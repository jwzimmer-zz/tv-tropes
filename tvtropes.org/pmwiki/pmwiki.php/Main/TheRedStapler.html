This can lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Defictionalization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Defictionalization">defictionalization</a>, where things only start being made due to demand for fictional things. It's not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement">Product Placement</a>, as it's usually unintentional; the fact that the product doesn't even exist might even owe itself to the use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrandX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrandX">Brand X</a> or similar tropes &mdash; <em>i.e.</em> the <em>avoidance</em> of product placement.
</p><p>Its effect is often exaggerated, though. The effects of this trope are often temporary; a <em>permanent</em> decline or increase in demand is usually an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends">Urban Legend</a>. It's also important to remember that correlation doesn't imply causation &mdash; although given the number of examples listed below, there must be a <em>lot</em> of interesting coincidences out there. Most of the time, the effect is positive, even when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity">the product is portrayed negatively</a>; advertisers call this the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">Homer Simpson</a> effect".

Swingline didn't make full-size red staplers; the one in the film was a black stapler painted red. Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeImitatesArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeImitatesArt">life would imitate art</a>, as people demanded a red version, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Defictionalization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Defictionalization">they got one</a>. Outside the U.S., <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveManyNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveManyNames">this trope has other names, too</a>. Cooking shows are particularly prone to this: the U.K. sometimes calls this the "Delia Effect", after high-profile <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CookingShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CookingShow">Cooking Show</a> host Delia Smith, to the point that her publishers will let the shops know in advance what she's about to recommend. Australia calls it the "Masterchef Effect" for similar reasons.
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Defictionalization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Defictionalization">Defictionalization</a> is when the demanded product comes into existence because of this trope, largely as tie-in merchandise to the show that spawned it.

If a name becomes popular because of a work, that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabyNameTrendStarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabyNameTrendStarter">Baby Name Trend Starter</a>.

<ul><li> In the 90's, Gap made a commercial for Khaki pants showing people dancing the lindy hop. The commercial did a better job of making people all over the USA start signing up for lindy hop lessons than making them buy the pants.
</li><li> A rather <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/mYy6UaDkVu4">sweet old advert<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for the Yellow Pages featured an old man looking for a book called "Fly Fishing" by J. R. Hartley. The ad proved so popular that the book was later <a class="urllink" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fly-Fishing-Memories-Angling-Days/dp/B000KP322S/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1417535491&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=fly+fishing+by+jr+hartley">written and published.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> A 2002 ad for BT communications featured a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks_h4X9DhYI">rather special telephone.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> The public went crazy for it.
</li><li> The grim nature of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em> was rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">offset</a> by some of the commercials that appeared during the breaks. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PD-_oLjmCGY">The Morning Rescue advert<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, in particular, caught the eyes of fansubbers, to the extent that one group began editing it into episodes where it had not originally appeared. Demand for the drink shot up due to curious Westerners who, having witnessed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a> in progress, wanted to try it for themselves; as a result, J-List began stocking Morning Rescue in their online store.
</li><li> Some Target advertisements had people wearing clothes with the Target logo on them; demand was such that Target wound up making them for real.
</li><li> Volkswagen had a print ad for the Polo which showed a car with every part a different color (red doors, yellow hood, blue roof, etc.). Enough people requested a car like that that VW made the Polo Harlekin.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJipJwDPJ-g">A commercial<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> from the Dutch insurance company OHRA (in which a mother and her daughter try to pick up their purple inflatable crocodile at the lost and found of a swimming pool, but are met with severe bureaucracy) led to a huge demand for purple inflatable crocodiles, which until then only came in the color green. It also led to the phrase "purple crocodile" becoming a metaphor for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">obstructive bureaucracy</a>.
</li><li> The US National Dairy Council once put out a series of advertisements showing cows sabotaging the marketing campaigns of a company called Big Fizz Soda, replacing their ads with ads for milk. Of course, nobody involved with the campaign thought to actually trademark the name Big Fizz Soda, so a soda company did so and promptly started selling their products under that name. Big Fizz Soda can still be found in drugstores and independent supermarkets.
</li><li> Commercials for Windex would sometimes feature angry crows who would use "smear sticks" to dirty windows again. Smear sticks aren't real (or aren't called that, in any case), but home goods stores will occasionally get people asking for them.
</li><li> Australian automotive accessories retailer Repco once had an ad that featured a motor enthusiast replacing his doorbell with one that made the sound of a revving engine (much to his girlfriend's disgust). They received so many inquiries about this, they started stocking a bell that made this noise.
</li><li> A 2014 ad for UK supermarket Asda featured three identical garden gnomes fishing in a pond, staring in shock when a gnome in a mankini floats past on a lilo. This was to make some kind of point about the conventional gnomes representing "ordinary" supermarkets or something, but due to demand, they started selling replicas of the gnome. Mankini-gnomes already existed (one appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GnomeoAndJuliet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GnomeoAndJuliet">Gnomeo and Juliet</a></em>), but not this particular model.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anime and Manga&nbsp;</div><div id="folder1" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheDropsOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheDropsOfGod">The Drops of God</a></em> is an incredibly powerful example of this trope. Thanks to the miracle of Internet wine ordering, thousands of Japanese people are treated to a charismatic character's opinion of a specific wine on his quest to find seven specific varieties, and can then go and order those very wines and taste them for themselves. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/sep/22/french-winemaker-vintage-manga-cartoon">This has caused quite a stir in the world's wine industries.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn">K-On!</a></em> did this with the characters' instruments, particularly Fender. For instance, Mio's Fender Jazz Bass is now popularly demanded in real life &mdash; even though the original is left-handed and the defictionalized ones are mostly stringed for right-handed use. The one main exception is Gibson guitars, mostly because they're hideously expensive (the Les Paul that Yui plays <em>starts</em> at around $2500 USD) and aren't available in Japan, although Les Paul <em>clones</em> are popping up marketed with the show's imagery.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar">Lucky Star</a></em>:
<ul><li> The town of Washimiya, Saitama, Japan experienced a massive surge in tourism thanks to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar">Lucky Star</a></em>, as the Hiiragi family shrine is based on the local Washinomiya shrine. It has since become a pilgrimage site for otaku of all ages, with many prayer plaques featuring weird prayers asking Konata to be their wife.
</li><li> The show also re-popularised anime merchandise and conventions. There has even been talk in the city council to make the local high school dress code match the one seen in the series. In turn, the girls became official honour residents of the city.
</li></ul></li><li> On August 1st, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">the day the original Digi Destined first went to the Digital World</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em> fans meet up in Dai-san Daiba park in Odaiba, where the Digi Destined met up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">on the third anniversary of their Digital World adventure</a>. Many western Digimon fans will make a point to visit Odaiba when visiting Japan as well.
</li><li> The Hikawa Shrine from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> also exists in real life (although real life has two Hikawa Shrines, and the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">anime</a> moved one to the location of the other). It's also a tourist spot for fans. Crown Game Center also <em>used</em> to exist but has since gone out of business and been replaced by a McDonalds.
</li><li> The classical-music industry in the Asia-Pacific region has reasons to thank <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NodameCantabile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NodameCantabile">Nodame Cantabile</a></em>.
</li><li> The eponymous character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon">Doraemon</a></em> has a particular fondness for dorayaki, and when the show became a success, dorayaki also became extremely popular in Japanese bakeries and confection shops.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em> apparently did this to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-07-11/gintama-cited-for-g8-visitors-buying-wooden-swords">wooden swords<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. it also helps that they were already ubiquitous in tourist shops and can't really be used as weapons (which means you can take them through customs more easily).
</li><li> Enoshima, an island off the coast of Kamakura, is a favorite destination among <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku">otakus</a>, since it is featured prominently in several popular shows such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SweetBlueFlowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SweetBlueFlowers">Sweet Blue Flowers</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UtaKata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UtaKata">Uta Kata</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InitialD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InitialD">Initial D</a></em>:
<ul><li> This manga popularized the Toyota AE86 Sprinter Trueno/Corolla GT-S by virtue of its protagonist beating seemingly much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolCar">cooler cars</a> with one on a regular basis, simply with raw driving skill. It didn't help that the manga contributed to the car's high resale value, which made obtaining an 86 in good working order a challenge, let alone in mint condition.
</li><li> The real life touge courses in the anime have become immortalized in real life as well. Mount Haruna (which is what Mount Akina is based on) often gets many visitors in the Gunma area, and the real tofu shop also gained popularity before it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">torn down</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WishUponThePleiades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WishUponThePleiades">Wish Upon the Pleiades</a></em> is a lesser example, with Subaru cars.

</li><li> Similarly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeidiGirlOfTheAlps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeidiGirlOfTheAlps">Heidi, Girl of the Alps</a></em> has drawn thousands of Japanese pilgrims to the Swiss Alps.

Former Princess Sayaka of Japan liked it so much that she had a real-world one made for her wedding dress.
</li><li> Sports manga and anime, if they're successful, can create interest in that sport and cause many fans to take it up themselves &mdash; not just in Japan, but around the world. Among those manga and anime:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaptainTsubasa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaptainTsubasa">Captain Tsubasa</a></em> tremendously helped the development of soccer as a whole in Japan, spurring the creation of the national pro league JFA and thrust the sport from obscurity to the second-most played sport in the country. Many Japanese and non-Japanese players credit it for their inspiration to play soccer.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackNumberOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackNumberOne">Attack No. 1</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AttackerYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AttackerYou">Attacker You!</a></em> did this for volleyball.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HikaruNoGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HikaruNoGo">Hikaru no Go</a></em> wound up <em>tripling</em> the number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Go" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Go">Go</a> players in the world.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Chihayafuru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Chihayafuru">Chihayafuru</a></em> did this for Karuta.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SummerWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SummerWars">Summer Wars</a></em> did this for Hanafuda.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Saki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Saki">Saki</a></em> did this for Reach Mahjong (Japanese Mahjong).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SlamDunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SlamDunk">Slam Dunk</a></em> was a smash hit in not just Japan, but also the Philippines and Korea. The manga was even credited by the Japanese Basketball Association for popularizing the sport in Asia, especially since a lot of the players in the Japanese league grew up reading it.
</li><li> While not as popular as the above examples, the writer of <em>Rin!</em> said that she received a lot of mail from fans saying they had taken up archery after reading the series.
</li></ul></li><li> The town of Takehara's popularity has risen quite a bit since it has been featured in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Tamayura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Tamayura">Tamayura</a></em>, and the town's inhabitants appear to be very proud of that fact. Restaurants and shops advertise with posters from the show (especially the ones actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealPlaceBackground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealPlaceBackground">used as scenery</a>), and one of the local ferries even sports huge posters of the show's main heroines. The announced TV series might raise the town's popularity to even greater heights.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny">Tiger &amp; Bunny</a></em>'s entirely unexpected popularity in Japan has led to the spike in sales for items only tangentially related to the show. The most notable was a brand of cologne that resembled a bottle the main character, Kotetsu, owned. <a class="urllink" href="http://i.imgur.com/VDs9V.jpg">It was apparently of utmost importance to 2ch and /a/ to know what he smelled like.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> Sunrise noticed and decided that they'd start selling Kotetsu's oft-replicated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat">Nice Hat</a>.
</li><li> The city of Kamogawa hopes their tourism gets a boost with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensInCardiff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensInCardiff">being the main city</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RinneNoLagrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RinneNoLagrange">Rinne no Lagrange</a></em>.
</li><li> The town of Oorai enjoys this due to the success of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer">Girls und Panzer</a></em>. The real life annual Anglerfish festival saw a huge spike in attendees the year after the anime debuted. The massive increase in tourism helped rescue the town's finances in the wake of the 2011 tsunami.
</li><li> As part of their 30th Anniversary for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a> franchise, Sunrise commissioned a project to build an actual 1:1 scale 60ft tall statue of the show's flagship machine, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">RX-78-2 Gundam</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">Downplayed</a> in that unlike its fictional counterpart, the statue can't move due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareCubeLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareCubeLaw">Square-Cube Law</a> making it infeasible and maybe impossible, but Sunrise has stated they would like to eventually "upgrade" the statue to be moving.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGate">Steins;Gate</a></em> features the soft drink of Dr. Pepper prominently, although it calls it Dk. Pepper instead, probably because of lack of sponsorship agreement. Nevertheless, this anime series boosted up the sales of Dr. Pepper considerably in Japan.
<ul><li> The makers of Dr. Pepper itself have noticed this, and later launched an <a class="urllink" href="https://www.famitsu.com/news/201804/25156370.html">official collaboration<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> with the sequel series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGateZero">Steins;Gate 0</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Lots of anime fans start learning the Japanese language, to the point where anime and manga fans make up some 60 percent of Japanese language classes. This actually causes an issue in that especially older anime and manga, even if they seem mature of American audiences, were made for a younger demographic in Japan. As a result, many fans who use anime as a basis for learning Japanese can come off sounding extremely odd to native Japanese speakers, since they will sound like they are imitating Japanese teenagers or grade-schoolers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KidsOnTheSlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KidsOnTheSlope">Kids on the Slope</a></em> has caused many people to get into jazz, particularly the '50s and '60s styles featured in the show.

However, the series has successfully boosted tourism sales in Saga, particularly for Drive-in Tori, which is a real restaurant that the characters help advertise for in the series. Since the Saga prefecture government <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackedByThePentagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackedByThePentagon">was part of the production committee</a>, this may actually have been invoked.

<ul><li> <em>Eupho</em>'s anime adaptation also inspired a minor surge of tourism to its setting of Uji in the Kyoto region, and in particular to Daikichiyama, a small mountain overlooking the city, which is visited in key scenes.

It was known for being among the last few German beer brands sold in swing-top bottles. Then, when the comic popularized the brand, it got so popular in Germany that the brewery had trouble keeping up with demand. Then Werner made his own beer in the sixth book, which would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Defictionalization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Defictionalization">Defictionalized</a> (and stopped the free advertising for Flensburger).

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> Wiki calls it the Bludgeon Effect: the franchise has many more toys created than there are characters in the TV show, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> has a <em>huge</em> source of characters that you've never heard of and haven't even got a personality. The name refers to Bludgeon, a relatively minor character who became Decepticon leader late in the Marvel Comics run and stayed a prominent character in subsequent series - much more so than his unpopular toy line would have indicated. This most commonly happens to characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersIDW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersIDW">the IDW comics</a> use to good effect; their toys' value online will skyrocket.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory">Toy Story</a></em> movies created a huge demand for many of the toys it featured.
<ul><li> It raised demand for simple plastic green army men so much that several companies started cashing in on it with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmyMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmyMen">video games</a> and such.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Barbie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Barbie">Barbie</a> dolls also got a boost from the second film, although Mattel's paranoia almost prevented this from happening. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar">Pixar</a> had wanted to use Barbie in the first movie, but Mattel said no, objecting to her being used as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Terminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Terminator">Sarah Connor</a>-esque badass. Then Mattel saw how the toys the movie <em>did</em> feature got a sales boost (particularly Mr. Potato Head), and they were only too happy to see Barbie used in the second and third movies (with something of a compromise in personality).
</li><li> The Slinky company had previously taken the Slinky Dog off the market years before <em>Toy Story</em>. They brought it back because of the movie, albeit modified to account for the character and due to stricter safety regulations.
</li><li> Demand for a movie-accurate Gabby Gabby doll led to some enthusiasts either making outfits for existing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGirlsCollection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGirlsCollection">American Girl</a> or <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/ChattyCathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/ChattyCathy">Chatty Cathy</a> dolls based on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory4">Toy Story 4</a></em> character, who has strangely not received a toy apart from smaller-scale action figures and plushies, or customising said AG/Chatty dolls to better resemble Gabby. There did eventually exist a full-sized Gabby Gabby doll, actual clothes, hair and all, but it is currently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">exclusive to Brazil</a>, having being made by a local toy manufacturer under licence. As to whether Thinkway Toys or some other firm whom Disney has a contract with would do a similar doll is anyone's guess.
</li><li> As for Gabby's "very best friend" Benson, good luck trying to have one sculpted by a puppetmaker though&mdash;a full-scale dummy can go for around several thousand dollars depending on how advanced the controls are. That isn't to say that a full-size Benson figure is out of the question though, as similar dummies can be had for under a hundred dollars, albeit as an entry-level dummy rather than a bespoke, professional-grade figure.

<ul><li> Aurora as a baby name took a while to catch on, but it suddenly became much more popular in the 2000s notably around the time the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyPrincess">Disney Princess</a> line was established (as the movie didn't really develop its popularity until the 2000s).

<ul><li> The series was largely responsible for a colossal increase in the interest and popularity of dinosaurs. It led to the creation of books, toys, documentaries, clothing, an NBA team name, you name it&mdash; it showed the world that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithDinosaurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithDinosaurs">Everything's Better with Dinosaurs</a>. It gets a boost every time a sequel comes out as well, as shown with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorld">Jurassic World</a></em>.
</li><li> The movie's popularity quadrupled the international price of amber. It also popularized fake amber with insects in it, which usually comes from China, is sold on auction sites, and outrages precious stone sellers everywhere.
</li></ul></li><li> Sales of the Dodge Ram pickup nearly doubled in 1996 thanks to a red model being featured as the hero vehicle in the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Twister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Twister">Twister</a></em>. While Chrysler sold 280,000 Rams in 1995, sales skyrocketed in 1996 to nearly 400,000 units and stayed at that level through 1999. Even after that, though, the Ram remained popular enough for Chrysler to spin it off from Dodge into its own make.
</li><li> Sometimes guns are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolGuns">popularized</a> because of their use in fiction.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyHarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyHarry">Dirty Harry</a></em> caused sales of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon">Smith &amp; Wesson's Model 29</a>, the famous .44 Magnum that Harry Callahan used in the movie, to skyrocket. The ensuing popularity drove prices into orbit, where they would stay &mdash; it became nigh impossible for real gun enthusiasts to get their hands on one. It's also a very heavy gun and probably not the best choice for a casual enthusiast anyway.
</li><li> The HK USP Match, Lara's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">weapons</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfChoice">of choice</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LaraCroftTombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LaraCroftTombRaider">Lara Croft: Tomb Raider</a></em>, became a very popular pistol for a time, so much so that even airsoft copies were selling for upwards of a thousand dollars - for context, for that much you could get a <em>real</em> USP.
</li><li> The Beretta 92F, hot off the heels of being adopted by the US military, got a boost in the late 1980s thanks to its prominent use by the leads of films such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard">Die Hard</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LethalWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LethalWeapon">Lethal Weapon</a></em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathWish3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathWish3">Death Wish 3</a></em>, Charles Bronson's character used the Wildey Magnum, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon">a semi-automatic pistol that fires rounds so powerful it rivals the Desert Eagle in muzzle energy</a>. The company that makes the firearm was struggling at the time, and was close to bankruptcy. The movie single-handedly increased the sales of the Wildey Magnum and rescued the company. It also counts as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityEndorsement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityEndorsement">Celebrity Endorsement</a>, as it was Charles Bronson's personal pistol.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon">Desert Eagle</a> was a semi-automatic pistol built by 3 guys who thought it would be cool to fire .357 and .44 Magnum-caliber rounds in a semi-auto. It started becoming the go-to weapon for fictional badasses in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>, most notably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArnoldSchwarzenegger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArnoldSchwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>, starting with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Commando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Commando">Commando</a></em>. Today, the gun is hugely popular, which leads to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">Hype Backlash</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPopularNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPopularNowItSucks">angry gun enthusiasts</a>.
</li><li> The Barrett series of sniper rifles was originally created by a single guy as a dare to create a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">.50 BMG rifle</a>. The Model 82 went on to be another badass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfChoice">Weapon of Choice</a>, it became as popular as the Desert Eagle, and it also went into service with multiple militaries as an anti-materiel rifle.
</li><li> The SPAS-12 is an awesome-looking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunsAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunsAreJustBetter">shotgun</a> capable of firing both semi-automatically and in pump-action. People who see those in fiction are often disappointed to find out that they were banned from import into the U.S. from 1994 to 2004 (meaning only those imported before 1994 made it onto the market, since production ended before the ban lifted) and production ceased in 2000, making them fairly rare. Their spotty reputation as far as reliability goes and excessive weight don't help much either. Nevertheless, the cool look and its capabilities as both a pump-action or semi-auto shotgun mean it still shows up in several films and video games.
</li><li> Despite being an outdated 80 year old design chambered for the rather anemic .32 ACP round, the Walther PPK (or more specifically, its import-legal variant, the .380 PPK/S) still enjoys impressive sales numbers thanks to its association with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">an iconic British spy</a>. Walther's more recent P99 line also saw an uptick in sales after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PierceBrosnan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PierceBrosnan">Pierce Brosnan</a> took over the role and Walther asked for Bond to carry what was their then-newest weapon.

Specifically, he notes that the Steyr AUG assault rifle is a good weapon, but there's no demand for it because it's never been in a movie<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0utez');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0utez" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0utez');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Although he'd be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard">wrong about that</a></span>, while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKiller">The Killer</a></em> caused a spike in demand for .45 pistols (which he considers substandard compared to the 9mm). Proving his point, he then proceeds to take a phone call from a customer who wants a specific make and model of the 9mm, because it's the kind that the protagonist on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewYorkUndercover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewYorkUndercover">New York Undercover</a></em> uses.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KickAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KickAss">Kick-Ass</a></em>: Because of the popularity of Hit-Girl and her mention of the Benchmade 42 balisong/butterfly knife, combined with the fact that Benchmade had stopped producing the model a few years prior, and the fact it was already a somewhat sought-after knife in collecting communities, the demand far exceeded the supply. Prices for the knife used were nearly triple what they had been months prior for a like-new knife. Benchmade would retool and produce a very small number of new limited edition BM42 knives, which sold for over $1000 each. To this day, even used Benchmade 42 butterfly knives still command much higher prices than they did before the movie.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SmokeyAndTheBandit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SmokeyAndTheBandit">Smokey and the Bandit</a></em>, along with the trucking song (later also a movie) "Convoy", caused such a spike in the popularity of CB radios that many of the restrictions on their use in the US were lifted in order to take advantage of this boom. The result was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewbieBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewbieBoom">Newbie Boom</a> that lasted until the Internet and cell phones became popular. Sales of the Pontiac Firebird Trans Am also saw an upswing, with a CB becoming a dealership option in some places. The CB radio craze brought about by the two also resulted in the "mainstreaming" of much CB radio jargon. "What's your twenty?", "Ten-four good buddy", and "Put the pedal to the metal" all entered the popular lexicon as a result of this movie.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sideways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sideways">Sideways</a></em> led to increased American sales of Pinot Noir, the wine favored by the main character. At the same time, Merlot sales declined in the US because he doesn't drink it, and says so in one scene. Ironically, this actually caused the average quality of both wines in the American market to switch places. Merlot had previously been overproduced to the point that it was regarded as rather d&eacute;class&eacute; by wine aficionados, hence Miles' dislike for it. In response to the change in demand, the market was flooded with mediocre Pinots, while the average quality of Merlots increased as fewer were produced.
</li><li> In the special edition commentary of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NapoleonDynamite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NapoleonDynamite">Napoleon Dynamite</a></em>, it was mentioned that the blue unicorn t-shirt Napoleon wears in the movie had been discontinued when the film came out, but thanks to the popularity of the film, the shirt was reproduced.

<ul><li> The movie featured self lacing sneakers, which <a class="urllink" href="http://www.themarysue.com/back-to-the-future-shoes/">Nike now has in production for 2015<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.themarysue.com/nike-mag-commercial/">to benefit Michael J. Fox's charity.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> They do not, however, actually self-lace. Though a hobbyist has worked out such a device, it's too big and strong for actual use (it would fill the shoe entirely, and possibly break your foot). Nike also produced a very limited run of Hyperdunk sneakers in 2008 inspired by the sneakers in the movie (again, non-self-lacing).
</li><li> There was <a class="urllink" href="http://www.snopes.com/movies/films/hoverboard.asp">a rumor<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that the Hoverboards from <em>Part II</em> were actually real, but had been banned due to inherent risk of lawsuits over injuries. According to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebSite/Snopes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebSite/Snopes">Snopes</a></em>, both Mattel (whose logo is prominent on the Barbie-pink hoverboard Marty McFly used) and the studio received a bunch of letters inquiring where you could get one of those wonderful toys. This was not helped when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertZemeckis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertZemeckis">Robert Zemeckis</a>, the film's director, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator">gave an interview where he jokingly said they were real</a>. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-hoverboard-lie-how-back-to-the-future-ruined-childhood/">This article<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> suggests that Zemeckis owes an apology (or preferably a real hoverboard) to all the children who saw the film for the trauma brought on by the realization that they could not, in fact, buy a hoverboard.
</li><li> There were also inquiries as to whether the coaster-sized dehydrated pizzas were real.
</li><li> A realistic example is the DeLorean DMC-12, a car that had been produced for less than two years and had a reputation for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar">extreme unreliability</a> (hence Marty's surprised comment that Doc Brown had, out of all automobiles, made a time machine out of a DeLorean). It was discontinued before the first film was ever made, but the movie caused second hand prices to skyrocket. Eventually, the car was brought back into low-level production, arguably because of the movie alone.
<ul><li> There's also a thriving sub-community of enthusiasts who have converted their DeLoreans into replicas of the one from the film. Or, if you'd rather pay to have someone else do it, you can have a professional who worked on restoring the original car from the film convert your DeLorean for only $50,000.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws">Jaws</a></em> codified the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreateningShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreateningShark">Threatening Shark</a> trope, and people took that to heart in real life. Beach attendance and other oceanic activities took a big hit. There were serious stories of people being afraid to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">take a bath</a> after seeing <em>Jaws</em>. It also caused a spike in shark hunting, as people would attack even harmless sharks, to the point of endangering them (especially the Great White). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterBenchley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterBenchley">Peter Benchley</a>, author of the novel <em>Jaws</em>, was so troubled by this that he devoted much of his later life to shark conservation. A popular Asian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends">Urban Legend</a> also claims that <em>Jaws</em> increased the demand for shark fin soup.

Making this stranger is that the writer claims that he was basing it on the Cabbage Patch Kids line. Given that the doll seen in the movie bears virtually no resemblance to a Cabbage Patch Kid, and a strong resemblance to a My Buddy doll, and even has a name more similar to My Buddy than Cabbage Patch Kids &mdash; namely "Good Guy" &mdash; it's understandable where the "confusion" could occur.

</li><li> Sales of Vans shoes increased following the release of 1982's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FastTimesAtRidgemontHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FastTimesAtRidgemontHigh">Fast Times at Ridgemont High</a></em>, where Jeff Spicoli (Sean Penn) wore his Vans black-and-white checkerboard slip-on shoes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThisIsSpinalTap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThisIsSpinalTap">This is Sp&#305;n&#776;al Tap</a></em>, the band uses a custom-made amplifier which has its maximum volume setting at 11 instead of 10. Several companies now make amps with that same setting, the BBC iPlayer volume scale goes from 1-11, and even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDb">IMDb</a> rating system for the film goes up to 11 rather than 10. And also, it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">named a trope</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix">The Matrix</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first film's release coincided with a spike in sales of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat">long black leather coats</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShades">Cool Shades</a> like the characters wore. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWoo">John Woo</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ABetterTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ABetterTomorrow">A Better Tomorrow</a></em> came out around the same time and did the same in Hong Kong, leading to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> in the sequel where Ken tells the neighborhood kids how dumb their taste in fashion is.
</li><li> Before <em>The Matrix</em> came out, there were no phones anywhere that slid open like the modified Nokia 8110 seen in the movie. The original wasn't spring-loaded; you had to slide it open and closed manually. After the movie opened, people wanted the spring-loaded, flick-open version, and cell phone companies had to design one to meet the demand that suddenly appeared. One such model was the Nokia 7110, which some mistook for the modified 8110 as mentioned above.
</li><li> New Rock boots were popularised by <em>The Matrix</em>. Goths during the early noughties were the most frequent wearers.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGun">Top Gun</a></em>. After the film's release, sales of Ray-Ban Aviators and bomber jackets skyrocketed. It also increased the number of people enlisting the Navy and Air Force, but that at least was intentional: why do you think the film was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackedByThePentagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackedByThePentagon">Backed by the Pentagon</a>?
</li><li> In fact, specific brands of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShades">Cool Shades</a> often get a boost from badasses wearing them. In addition to <em>The Matrix</em> and <em>Top Gun</em>:

</li><li> Ray-Ban Wayfarers were popular going back to the 1950s, when Audrey Hepburn wore them in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BreakfastAtTiffanys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BreakfastAtTiffanys">Breakfast at Tiffany's</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomCruise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomCruise">Tom Cruise</a> made them popular even before <em>Top Gun</em> when he wore them in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RiskyBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RiskyBusiness">Risky Business</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WillSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WillSmith">Will Smith</a> helped sales of Ray-Ban RB 2030 Predator 8 Wrap shades after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MenInBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MenInBlack">Men in Black</a></em>. Ray-Ban tried to do it again with the anachronistic shades worn by Smith in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WildWildWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WildWildWest">Wild Wild West</a></em>, but it didn't work nearly as well.
</li></ul></li><li> Sales of tickets on Seabourne cruises oddly spiked after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Speed2CruiseControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Speed2CruiseControl">Speed 2: Cruise Control</a></em>. Before the movie came out, Seabourne was asked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatWereYouThinking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatWereYouThinking">what they were thinking</a>, allowing a movie about people not having much fun on a cruise take place on their company's ship. Seabourne representatives just said it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity">free publicity</a>. They were right. A similar effect, on a grander scale, occurred with the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997">Titanic</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Contact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Contact">Contact</a></em> apparently created quite a bit of publicity for the SETI program. Even ten years later, it's usually how people know of it. This was probably intentional, given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Contact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Contact">the book</a>'s author <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlSagan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlSagan">Carl Sagan</a>'s support for the program.
</li><li> Movies about dancing will often result in a spike in people enrolling in dance classes:
<ul><li> The Japanese movie <em>Shall We Dance?</em> greatly increased both the popularity and respectability of ballroom dancing in Japan. As the movie shows, it was a furtive practice prior to the movie, as it was regarded as disreputable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyDancing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyDancing">Dirty Dancing</a></em> produced a similar effect in the West when it was first released. Masses of teen-age girls in Germany rushed into dance schools hoping to learn to dance like Baby Houseman or (especially) have a second Johnny Castle as their instructor. Guys mostly took dancing lessons because there were loads of girls, and a few hoped to one day be able to get chicks because they can dance like Johnny Castle.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DancingWithTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DancingWithTheStars">Dancing with the Stars</a></em> has resulted in increased demand for ballroom dance classes in the US as well. Here's an <a class="urllink" href="http://www.pioneerlocal.com/lagrange/news/1896411,la-grange-towncolumn-112609-s1.article">article with an example<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. The Japanese TV version was titled <em>Shall We Dance?</em> in homage to the movie, and Richard Gere starred in an American version of the same film. Ballroom dancing owes a <em>huge</em> debt to that quirky Japanese comedy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StrictlyBallroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StrictlyBallroom">Strictly Ballroom</a></em> had a similar effect in Australia.
</li></ul></li><li> In-universe example: In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightAtTheMuseum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightAtTheMuseum">Night at the Museum</a></em>, a few chaotic events one night at the American Museum of Natural History caused a small media frenzy, which resulted in a drastic increase of attendance at the museum. The film itself also renewed interest in visiting the museum. Which in turn led to the sequel <em>Battle of the Smithsonian</em>, where the museum directors couldn't sign on fast enough, in hopes that they could make lightning strike twice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AClockworkOrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AClockworkOrange">A Clockwork Orange</a></em> caused sales to go up for "Ludwig van"'s Ninth Symphony recordings.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> films caused all sorts of demand for the toys and gadgets the suave spy has used over the years:
<ul><li> Bond has used all sorts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolCar">Cool Cars</a> over the years; after being featured in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSpyWhoLovedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSpyWhoLovedMe">The Spy Who Loved Me</a></em>, demand for white Lotus Esprits grew so much that customers were put on a three-year waiting list. In later films, car companies would maneuver to try and deliberately place their own products in the films (the most successful example being the BMW Bond drove in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PierceBrosnan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PierceBrosnan">Pierce Brosnan</a> era). But the coolest of all time is the Aston Martin DB5 from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goldfinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goldfinger">Goldfinger</a></em>; everybody dreamed of owning one since that movie. But these people, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear">Top Gear</a></em>'s James May, were astonished to find out that the car had quite a spotty reputation in Britain, leading to low demand and massive depreciation. Then the <em>Top Gear</em> segment became popular and gave the DB5 another boost.
</li><li> In supplemental material for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thunderball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thunderball">Thunderball</a></em> it is revealed that the military, upon seeing the film, were interested in acquiring the pen-sized device Bond uses to breathe underwater. Unfortunately, the device doesn't actually exist. Production designer Peter Lamont politely informed them that the effect was created in the editing room and that Connery surfaced between takes.
</li><li> Omega, like many other Swiss watchmakers, saw their sales decline in the 1970's due to the "Quartz Revolution". Then in 1995, they partnered with the production team of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoldenEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoldenEye">GoldenEye</a></em>, and the Seamaster model featured in the film became one of the most ubiquitous luxury divers in the world over the next few years. The success of that model led to them being able to fund several innovations, such as the Co-Axial escapement. Over the next twenty years, they would come to be one of the most recognizable Swiss watch brands in the world, arguably second only to Rolex (which Bond also popularized back in the 1960s).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skyfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skyfall">Skyfall</a></em> caused <a class="urllink" href="http://www.digitalspy.com/fun/james-bond-007/news/a434612/skyfall-shave-scene-increases-cut-throat-razor-sales-by-405/">a spike<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in the sales of old-fashioned straight razors (also known as cut-throat razors) due to the scene where Moneypenny seductively uses one to give James Bond a close shave.
</li><li> The Mexican Day of the Dead celebration doesn't traditionally involve a giant parade, like the one Bond encounters at the start of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre">Spectre</a></em>. But then in 2016, the year after the film came out, the Mexico Tourism Board decided that there was enough demand for such a parade, both from people abroad <em>and</em> in Mexico itself, that they <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-37813562">organized one in Mexico City<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> as a means of attracting tourists to the city.
</li><li> Solitaire's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TarotMotifs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TarotMotifs">tarot deck</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LiveAndLetDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LiveAndLetDie">Live and Let Die</a></em> was eventually produced as a full deck, originally sold under the name "007 Deck" and later renamed "Tarot of the Witches". Its reception by actual tarot readers is mixed.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ZackAndMiriMakeAPorno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ZackAndMiriMakeAPorno">Zack and Miri Make a Porno</a></em> created a demand for real hockey jerseys for the fictional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DawnOfTheDead1978" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DawnOfTheDead1978">Monroeville Zombies</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VForVendetta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VForVendetta">V for Vendetta</a></em> caused a huge spike in sales of Guy Fawkes masks at costume stores. The mask's increased popularity probably contributed to its adoption by the nebulous group/movement known as Anonymous and has since become a populist symbol and staple at protests across the globe. This is ironic for two reasons: first, the original Guy Fawkes was an ardent monarchist who wanted to get rid of the protestant King James and restore catholic supremacy in England; and second, people who use these masks to protest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil">the tyranny of the rich</a> cause Warner Bros. to get a small royalty with every mask they buy.
<ul><li> Another reason the V masks have taken off is that, while Guy Fawkes masks have been worn for centuries, they were typically home made and no one really standardized a design and thought to mass produce them until V for Vendetta came around.
</li></ul></li><li> The famous Red Ryder BB gun from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AChristmasStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AChristmasStory">A Christmas Story</a></em> had it happen to it twice. The Red Ryder BB gun was named for a comic strip cowboy character from the 1940s and 1950s, and even after the comic was cancelled in 1963, it was already the most famous BB gun in American history, even outstripping the fame of the comic that inspired it. Then <em>A Christmas Story</em> caused a surge for the specific model of BB gun it described, which ironically did not exist in real life, even as a prototype, until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Defictionalization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Defictionalization">after the movie</a> (the gun with the sundial and compass in the stock at the time was the Buck Jones Daisy BB gun).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShirleyTemple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShirleyTemple">Shirley Temple</a> set several trends for girls.
<ul><li> The curls<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1x1mh');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1x1mh" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1x1mh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which, mind you, is no easy hairdo to style; Shirley herself attested that it was literally a pain to set as the vinegar rinse used splashed and irritated her eyes.</span> obviously were a fad.
</li><li> She wore a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyInMink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyInMink">white rabbit coat</a> in one film and the popularity of such coats exploded for upper class girls.
</li><li> There has been a surge of girls being named after the actress during the peak of her career. By 1935, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.behindthename.com/name/shirley/top/united-states">over 40 thousand babies<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> were named Shirley by mothers either in honour of Temple or in hopes that their daughter would be just as much of a box office superstar as their namesake.
</li></ul></li><li> According to the movie's trivia section over at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDb">IMDb</a>, the use of caller ID increased more than threefold after the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream1996" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream1996">Scream</a></em>. The movie also increased demand for Ghostface masks/costumes, which existed before (and which is actually a minor plot point in the first film).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WallStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WallStreet">Wall Street</a></em>:
<ul><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelDouglas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelDouglas">Michael Douglas</a> used a (now comically large) mobile phone in the 1987 film, it established the mobile phone as an essential business accessory, leading to the modern popularity of mobile phones. Nice Guy Eddie's enormous car phone in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReservoirDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReservoirDogs">Reservoir Dogs</a></em> (1992) may have helped too.
</li><li> It increased the sales of a certain type of horizontally striped shirt. They were sometimes called "Gekko shirts" after the film's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> (although their popularity may have been prompted by the common <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation">Alternative Character Interpretation</a>).
</li><li> According to the DVD commentary, people have come up to Douglas for years and said that his performance inspired them to become stockbrokers. Douglas has had to remind them that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom">Gekko is the villain</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The 1977 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SaturdayNightFever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SaturdayNightFever">Saturday Night Fever</a></em> created a nationwide craze for disco music and disco dancing (together with discotheques). Before it came out, disco was mostly confined to the New York and Philadelphia urban and gay communities.
</li><li> After the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheItalianJob2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheItalianJob2003">The Italian Job (2003)</a></em>, sales of Mini Coopers, featured heavily in the movie, increased by 22%.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PulpFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PulpFiction">Pulp Fiction</a></em>:
<ul><li> The film caused great demand for John Travolta's UC Santa Cruz Banana Slugs T-shirt.
</li><li> Brown leather wallets with the words "Bad Mother Fucker" stitched on them <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bmfwallets.com/">are also available.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> If you were in college in 1994 and smoked cigarettes, you had at least, by Christmas break, learned to roll them yourself, if indeed you hadn't switched to rolled cigarettes completely.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Juno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Juno">Juno</a></em> caused what was, by all accounts, a <em>staggering</em> demand for hamburger-shaped phones, despite the main character's brief negative comment that it is awkward to talk into. According to a <em>New York Post</em> article just after the film's release, the burgerphone had a huge rise of 759% in a month.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat">Nice Hat</a> worn by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones">Indiana Jones</a> has been pretty much consistently popular since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaidersOfTheLostArk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaidersOfTheLostArk">the first movie</a> was released and is still being sold in costume shops as well as hat stores. It is a high-crowned <a class="urllink" href="http://www.indygear.com/igfedora.html">Herbert Johnson fedora<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, if you're interested.
</li><li> The Talkboy was originally a non-working prop for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HomeAlone2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HomeAlone2">Home Alone 2</a></em>. In 1993 it was <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVKur7lSyOU">made into a retail version,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> brought on by a massive letter-writing campaign by fans of the film.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBirthOfANation1915" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBirthOfANation1915">The Birth of a Nation</a></em> single-handedly revived the Ku Klux Klan after decades of dormancy. The movie was based on a book called <em>The Clansman,</em> which contained the first example of a man burning a cross. Two weeks after <em>The Birth of a Nation</em> premiered, someone burned a cross atop Stone Mountain, and an old tradition was invented.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLifeAquaticWithSteveZissou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLifeAquaticWithSteveZissou">The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</a></em>: The Adidas Rom track shoes made specifically for Team Zissou produced a demand for them in the real world. Although they were never made by Adidas, blogs popped up with directions on how to retrofit a pair and people also started selling them on eBay. Red beanies also became quite popular after the movie was released, with companies selling Ned's traffic light adorned cap.
<ul><li> Actually because of the demand Adidas eventually did produce an official version in VERY limited quantities. They were released at the We Love Green festival in France in 2017, where Seu Jorge was performing. They were limited and numbered, and sold out very quickly.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HolidayInn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HolidayInn">Holiday Inn</a></em> was the inspiration for the name of the popular real life hotel chain.
</li><li> The success of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JJAbrams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JJAbrams">J. J. Abrams</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009">Star Trek (2009)</a></em> reboot somewhat increased the value of various Trek <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMerch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMerch">merch</a> and memorabilia. Interestingly, various car brands saw a brief spike in the sale of white-colored cars around that time.
</li><li> The gauge piercing became more popular after the Na'vi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar">Avatar</a></em> sported them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers">Transformers</a></em>, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">Merchandise-Driven</a>, certainly tried to do it:
<ul><li> The films revitalized the Camaro line via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement">Product Placement</a>, but yellow Camaros skyrocketed in popularity, with it becoming incredibly common to see the twin stripes centred on them, even though it's used on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidAppealCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidAppealCharacter">Kid-Appeal Character</a>. In fact it completely revitalised the popularity of the colour yellow for cars, especially sports cars.

So the Thai government renamed a stretch of the Mae Klong river into the "Big Khwae", near its confluence with the original Khwae. The location used in the film is not in Thailand at all, but Sri Lanka.
</li><li> Since the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CastAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CastAway">Cast Away</a></em> in 2000, Wilson Sporting Goods now makes and sells special Cast Away edition Wilson volleyballs, with the smiling handprint-shaped red face printed on them, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wilson.com/en-us/volleyball/balls/outdoor-volleyball/cast-away-volleyball/">still on sale as a regular item to this very day.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>

In particular, it helped boost sales of Kahl&uacute;a, a Mexican coffee liqueur that's popularly used to supply the drink's coffee flavor.

</li></ul></li><li> The 1960 teen comedy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhereTheBoysAre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhereTheBoysAre">Where the Boys Are</a></em>, about a group of college girls who head down to Fort Lauderdale, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Florida" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Florida">Florida</a> for spring break, is frequently credited with both popularizing the spring break tradition in the United States, with the emergence of Fort Lauderdale as America's number one spring break destination, and with helping the Miami area rapidly grow in size. The latter lasted until 1985, when a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyFratboyHijinx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyFratboyHijinx">particularly out-of-control</a> spring break sparked <a class="urllink" href="http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4335&amp;context=etd">a massive backlash<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> from locals and the mayor that saw the event driven out of the city.
</li><li> The 2011 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Limitless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Limitless">Limitless</a></em> and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Limitless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Limitless">2015 TV adaptation</a> have undoubtedly spurred interest in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSerum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSerum">nootropic drugs</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperIntelligence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperIntelligence">cognitive enhancement</a>, inspiring a transhumanist "biohacking" movement to maximize individual potential through drugs and better habits. Although there is no direct real-world analogue to NZT-48, nor is there likely ever to be, stimulants like Modafinil and Adderall have proven especially popular among Type-A college students and Silicon Valley entrepeneurs. Demand for true nootropics has trickled down to even the pharmaceutical industry itself now.
</li><li> The Graflex 3-cell Flashgun handle, a common accessory for 1940's cameras, is notoriously difficult to come across now despite their antique status (they can be found on Ebay for almost $800). The handle's rarity and high demand nowadays comes as result of being used as the original prop for Anakin and Luke's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserBlade">lightsaber</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>. No wonder vintage photography collectors are frustrated.
</li><li> After the success of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlairWitchProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlairWitchProject">The Blair Witch Project</a></em>, tourism to the quiet little town of Burkittsville, MD skyrocketed. Since many, if not most, of the town's new visitors were loud, obnoxious young people (some of whom committed outright acts of vandalism, thievery and the like), the residents of Burkittsville were understandably upset.
</li><li> This trope also has its dark side: An increase in prostitution was reported after the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrettyWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrettyWoman">Pretty Woman</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BabyDriver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BabyDriver">Baby Driver</a></em> seems to have sparked a renewed interest in iPod classics, with sales going up by 929% on eBay.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBeach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBeach">The Beach</a></em> resulted in its filming location, Maya Beach to be closed for a few months at a time and then <a class="urllink" href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/maya-bay-closure-thailand/index.html">indefinitely<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> due to damage caused by filming and tourists.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Parasite2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Parasite2019">Parasite</a></em> led many people to seek the recipe for the Korean noodle dish jjapaguri (or "Ram-don", in the English subs), with added steak to resemble the one in the movie.

And a generation later, there was a backlash against that kind of outfit for boys by fathers who remembered how much they'd hated them as youngsters.
</li><li> Kate Greenaway's illustrations revolutionized Victorian fashions by creating a huge demand for the simpler, more relaxed outfits she'd designed for her adult and child figures.
</li><li> In 1933, James Hilton wrote a book called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LostHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LostHorizon">Lost Horizon</a></em>, where the survivors of a plane crash stumble upon a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySuetopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySuetopia">perfect utopia</a> called Shangri-La. The book is obscure now, but Shangri-La and what it represents &mdash; longing for a faraway place of beauty, spiritual replenishment, and supernatural longevity &mdash; stuck around. When Tibet realized that heavy logging of their old-growth forests was causing disastrous floods, they turned to tourism, found that it paid really well, and renovated a village, renaming it Shangri-La.
<ul><li> There was an even odder two-step version during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. When reporters asked President Roosevelt where the bombers for the Doolittle Raid came from, he blew off the question by joking that they took off from "Shangri-La." Shortly afterward the U.S. Navy launched a carrier named the U.S.S. <em>Shangri-La</em> (CV-38), which served until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">Vietnam</a> era.

A beverage of that name <em>did</em> exist in the Tudor era (as <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_Jgq-VQE-o">beer blended with butter, sugar, eggs, and spices<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, kind of like a 16th-centuy eggnog), but in recent years everybody seems to have his own recipe for it &mdash; including <em>The Wizarding World of Harry Potter</em> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/UniversalStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/UniversalStudios">Universal Studios</a> Orlando.
</li><li> The books were also credited with a boost to the number of schoolchildren learning Latin (as the magic words for spells in the Harry Potter universe are normally a Latin translation of the intended effect).

This cropped up again in Palestine in the 1930s when the book was published there. There was a huge demand for blue frock-coats and yellow vests as well, because Werther is described as wearing them. Not to mention the merchandise &mdash; <em>Werther</em> perfume. And the fan fiction (in the 18th century, yet). <em>And</em> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njI4Mo84qeQ">the opera<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

<ul><li> The town of Forks, Washington has seen a 600% increase in tourism in the last few years, nearly all of it due to it being the main setting of the series. There have even been a pair of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Documentary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Documentary">documentaries</a>, <em>Twilight in Forks</em> and <em>Destination Forks</em>, made about how the town has been affected by this. The <em>Twilight</em> tourism has also rubbed off on neighboring towns, most notably La Push (home of Jacob Black and the Quileute tribe) and Port Angeles (the main town on the Olympic Peninsula, and where several scenes from the book took place).
</li><li> The restaurant Bella Italia in Port Angeles, where Bella and Edward have their first date, received so many requests for the mushroom ravioli that Bella orders in the book that they <a class="urllink" href="http://www.peninsuladailynews.com/article/20080801/NEWS/808010304">added it to the menu<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> under the name of "Bella's Mushroom Ravioli."

She removes the label from all her clothes and wears drab black, grey, or white everything. She has one specific bit of clothing: a black Buzz Rickson's MA-1 jacket, a replica WWII flying jacket slavishly reproduced by Japanese clothing otaku, accurate down to the wobble in the stitching. Buzz Rickson's was real. The jacket was real. The quality was real.

</li><li> According to legend (though likely apocryphal), Sir Walter Scott's <em>Anne of Geierstein</em> is supposedly the source of opals having bad luck; its protagonist dies shortly after her opal necklace is tarnished by holy water. The legend says that the book was popular enough that sales of opals dropped 50% in England after the book was published, and the market was only corrected after a large black opal influx from Australia. In fact, there is little contemporary evidence to support this claim.
</li><li> This trope is the whole reason that we have <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheShadow">The Shadow</a></em> at all. Street and Smith was getting its clock cleaned in the detective-story magazine business in 1930, and so decided to latch on to a new gimmick &mdash; dramatizing their stories on the radio. They chose as a narrator/host character a mysterious, vaguely sinister figure that soon became known as "The Shadow" (a nod to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens">Charles Dickens</a> character who was a hypothetical newspaper reporter). While he wasn't intended to do more than usher in the stories and never actually figured in them (think "The Cryptkeeper" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TalesFromTheCrypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TalesFromTheCrypt">Tales from the Crypt</a></em>), the public fell in love with the character and demanded to know more about him. Whereupon Street and Smith hired Walter B. Gibson to begin writing novel-length stories of The Shadow in a new magazine devoted to him. And the rest is history.

</li><li> It's been said that as much as a third of all tourism to Prince Edward Island, Canada's smallest and least-populated province, is related to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnneOfGreenGables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnneOfGreenGables">Anne of Green Gables</a></em>, which is set there.
</li><li> The Polish/Lithuanian name "Gra&#380;yna" was invented by the poet Adam Mickiewicz for his narrative poem <em>Gra&#380;yna, A Lithuanian story</em>. It's derived from the Lithuanian word <em>gra&#158;i</em>, meaning "beautiful", and it was widespread in Poland up until around the 1980s.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em> was known for providing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColbertBump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColbertBump">Colbert Bump</a> to many of the films it riffed, which would later cause problems because the movies would become popular enough to be too expensive to redistribute. But the show was also known to cause increased demand of things in the movies it featured. Case in point: The "hero" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TimeChasers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TimeChasers">Time Chasers</a></em> wears a Castleton State College T-shirt through most of the movie. That shirt got popular enough to be demanded in real life (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColbertBump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColbertBump">and the film got itself a DVD release</a>). Eerily enough, one of Crow's riffs during the episode was "remember when everyone got the Nick Miller haircut and started wearing Castleton T-shirts?"
</li><li> Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DavyCrockett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DavyCrockett">Davy Crockett</a></em> caused a wild sensation in the '50s, popularizing (among other things) coonskin caps as a must-have item among children. Coonskin caps were so popular, the raccoon almost became an endangered species because of it (this was before synthetics). As seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture">Back to the Future</a></em>.
</li><li> Due to the run of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KnightRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KnightRider">Knight Rider</a></em>, there was an increase in demand for Firebird Trans Ams &mdash; especially ones with all the gadgets KITT possessed, like the red nose-mounted scanner lights and control yoke instead of a regular steering wheel. Unfortunately, vehicle regulations and traffic laws meant most of those flashy lights and such were either illegal or not allowed on non-emergency vehicles. Eventually the show stopped referring to the car as a Trans Am altogether, so that people would stop showing up at car lots and requesting options they couldn't get. You can, however, buy a Knight Rider themed dashboard GPS that speaks to you in KITT's voice.
</li><li> The TV miniseries adaptation of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesClavell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesClavell">James Clavell</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Shogun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Shogun">Shogun</a></em> launched the American fascination with Japanese cuisine during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>. In the late 90s, direct-to-video Anime would be handed that baton.
</li><li> Tommy Hilfiger's popularity in the hip hop scene can be traced to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SnoopDogg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SnoopDogg">Snoop Dogg</a> wearing a Tommy shirt during his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em> performance.
</li><li> For a show which spends most of its time talking about unaffordable supercars, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear">Top Gear</a></em> has a reputation as being able to destroy an everyday car's sales with a single negative word. Manufacturers will occasionally refuse to provide a car for the show to review, fearing they'll hate it, but this tends to rile the presenters more, and they'll often name and shame such cars before going on to review them "covertly" anyway. The presenters would add that in spite of that, too many of the cars they've trashed have gone on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity">to sell well anyway</a>.
<ul><li> Due to Ferrari's reluctance to allow Top Gear to obtain an Enzo Ferrari for testing and review, Clarkson recruited Nick Mason of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd">Pink Floyd</a> to allow the show to use his Enzo for review and testing. Mason agreed, under the stipulation that they "promote" his book, <em>Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd</em>.
</li><li> The presenters spent an entire series mocking the forthcoming Dacia Sandero before it had even been finished. By the start of the next series, Renault had not only delayed the UK release of the model, but also of the whole brand's (while the official reason was because of the greater-than-anticipated demand in Continental Europe, one can't help but wonder why Renault would release that statement when they did). But Season 14 has May drive the Sandero in Romania, and he liked it so much that he wanted to take it back to the U.K. with him (before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a lorry driver "accidentally" backed into it, much to Clarkson and Hammond's amusement</span>). That may have been enough to give Dacia <a class="urllink" href="http://bestsellingcarsblog.com/2013/07/29/uk-6-months-2013-peugeot-208-and-bmw-1-series-break-into-top-10/">a respectable showing in the UK.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> May would later take a Sandero with him on the Ukraine trip, and it would be the only car of the three not to run out of gas before reaching the border.
</li><li> For their <em>American Supercars</em> special, Dodge refused to loan them a Challenger because they'd given so many of their other cars bad reviews. So Richard Hammond bought one &mdash; and he loved it.
</li><li> <em>Top Gear</em>'s power lap certainly gives lower-profile sports car companies a chance to get some recognition: the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gumpert_Apollo">Gumpert Apollo<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was best known for several years as the "fastest car round the <em>Top Gear</em> track." Although sometimes the opposite is true: Clarkson royally took apart the reliability and safety of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caparo_T1">Caparo T1<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> When testing luxury cars in Albania, Bentley refused to provide a car. Clarkson took a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar">beaten-up Yugo</a> instead, all the while pretending it was "really" a Bentley.
</li><li> The real red stapler, though, is the military. Every challenge featuring the military provides the British armed forces with a chance to show off their state of the art military hardware to millions of prime-time (often male, young adult) viewers. <em>Top Gear</em> is one of the best recruiting ads out on the BBC, second only to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Home perm kit sales skyrocketed in Britain after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AshesToAshes2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AshesToAshes2008">Ashes to Ashes (2008)</a></em>, which features a permed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeeleyHawes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeeleyHawes">Keeley Hawes</a>, began running.
</li><li> At the height of its popularity, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> most definitely did get the youngsters fixated on martial arts, although it was less of the "take classes, study disciplines and earn belts" sort than it was the "yell 'hi-yah!' and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">kick your cousin in the groin</a>" variety.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDukesOfHazzard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDukesOfHazzard">The Dukes of Hazzard</a></em> revitalized popularity in the late-1960s model Dodge Charger. Dodge produced around 45,000 for 1970, so while they are not scarce, the popularity has driven the price higher than the equivalent Plymouth model. The show also popularized <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWearsShortShorts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWearsShortShorts">short shorts, particularly tight jeans cut off just below the buttocks ("Daisy Dukes")</a>.
</li><li> Inversion: Australian TV show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KathAndKim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KathAndKim">Kath and Kim</a></em> decreased the popularity of chardonnay in Australia (which is a shame, because Australia really does make some good chardonnay). Having it drunk by two of the least classy middle-class women in all of Melbourne, one of whom pronounces it "card-donnay", might have something to do with it.

As soon as it was positively identified &mdash; as a Label Lab "Misty Mountain" design &mdash; fans dog-piled on House of Fraser, the online apparel store that sold it. It took less than a month for all of the Misty Mountain shirts to sell out.
</li><li> Tom Baker's iconic scarf was so popular that BBC released the knitting instructions and the colors to use, and people knitted their own, even entering contests on length (as the original was 22 feet long(!)).
<ul><li> Later, after the show's revival in the 2000s, demand for the scarf resurged (even though Baker wasn't in the reboot, at least not until the 50th anniversary special), and BBC licensed one &mdash; but fans decried it's paltry 6 foot length. The next year, BBC licensed a 12-foot one to satisfy the fans.
</li></ul></li><li> The Thirteenth Doctor's scarf introduced in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2019NYSResolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2019NYSResolution">Resolution</a>" was sold out after its <a class="urllink" href="https://www.blueberries-online.com/men-c2/paul-smith-accessories-mens-paul-smith-acc-mens-rainbow-edged-scarf-blue-p28084">store page was found.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li></ul></li><li> After the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em> episode "Numbers" debuted, there was a marked rise in purchases of lottery tickets using the numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, and 42. And indeed, there have been several reports of people winning large amounts of the money by playing those numbers and <em>winning</em> from some or most of the numbers. A reported jackpot with all of the <em>Lost</em> numbers has, to date, never been reported.
</li><li> The title character's coat in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock">Sherlock</a></em> was a discontinued, limited edition item (a fact mentioned <em>in dialogue</em> in the series). There were so many demands for it after the show aired that Belstaff brought it back.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Emergency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Emergency">Emergency!</a></em>: The show is popularly thought to have been the best advertisement about the merits of the paramedic program ever, and lots of cities and counties started setting up their own in the 1970s. While the series' influence on public policy might never be confirmed, the series definitely inspired many people to become paramedics and/or firefighters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em> showcased a lot of space-age technology and coolness that people wanted to have for themselves:
<ul><li> The managers of a fancy hotel once contacted the producers asking them what they did to get the fancy automatic doors to work right. They were nonplussed to hear that the doors on the <em>Enterprise</em> worked by having a guy pull on a rope. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">technology marched on</a>, automatic doors would wind up working exactly like they did on <em>Star Trek</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesDoohan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesDoohan">James Doohan</a>'s Montgomery Scott character has inspired so many to become engineers that he received an honorary degree in Engineering from one such school. Similarly, Dr. McCoy is said to have encouraged many fans to pursue careers in medicine. And many black women who went into STEM and space exploration fields because of Nichelle Nichols.
</li><li> As soon as it was technically possible, cell phones were produced to have a clamshell case design because Star Trek communicators popularized such a look. In fact, you can even get phones that look <em>exactly</em> like a communicator.
</li><li> Uhura's headset looks very much like the Bluetooth headsets of today.
</li><li> The starship <em>Enterprise</em> herself inspired NASA to name a training shuttle <em>Enterprise</em> (though the effect is lessened when one learns that shuttle never went into space). Weirdly, in later <em>Star Trek</em> series, that shuttle is called out as the namesake for the in-universe <em>Enterprise</em>. Trekkie Richard Branson named his prototype Virgin Galactic (low-orbit) spaceship <em>Enterprise</em> as well. And he named the second one <em>Voyager</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> When fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl">Gossip Girl</a></em> learned where Chuck's trademark hideous scarf from season one could be purchased, it sold out in a matter of days.
</li><li> After <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em> started airing, applications to be forensics investigators and applications for appropriate college majors skyrocketed. Pretty much every Las Vegas souvenir store carries <em>CSI</em> merchandise now (even though the actual Las Vegas police doesn't even call them CSIs). It also gave us <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCSIEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCSIEffect">The CSI Effect</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShouldKnowThisAlready" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShouldKnowThisAlready">Which is bad, by the way</a>.
<ul><li> Invoked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisRock">Chris Rock</a> in one of his stand-up routines, suggesting that many Americans would've murdered their spouses and buried them in the back yard, except for watching CSI: "Man, they're <em>thorough</em>! I'd better make up, they might catch my ass!"
</li><li> A sad example. In Chile, a university created a three-year CSI course due to popular demand. It lasted for two years, until the students realized that there were no jobs for CSI technicians in Chile. They promptly tried to sue.
</li></ul></li><li> When the game show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTheHiddenTemple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTheHiddenTemple">Legends of the Hidden Temple</a></em> was on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a>, <em>everybody</em> wanted one of the team shirts the contestants wore, and there were a few playground arguments over which of the six teams was the coolest. Since they were a prop and only available to the actual contestants, many kids were disappointed. Over 15 years and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">Nostalgia Filter</a> later, the demand is still so high, they keep a couple of Internet companies in business. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.templeshirts.com/">Like this one.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> The "Rachel" cut, the flat, straight and square-layered hairstyle worn by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferAniston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferAniston">Jennifer Aniston</a> in the first couple of seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em>, was so popular with women that it came to be associated with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> the same way that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EightiesHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EightiesHair">frizzy, voluminous hair</a> defined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">the preceding decade</a>. The funny thing is that this was unintentional. The stylist originally wanted Aniston to have even-length hair, but wasn't sober and accidentally cut off a bit too much on the front right; instead of matching all the rest of her hair to it, he just cut off a bit on the other side to make it symmetrical. In an interview, Aniston claimed that she hated the haircut and didn't get what the "big deal" was.
</li><li> The massive popularity of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em>' early seasons had viewers clamoring for Mulder's UFO-themed office poster. However, the image on the poster was created (and owned) by the show's production team, and couldn't legally be mass produced. Eventually, the show's merchandising department remedied the problem by redesigning the poster used in the show itself, adding the iconic "I Want to Believe" catchphrase to a (similar) pre-existing image of a UFO. The show also greatly increased the interest in UFOlogy and probably inspired many young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">conspiracy theorists</a>.
</li><li> Whenever the show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em> features a song that is either obscure or hasn't been big in several years, the publicity causes sales for the original song to go up.

The reason? Dealers adding random chemicals to their meth to get that color. The makers of the show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndSomeOtherStuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndSomeOtherStuff">deliberately used an incorrect formula</a> so that they wouldn't teach viewers how to cook meth, but it didn't stop various enterprising dealers from trying to cash in.

The researchers who examined the link claimed that it was because the show made raising a baby at such a young age look like a harrowing, stressful job that would destroy a teenage girl's life. Oddly enough, it was also feared that the show would lead to the exact opposite effect, with teenage girls attempting to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolThing">imitate the show's stars</a> and get themselves pregnant, possibly just to get onto the show.

Ironically, because the museum no longer had the patterns for the original sweatshirt they actually turned to the one used in the show to recreate them.

It became enough of an issue that the producers had a regular family with five children (one set of triplets followed by a set of twins) come on to discuss the sheer expense of taking care of so many small children at once to try and dissuade fans. Also, the sight of celebrities getting to spend time with their children resulted in enough resentment from everyday Koreans (who have some of the longest working hours in the world), led to the government forcing employers to give employees more time off.
</li><li> In Spain, when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMinistryOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMinistryOfTime">The Ministry of Time</a></em> was broadcast, there were noted spikes in searches for the historical characters that made an appearance in each episode.

Additionally the black jumpsuit worn by Fleabag also sold out after the show aired.
</li><li> When the Kings Island roller coaster The Racer was featured on an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBradyBunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBradyBunch">The Brady Bunch</a></em>, not only did the ride's popularity increase but it caused a spike in interest and demand for roller coasters in general throughout the 1970's. As a result, the roller coaster industry experienced a renaissance, where it was previously at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBottom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBottom">Rock Bottom</a> since The Great Depression.
</li><li> The success of Starbucks in the UK when it opened its first branches there in the 90s owed a lot to another recent US import - prestige American comedies that played in an extremely popular Friday night block. The biggest hit was of course <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em> picked up the slightly older/middle class/sophisticated demographic. A population was eager to hang out in Central Perk (with which Starbucks shared its casual and comfortable vibe) and/or Cafe Nervosa (with which it shared its Seattle roots)

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RupaulsDragRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RupaulsDragRace">Rupauls Drag Race</a></em> has popularlized drag performance in the mainstream public, but the drag community is split on whether or not that's a <em>good</em> thing. On one hand, the show is praised for normalizing gender-nonconformity in young people and for increasing foot-traffic into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayBar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayBar">gay bars</a>, either for <em>Drag Race</em> viewing parties or for their own drag shows. On the other hand, many drag queens and fans that have been into the scene for decades miss the days when it was still underground and not inextricably tied to a reality show. People whose first exposure to drag was through the show might not realize that most local queens only perform as a hobby and might not have the money or skills to look as polished as the queens on tv (and many don't aspire for that anyway). Even most contestants urge their fans to learn more about drag beyond <em>Drag Race</em> and to support/respect their local queens. As Season 5 winner Jinkx Monsoon put it, "Watching <em>RuPaul's Drag Race</em> doesn't make you an expert on drag; it makes you a fan of a tv show."

Apparently he was quite disappointed to discover its origin. It's not nearly as clever as when he thought it was some kind of metaphor.
</li><li> Thrift store and flannel clothing became popular after the mainstream success of various grunge bands. However, many of these bands were wearing them not to create a fad, but because they were the warmest clothes they could afford, and flannel clothing was (and still is) quite abundant in the northwest United States, where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Grunge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Grunge">Grunge</a> scene originally developed. In fact the "look" becoming a fad annoyed many grunge artists, because they were playing in their everyday clothes in deliberate contrast to the excessive flashiness of 80's bands.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilYoung" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilYoung">Neil Young</a> raised (or lowered) the messy uncombed flannel look to a fine art.

</li><li> Sales (and prices) of Fender Jazzmaster, Jaguar and Mustang models, chosen by Cobain and his ilk as they were inexpensive, strange, unfashionable pawnshop guitars (and as Cobain had small hands and found the smaller necks easier to play) grew with Grunge's popularity. Similar, too, were the popularity of strange analog 1970's stompbox effect pedals grungers used to create their sounds.

<ul><li> Just about anything a Beatle wore took off. Arguably the most famous is the moptop hair cut.
</li><li> The Beatles connection certainly helped (and continues to help) sales of Rickenbacker, Hofner, and Gretsch guitars and basses, particularly those played by the band, as well as certain Epiphone, Fender and Gibson guitars, and Ludwig drums.
</li><li> They were one of the first bands to use a Moog modular synthesizer (though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMonkees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMonkees">The Monkees</a> had them beat by two years), on the <em>Abbey Road</em> album in 1969, helping to pave the way for the popularity of synthesizers in pop music.
</li><li> As far as studio technology is concerned, the fact that the Beatles used EMI REDD47 mixers, Fairchild 660 and 670 limiters, Neumann U47 and U48 microphones, and Altec compressors to record their music, often pushing them in radical ways to produce the groundbreaking sounds they made, has led not only to new interest in the genuine articles, but plenty of hardware and software recreations of that gear. Oddly enough, even by 1960s standards it was relatively old-fashioned equipment, and Abbey Road Studios was slow to adapt new technology.
</li><li> The use of the advance equipment is also (among others things) why they stopped performing concerts and touring during their height, because it was too hard to replicate outside the studio.
</li><li> When George first played the sitar in "Norwegian Wood", fans wrote to the label and to radio stations by the millions, asking what kind of "guitar" that was. Overnight, the sitar was transformed from a classical and sacred instrument to an exotic pop sound.

</li><li> It has been observed that a number of hit singles, even after their sales started to decline, have enjoyed spikes in their sales when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a> released parodies of them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain">Kurt Cobain</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana">Nirvana</a> once said, "I knew we had arrived when Weird Al Yankovic did a parody of us."
<ul><li> ...which was subsequently parodied on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> by having Homer (in an episode in which he briefly became a grunge-rock star) watch Weird Al parodying his hit song on TV. To take the pop-cultural references one level further, Weird Al now uses a clip of that Simpsons episode as part of the visuals shown in his concerts.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MenAtWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MenAtWork">Men at Work</a>'s "Down Under" is catchy enough that despite only mentioning the iconic Australian product once in the entire song, it drove up sales of Vegemite on its release.

The Les Paul had been discontinued for years when Clapton and his peers started using it. Not only did Gibson bring it back to great success it also drove up the prices of the original 1950s models to insane levels. A 1959 Les Paul Standard is the most expensive guitar in the world, all thanks to Clapton. Sales of high-wattage Marshall amplifiers also increased, along with effects boxes like wah-wah pedals, distortion boxes and phase shifters.
</li><li> Certain musicians such as Ricky Wilson of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheB52s" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheB52s">The B-52s</a>, Johnny Ramone of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRamones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRamones">The Ramones</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain">Kurt Cobain</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana">Nirvana</a> greatly increased the popularity of Mosrite guitars. Mosrites were obscure guitars, but they had became popular in punk by virtue of being cheap (the Ventures models being popular). Wilson also based the entire sound of the early B-52s around the guitar's other-worldly, surfy tone, making the instrument highly sought after in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostPunk">Post-Punk</a> scene. Nowadays, Mosrite guitars are rare and expensive because of the musicians who played them.
</li><li> The use of cheaply made, red Montgomery Ward Airline electric guitars and Silvertone amplifiers by Jack White of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWhiteStripes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWhiteStripes">The White Stripes</a> (an attempt by Jack to make use of unconventional, limited, gritty, hard-to-manage-and-play gear as opposed to more popular and comfortable models) led to an interest in vintage lo-fi music equipment (and a reinterest in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GarageRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GarageRock">Garage Rock</a> in general)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrooksAndDunn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrooksAndDunn">Brooks &amp; Dunn</a>'s 1992 hit "Boot Scootin' Boogie", a song about line-dancing, sparked a renewed interest in line-dancing that lasted well into the late 1990s. The craze even inspired another song which lampshaded the sudden increase &#151; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Shenandoah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Shenandoah">Shenandoah</a>'s "If Bubba Can Dance (I Can Too)", which was inspired by a comment that one of the writers made after seeing a commercial for line-dancing lessons.
</li><li> The saxophone solo in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GerryRafferty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GerryRafferty">Gerry Rafferty</a>'s "Baker Street" led to hugely increased sales of saxophones everywhere.
</li><li> The Roland TB-303 bass line synthesizer/sequencer was introduced in 1982, but didn't sell too well and production was ceased two years after its introduction. By the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>, the price of a used machine had fallen from its original price of $400 to under $100. Some machines were bought for next to nothing by Chicago DJs, who invented the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseMusic">Acid House</a> genre on it by tweaking the sound generator while a sequence runs. When the genre became popular in the early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">Nineties</a>, the TB-303 was so in-demand and sought-after, that its value had risen to multiple times its original price.
<ul><li> Pretty much the same applies to analog synthesizers in general, which were almost worthless during the beginning digital boom in the late 80s, but grew outrageously expensive after they helped make and popularize new electronic dance music styles only a few years later.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the many reasons why the Yamaha CS80 is so expensive is that it's the key element in <em>Vangelis</em>' trademark sound, and many musicians want to sound like this.

Add to this the fact that many Jarre fans and followers are electronic musicians themselves.
</li><li> Subverted by <em>Manta</em> by Norbert &amp; die Feiglinge, a song about a sports coup&eacute; made by Opel. What the song kicked off was not an increased demand (which was good in a way because the Manta was discontinued two years earlier) but a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermanHumour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermanHumour">huge wave of jokes ridiculing the car and especially the drivers</a>, which ruined its reputation for many years.

</li><li> The Kingston Trio's hit cover version of "M.T.A." in the early 1960s is supposed to have so badly damaged the reputation of Boston's Metropolitan Transportation Authority that it took its current name, Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, shortly afterwards to prevent the acronym from applying. But things have changed in the decades since. "Charlie", the protagonist of the song, has been the MBTA's official mascot, as used on its "CharlieCard" fare cards, since 2004.

</li><li> Far East Movement's "Like A G6" apparently resulted in people demanding to be able to fly in a G6, which Gulfstream Aerospace has not made, as they were still producing the G4 at the time of the song. They eventually got their wish in 2013 when Gulfstream released <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulfstream_G650">an actual G6.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>

The Yui-no-Mizu mineral water experienced the same to a lesser degree.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Houston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Houston">Houston</a> hip-hop producer DJ Screw played a major role in the popularization of purple drank, aka lean, sizzurp, or syrup, a drug created by mixing promethazine codeine cough syrup with soda pop. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThreeSixMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThreeSixMafia">Three 6 Mafia</a> song "Sippin' on Some Syrup" solidified its reputation as a legal high of choice for chilling out. Actavis, maker of one of the more popular cough syrups for this purpose, eventually <a class="urllink" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9bz3gv/sizzurp-is-the-new-quaalude">pulled it<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> from store shelves in 2014 once they realized where most of their sales and popularity were coming from, not wanting to risk lawsuits.
</li><li> The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline reported a large jump in caller traffic when rapper Logic's song 1-800-273-8255 (which is the number of the lifeline) began hitting the charts, with call rates <a class="urllink" href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/25/health/logic-suicide-hotline-vma-18002738255/index.html">increasing 50%<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> the night he performed it live at the Video Music Awards.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheTragicallyHip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheTragicallyHip">The Tragically Hip</a>'s "Bobcaygeon" garnered interest in increased tourism of the eastern Ontario town of the same name. The largest community events in Bobcaygeon's history included a viewing of the Hip's last tour, and a candlelight vigil for their late frontman Gord Downie. Despite this, the song is not about the town but the name was included to complete a rhyme.
</li><li> It's <a class="urllink" href="https://www.sprucecanyonfamilydentistry.com/blog/invisalign-making-waves-because-of-one-song/">been reported<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that Invisalign sales have increased since the release of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillieEilish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillieEilish">Billie Eilish</a>'s "bad guy," due to the video opening with Billie taking hers out.

</li><li> In one of the more bizarre examples of the phenomenon, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BTS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BTS">BTS</a> member Jungkook managed to <a class="urllink" href="https://www.koreaboo.com/news/jungkook-downy-saga-stir-business-circles/">cause a nationwise shortage of the fabric softener Downy in South Korea by simply mentioning he was using it to do his laundry.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Once Downy caught up to demand, they later partnered with BTS to release fabric softener branded with their mascot characters.

<ul><li> Mexican <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling">Professional Wrestling</a> fans have made a tradition of wearing a replica of their favorite wrestler's mask when they go to the shows. This show of support has also made inroads north of the border, with the recent success of masked wrestlers like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterioJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterioJr">Rey Mysterio</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GregoryHelms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GregoryHelms">The Hurricane</a>.
</li><li> Wrestlers will often wear their own merchandise as product placement or simply as part of their entrance/ring gear. On occasion they don't have merchandise to begin with and their gear gains popularity, leading to this trope.

Many martial artists unrelated to pro wrestling, like judokas, karatekas, amateur wrestlers and MMA fighters, have confessed being sucked into the martial arts world during their childhood by watching Inoki or Tiger kicking and grappling evil foes in the ring. The same can be applied to United States as well, given that many a sport wrestler can tell he begged to join the school club out of love for the WWF.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheAdventuresOfSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheAdventuresOfSuperman">The Adventures of Superman</a></em> inverted this trope significantly. In 1946, Florida-native activist Stetson Kennedy had infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan and learned its secret greetings and rituals, but the Klan at this time had grown powerful enough that the police were reluctant to stand up to them. He decided instead to pitch a story to the producers of <em>The Adventures of Superman</em> in which Superman takes on an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> organization called "The Klan of the Fiery Cross". The 16-episode arc revealed the Klan secrets that Kennedy had discovered, stripping the Klan of much of its air of menace and mystery. As a result, new recruitment for the Klan dried up to almost zero within a few weeks of the initial episode broadcasts, and Kennedy and his episodes were regarded by some as "the single greatest contributor to the weakening of the Klan." <a class="urllink" href="http://dangerousminds.net/comments/how_superman_singlehandedly_thwarted_the_ku_klux_klan">Read more here.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>

The same goes for airsoft copies of certain guns; one company, KWA, had its stock of Beretta 93R machine pistols sell out in record time after <em>Modern Warfare 2</em> featured it as one of the best sidearms in its multiplayer component.

<ul><li> On the other end of the spectrum are "Wasteland Builds" where gun enthusiast gamers will build or modify rifles (usually AK platform rifles, though occasionally G3 clones too) to match the aesthetic or even replicate specific in-game weapons from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER">STALKER</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em>, or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metro2033" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metro2033">Metro 2033</a></em> series.

Oddly enough, with all the royalties being paid out, Wargaming has decided to go on a restoration spree by channeling some of the money they make from the game into restoring old tanks, ships, and planes to a showable (if not flyable/drivable/sailable) condition.

</li><li> Similar to SSB, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> occasionally gives exposure to an obscure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> property which proceeds to become much less obscure.

But <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">it's always been regarded as a Disney classic overseas</a>, so it was included in the game, leading to its American fandom becoming much more mainstream.

</li><li> University of Nevada hoodies were sold out from the university online store after pictures of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada-tan">Nevada-tan<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> surfaced. Nevada-tan is the Internet nickname for a Japanese girl who murdered a classmate in 2004, deriving from a widely published photograph of her wearing a University of Nevada hoodie. The store temporarily withdrew the hoodie from sale after learning the reason for the sudden increase in demand.
</li><li> A bizarre example of the news having this effect: following the revelation that former Russian spy Alexander Litvenenko had been poisoned with the radioactive element polonium, a Polish restaurant in Sheffield called Polonium saw its bookings skyrocket. This is probably the result of Sheffielders Googling the element and finding the website of the restaurant in the search.
</li><li> When Chef Paul Prudhomme first introduced his famous recipe for blackened redfish, it became so popular <em>that it put the redfish on the endangered species list</em>.
</li><li> Major sports events every year inspire thousands of people to discover their inner athlete and suddenly take up said sport, only to give it up a couple of weeks after said event is over. Happens very prominently with less popular recreational sports such as tennis (try getting a public court when Wimbledon is on in the UK).
</li><li> U.S. presidents, have been known to affect demand for things they like, but John F. Kennedy was one of the biggest. When word circulated that he could read 1600 words per minute, attendance in speed-reading courses went up. He also listed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FromRussiaWithLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FromRussiaWithLove">From Russia with Love</a></em> as one of his favorite books in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Life" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Life">Life</a></em>; it instantly became a best-seller, piqued American interest in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em>, and ensured that it would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FromRussiaWithLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FromRussiaWithLove">the next Bond novel adapted to film</a>. He's even credited with "killing the hat" by not appearing in public with one, although that one's apocryphal &mdash; the hat was already in decline since the early-mid 1940s (almost two decades before he became President),<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note38mi8');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note38mi8" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note38mi8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This was partly because of wartime restrictions and rising post-war use of cars</span> and the hat would remain a standard piece of menswear until around 1965-67. Furthermore, he <em>did</em> wear a top hat to his inauguration (only to take it off for his "Ask Not" speech).
</li><li> An inversion ocurred with the constant use of double-breasted blazers by bankers and financiers between the 1980s and 2000s. After the 2008 crisis, the jacket's reputation went from "cool gangster suit" to "corrupt banker suit", and thus demand evaporated overnight, becoming basically extinct... before it saw a revival of sorts about a decade later.
<ul><li> Formal clothes in general fell victim to the crisis and its link to Wall Street men. Furthermore, the fact tech entrepreneurs only wore casual clothes (blazers being their most "formal" piece of attire) led most companies to drastically relax or even completely ditch their dress codes, to the point many places discourage the use of formal clothing in favor of a more casual set-up known as the "Midtown Uniform".

</li><li> Athletes have been known to influence hairstyles:
<ul><li> The increase of the popularity of men suffering from male pattern baldness shaving their heads could be traced to the decision of basketball legend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MichaelJordan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MichaelJordan">Michael Jordan</a> shaving his head for that reason.
</li><li> In Brazil, soccer player Ronaldo also shaved his head. He also gave the world <a class="urllink" href="http://copa3x4.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/ronaldo-cascao.jpg">this horrible haircut<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> (compared to <a class="urllink" href="http://i40.tinypic.com/27y1lig.jpg">Casc&atilde;o/Smudge<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> of local comic strip <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MonicasGang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MonicasGang">Monica's Gang</a></em>), which inspired children to imitate him.
</li><li> In the U.K., David Beckham's hair was the source of many such fashions, including the mohawk he wore in the 90s, his skinhead look in the early 2000s and his undercut in the 2010s.
</li></ul></li><li> On February 2, 2011, knitting blogger Stephanie Pearl-McPhee posted <a class="urllink" href="http://www.yarnharlot.ca/blog/archives/2011/02/02/mine_mine_all_mine.html">an entry<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> about her wonderful new mittens, which she had knitted from mawata (silk hankies) obtained from Blue Moon Fiber Arts.

<ul><li> This is actually fairly common- In the same vein as Being Farked, one can be "Harlotted"; a yarn or pattern Stephanie uses becomes an incredibly in demand product.

</li><li> Some specialist software used by British city councils is now undergoing this trope due to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.whatdotheyknow.com">WhatDoTheyKnow.com<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalBasketballAssociation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalBasketballAssociation">NBA</a> player Jason Collins <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightGay">came out the closet</a>&mdash;becoming the first openly gay athlete in one of America's "Big Four" major leagues&mdash;he revealed that the reason he wears the number 98 is to commemorate Matthew Shepherd, a gay college student whose brutal murder in 1998 led to the passing of hate crime laws in the US. After making that announcement, his Brooklyn Nets jersey became the biggest seller on the NBA's website.
</li><li> A <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-2367-4-things-you-learn-behind-counter-gun-store.html">morbid example<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of this: whenever a high-profile mass shooting occurs in the United States, not only do gun sales typically go up, but sales of the specific model of gun used in the shooting skyrocket even further. Sales of the Glock 19, for instance, shot up after a would-be assassin used one to badly wound Representative Gabrielle Giffords (of Arizona's 8th congressional district) and kill six others at a campaign rally, as did sales of AR-15 rifles after the Sandy Hook Elementary killer used one. Even gun accessories are subjected to this, as happened when "bump stocks", a modification that uses a semiautomatic rifle's recoil to effectively turn it into an automatic weapon, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/gun-stores-selling-bump-stocks-153911597.html">sold out at stores across the country<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> after the Las Vegas concert killer used them on his rifles. The reason for this is fear that incoming gun control legislation will make it impossible to get that weapon down the line, leading many gun enthusiasts to feel that they need to get one as soon as possible. Indeed, the connection between left-wing electoral success and surges in gun sales &mdash; and, conversely, right-wing electoral success and hard times for the firearms industry<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4gk2u');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4gk2u" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4gk2u');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanGunPolitics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanGunPolitics">In the US</a>, gun control is generally held to be a left-wing issue, and opposition to such is generally held to be a right-wing issue. There are exceptions in both directions, of course.</span> &mdash; is <a class="urllink" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/obama-great-gun-business-trumps-terrible-163923519.html">so well-known<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that a (possibly tongue-in-cheek) conspiracy theory claims that gun and ammo manufacturers are secretly backing ineffectual anti-gun politicians and activists in order to invoke this, exploiting fear of gun control to drive sales.
</li><li> In 1918, Italian general Armando Diaz signed the Victory Address, a short document meant to inform the population of the victory against Austria in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>. It was shown in schools, barracks, and town halls, and many children were required to memorize it. The Address ended with the words "firmato: Diaz" (signed: Diaz), which led many to think that "Firmato" was his first name. In the following years, many children were baptized with that name.
</li><li> In 2006, Britain's already scandal-hit Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott found himself in even bigger trouble when he treated himself to an afternoon off to enjoy a game of croquet. Bad news for him, as it ultimately cost him his grace-and-favor mansion, but good news for manufacturers of croquet sets which suddenly came into greater demand than they had for decades.
</li><li> O. J. Simpson's infamous chase down the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LosAngeles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LosAngeles">Los Angeles</a> freeway in a white Ford Bronco saw sales of that vehicle skyrocket by seven thousand in the following year, despite it being a fairly primitive model of SUV compared to Ford's Explorer and other modern, four-door vehicles.
</li><li> The shooting of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman led to a spike in sales of Skittles candy. Martin was holding a bag of Skittles when he was shot, and as such, Skittles <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconOfRebellion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconOfRebellion">became a popular symbol at the protests</a> that eventually coalesced into the Black Lives Matter movement.
</li><li> When Nissan came up with the Skyline GT-R line of sports cars based on the Skyline luxury car range, it was not officially sold in Western markets. However, the likes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranTurismo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranTurismo">Gran Turismo</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFastAndTheFurious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFastAndTheFurious">The Fast and the Furious</a></em> among others spurred so much mainstream interest in the "Godzilla", as it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">nicknamed</a> by an Australian auto magazine, that grey-market importers stepped in to cater to the demand. One such importer was Motorex, who supplied the GT-R used by Paul Walker's character in the first film. Nissan eventually took notice and developed the R35 GT-R, first conceptualised in 2001 and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavedFromDevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavedFromDevelopmentHell">released in 2007</a>. The R35 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivorcedInstallment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivorcedInstallment">branched off</a> from the mainline Skyline range, as part of its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot">Continuity Reboot</a>.
