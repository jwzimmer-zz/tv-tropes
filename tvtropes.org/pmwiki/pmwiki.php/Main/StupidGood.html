It is difficult, if not impossible to reason with hardened criminals or terrorists of any sort (at least, in most cases, without a credible threat of force that this sort of personality would naturally be unwilling to provide), both in reality and in fantasy. It gets even more ridiculous when one tries negotiating with entities whose goals include the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilEmpire">conquest</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">destruction</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">domination</a> of the world, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfEvil">pure manifestations of evil</a>.

They don't want to have a huge moral quandary on their hands every time enemies attack.
</p><p>Suffice to say, this isn't really the intended way to play a paladin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid">either</a> (though the <em>Book of Exalted Deeds</em> did provide vows of non-violence for those who wanted to play a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist">pacifist character</a>). The <em>Book of Exalted Deeds</em> didn't provide so much advice for these players (indeed, they left a paladin to choose between "destroying evil and honoring love" when said love was between two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils">succubi</a>), but they did indicate a good character could ask "How big is that dragon, and does it have any friends?" with an eye towards knowing if they stand a chance at all. Guess <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WizardsOfTheCoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WizardsOfTheCoast">Wizards of the Coast</a> thought it was more important to avoid being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick">Miko Miyazaki</a> than it was to avoid being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Nodwick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Nodwick">Piffany</a>.
</p><p>In some settings, however, Stupid Good behavior may actually <em>work</em> &mdash; though these settings also tend to be so high on the idealistic end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism">Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism</a> that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeDiabetes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeDiabetes">crap sunshine and puke rainbows</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuritySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuritySue">Purity Sue</a> also has a tendency to convert any villain &mdash; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants">no matter how loathsome</a> &mdash; to the side of Light.
</p><p>This approach can even work on occasion in more cynical works, but in a completely different way: A character may turn out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FluffyTamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FluffyTamer">Fluffy Tamer</a>, befriending things that have been <em>assumed</em> to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>, but are actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReluctantMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReluctantMonster">Reluctant Monsters</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonMaliciousMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonMaliciousMonster">Non Malicious Monsters</a> responding to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanHelsingHateCrimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanHelsingHateCrimes">violence</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil">with violence</a>. In truly cynical works, this may still actually work, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">go horribly right</a>: the monster may be so taken with the Stupid Good character that it decides to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndCallHimGeorge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndCallHimGeorge">give him a hug</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant">Gentle Giant</a> may be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalKlutz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalKlutz">Lethal Klutz</a>, or they may discover that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureIsNotNice">Nature Is Not Nice</a> when one of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings">new friends eats another new friend</a>. Arguably the darkest variant is when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsOffMyFluffy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsOffMyFluffy">Hands Off My Fluffy!</a> crosses paths with a crowd carrying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchesAndPitchforks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchesAndPitchforks">Torches and Pitchforks</a> chanting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch">Burn the Witch!</a>.
</p><p>One fairly awesome way that a Stupid Good Fluffy Tamer can be played completely straight even in the most cynical of works with little to no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">narm</a>, however, is by a pairing that results in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassAndChildDuo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassAndChildDuo">Badass and Child Duo</a>. In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld">Death World</a>, this is typically the only way a child or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna">equivalently naive</a> character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">could plausibly survive</a>, and the mere existence of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist">Wide-Eyed Idealist</a> can be enough to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwakeningTheSleepingGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwakeningTheSleepingGiant">rouse</a> an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Antihero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Antihero">antihero</a> into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInSourArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInSourArmor">Knight in Sour Armor</a>, devoting themselves to the preservation of this innocence.
</p><p>If becoming good results in Stupid Good, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroBall">Hero Ball</a>.
</p><p>Despite the implications, not actually related to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbIsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbIsGood">Dumb Is Good</a>, which is where a lack of intelligence means a person is innately inclined to be good, as opposed to taking Good to such extremes as to act in a stupid manner (so this is more along the lines of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsDumb">Good Is Dumb</a>).
</p><p>Not necessarily a perfect mirror to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil">Stupid Evil</a>. Many fictional characters (and real people) see good as being worthy of pursuit for its own sake, even when it seems illogical; evil characters are expected to place self-interest above the desire to merely be perceived as "evil". After all, part of being evil is not caring about what other people think about you (in most cases). However, there is no universal agreed-upon-by-everyone "good" or "bad".

This gets him in extremely uncomfortable circumstances <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until he reaches his saturation point when caught in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice">Sadistic Choice</a>, and pulls the trigger</span>.
<ul><li> Vash could be argued as a sympathetic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">deconstruction</a> of this. He suffers rather heavily to save people without hurting others <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to the point that when you see his bare chest, it is almost all either scar tissue or metal braces holding it together</span>. He had plenty of opportunities to save many lives by ending a few but always chose to resolve conflicts peacefully. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Being forced to confront that choice when it concerned people that he knew personally was what finally broke him.</span>
<ul><li> What's more, Vash is one of the few people on the planet who can live up to his ideal that he can save everyone due to his insane skills. He's aware that he is different in this respect, so it's less him being stupidly good and more using his more than adequate gifts to protect everyone. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Even at his lowest point, when faced with an enemy he simply can't defeat, mentioned above, he never gives up his ideals, but he does realize by the end that there are some forces he cannot overcome and he can't be everywhere at once, the last scene of the anime is him basically accepting this fact and moving on to try and live a more reasonable life.</span>

But honey, maybe you should use the brain that we know you have in there and think: your friends have already displayed their rescue fetishes, those arrancar were trying to kill you and one was still hitting you while you were healing her, and Aizen is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> who has probably planned for you to do all of that (and you know it, heck, you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> it after he showed you the Hogyoku)!

As an example of how bad Ichigo can be with this, after waking up from his Hollow-side taking over, he saw that Ulquiorra, an already viciously powerful opponent, had been dismembered by his outburst. His logical reaction was to offer that Ichigo could <em>injure himself to an equal extent</em> to have a fair fight with him. The Ulquiorra incident is particularly bad because Ulquiorra demonstrates that he has the ability to regenerate limbs... Yeah, it wasn't a smart time for him. Granted, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ulquiorra was currently suffering from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortalWoundReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortalWoundReveal">fatal wound regardless</a></span>, but Ichigo wasn't aware of that at the time he made the offer.

<ul><li> This applied to many superheroes in the Silver Age. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superdickery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superdickery">Superdickery</a> wasn't in effect.
</li><li> Because of his refusal to kill villains, and especially the fact he tries stopping others from killing villains, many readers have accused <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> of falling under this trope. Mainly because whenever he sends villains (especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a>) to jail or Arkham, they always break out and go back to their old ways over and over again while they continue to make Gotham the dangerous place it's always been to live in. And yet Bruce, along with his sidekicks, still can't bring themselves to kill him or at least let someone else do it.
<ul><li> As a counterargument to this, many others have argued that Gotham's official law enforcement falls under this even more and that dozens of authority figures should be held accountable before even beginning to look at the volunteering vigilante. With Batman, there at least exists the excuse that he doesn't want one vigilante to take the role of judge, jury, and executioner, and that the whole point of his crusade is to <em>support</em> law enforcement, not <em>supplant</em> it. With Gotham's official authorities, however, there exists no excuse why Joker hasn't been shot to death by cops, declared accountable for his actions by a legal psychiatrist, or just plain given the death sentence by a judge yet. Possible corruption isn't even a part of it, as Joker doesn't seem to be wielding any significant clout. During <em>No Man's Land</em>, a storyline where Gotham becomes ravaged by an earthquake and is declared legally lawless and no longer part of the U.S., James Gordon actually has the Joker at gunpoint, <em>after the latter killed his wife</em>, and still chooses to just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kneecapping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kneecapping">kneecap</a> him rather than finally doing what needs to be done, no laws holding him back in this one instance.

However, as soon as the man in question relinquishes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Artifact of Doom</a> containing the angel, they immediately withdraw, despite it being clear to everyone (including them) that the man is evil even without the influence of the angel, and they would have left without the apocalypse-averting information rather than interfere in the man's (to all intents and purposes nonexistent) chance to seek redemption had Harry not beaten the information out of him.
</li><li> On the other hand, they are prevented from falling firmly into this trope for two reasons; one, in the above example, Harry totally refutes the villain's assertions that they are too "weak" to do the pragmatic thing, since he is fully aware that it takes enormous personal strength to be so dedicated, and he greatly admires them for it even in the midst of his exasperation. Two, it is explicitly confirmed and proven that the knights have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BargainWithHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BargainWithHeaven">Bargain with Heaven</a> that works through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence">Contrived Coincidence</a>, and consequently nothing too terrible has ever come of them sticking to their principles, even if it takes something spectacularly improbable (or Harry's willingness to do the dirty work) to make things turn out mostly OK.

He attempts to disband the army, confiscates the land of the priests of Ammon, causing them to curse it, distributes it to the poor without regard for whether or not they know how to farm and then when the Syrians revolt and the Hittites invade wants to bankrupt what little of the treasury is left to buy them off despite being told by several sources that this will only convince them of Egypt's weakness and encourage their invasion.
</li><li> In one of C. S. Forester's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HoratioHornblower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HoratioHornblower">Horatio Hornblower</a></em> novels, Hornblower can save his ship only by lying to a French officer that Napoleon has recently died. To make the enemy believe him, Hornblower has to support the lie by taking an oath on his honor as an officer. He plans to resign his commission in disgrace at the next port because he has permanently dishonored himself. Fortunately for him, he finds out, by Jove, Napoleon really IS dead, so the lie was the truth all along. In Forester's defense, he conveys the standards of that culture so vividly that the reader can believe in Hornblower's scruples. This incident subverts the Stupid Good trope on a couple levels. Hornblower is arguably being "stupid good" in that he expects his enemies to completely ditch their plan solely because Hornblower gives his sworn word. However, he's not being "stupid" because they <em>do</em> take his word, and he's not being "good" because his actions are utterly shameful in his culture.

<ul><li> Not really all the Valar (Varda, for example, caught on to Morgoth&#146;s wickedness early on and never liked him, and Tulkas vocally opposed giving Morgoth a second chance) but specifically Manw&euml;, whom it was said had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodCannotComprehendEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodCannotComprehendEvil">limited understanding of evil</a> because he was so close to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">Eru</a>, and the rest of the Valar sort of had to go along with his greater authority. It's also said that because they swore to let him out, they then had to do so.

She offers them some wine and tells them that she forgives them for framing her for their crimes and ruining her life. However, after Roland and Arden drink the wine, when asked why she's not drinking, Alexis reveals that she doctored the wine with tranquilizers and states that she's not stupid! Yep, she was just pretending to be Stupid Good just to get them to let their guards down! She follows it up by having a tattoo artist put "BASTARD" on Roland's forehead, "BITCH" on Arden's forehead, and tattoo Arden's body with snakes.
</li><li> In general, it's safe to say that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em> isn't kind to any who entertain the notion of being really, really nice people before engaging either their brain or general-purpose cynicism. Whichever.
<ul><li> Eddard Stark is bound by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">inflexible code of honor</a>. It isn't as irksome in the otherwise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> as one might expect. His flaw isn't his code of honor, but his belief that other people are better or more honest than they actually are and that they can be shamed into doing the right thing; he's willing to do the right thing, no matter how hard that may actually be.
</li><li> His son, on the other hand, falls into this category towards the end.
</li><li> Roose Bolton's legitimate son Domeric was an earnest and kind soul, who ended up being killed by his sadistic bastard brother Ramsay because he believed they could be best friends if they just got to know each other.

</li><li> Lord Edmure Tully is also a prime example: he rushes out and repeatedly gets himself into boiling hot water when it comes to longer-term strategy, for all he can pull wonders off tactically and in the very short term. He just can't hang back and watch his people get hurt in a bid for longer-term or multiple-step solutions. Or, can't bear the thought of the smallfolk having nowhere to find safety while he is fine behind thick walls. Accepting more mouths to feed when you're facing a castle-siege is... really nice, but not very <em>wise</em>.
<ul><li> Of course, this is only the case in-universe. In real life, protecting the peasants was the whole point of having a huge castle with thick walls. After all, if the besieging enemy kills all your peasants, then who's going to farm your lands?

The trilogy that introduced Natasi "I Satan" Daala and Kyp Durron is particularly notable for this. Mon Mothma tried to negotiate peace between the New Republic and the Empire with Ambassador Furgen, who made it no secret that he was pure evil. In fact, he throws his drink in her face and says that there will never be peace between the two governments. Then it turned out later that the drink contained nanobots that were destroying her from the inside out! You would think Mon Mothma would have had more common sense by this point in time, but apparently not. Then there is the matter of Kyp Durron going around blowing up solar systems containing Imperial citizens with the Sun Crusher. Mon Mothma and her council know what he has done, but instead of punishing him, they hand him over to Luke Skywalker, who welcomes him back with open arms. Several characters were more than happy to point that this is not how life works, and Kyp now has the pleasure of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceDoneNeverForgotten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceDoneNeverForgotten">never hearing the end of it</a> for the rest of his life!

Despite agreeing with themselves that "pacifism is itself a course of action" before the Dominators break into their council chamber and threaten them with death, they can only pick up the Dominators on using a rude tone of voice. Rather than, say engaging in proper negotiation, instead of doing pacifistic but noble actions like sticking to their principles or protesting. (This, of course, ends horribly for them.)

As he puts it, the creature is so different and on such a larger <em>scale</em> than humanoids, it may just be operating an animal-like intelligence rather than malice, or unaware that these little specks it eats up are thinking, feeling beings as well.

This seemed to change for a while when he adopted the Crow gimmick... and then he turned around and joined up with the Wolfpac the instant they split off from the nWo. Needless to say, they punked his ass out in a few months. Right through to his run in TNA over the last few years, Sting has virtually never had an ally who did not betray him. The most recent of his betrayals came after he made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Face&#150;Heel Turn</a>, joining up with the Main Event Mafia to teach the young wrestlers some respect.

Special mention must go to Maria Kanellis, who was portrayed as extremely naive from day one, but who in the summer of 2009 made a judgment call that was pretty boneheaded even for her. Dolph Ziggler (formerly "Nicky" Nemeth of the Spirit Squad) was ruthlessly tearing his way up through the midcard (after himself starting out as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil">Stupid Evil</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaiveNewcomer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaiveNewcomer">Na&iuml;ve Newcomer</a> who tried to shake all his opponents' hands before their matches). It was apparent to anyone with half a brain that Ziggler was self-centered, arrogant, and prepared to do whatever it took to win the Intercontinental Championship. But Maria genuinely loved him, accompanied him to all his matches, and constantly made excuses for his behavior, even insisting that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy">his bully shtick was just part of the kayfabe act</a> and that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsReality">away from the ring he was a completely decent person</a> - in short, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a>. She even became paranoid of other Divas who tried to warn her away from Ziggler, assuming that they were jealous of her. Maria's stubborn defense of Dolph eventually put her across the ring from his opponent for the Intercontinental Championship: Rey Mysterio, WWE's ultimate babyface. Fortunately, Maria took a brief hiatus from WWE and broke off her relationship with Dolph before he could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorrupter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorrupter">totally corrupt her</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> came off as this a bit during his mid-2011 feud with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a>. John was <em>adamant</em> that he defend his WWE title against Punk at the next PPV, despite Punk saying he was going to leave the company at midnight, just a little bit after said PPV. Yes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a> seemed corrupt for trying to meddle in it and suspending Punk, running parallels to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MontrealScrewjob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MontrealScrewjob">Montreal Screwjob</a>. John got his way....and Punk won, leaving the company with the title, exactly what Vince was trying to prevent.
<ul><li> Cena also won the 2012 Money in the Bank, giving him a title shot at any time of his choosing. Almost all previous winners have cashed in their opportunity on a weakened opponent, normally after they have been through a grueling match or have suffered a beat down,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0sieu');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0sieu" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0sieu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The sole exception being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RobVanDam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RobVanDam">Rob Van Dam</a>, who instead used his Money in the Bank opportunity to force Cena to defend the title at a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW">ECW</a> reunion pay-per-view, a venue that gave RVD home field advantage</span> but Cena insisted on giving the champion fair warning because he wanted the fans to see a more exciting match.

The dichotomy of peace-loving werewolves is certainly interesting, but some of these hippies would sooner talk politics over tea with the creatures they're supposed to kill. The worst part is the tribebook for the Children of Gaia seems to encourage portraying them as the hippies of Werewolf-kind with no real pragmatism to counterbalance their idealism. On the other hand, the other werewolf tribes tend to take Lawful Stupid to gory new heights. If they so much as <em>think</em> someone is tainted with the slightest bit of evil, <strong>GROWLSLASHKILLBITEMAIMKILLSLASH</strong>...

This was meant to refer to the extremes in philosophy of the groups.
<ul><li> Anyone with a virtue rating higher than 7 becomes incurably insane and the Vision castes are, by design, meant to guide the others in looking at the bigger picture.

</li><li> The Vow of Nonviolence from the <em>Book of Exalted Deeds</em> forbids attacking enemies... again, much like combat medics, who forfeit their special Geneva Convention protections against being knowingly fired upon if they carry combat arms or use their sidearms (which they <em>are</em> allowed to carry) as weapons of offense. The Vow of Peace requires that you work to stop other people doing violence even if they're on your side. This is both a purer form of the trope and unlikely to go down well with the rest of the party.
</li><li> <em>Book of Exalted Deeds</em> also profiles several godlike celestial beings, including Queen Morwel and the Court of Stars, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood">Chaotic Good</a> rulers of the eladrins.

She was taken captive and survived only because Faerinaal (a more sensible member of the Court of Stars) was able to mount a successful rescue while Demogorgon's dual personality was in disagreement over the best way to torture her to death, and since then, Morwel has kept Gwynarwhyf "on a short leash".

In a game where experience is mostly gained by killing things, any player with this class forfeits ALL experience for the whole adventure if anything gets killed during the adventure itself.

In particular, uber-high Compassion forbids killing, even of... say, an all-consuming eldritch horror whose single-minded goal is to drive all of existence into the unending void. High-virtue characters <em>can</em> act against their Virtues (if they have enough willpower points), but if the virtue in question is the character's most prominent one, doing so can lead to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a>.

From the moment that she took up arms and became "king" of England, Saber spent her entire life fighting for others only to be betrayed near the end of her life. Her appearance in the Grail tournament was the result of her dying wish for her kingdom to prosper. Ironically enough, Shirou of all people is amazed at her selflessness, which only goes to further encourage his protective attitude towards her.

Conversely, if the player lets the thugs go after they release Daniel, Daniel gets angry at Mordin, who says that <em>he</em> would have killed the thugs. Perhaps partially explained by Daniel being human; he likely swore the Hippocratic Oath while learning to be a doctor, and shooting people when you don't have to certainly qualifies as doing harm. Mordin, on the other hand, literally comes from a different world than Daniel, and the chances of its rules for physicians being <em>exactly</em> the same as those of Earth are quite slim.
<ul><li> A dossier conversation given by Lair of the Shadow Broker also shows that Daniel's Stupid Good tendencies actually make him a <em>bad doctor</em>. During the plague, he becomes far too emotional to actually focus on treating patients effectively. He is only an assistant, sure, but the first concern of a doctor during an epidemic sure as hell isn't going to be asking about the burial or death rituals of an already dead patient - it would be on quickly moving on to save the people who <em>can</em> be saved. Not to mention the Stupid Good-ness of leaving the clinic in the first place. The good intentions of getting the cure to the air control are undermined by a) high risk of death for an untrained medic and b) abandoning the many sick patients who need his medical help, even if the treatment he can offer is ineffective.

</li><li> Some <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> players feel this way about the current state of the Argent Crusade. In <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em>, they were the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Men</a> who were pushing the fight towards the Lich King while the Horde and Alliance bickered. Come <em>Cataclysm</em>, they remain on good terms with both factions. It wouldn't be a problem if the Crusade hadn't specifically stated that they've re-focused their main goal as claiming Lordaeron for the living. This comes into conflict with the Forsaken, who are quickly turning into the Scourge 2.0 by killing the living to raise as new undead, all while plague-bombing and defiling a lot of the landscape. Tirion Fordring's apathy and unwillingness to act against them has been interpreted as either not wanting to provoke the Forsaken so he doesn't provoke the rest of the Horde - thus sacrificing his values for politics - or as him believing that the Forsaken deserve a chance - thus falling squarely into this trope.
<ul><li> Jaina Proudmoore often gets similar criticisms. In a recent short story, she was trying to talk to Varian to convince him to keep peace with the Horde. This took place after the novel that made it clear that Garrosh would stop at nothing to claim the entire planet for the Horde, and considering Thrall has so far done exactly nothing about that, one has to wonder what, exactly, she expects Varian to do.
<ul><li> However, this has been completely averted in Mists of Pandaria, where Garrosh decides to destroy Theramoore and kill most of its inhabitants in the process. Jaina finally breaks, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">and spectacularly so</a> by going full-on the *other* way, questioning why the Horde should be allowed to exist and going on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> against Garrosh. The criticisms are now aimed at whether this character development is either believable or just too extreme.
</li></ul></li><li> Varian himself may have had such a moment in the Siege of Orgrimmar when he stopped Thrall from executing Garrosh, not considering that he could escape to commit more atrocities. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And he does</span>. He then decided to give the Horde another chance under Vol'jin after disposing of Garrosh instead of taking advantage of their weakened state to defeat them once and for all. While such an outcome was inevitable (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">obviously a faction-based MMO can't have one of its factions completely destroy or conquer the other</a>) some, including a few of his fellow Alliance leaders, like Jaina, still question whether Varian truly had the interests of the Alliance at heart when he made this choice, or if he was just making a moral decision at the expense of his own faction. On the other hand, Wrathion alludes to how the rest of the Horde would not have gone down without a long and bloody fight, albeit one he sees as an acceptable sacrifice to unite all of Azeroth.
<ul><li> In all fairness, it would have been wrong to murder them after they fought alongside the Alliance to stop Garrosh.
</li></ul></li><li> And beforehand, similar arguments can be thrown at Malfurion Stormrage. He is the protector of the wilds, but absolutely does <em>not</em> condone the usage of underhanded means even when it's saving the wilds, especially when dealing with his brother Illidan. He turns into a demon in order to save the forest? He's just as bad as the demons and must be banished for his crimes. What was that, Illidan is trying to cast a disastrous spell and in a way put a harm on his lover Tyrande (somewhat. The truth was being twisted by Maiev)? Even if that was aimed to destroy the common enemy, the Lich King? He must pay for his crimes... though he backpedals when there are chances that Tyrande might live, and Illidan genuinely offers to work together to save her. When he woke up from his Emerald Dream, he didn't realize that the Horde as of current were no longer the same good Horde that fought with him to stop Archimonde (it was under Garrosh) so he didn't lift a finger when his forests were razed. He may be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Reasonable Authority Figure</a> at times, but sometimes, that can be questioned.

During this confrontation, it is revealed that Braga did not need to be mind manipulated by the Emperor into falling to the Dark Side, instead, being faced with complete and utter failure to redeem him, sunk into despair and decided the galaxy was not worth trying to protect.</span>
</li><li> The player can play this trope straight themselves in the conclusion of the Jedi Knight storyline depending on their decisions, though it fails, as well as some of the other storylines.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalSonata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalSonata">Eternal Sonata</a></em>, when Prince Crescendo of the kingdom of Baroque decides that he can no longer support the Andantino resistance against the empire of Forte, he decides to simply travel to Forte to throw himself upon the mercy of the nation's leader, Count Waltz in the hope of negotiating. Anyone in the player party could have told him this was a <em>horrible</em> idea, as Waltz is a petty teenage tyrant who's been poisoning the people of realm with mineral powder that makes them into magic soldiers in an attempt to gain supreme power. The party immediately chases after him and upon finding him chews him out for his reckless action, but unfortunately, the next thing that happens is that said tyrant appears before the group with his right-hand man and a thunder of magical dragons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> pulls some rather controversial stunts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption">to try and force the player to play this way during the ending.</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The final challenge of the game is that someone has to go into the Project Purity control room and activate the purifier, sacrificing themselves in the process because of the blast of lethal radiation that would come after. The only heroic choice in the game is to make this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> yourself, even though you can have up to <em>three</em> party members (a super mutant, a robot, and a ghoul) who should be able to survive the radiation. If you ask them, though, they'll just tell you that this is your destiny, call you a coward, or just flat-out refuse in a very out-of-character manner. Partially averted in the <em>Broken Steel</em> DLC, which allows the super mutant to do the deed for you, and though he does survive, the game still calls you a coward for not performing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidSacrifice">Stupid Sacrifice</a> for the greater good.</span>

She will often rush in recklessly to attack demons in the name of helping people, unaware that she is cultivating a reputation as a demon-summoning witch.

In the end, facing down Damien &mdash; a mutant supremacist who intends to annihilate all of humanity, used to savagely beat her while she was a child, intends to rape and forcibly impregnate her to create a race of superhumans, killed her father and then showed her his severed head when she was five and is now about to kill all her friends &mdash; she FINALLY snaps and goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchingMoronHiddenBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchingMoronHiddenBadass">Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass</a> on his ass. Halfway through tearing him a new one, however, she regains her self-control, apologizes for attacking him, asks him to surrender (pretty please with sugar on top?) and refuses to attack him further. The only reason he still managed to wind up dead is that he attempted a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Taking You with Me</a> gambit, only to have Grace saved by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a>. And afterwards, Grace is traumatized for DAYS about having acted violently.
<ul><li> Lampshaded somewhat later when history class introduces Grace to World War II, Nazis, Hitler, and concentration-camps. Making her realize that Damien was basically a second Hitler (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidJetpackHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidJetpackHitler">with superpowers</a>), and that offering him a chance to surrender and walk away was probably really stupid.
</li><li> Those incidents apparently left their mark, since she's thrown this characterization off entirely. Perceived threats to her friends have become an official <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a>, and while she admits that she'd still prefer nonviolent solutions, in worst-case scenarios she's <a class="urllink" href="http://www.egscomics.com/?date=2010-09-06">perfectly willing to use lethal force<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

(In fairness, <em>most</em> if not all of the robots in the comic come across as a bit naive at times, Helix <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">just perhaps a bit more so than most</a>. Justified in that their individual neural networks are still evolving and a lot of things simply <em>are</em> intellectual new ground for many of them as of yet.)

While she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna">The Pollyanna</a>, she is also just so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassAdorable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassAdorable">Badass Adorable</a> that she can get away with it. Or perhaps she is this trope, but she has such a "reality distortion field" around her that evil creatures in her presence can be forced to behave if they are told she would cry if they didn't. It's stated by The Powers What Is that her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness">Incorruptible Pure Pureness</a> level is so high that she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVsCynicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVsCynicism">slides the world toward idealism</a> just by the strength of her happy thoughts.
<ul><li> She did, at one point, hire a Stupid Good paladin for the party to serve as a role model for Yeagar. Who insisted on challenging every Undead Mook they found so they couldn't harm the population, instead of making a beeline for the leader, getting Nodwick killed even more than usual. Even Piffany herself realized he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a>.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation">On the other hand</a>, Celia's reaction to the unnecessary killing of goblins could be interpreted as being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a>; she reacts like a real person to real deaths, not like an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPG">RPG</a> character. Her inability to recognise that Greysky City is completely evil is another matter, though...
</li><li> Her rationale is explained later. Because she (and everyone in her native plane) is not a mortal/PC race, she does not have a soul. So no afterlife or possibility of <em>Raise Dead</em> for her. As a result, she has a much different view of the results of dying than Humans, Elves, or even Goblins do.
</li><li> Celia's Stupid Good tendencies were subverted in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0579.html">this strip<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> with her rather ruthless reason for not wanting to abandon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMillstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMillstone">Belkar</a>.
<ul><li> Then there's Elan. The adventure game even lists his alignment as "Foolish Good". That said, most of his actions that <em>really</em> fit this trope are based on willful ignorance and his belief in following narrative conventions about how heroes are supposed to act rather than his <em>very real</em> stupidity or an inability to understand why it might not be a good idea.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Pretty much everyone in the "Dimension of Lame" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SluggyFreelance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SluggyFreelance">Sluggy Freelance</a></em> is Stupid Good &mdash; so pacifistic that one mage attempted to heal a demon that was attacking her friends, and that they can be convinced that throwing food at the demons is as bad as the demons eating people alive. Torg ends up describing them as "not as good as they think they are."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/RustyAndCo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/RustyAndCo">Rusty and Co.</a></em>'s Madeline is truly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">ditzy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePaladin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePaladin">do-gooder</a> &mdash; who is absolutely badass.

The idea that she could have donated the money to actual environmentally-friendly charities never seemed to enter her head; she just wrote it off as "blood money" and dismissed it as inherently dirty. On top of that, the sight of Lisa ripping up the check gives Homer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible">simultaneous heart attacks</a>. In the hospital, he says that he understands why Lisa did it but adds that they really could have used that "twelve thousand dollars". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">Lisa quietly tells him that</a> it was twelve <em>million</em>. Cue another heart attack.
</li><li> It's not the last time. In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS14E12ImSpellingAsFastAsICan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS14E12ImSpellingAsFastAsICan">I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can</a>", during the Spellympics she is offered a scholarship to any of the Seven Sisters colleges to throw the tournament (And a hot plate!). Obviously this is a moral dilemma, so she asks Marge if the family can afford to send her to college. Marge admits that it would be very hard on the family. Regardless, Lisa decides it's the 'right' thing to win anyway, even though her real reason for competing was for popularity and attention. As with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> example, it's better that she's honest, but she could have decided to spell to the end honestly and see what came of it without risking the scholarship, or she could have outed the rigged contest to officials anonymously, but elects to give a loud public speech about how she's been bribed. This backfires in a way reminiscent of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ABoyNamedCharlieBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ABoyNamedCharlieBrown">A Boy Named Charlie Brown</a></em>'s misspelling "beagel" when she misspells "intransigance", and George Plympton tells her the word is spelled "...E-N-C-E!" and she loses the spelling bee. It's just arrogance that she assumes she can win the Spellympics even when they're rigged <em>against</em> her.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS10E7LisaGetsAnA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS10E7LisaGetsAnA">Lisa Gets an 'A'</a>", has Lisa cheating on a test, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeTheRatingScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeTheRatingScale">earning an A+++</a>, which bumps up her school's average GPA to the point that the school earns a federal grant. However, at the ceremony for Lisa, she reveals to the audience that she cheated on the test. Yes, she's once again being honest even if it means that the other students won't get as good of an education because of it. However, Principal Skinner and the rest of the school staff <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">anticipated that she'd do this</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">as the whole ceremony was a fake</a>. They hold the ceremony a second time (without Lisa) and accept the grant money.
</li><li> All of those are more examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark">What You Are in the Dark</a>. A straighter example is in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS9E6BartStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS9E6BartStar">Bart Star</a>" when Lisa wanted to join the Pee Wee Football league so she could make a statement about sexism. Flanders gladly welcomes her to the team, revealing that there are already some girls on the team. Surprised, Lisa tries to make it about animal cruelty (since footballs are made of "pig skins"), but they explain that the balls are synthetic and part of the profits go to Amnesty International. Her moral high ground utterly shattered, Lisa runs off in tears.
</li></ul></li><li> Due to his na&iuml;vet&eacute;, Butters from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> can teeter anywhere from mildly oblivious and gullible to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a>. This happens especially in "Butters' Very Own Episode".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> considers <em>everyone</em> his friend, no matter how many times they tell him to his face that they hate him. The one exception is Plankton, but even then only sometimes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WanderOverYonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WanderOverYonder">Wander over Yonder</a></em> often has Wander taking this role, always being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">loving</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna">positive</a> character, even to his enemies (or friends, as Wander considers them), which sometimes just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">makes things worse</a>. In the end, however, he is usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCloudCuckoolanderWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCloudCuckoolanderWasRight">right all along</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">earns his happy ending</a>, perhaps due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Laser-Guided Karma</a>.
<ul><li> This is especially emphasized in Season 2, where Wander desperately attempts to redeem the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">omnicidal</a> Lord Dominator, despite everyone's warnings. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He even saves her life when her ship blows up in the season finale.</span> That said, this season also reveals that he's much more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">aware than he lets on</a>, and also potentially justifies this by revealing that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he has actually redeemed villains in the past by the same methods</span>.
