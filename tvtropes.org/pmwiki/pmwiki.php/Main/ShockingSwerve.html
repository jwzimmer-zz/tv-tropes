<ul><li> <strong>A proper shocking swerve needs to feel like a complete contrivance</strong>. It's often accompanied by poor reasoning as to how it works. However, the twist can still be a positive thing if the tone of the rest of the work fits with it, or if the work is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">So Bad, It's Good</a> to begin with. Either way, some element of humor, intentional or unintentional, is required to get the most out of this.
</li><li> <strong>Remember that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">Reality Is Unrealistic</a>.</strong> People meet with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">unexpected disasters</a> or positive changes all the time in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, but even a fairly realistic event can still come across as not making sense in terms of the plot.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Espada ranks were stated by a Fracci&oacute;n, Shawlong, to go from 1-10. However, it's eventually revealed that the Espada ranks actually go from 0-9. Yammy switches from 10 to 0 during his Resurrecci&oacute;n. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> clarified that Espada ranks are based on the amount of power, not the ability to use it. Yammy was never portrayed as especially competent, so the idea of his raw power not translating to combat effectiveness was foreshadowed well enough. However, the author's choice to reveal his secret "0" rank as a cliffhanger, only for him to be killed basically offscreen the next chapter, is the very definition of a pointless twist.
</li><li> In the Zanpakuto filler arc, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingWeapon">Muramasa</a> claims to have killed his master and that he wants to liberate all Zanpakutos from their owners. It transpires that he's using the zanpakutou rebellion to distract the shinigami so he can free his sealed master Kouga Kuchiki. The closest thing to a foreshadow is Byakuya's fake <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Face&#150;Heel Turn</a>, but that act doesn't foreshadow Kouga's existence, it only foreshadows Byakuya wanting Muramasa defeated.
</li></ul></li><li> Among the male idol community, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BProject">B-Project</a> Koudou*Ambitious</em> is pretty well known. What starts as a normal, if eccentric, idol anime ends with the B-Project's kindly manager, Yashamaru, revealing to the heroine that her father was one of the people that ruined his life, and that in revenge he's willing to take down the company his daughter now works at, scoop up B-Project, and make it big at another company after controversy forces the former company to shut down. Absolutely <em>none</em> of this was foreshadowed beforehand, but the only hints that something was wrong with Yashamaru were the scenes where he makes a secret deal with an off-screen higher up, and Episodes 10 and 11, where he suddenly vanishes and has his songs distributed to another group under a different label. But even then, that leads to more of a kidnapping and blackmail arc rather than industrial sabotage, and the heroine didn't seem like she was central to the conflict at all.
</li><li> The ending to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BunnyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BunnyDrop">Bunny Drop</a></em> manga is infamous for this. It turns out that Rin and Daikichi are not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodRelated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodRelated">niece and nephew. Daikichi's grandfather isn't Rin's biological father</a>. This isn't foreshadowed at all except for <em>possibly</em> how Rin is a blonde. This in itself related to the swerve of how as a teenager Rin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush">develops feelings for Daikichi, the man who raised her since age six</a>, which has little foreshadowing besides how Rin never considered Daikichi her adopted dad (and even that's pushing it on foreshadowing).
</li><li> For some viewers, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a> R2</em> Turn 21, where it's revealed that Marianne (who for most of the series had been painted as practically a saint) not only fully supports her husband's Instrumentality plan, but she's committed multiple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Kick the Dog</a> moments herself, including using her Geass to possess a young girl after her death, and not particularly caring about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> her daughter went through. And that's only <em>one</em> of the plot twists thrown into this episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWarsTheYoungHuntersLeapingThroughTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWarsTheYoungHuntersLeapingThroughTime">Digimon Xros Wars: The Young Hunters Leaping Through Time</a></em> has 2 in the finale. Ryouma's Digimon partner, who had previously barely talked at all and showed no personality turns out to be the big bad in disguise, brainwashing his tamer and an even "better" one where the previous generic evil <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is now a good guy, and a human with a clock Digimon (despite previously having nothing to do with time) wandering through dimensions collecting humans to beat up the new big bad he inadvertently created. WHAT A TWEEST!
<ul><li> In addition, people savvy enough to pick out symbolism relating to time will feel some ending whiplash. The vocal command to enter the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PocketDimension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PocketDimension">Pocket Dimension</a> is "Time Shift", the odd old guy who appears to be behind everything has a clock Digimon partner, and the whole season is called "The Young Hunters Leaping Through TIME". But it turns out, in the end, that this symbolism was all... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxSymbolism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxSymbolism">pointless</a>!
</li><li> One may argue that the swerve was that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">this series</a> actually had a continuous plot working up to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>...
</li></ul></li><li> Regina, Cure Ace and Cure Ace's identity in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DokiDokiPrecure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DokiDokiPrecure">DokiDoki! PreCure</a></em> can be seen as this. The anime goes to great lengths to have Mana and Regina bond, Regina becoming stronger through friendship. Fans even saw the clues that seem to point that something big would happen to Regina, most likely her performing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighHeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighHeelFaceTurn">High-Heel&#150;Face Turn</a> and join the team as another Cure. Come the halfway point... <em>DENIED.</em> Regina's father, King Jikochuu, brainwashes her even more, making her even <em>more</em> evil, Cure Ace shows up and ends up being a nine-year-old girl named Aguri Madoka that hadn't been alluded to <em>at all</em>.
<ul><li> Then it turns out that Aguri/Cure Ace, Ai-chan <em>and</em> Regina were originally Princess Marie-Ange all along.
</li></ul></li><li> Il Palazzo in the last episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga">Excel Saga</a></em> (ignoring the non-canon 26th episode) abandoning his dreams of conquest to fall down a hole with Excel. Given that it is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagSeries">Gag Series</a>, the lack of buildup works fine.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> has had more than a few, no thanks to Hiro Mashima's open lack of planning.
<ul><li> Mest Gryder is introduced in the Sirius Island arc as a member of Fairy Tail who the other members <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy">suddenly know</a> despite never appearing beforehand, and he's later revealed to be a Magic Council spy named Doranbalt who <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackstoryInfiltrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackstoryInfiltrator">infiltrated</a> Fairy Tail with a memory charm to get enough dirt to disband it. Much later, it turns out that he was, in fact, a Fairy Tail member named Mest who infiltrated the Magic Council to get info, and wiped his own memories to be a more covert spy, even though said memory wiping would also make him oblivious to the fact that he's supposed to be a spy in the first place. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> explains that the reveal was considered some time ago and nearly scrapped, thus leaving a lack of buildup when it was finally implemented.
</li><li> The conflict of the final arc suffers from this. The Alvarez Empire has allegedly always been a looming threat over Ishgal, yet was never mentioned at all beforehand. The Emperor, and consequently the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a>, is Zeref. Before this arc, he had been characterized as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAloner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAloner">The Aloner</a> because of a curse that takes life while he values it, as well as his bad reputation as the Black Wizard leading most of humanity to view him as an evil existence that must be destroyed, with some cultists doing terrible things in his name. Apparently, Zeref can still amass a great number of people without killing them by "not thinking of them as people", behavior that is not reflected in his blatant popularity among his subjects, and his angst over being rejected by "the world" was only an issue in Ishgal.
</li><li> Irene Belserion of the final arc's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">Spriggan 12</a> is frequently compared to Erza in appearance and magic power, and clearly has some strange interest in her, so the revelation that they are mother and daughter is hardly a surprise. The Shocking Swerve comes in when she then reveals that she is also the creator of Dragon Slayer Magic. She doesn't look like a Dragon Slayer, is never shown using the magic (her fighting style revolves around enchantment), her source dragon Belserion is suddenly thrown in as the catalyst for the Dragon King Festival (a war between human-liking and human-eating dragons in which the former side produced Dragon Slayers for backup), she passes under Acnologia's radar despite his goal of slaughtering the Dragon Slayers and ability to smell them all across the continent, and her backstory issues with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph">being stuck in dragon form</a> clash with the earlier revelation that Acnologia can switch back and forth when he wants. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> claims to have planned out the revelation, but surprisingly hadn't decided on the details of the much more obvious revelation of her being Erza's mother, and avoided bringing up her backstory in situations where it should have come up.
</li></ul></li><li> Gilgamesh's appearance and the possibility of his existence in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em> isn't foreshadowed in the slightest, at least in the anime.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SchoolDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SchoolDays">School Days</a></em>: (manga only) Kotonoha and Sekai abruptly going <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> in the last chapter with virtually no foreshadowing at all, just to shock the reader at the story having one of the game's few bad endings as opposed to the majority of happy endings. Note this occurs only in the manga; the anime does a much better job of building up Kotonoha and Sekai's gradually decreasing mental stability, making it much more of a genuine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistEnding">Twist Ending</a>.

What makes this even <em>more</em> jarring are those who watched <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiUniverse">Tenchi Universe</a></em> years ago and ran with how his mother there was.

Basically, every plot point after Acid Tokyo qualifies. <em>They even sneak a couple into the epilogue</em>.
<ul><li> Because of this, its sister series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/XxxHolic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/XxxHolic">Xxx Holic</a></em>, which is fine when left on its own, periodically suffers from it. One particularly notable instance is when events of Tsubasa reveal Watanuki, who was previously stated to be an orphan (which was pointed out explicitly by a skilled fortune teller), turns out to not only be the son of versions of Sakura and Syaoran that actually are still alive (said fortune teller almost too conveniently later comes back to retract her statement), but is also <em>an alternate version of Syaoran</em>, and technically wasn't even supposed to exist. He also apparently visited the wish shop once before to get himself mind wiped and can't remember a lot of things about himself, but didn't even notice that something was wrong with his memories until he was asked a particular question and he realized he couldn't answer. And none of this is even adequately explained in his own series.

<ul><li> The ending to the anime came off as this to many people, especially manga readers. It ends with Nitori accepting puberty and with many implications that both Takatsuki and Nitori will grow out of their gender dysphoria. This is in sharp contrast with the manga, where the same scenes are shown in a more negative light and the dysphoria just gets worse after her voice starts cracking.
</li><li> The manga ending too with Takatsuki not wanting to transition and deciding to continue living as a girl. While it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> fans saw the way Shimura wrote it, essentially randomly, go against everything we had been shown prior. There is some mild <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">foreshadowing</a> but it's more in the vain that Takatsuki was confused period.

This defies logic on a number of levels. First off Magneto had been seen still living in Genosha shortly before the time Xorn joined the team. Secondly, Xorn used healing powers which Magneto lacks. Finally, it was complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment">Character Derailment</a>; Morrison turned Magneto from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> holocaust survivor with a Malcolm X-like philosophy into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">A Nazi by Any Other Name</a> (though the alien mind control spores may have had something to do with that). The reason for this was apparently because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes">Broad Strokes</a> style he uses and did not see Magneto as anything other than "a mad old terrorist twat."

It's been said that Morrison was forced to make it Magneto by Marvel editorial. This fact and Morrison supposedly resenting it might account for a lot of the issues of the reveal. It's been said by people who apparently a) missed the unredacted version of Morrison's proposal being printed in one of the hardcover collected editions, where Xorn was pitched to Marvel as Magneto in disguise before the run even started, b) missed the many interviews after the fact where Morrison said it was always his plan, and c) missed the various subtle clues planted virtually from the first that Xorn was Magneto, as collated <a class="urllink" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!msg/rec.arts.comics.marvel.xbooks/ELmF0_KzNxM/aAgtgiyFIxMJ">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

<ul><li> There were more than a few Shocking Swerves in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga">The Clone Saga</a></em>. One issue, in particular, ended with the discovery of what seemed to be the corpse of the original clone, indicating that it was neither Ben nor Peter and raising the mystery of what the double's origin really was. It turned out that the writers didn't have a clue, they just thought it was a cool twist.
</li><li> A similar situation was with the "death" of Peter and MJ's baby. The issue where that happened ended with an associate of Norman Osborn &mdash; the perpetrator of the entire Clone Saga and whose resurrection was a shocking swerve in and of itself &mdash; taking a mysterious "parcel" and heading off on a boat to parts unknown. Savvy readers would have suspected that this would be the Parkers' child, whose death was faked. Turns out this wasn't the case. Although later revealed to be just a cat, the creators revealed that there was never any intention to have the Parkers' child survive and they just planned on endlessly teasing the fans with this with no plans of resolving the issue.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">body-swap</a> of Terra and the Ultra-Humanite in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/PowerGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/PowerGirl">Power Girl</a> ongoing series did not feature any foreshadowing or rational explanation, and actually seems to directly contradict previous established facts (In the issue before the reveal, Satanna actually comments that her sources are still looking for Humanite, and so far have not had any luck in locating him). The conflict itself was handled well and led into one of the best issues of the series, but the actual swap came completely out of nowhere and even Terra's half-explanation after she was rescued does not clear up all the points, since she refers to lengthy torture sessions and stays in a psychiatric hospital, even though the entire affair occurred in only a single day. Good idea, good follow through, but <em>horrible</em> lead-in.

We know it was random because in the author's note she outright admitted to writing the twist in on a whim, both to shock the audience and reintroduce some tension into Izuku's future fights. Up until that point, Izuku was as strong as Sanji would theoretically be at the end of <em>One Piece</em> and there was no foreshadowing whatsoever of such a mental block <em>ever</em> developing. Unfortunately for her, the decision was not well-recieved; Izuku being so overpowered was one of the draws of the story, and the twist itself was poorly written and seen as cheap. The backlash was bad enough that she had to backtrack and promise to end the subplot as soon as possible.

Her motive- anger over Miho rejecting her advances- is completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacter">Out of Character</a>, and it doesn't help that her actions end up dooming Oarai to closure (Yukari not only goes to school there, but her parents run a hair salon on the ship).

Except there's <em>nothing</em> in any of his sparse previous appearances that even <em>hint</em> towards this being a possibility, and the fact that he and Sera were explicitly set up as soulmates in his first appearance is ignored completely. Add in the fact that Sera was flirting with a different character who appeared in the arc before the reveal was made, and it becomes frustratingly obvious that the author only tacked this twist on because Sera's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfInsert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfInsert">real-life counterpart</a> no longer had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityCrush">Celebrity Crush</a> on Finn.

He's become some vaguely demonic entity, apparently summoned by the actions of the protagonists in the opening.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfGore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfGore">The Wizard of Gore</a></em> is in love with this trope. Montag's murder method seems to be mass hypnosis, but the film points out repeatedly that there are several events that contradict that. Combine that with an ending where not only do we have a scene where the two main characters lampshade how unlikely the events were before one shows themselves to be the killer in disguise, but then the other person in the conversation reveals that it was her manipulations the entire time, fooling the villain. And then the villain wakes up and realizes it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a>.
</li><li> The end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Pieces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Pieces">Pieces</a></em> has the mix and match corpse, that the killer made out of body parts from his victims, randomly come to life and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">rip a guy's balls off</a>.
</li><li> The killer in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighTension">High Tension</a></em> turns out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian">Marie's</a> evil split personality, manifested as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePigPen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePigPen">a filthy</a> trucker. Watch the film with this information in mind and realize how little sense it really makes.

The oft-mentioned Elevator Killer turns out to be none other than Merv Griffin. The only foreshadowing leading to this is a scene where a character watches his talk show on TV.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MNightShyamalan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MNightShyamalan">M.

In the movie's partial defense, this was a problem in the book as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PlanetOfTheApes2001" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PlanetOfTheApes2001">Planet of the Apes (2001)</a></em> ends with the hero returning to Earth in his own time, only to find that it is ruled by apes, and the Lincoln Memorial has been replaced with a statue of the movie's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> (who won't even be born until 3 thousand years in the future, on a completely different planet). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">The filmmakers have admitted</a> that they have no explanation for this, and that it was only done to be surprising. A possible interpretation is that he thinks he's gone back to earth, but in reality just made another hop forward, to where ape society looks a lot like the human society he came from. This might generate more and harder questions than it answers though. An alternative explanation offered by one of the film's actresses, which she had simply assumed was the official explanation, was that the Big Bad had gone back in time as well and had simply arrived at an earlier point than the protagonist. Reportedly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton">Tim Burton</a> had filmed six different endings, so that no one could spoil the ending. This one was used because it was closest to the end in the original book.
</li><li> In the 2005 Spanish horror film <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNun2005" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNun2005">The Nun</a></em>, it turns out there isn't a killer ghost nun, it was the main character's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality">Split Personality</a> all along. Under scrutiny, this makes even less sense than <em>Haute Tension's</em> similar twist.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeadSilence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeadSilence">Dead Silence</a></em>: You know, it would have been nice to state that also human dolls are to be considered. Or that they exist at all.
</li><li> The obscure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryCohen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryCohen">Larry Cohen</a> movie <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodToldMeTo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodToldMeTo">God Told Me To</a></em> sets itself up as a supernatural thriller, then becomes a sci-fi movie as the outer space origin of the movie's killer is revealed. Then the movie becomes a Shocking Swerve pileup as we find out the hero is related to the Evil Space Jesus villain and has the same alien powers he possesses. Oh, Evil Space Jesus is a hermaphrodite. Who wants to mate with the hero. His own brother. Via a <em>chest vagina</em>. It's a weird, <em>weird</em> movie...
</li><li> In the ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChristmasEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChristmasEvil">Christmas Evil</a></em>, the Santa Claus wannabe main character is driving a van after he knocks out his brother. Suddenly, a mob carrying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchesAndPitchforks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchesAndPitchforks">Torches and Pitchforks</a> appear before him, and he drives over a bridge... and the movie takes a sudden fantastic turn as the van keeps going, and flies into the night sky. According to the director, this is actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingDream">Dying Dream</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cut">Cut</a></em>, a group of students are being killed off while working on an unfinished slasher film rumored to be cursed. In the end, it turns out the killer is the one from the film itself. He's come to life through very poorly explained means involving "the creative energies put into the film" or some nonsense like that.
</li><li> Parodied at the end of the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScaryMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScaryMovie">Scary Movie</a></em>, where the killer is revealed to be the handicapped Doofy, who has already gotten away and is shown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheUsualSuspects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheUsualSuspects">taking off his disguise</a>, and is then picked up by his girlfriend and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins">drives off into the sunset</a>. Earlier in the film, the girlfriend had no idea that he was even the mastermind, but they're revealed to have been working together in the ending.
</li><li> Many villains in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpyKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpyKids">Spy Kids</a></em> films start off posing as good guys, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EtTuBrute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EtTuBrute">one particular backstab</a> in the second, that of Felix Gumm, comes out of pretty much nowhere and adds pretty much nothing to the plot; the role he plays post-heel turn could fairly easily have been filled by an ordinary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mook</a>. And in the third film, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack">he's back to the good side</a> with just as little explanation.

Only for Judy to reveal that she was the killer after all and promptly shoots Mark. The end.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidCronenberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidCronenberg">David Cronenberg</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a> movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EXistenZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EXistenZ">eXistenZ</a></em>, this trope is used in-universe. In the climax, the male protagonist is suddenly revealed as another secret agent who was sent to kill his female partner all along, even though this contradicts most of what's been shown of the character. It's soon revealed to be part of another layer of the VR game, and the programmed plot twists (extracted from the players' minds) were becoming increasingly random.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockNRollNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockNRollNightmare">Rock 'n' Roll Nightmare</a></em>, a rock band moves to a farmhouse and its members are killed one by one by the devil (yes, <em>the</em> devil). In the climax, the devil confronts John Triton, the sole remaining character, and starts gloating about killing his friends. Triton then reveals that he has killed no-one: his entourage were actually shadow puppets all this time, and Triton himself is an arc angel who has come to banish the devil back to hell.
</li><li> After about 40 minutes of barely audible, badly written, badly edited, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding">horrendously paced</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">confusing gibberish</a>, <em>A Certain Sacrifice</em>, a film only known because it stars a pre-fame <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madonna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madonna">Madonna</a>, turns into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAndRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAndRevenge">Rape and Revenge</a> movie out of nowhere. And that's before we get to <em>the Satanic sacrifice of the heroine's rapist</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HappyBirthdayToMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HappyBirthdayToMe">Happy Birthday to Me</a></em> has one of the most ridiculous endings of any slasher movie. At first, it's "revealed" that Virginia, the protagonist, was the killer all along, before, out of nowhere, her mask is pulled off, and it's revealed that Ann was the one doing the killings <em>disguised</em> as Virginia. Ann also reveals that she's Virginia's long lost half-sister. It only resulted in making the movie more confusing and convoluted than it already was. Indeed, Virginia <em>was</em> actually the killer in the original script, but the director thought it was too obvious, so he came up with the resulting ending on the spot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PaulBlartMallCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PaulBlartMallCop">Paul Blart: Mall Cop</a></em>: At the end of the movie, it turns out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadFriend">Kent, the SWAT commander</a>, was the mastermind behind the scheme with the robbery at the mall, with the previous apparent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> being his partner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Veck Sims</a>. This was after he seemed to have been doing nothing but <em>help</em> Paul rescue the hostages in the mall with little indication that he was the one behind it, making his double-crossing of Blart come right out of nowhere.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">original planned ending</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CatsEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CatsEye">Cat's Eye</a></em> was to reveal that General the cat was Evil All Along, and he suffocates Amanda by stealing her breath. This would have turned his entire arc into a nonsensical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog">Shoot the Shaggy Dog</a> story packed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> (He follows a telepathic plea for help halfway across the country and battles an evil troll to protect a little girl, just so he could kill the kid himself?). Thankfully, the ending didn't make it into the finished film.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Adaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Adaptation">Adaptation.</a></em> where the protagonist's twin writes a script called <em>The Three</em> in which it turns out the kidnapper, the victim, and the detective are all the same person. His brother points out how this doesn't make sense because &mdash; for example &mdash; there's a car chase where the detective is tailing the kidnapper who has the victim in the back seat... so if they're all one person what the hell is he doing in reality?? And yet there are still people in Hollywood who want to produce the movie. Hilariously, only a few years later Hollywood actually <em>did</em> make a film with that exact same twist- <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Identity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Identity">Identity</a></em>, which even takes the trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> by having <em>multiple</em> cops, killers, victims, and bystanders be alternate personalities of one another, and even the cop turns out to be a killer in disguise having killed the <em>actual</em> cop personality prior to the movie!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem">Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</a></em>: The film actually does a good job of setting up that Percival Graves, the magical equivalent of the Director of the FBI, is not only the film's human antagonist, but also a secret supporter of Gellert Grindelwald, a dark wizard who wants to subjugate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Muggles</a> for the greater good. Then the climax reveals that Graves was really Grindelwald in disguise all along! The twist was heavily criticized, mostly because Graves made an ideal nemesis for Newt and Tina, the film's heroes, whereas Grindelwald's fate has already been explained in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a></em>, but also because much of the subtle foreshadowing only becomes obvious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewatchBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewatchBonus">on repeated viewings</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShutIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShutIn">Shut In</a></em>:
<ul><li> The reveal that Stephen is not really paralyzed, as that would mean he was somehow able to fake catatonia for several months without being found out <em>at all</em> by his doctors.
</li><li> Also, the reveal that he had been drugging Mary the whole time, which caused her odd dreams, as he was able to somehow move around the house and drug her without being noticed <em>at all</em> by her.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Flightplan2005" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Flightplan2005">Flightplan (2005)</a></em> has a twist that seems clever at first reveal, but progressively makes less and less sense as it goes on. The film's plot is that an aeronautics engineer named Kyle and her daughter Julia head from Berlin to New York for the father David's funeral after he dies in an accident, and the daughter goes missing on the plane... and there's no evidence she was ever on board. At the film's ending, it's revealed everything was masterminded by the air marshal, working with one of the flight attendants. David was murdered, the marshal bribed the mortuary director to let him plant explosives in the casket, the flight attendant abducted Julia and erased all record of her being on board. The plot was to use the explosives to extort $50 million from the airline, and pin it all on Julia. This works until you consider a <em>lot</em> of mental gymnastics need to be exercised for this to work, especially since it would have all been derailed if a single person on board had remembered seeing the girl.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRapture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRapture">The Rapture</a></em>: Despite the title of the film, it's still a shock when the Rapture <em>actually happens</em>.

This actually hurt the film's chances at the box office, too.

Every previous scene had depicted him as a fanatical supporter of the First Order, and much of his hatred for Kylo Ren stemmed from them competing for power within it. But rather than building support within the First Order to overthrow the unstable tantrum-thrower who was the only surviving witness to the supposed murder of their leader by Rey, he decides to help the Resistance, even though he hates them, they're trying to destroy the cause he's dedicted his life to, and he lives on a First Order battleship they're trying to blow up.

</li><li> MYTH Conceptions suffers from this. Skeeve and his small band have declared war on the largest army in the dimension. The army's general, after suffering from some hit-and-run attacks from Skeeve n Co., erects a large tent in a neutral location to discuss the cessation of hostilities. After a bit of a chat, the sides of the tent are dropped, revealing that the entire army is outside, poised to strike the protagonists. They are rescued by a little blue gremlin (a creature Aahz had been insisting does not exist) for no reason whatsoever.

After the cancellation, the showrunners refused to go back and change the ending. <em>Peacekeeper Wars</em> is essentially what was intended as the fifth season condensed into three hours.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse">Dollhouse</a></em>, the reveal that Boyd Langton was the head of the Rossum Corporation, which turns the character into a lunatic with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette">stupidly impractical master plan</a> and, in retrospect, makes a lot of their earlier actions in the series unnecessary at best and nonsensical at worst.

Bashir's parents were once brought up in a conversation, and Bashir completely dodged it, a full season before his reveal established why he would hate his parents. This was the second time that happened to the character, as the two-parter 'In Purgatory's Shadow'/'By Inferno's Light' revealed that Bashir had been replaced by a changeling several episodes before. The actor didn't learn until he got the script for the two-parter.
</li><li> The third season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em> ends with the showdown over the Xindi weapon, which has been the plot the entire season.

In no way did anything in Season 3 hint, foreshadow, or subliminally convey that space Nazis were on the horizon, and it completely undercut what was otherwise a fairly satisfying season finale. The episode was written at a time when a fourth season was very much in doubt. Connor Trinneer (Trip) personally believes the writers deliberately did this to stick the network with negative blowback in case the show actually did get cancelled.

</li><li> Depending on the viewer, many twists, including several Cylon identity revelations in the later episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica</a></em> may fall under this trope.
<div class="indent">(from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a></em>) <br><strong>Seth Green:</strong> Wow! Ron Moore! Creator of <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>. How about letting us come aboard and help you with your whip-smart plots? <br><strong>Ron Moore:</strong> Help? Why would I need help writing plots? I just throw a dart at the cast list and <em>boom</em>: they're a Cylon. Rinse, repeat, cash the frakking check. Watch... <em>(Moore throws several darts at a board with cast member photos taped to it)</em>... <em>(mocking)</em> oh, please help me, this is so hard!
</div><ul><li> The identities of the Final Five Cylons, in particular, were pulled out of left field. One of the clearest indicators of this was that Chief Tyrol's baby had to be clumsily retconned into an adulterous offspring since there was only supposed to be one fertile Cylon in the series.
</li><li> This pops up as early as the pilot miniseries when some poor and seemingly random schmuck is pointed out by Baltar to be a Cylon in a panicked effort to avoid being outed as a collaborator himself. At the end of the episode he... turns out to have <em>actually</em> been a Cylon.
</li></ul></li><li> Not nearly as shocking as most of these swerves, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em>'s ADA Serena Southerlyn's coming out was pretty damn surprising. The only thing that vaguely and possibly hints at this was a few episodes earlier when McCoy, in order to get around a claim of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpousalPrivilege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpousalPrivilege">Spousal Privilege</a> on the part of a gay couple, files suit (and wins) to prevent the state from recognizing gay marriages. Southerlyn was uncharacteristically more upset than usual about McCoy's cynical tactics (as he doesn't indicate he personally is opposed to gay marriage) and outright refuses to assist him. This episode is somewhat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">Hilarious in Hindsight</a> if you watch it after having seen the reveal of Serena's sexuality since she makes quite a few references to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveThisFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveThisFriend">a gay friend she had in college</a>.

Turns out the other guy is innocent. They catch the criminal and he confesses. Elliot apologizes to the first guy and promises to get him out ASAP... then, the guest detective of the day may or may not have pushed the guy out the bathroom window and to his death. DA shrugs her shoulders and goes "There's nothing I can do". Episode ends.
</li><li> Perhaps the most infamous example involves a recurring character, FBI Agent Dana Lewis. The episode <em>Secrets Exhumed</em> is based on <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Sherri_Rasmussen">Stephanie Lazarus<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> a police officer who committed a love triangle murder in 1986 and wasn't caught for over <em>two decades</em>. It is revealed Lewis perpetrated a similar crime and used her FBI powers to cover her tracks. She attempts to pin the death on a serial killer to protect herself once and for all, only to have it fall apart when the SVU detectives realize the murder didn't fit the killer's MO and the confession was coerced. Lewis is ultimately caught and confesses. The decision to use a popular recurring character as the murderer, in effect killing her off, was <em>not</em> popular with the fan base.
</li></ul></li><li> The first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roswell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roswell">Roswell</a></em> introduced a character played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulieBenz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulieBenz">Julie Benz</a> as their new teacher. Liz becomes suspicious of her and suspects she's secretly a government agent looking for the aliens. Instead, she reveals that she's actually the school's new guidance counselor. Needless to say, this does nothing to explain why she was impersonating a teacher in the first place. She later gets involved in the plot for reasons resulting from her actual job.

Early in the show's run, the crew filmed the final scene of Ted's kids listening to the end of the story to avoid problems of them aging by the time the show actually ended, so the end of the story actually was planned right from the start. Unfortunately, this also meant they were inescapably locked into that ending even as each passing season made it less and less appropriate to the story. Thus, Ted runs off to be with Robin at his kids' urging, despite our having spent the past several years getting a thorough education in how wrong they are for each other. Not to mention Barney and Robin divorce with a 30-second explanation after the past 3 seasons have established them multiple times as soul mates.

Even if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that there are subtle clues in previous episodes, especially concerning how Ward got everyone to trust him, <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1s4p6');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1s4p6" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1s4p6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(he become Skye's SO, saved Simmons, went on a mission with Fitz, etc.)</span> not every viewer agreed that acting exactly like a protagonist constituted a hint. How poorly foreshadowed was the twist? Almost no-one believed it. Immediately after the reveal, the big debate between fans was whether Ward was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector">Fake Defector</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a>.

The convoluted-ness of the explanation for Zelena's return didn't help.
</li><li> Season 5 revealed that Hook became a second Dark One while in Camelot. So for all of Emma's talking about how everyone betrayed her and establishing her edging close to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> to become the Dark Swan, she inexplicably never did anything wrong at all - which contradicted about half her dialogue and motivations for the season.
</li><li> The mid-season finale threw this to ludicrous levels. Rumpelstiltskin reveals he is once again the Dark One after Hook sacrifices himself to destroy the curse for good. The explanation for this was even more convoluted - he found a potion that would somehow steal all the magic out of Excalibur around the same time Hook was destroying it. This literally undoes a whole half-season's worth of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> and was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">Ass Pull</a> of the highest degree.

Not only was this bleak twist rather abrupt and unexpected, but it also makes little sense that the cast end up in Hell.

<ul><li> The Season 6 finale ended with Sabrina turning to stone and shattering because her soul mates had left her. In the Season 7 premiere this is resolved by Aunt Zelda somehow giving up her adult years in exchange - essentially because Zelda's actress Beth Broderick had quit the show. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that the original way of getting around this was that both the aunts would give up their magic to save Sabrina.

Sabrina's planned ending was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Kill 'Em All</a> situation and trying to force a twist that wouldn't work (the villain deciding <em>not</em> to blow up the school for no reason) just results in the characters rejecting it.

</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow">Legends of Tomorrow</a></em> showrunners did this to themselves in season 4. The original plan was for Nate's father, Hank Heywood to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the season, torturing magical creatures to use as soldiers and swaying Nate to his side. However, the producers so loved the actor playing Hank that they couldn't go through with the idea of making him evil. Instead, it turned out Hank was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn">Unwitting Pawn</a> for the demon Neron who had a wild plan to unleash Hell on Earth.

In the span of just a few episodes, Hank went from a sinister figure on an evil plot to a goofy guy whose plan made little sense.

</li><li> In 1988, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BarryWindham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BarryWindham">Barry Windham</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LexLuger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LexLuger">Lex Luger</a>, two of the most popular wrestlers in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance">NWA</a> at the time, were embroiled in a feud with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheFourHorsemen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheFourHorsemen">The Four Horsemen</a> stemming from Lex being kicked out of the group and Barry turning down their offers to join them.

They were defending them in a rematch a month later. During the match, the Horsemen manager, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JamesJDillon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JamesJDillon">James J. Dillon</a>, rammed Luger's head into the steel post causing him to bleed and be knocked out for a few minutes. Barry was getting beaten in the ring looking to tag out but nobody was there and the Horsemen taunted him for it. When Lex finally dragged himself to the apron, Barry forced a tag and body slammed him into the ring and gave him a vicious clothesline that let the Horsemen easily regain the belts and led to Barry joining the group. Nobody saw this turn coming and led to Barry being one of the most hated villains (and also led to what many consider the best incarnation of the Four Horsemen as well, to the point that this incarnation featuring Windham was the one inducted into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWEHallOfFame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWEHallOfFame">WWE Hall of Fame</a>).
</li><li> Probably the most infamous shocking swerve in the WWF was the "Higher Power" twist. To make a <em>very</em> long story short: it was 1999, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a> had made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a>. His son, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShaneMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShaneMcMahon">Shane</a>, had seized control of Vince's stable, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheCorporation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheCorporation">The Corporation</a>, and merged it with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a>'s pseudo-satanic stable The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MinistryOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MinistryOfDarkness">Ministry of Darkness</a> to form the super stable The Corporate Ministry, which was slowly taking over Vince's company. This forced Vince to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">make peace with all the people he had pissed off over the last year</a>, most notably his arch-nemesis <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a>.

Rumors and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">Wild Mass Guessing</a> flew all over the place. Eventually, The Undertaker brought the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackCloak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackCloak">black-cloaked</a> Higher Power to the ring, who revealed himself to be... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackedByGanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackedByGanon">Vince McMahon</a>! His stated reason for going through with this impossibly-contrived <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette">Gambit Roulette</a>? To <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">piss off Austin</a></em>. In fairness to the bookers: this was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeForPlanB" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeForPlanB">Plan B</a>. The Higher Power was supposed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley">Mick Foley</a>, which would have made total sense and given us a good feud, but Foley didn't want to make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">heel turn</a> without any buildup to it, and also felt that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DentedIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DentedIron">he was too physically broken down at this point</a> to do a feud with Austin justice.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffHardy">Jeff Hardy</a> heel turn is already the most notorious of these swerves.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamoaJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamoaJoe">Samoa Joe</a> turned heel when he laid down in the 2009 King of the Mountain match at the last second for no reason. Despite the fact that he had been going after the Main Event Mafia for months, had fought like crazy up to that point, and was probably seconds away from becoming <em>World Heavyweight Champion</em>, it was all supposed to be a ruse. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">That sure makes sense.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting">Sting</a>'s Main Event Mafia heel turn made no sense, and fans didn't even boo him anyway, seemingly treating it as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity">Fanon Discontinuity</a> even as it was happening. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">So the whole thing was dropped, and Sting went back to being a face anyway.</a>
</li><li> The Tomko heel turn just about killed his career. All the momentum he'd built through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Christian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Christian">Christian</a>'s Coalition and then the brief "Tomko's for Tomko" phase was completely destroyed just to job him out under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a>'s thumb. It should probably also be noted that Tomko, instead of going on to do things in TNA, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.tmz.com/2011/10/11/former-wwe-wrestler-arrested-for-robbing-a-pharmacy-tyson-tomko-bloody-needle-marks-travis-cvs-oxycodon-chilis/#.T0nzQ4cge8A">did this.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>

In this case, though, people vastly preferred them as Bad Influence even if they admit the formation of the team made no sense.
</li></ul></li><li> TNA's 2010 <em>Victory Road</em> PPV had a special stipulation for the Knockouts match. It was already title vs career with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MadisonRayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MadisonRayne">Madison Rayne</a> defending against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AngelinaLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AngelinaLove">Angelina Love</a> respectively. However, the added stipulation was that if either of Madison Rayne's teammates (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VelvetSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VelvetSky">Velvet Sky</a> or Lacey Von Erich) interfered in the match, the title would go to Angelina. At the end of the match, some masked woman in a biker helmet drove into the arena and interfered, earning a disqualification. The referee tried to find out who it was briefly but then decided to award the title to Angelina. Read: <em>without checking the identity of the masked woman</em>. Furthermore once Madison had found out she lost her title she drove away with the mystery woman (read: the woman that just cost her the title). It was neither Velvet nor Lacey under the mask but actually, the returning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LisaMarieVaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LisaMarieVaron">Tara</a> which raises the question of why the hell did she wear a mask to interfere in the match when she could cause a disqualification without the title changing hands? Or why, when the title was given to Angelina, did she not take off the mask to reveal who she was and therefore get Madison her title back? There was literally no reason for her to keep her identity hidden (which she did for about a month) other than to have a dramatic reveal when it was fairly obvious who it already was. And that's not even wondering why Lacey and Velvet didn't reveal themselves right away at the PPV if Tara wasn't going to unmask.

What they were wrong about of course is that the angle wasn't even close to resolved when that finally did happen and in fact would end up being finished in an even more underwhelming way, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">off screen</a></em>.

Especially when it was more likely that whoever Laurinaitis's replacement was (especially if he was a face) would hire him back considering what an attraction he is to the company. The explanation for the turn didn't make much sense either though that was more to do with Laurinaitis messing up his lines (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MichaelCole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MichaelCole">Michael Cole</a> provided a more accurate explanation).
</li><li> The 2011 angle in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinNash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinNash">Kevin Nash</a> suddenly appeared after the main event of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SummerSlam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SummerSlam">SummerSlam</a></em> was decided and attacked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a> after he had won, allowing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AlbertoDelRio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AlbertoDelRio">Alberto Del Rio</a> to cash in his Money in the Bank briefcase to win the title. After Nash revealed someone had texted him to attack the winner, a decent mystery angle ensued for a short bit, as there was a whole host of potential suspects, including Del Rio, who won the title from the attack, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a>, who had been ousted from power a while earlier and had his own motives, and likely the most logical suspect, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnLaurinaitis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnLaurinaitis">John Laurinaitis</a>, who was not only a Vince McMahon loyalist and could easily have been looking to undermine the show now that Triple H was in charge, but had also been seen suspiciously sending text messages at the end of his backstage segments. At the end, who sent Kevin Nash the text? It was... Kevin Nash, who broke into Triple H's office and sent the text from Hunter's phone to his own to justify doing it. Why did he do it? "To make WWE cool again," and because he felt Triple H wasn't his friend anymore. Laurinaitis' texting apparently was not only not to anybody important, but he would continue doing it after Nash had revealed the truth.
</li><li> In early 2012, psychotic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane">Kane</a> suddenly starts stalking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EveTorres" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EveTorres">Eve Torres</a> and one episode of <em>Raw</em> ends with him implying to rape her backstage. Next week Eve passionately makes out with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> after he saves her from a rather conveniently staged attack from Kane, just as Cena's best friend and Eve's crush <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ZackRyder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ZackRyder">Zack Ryder</a> happens to wander by. You're guessing Kane set this all up right? Wrong, next week Kane disappeared from the storyline and Eve suddenly revealed she'd been playing Zack all along in an attempt to get attention for herself. No mention of what Kane's master plan for her was either. Fans have suggested that the storyline was meant to play out in a different direction with Kane possibly manipulating Eve (judging from her expression when she kissed Cena - she looked like she did not want to do it, and her seemingly genuinely upset when Zack was taken away in an ambulance later in the night) but Eve ended up getting an insane amount of heat when she kissed Cena so the writers likely changed tack and turned her heel to capitalise on it.
</li><li> Throughout 2014, the Puerto Rican version of the World Wrestling Council had been running an angle about Juan Manuel Ortega gathering together wrestlers and other industry figures for the purpose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfDoom">ridding pro wrestling of the Col&oacute;n family</a>. Another angle involved a trio who called themselves La Revoluci&oacute;n trying to eliminate the three top contenders for WWC's Universal Title, Ray Gonz&aacute;lez, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CarlitoColon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CarlitoColon">Carlito Col&oacute;n</a> and the Juan Manuel Ortega managed Mighty Ursus. Then in mid-2015, the most unexpected thing happened. Carlito, Revoluci&oacute;n and Ortega joined forces against Ursus and Gonz&aacute;lez, Revoluci&oacute;n seemingly not caring Carlito was still a top title contender and Ortega taking so much pleasure in betraying his partner he forgot about his grudge against the family.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AndradeCienAlmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AndradeCienAlmas">Andrade "Cien" Almas</a> was signed to WWE in early 2016. Upon debuting, while many considered him to be an incredible talent, few would expect him to be in a feud anywhere above the mid-card. Flash-forward to summer 2017 and he had associated himself with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheaTrinidad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheaTrinidad">Zelina Vega</a>, a well-respected veteran with pretty great mic skills, who would eventually become his manager. Though Almas' character had largely improved, absolutely <em>no one</em> expected him to become NXT Champion at TakeOver: WarGames. Even the commentators seemed legitimately shocked that he had won.

<ul><li> Another kind of twist that wasn't a kind of reveal was the ending to the serial <em>Brothers in Arms</em>. It has been a quite straightforward tale of two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> mortal enemies with a shared past clashing again and again during their ventures and was set up to end in a spectacular final confrontation between the two. Then, <em>literally</em> right when they were about to hit each other, a random dimension-portal opened up between them, teleporting them to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarroWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarroWorld">Bizarro World</a>, and thus ending the serial with no final fight.

It turns out that the entire universe is <em>a video game</em> being played by extra-dimensional beings. The party discovers this by jumping through a portal into "4D Space" and coming out of a high tech television screen. Not only was this a shocking swerve for the game, but it was also a <em>retroactive</em> shocking swerve for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOcean1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOcean1">Star Ocean</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTheSecondStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTheSecondStory">Star Ocean: The Second Story</a></em> as well, and fans did <em>not</em> like it.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em>:
<ul><li> The truth behind Liquid Snake's possession of Revolver Ocelot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots">Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</a></em> succeeded in pissing off some fans of the series. Basically, it turns out at the end that you were never fighting Liquid and that Ocelot was using a combination of drugs, nanomachines, and hypnotherapy to make himself think he was Liquid for his most complex <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette">Gambit Roulette</a> to date. However, this not only cheapens Liquid's character but effectively and retroactively turns the <em>final boss fight</em> into a big pile of... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak">meaninglessness...</a> by destroying all the previous epicness it portrayed, turning it into something completely impersonal and rendering the victory hollow. Knowing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator">Hideo Kojima</a>, this was probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntendedAudienceReaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntendedAudienceReaction">completely intentional</a>, but still, annoying. It's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot">waste</a> of what could have been pure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a>, in that an actual possession would've made much more sense. Why? Ocelot is <em>The Sorrow</em>'s son, a famous (and genuine) telepath. It stretches suspension of disbelief much less to think that Ocelot inherited some of his father's ability and that it unintentionally let Liquid take control.
<ul><li> Somewhat mitigated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> confirmation later that Liquid was still in fact possessing Ocelot during the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</a></em>, and that Ocelot only removed the arm to replace it with a decoy before the events of <em>Metal Gear Solid 4</em>, confirming why Ocelot spoke with Liqui'&#146;s voice during his possession in <em>2</em> but not <em>4</em> and why his arm was now metal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShirtlessScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShirtlessScene">when he took off his coat</a> during the final boss fight of <em>4</em> after clearly having an organic arm replacement when rolling up his sleeve at a few points in <em>2</em>. This also confirmed in the process that Ocelot inheriting his father's spiritual medium abilities and unintentionally using them to revive Liquid did still happen, just not for as long as he acted like it did, therefore avoiding a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retcon</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator">for once</a>). The rivalry also did remain deeply personal even with Ocelot in Liquid's place, when taking Ocelot's history with Big Boss into account and Snake being Big Boss's clone. Hence why the health bars evolve from "Solid Snake vs. Liquid" to "Naked Snake vs. Ocelot" to encapsulate the two series-spanning rivalries, even if neither Big Boss nor Liquid were actually there for it. Still a shocking swerve to pull the twist at all, but the effort to make it still fit in with the established lore makes it more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">downplayed</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Pok&eacute;mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire</a></em> reveal the origins of Mr. Bonding, a man from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Pok&eacute;mon X and Y</a></em> who went around giving people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocializationBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocializationBonus">Socialization Bonus</a> powers, but was basically an extra. It's revealed that he was a man who felt powerless after being forced to fire people from the Mauville Corporation. The five Pok&eacute;monCenter men (extras from the original <em>Ruby and Sapphire</em> games) fuse with the man and give him their power, and he uses it to share with people around the world. To put this already bizarre plot twist in perspective: fusion between people has never been established as part of the franchise's canon at any point, nor is the fusion ever explained at any point.
</li><li> You can do this to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a> movies your character appears in during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2">Pok&eacute;mon Black 2 and White 2</a></em>: While in the filming studio, strongly deviating from the suggested script creates the Strange ending. Some of these are fairly straightforward, but most end in something weird happening out of nowhere. For example, in <em>Brycen-Man</em> the titular villain just gives up, in the last <em>Red Fog of Terror</em> you are revealed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong">Evil All Along</a> and two of the <em>Timegate Traveller</em> films can end with the hero being captured and enslaved at the end.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yuri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yuri">yuri</a> visual novel <em>Princesses's Maid</em>, the Tatiana ending is this. Tatiana wants to be with you, but running away from her arranged marriage to a prince would be political suicide, and endanger her kingdom. Immediately after this, her sister Martha comes in and says that they won't have to worry about it... because she set the prince's room and board on fire. She framed Tatiana so she'd have no choice but to run away with the player character and have a "happy" ending.
<ul><li> Olivia's ending is also this, and it's an intentional swerve: the protagonist (Epponnie) reveals that they are an impostor: the real Epponnie sacrificed herself to seal an evil queen inside her body. The protagonist is that evil queen. She decides to conquer the world (off-screen) and end the game with a harem ending. Olivia is rightly confused by the turn of events.
</li></ul></li><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheTestamentOfSherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheTestamentOfSherlockHolmes">The Testament of Sherlock Holmes</a></em> it turns out that one of the girls who are reading the story, and who's supposedly the granddaughter of Holmes, is actually the granddaughter (or possibly grand-granddaughter) of James Moriarty. Her mother was adopted by Sherlock Holmes when Moriarty died. While this isn't a bad twist per se, it still feels like a twist for the sake of a twist, quite disconnected from the rest of the story and which serves no purpose.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlyCooperThievesInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlyCooperThievesInTime">Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time</a></em>, the reveal of Penelope's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Face&#150;Heel Turn</a> comes out of nowhere nor fits what's been established. She wanted to eliminate Sly Cooper for holding her genius boyfriend Bentley back, it being implied <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong">she only "loved" Bentley out of using him</a> for making billions in weapon deigns and/or world domination. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sly3HonorAmongThieves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sly3HonorAmongThieves">previous game</a> portrayed Penelope as a straight-up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl">Nice Girl</a> even compared to the other thieves Sly teamed up with, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault">guilt-ridden</a> when Murray was captured due to her plan, and despite seeing Bentley's genius only showed feeling toward him after he rescued her well afterwards. Even in this game Sly had retired by this point and thus wouldn't be holing them back, in fact Penelope's actions force Sly to un-retire thus would the opposite effect of what she supposedly wanted. While there was foreshadowing such as her disappearance prior to the beginning of the game and the mouse emblem thought the level where the twist is revealed, nothing hinted she's angry and bitter at the Cooper gang instead of being held against her will and forced to assist Le Paradox.
</li><li> Surprise!! The Dragon, the final boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WonderBoyInMonsterLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WonderBoyInMonsterLand">Wonder Boy in Monster Land</a></em>, is actually a robot. Possibly from space.
</li><li> In the 37th Pacific Bay case of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CriminalCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CriminalCase">Criminal Case</a></em>, we see Holly Hopper, the apparent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cult">Utopian leader</a> commit suicide to escape arrest. In the next case, it was revealed that the suicide was faked after all and that Holly was alive enough to become suspect again in Case 38. Not all fans were pleased with this development.
</li><li> At the various endings of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeavyRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeavyRain">Heavy Rain</a></em> the killer is revealed to be one of the player characters, the private detective. The problem is that the game allows listening to the characters' thoughts as part of the mechanics, and the detective's thoughts make it look as though he isn't aware of things that the killer would know. Further, it renders a previous plot point (Ethan's strange visions of things only the killer would know) completely inexplicable. According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> the odd nature of the twist is partly the result of story changes late in production when it was too late for complete rewrites; the game originally had supernatural elements and a psychic connection formed between Shelby and Ethan would've explained the visions.
</li><li> The ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DrawnToLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DrawnToLife">Drawn to Life</a>: The Next Chapter</em> was received as badly as it was for this reason and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenDownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenDownerEnding">several</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog">others</a>. None of the Raposa, the mannequin characters, or even the <em>player avatar</em> even exist. The entire game is the dream of the minor character Mike, who fell into a coma after a car accident that killed his parents and burned half of his sister Heather's face, hence why half of Raposa Heather's face is dark. Very little of this was foreshadowed beforehand, and what <em>was</em> foreshadowed was done so rather poorly: Mike was nowhere to be seen in the first game, and the entire reveal makes little sense given the events thereof. The whole gist of the series is that <em>you</em> are the Creator, and then this random kid whose existence was never even alluded to shows up out of nowhere and, by the end of the game, retroactively usurps your title.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fire Emblem Fates</a></em> has a few cases.
<ul><li> Chapter 25 of the Birthright route, "Traitor Revealed". It turns out there's been a traitor within your group the whole time; this fact <em>has</em> been foreshadowed by Iago. However, the traitor turns out to be Takumi, with Iago having been secretly controlling them this whole time. However, this makes no sense for a number of reasons:
<ul><li> Azura already "cured" Takumi of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">Demonic Possession</a> earlier in the game, and there were no hints whatsoever that this curing wasn't complete.
</li><li> Other routes reveal that the one responsible for Takumi's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">Demonic Possession</a> is definitely not Iago, nor does Iago have any connections to them. Iago has also never shown any hints of having brainwashing powers anywhere earlier in the game.
</li><li> The brainwashed character has been <em>playable</em> and under your control ever since they joined the army, meaning that if the player has been making an effort to use them, they're doing the exact opposite of what a brainwashed traitor would do: they've done nothing but help you.
</li><li> And finally, this twist doesn't make a difference to anything in the end, as said traitor is immediately de-brainwashed via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a> without a fight, and the brainwashing plays no further role in the chapter, or indeed the rest of the game.
</li><li> While it <em>is</em> mentioned that Iago had been getting new powers from Garon, whom the third route reveals does have a connection to the one responsible for Takumi's possession. However, this is done briefly enough that many fans were still left baffled by it.
</li></ul></li><li> The most controversial one by far is a late-game reveal on the Revelation route: it turns out Mikoto and Arete were sisters, making Corrin and Azura cousins. Not only did this annoy shippers due to pulling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseIncest">Surprise Incest</a> on them out of nowhere, but this reveal has no impact on the plot and is never mentioned again. It also means Mikoto was actually from Valla, not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wutai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wutai">Hoshido, despite having a Japanese-inspired name, looking somewhat Japanese, and acting like a</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YamatoNadeshiko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YamatoNadeshiko">Yamato Nadeshiko</a>.

Not only is the first time that time travel is ever mentioned by the story (apart from a non-canon Story Event for Japan's 3rd anniversary and as flavor text on a Global-exclusive unit), but Akstar shares very little with Rain in terms of battle style or character quirks, sharing more in common with Lasswell. Not only that, but Rain is a Lethal Chef while Akstar is a Supreme Chef and Rain was shown to be unable to use the transformation magic that his older self eventually makes use of in order to don this disguise. The Japanese fanbase was not pleased by this twist and many fan artists deleted their <em>Brave Exvius</em> art off of their social media profiles as a result of this chapter.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanTheTelltaleSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanTheTelltaleSeries">Batman: The Telltale Series</a></em> has one that <em>might</em> be one of these, depending on your choices.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FiveNightsAtFreddysSisterLocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FiveNightsAtFreddysSisterLocation">Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location</a></em>'s Custom Night has plot twists with little to no foreshadowing beforehand, and these (might) affect much of the entire franchise's pre-established lore much like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVThePhantomPain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVThePhantomPain">Metal Gear Solid V</a></em> above. The only concrete one is the player being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">Greater-Scope Villain</a>'s son (something not established until the very end of the game). The "might" comes in from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation">what's implied through a vague and open-ended final cutscene</a>; namely, the protagonist may or may not go on to become Springtrap following the game's events, and not his father as seen <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FiveNightsAtFreddys3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FiveNightsAtFreddys3">Five Nights at Freddy's 3</a></em>.

The fate of the son is not explicitly revealed, but it's implied you're playing as him and he dies in the fire that was set to destroy the remaining animatronics.

Played much straighter, however, with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ryder's betrayal, as in spite of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">attitude</a> in the game, there are no hints or even foreshadowing of him becoming a traitor, as he even constantly shows genuine dedication to the Grove Street Families in the beginning of the game, yet his betrayal just comes out of nowhere without any explanation, which isn't even helped by the fact that he is almost completely ignored on the subject of Smoke's betrayal</span>.
</li><li> A bizarre example happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SuperDanganRonpa2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SuperDanganRonpa2">Super Danganronpa 2</a></em>. During the final chapter, it's revealed that protagonist Hajime Hinata is actually Izuru Kamukura, one of the two main antagonists in the game. The game makes zero effort to foreshadow this or even let players know that the character exists. Instead, it was foreshadowed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DanganRonpaZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DanganRonpaZero">Danganronpa Zero</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">which was not released for Western audiences</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaV3KillingHarmony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaV3KillingHarmony">Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony</a></em>: For some players, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyProtagonist">Kaede Akamatsu</a> being the culprit of the first chapter counts. The twist <em>is</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">foreshadowed</a> to some extent, albeit in ways that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewatchBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewatchBonus">become clearer on a second playthrough</a>, but many players were completely caught off guard by this twist, considering that Kaede is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a>, and most wouldn't expect that she'd commit a murder right under their noses while they were controlling her actions and hearing her thoughts.

This comes completely out of thin air and makes no sense. It's presumably made by the Sardini Company, but they just were scared out of their house for the fourth time and Vito does not seem to have any supernatural powers. Doubles up with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">Ass Pull</a>.

This game is a parody of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpecOpsTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpecOpsTheLine">Spec Ops: The Line</a></em>, which is notably <em>not</em> this trope if you paid attention.

In it, you succeed in battling the leader of the Eden's Gate cult, Joseph Seed, and place him under arrest. Then, with no warning, a nuke detonates as you're leading him away, eventually resulting in you and Joseph stuck in a bunker as he begins to brainwash you, with the nuke having presumably killed everyone else and rendered everything you did completely pointless. While there is some foreshadowing of this ending, it comes primarily in the form of brief in-game radio broadcasts, which considering all the chaos going on around you at any given moment are easy to miss, and even then a player might not connect the dots.
</li><li> The true ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising3">Dead Rising 3</a></em> has the revelation that Isabela Keyes has pulled a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Face&#150;Heel Turn</a> and is so obsessed with finding the immune Nick Ramos that she started the outbreak and killed thousands purely to flush him out. The biggest trouble is this comes in the form of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveRant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveRant">Motive Rant</a> recorded on a laptop in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostCreditsScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostCreditsScene">Post Credits Scene</a> that comes right out of nowhere, adds absolutely nothing to the plot, and doesn't even remotely change the events of the game, and that it comes at the price of completely negating the genuine heroism she displayed across three prior games by turning her into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Karma Houdini</a> who did a backflip over the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Fans were pretty torn about it.</a>

The question is, why did this character do all of these things? At what point did they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">go rogue</a>, assuming they weren't just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong">Evil All Along</a>? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenSequelHeelSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenSequelHeelSyndrome">None of these questions are answered by current canon.</a> <em>Time Crisis 1</em>, <em>3</em>, and <em>4</em> as well as spinoffs <em>Crisis Zone</em> and <em>Razing Storm</em> have side modes in their respective console ports that add more to the series' lore, so it's possible that if there is ever a port of <em>Time Crisis 5</em>, these plot threads will be resolved.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThimbleweedPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThimbleweedPark">Thimbleweed Park</a></em>, when the characters finally confront the main antagonist, he reveals that they are all just characters in a video game, and the only way to stop everyone from meaninglessly living the same scenes over and over again after a reboot is by turning off the video game in an alpha build. Then after you do that, the game is rebooted anyway, and the game restarts from the beginning.

This may be a silly swerve in keeping with the game's wacky theme, but it doesn't make a lick of sense. It might have to do with Ron Gilbert not planning on another sequel. But another one was eventually made (without him) and it just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">handwaved</a> this bizarre ending.

Not only that, but Bernadette had, before the series started, been involved with a minor character whose only role on camera was to be killed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a>, and left <em>her</em> for infidelity.

<ul><li> What may be one of the biggest examples: the episode "What the Hell Happened to Mega64?" starts with one of Dr. Poque's college friends coming to see him. In the first five minutes, they're taken hostage by a Mafia and the friend is killed, complete with blood splattering. The rest of the episode has Rocko, Derek, and Shawn trying to rescue him. The episode ends with them learning the friend was the head of the Mafia. It's never really explained why he wants to kill Dr. Poque, why the Mafia were selling plush parrots, or how the friend is even alive. It gets even weirder when the friend is shot in the back by a guy wearing a sombrero, who then warps out. The creators said that it was a twist for the sake of a twist, and even the characters question it.

<ul><li> "Next of Pin": In fear of losing Steve who is about to win a final bowling match which will make him a pro bowler and have him move away from his family, Stan <strong>STABS</strong> him in the ankle not only costing him the match but also severely injuring him as well. Not helping is the fact that when Steve finds out he was the one to stab him and questions why, Stan's only response is "I don't know!"
</li><li> "Death by Dinner Party": At the end of the episode, it's revealed that all the murders that happened throughout were all staged by the rest of the cast as a way to get back at Roger for acting like a childish jerk. The twist in question though is contradicted by several scenes earlier in the episode where the other characters are shown to be scared over the thought that they could be the next ones to die when they have no reason to act this way since Roger isn't present for any of them.

Rewatching the episode with this knowledge raises a million questions, but, of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">that's the joke</a>.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Chief Wiggum:</strong> So, wait a minute, wait a minute... You tied up the judicial system, costing the city millions of dollars just for a TV show?
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Carmen Electra:</strong> Yes!
</div></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>:
<ul><li> In a three-part arc the mystery of Kenny's ability to die endlessly was explained. The boys had been playing superheroes, with one of the children playing the laughable "Mint-Berry Crunch," a half-man, half-berry. Everything built up to a confrontation between Kenny and Cthulhu. Then, out of nowhere, Mint-Berry Crunch turns out to be an actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">superhero sent to earth as a protector</a>, and he literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu">punches out Cthulhu</a>. Kenny is as incredulous as the audience during this reveal.
</li><li> The Critters from "Woodland Critter Christmas" start out as a regular parody of saccharine, insipid Christmas specials... until we find out that they are devoted followers of Satan, hellbent on bringing about the advent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAntiChrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAntiChrist">The Anti-Christ</a>. One moment they are happy and cheerful, the very next they're sacrificing a disturbingly willing Rabbitty and having an orgy with his corpse (and they're <em>still</em> happy and cheerful). Justified because it's a story written by Cartman.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil">Star vs. the Forces of Evil</a></em> has Moon's betrayal. Previously, while she'd been distrustful of Eclipsa, she decided to mind her own business, refusing to help Mina dethrone Eclipsa, but also deciding not to warn her and leave her to deal with Mina by herself. However, it's later revealed that Moon changed her mind and sided with Mina and the Magic High Commission, and it was actually her idea to have Globgor released from his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalPrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalPrison">Crystal Prison</a> during Eclipsa's coronation, making her appearance in that episode make little sense in hindsight. If Moon had briefly considered accepting Mina's offer to join her, or if her behaviour at the coronation had been slightly off, the plot twist of her betrayal would have made more sense.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TangledTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TangledTheSeries">Tangled: The Series</a></em>:
<ul><li> Varian's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Face&#150;Heel Turn</a> is very much seen as this. While turning the character into a full-fledged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds</a> based on how accidentally destructive they already were makes some amount of sense, the reasoning behind their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass">self-aware turn to evil</a> and committing of treason comes from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> of <em>no one</em> apparently following up on him asking for help in saving his father, especially since his father was the head of a village regularly frequented by the nation's princess, and the man was a respected figure between "Queen for a Day" and "The Quest for Varian" in his own right. Depending on the viewer, it was either a gut punch or a completely asinine turn of events. Or both.
</li><li> <em>Cassandra's</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Face&#150;Heel Turn</a> is an even bigger one, as despite her anger at Rapunzel for what happened to her hand, she had resisted becoming like Varian and betraying her... only for something mysterious to happen to her inside of a magical mansion, prompting her to betray Rapunzel anyway. A good amount of fans felt this ruined the character and invalidated the various lessons/morals of numerous past episodes in the name of the show's popularizing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome">Cerebus Syndrome</a>, while others were left as confused and dumbfounded as were by the previously mentioned swerve. The fact that this also served as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger">Cliffhanger</a> for the second season doesn't help either.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em> is notorious for its usage of Shocking Swerves, usually for the sake of justifying a character's elimination:
<ul><li> <em>World Tour</em>:
<ul><li> Gwen's elimination in "Picnic at Hanging Dork" is the result of her allergy to eucalyptus. Not only was her allergy never once foreshadowed (not even in <em><strong>this very episode</strong></em>), but the episode kept hinting that it'd be Courtney who'd be eliminated.
</li><li> Both endings of the finale are one of these, what with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheReturnOfTheKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheReturnOfTheKing">feral Ezekiel stealing and destroying the money</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Alejandro being severely injured to the point of being forced inside the Drama Machine</a>. In other words, the whole season was invalidated for the sake of movie references that even by 2010 (when <em>World Tour</em> originally aired) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionalPeriodPiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionalPeriodPiece">were already overdone and outdated</a>. The ending where Alejandro wins actually manages to one-up this. In his ending, he ends up winning because Heather accidentally throws his dummy into the volcano, but the money is still destroyed and he still ends up severely injured and put in the Drama Machine.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub">Winx Club</a></em>, season 2: One of the teachers, Professor Avalon, turns out to be an evil clone. It's a legitimate twist in the original... but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubInducedPlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubInducedPlotHole">not so much in the 4Kids dub, where the spell that was shot at the teacher in an earlier episode was changed to a Sphere of Truth spell, which should have revealed this</a>.
