</li><li> One memorable episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> had Conan cornering the killer-of-the-week in a parking lot and spouting off the details of the crime. The killer is at first taken aback at being found out, but calmly confesses to the murder when he realizes the police would never believe anything a little kid like Conan says. Conan admits this to be true &mdash; which is why he taped the whole conversation.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> had one during the Enies Lobby arc where Spandam, after accidentally activating the Buster Call, is gloating to Nico Robin about his future plans and how all the Marines under him are sheep. The kicker to this is that HE was the one who left the radio on for all to hear. Then he weakly tries to cover it up by trying to imitate Luffy when he finally notices this. No one is fooled, of course. This is an odd case, though, in that Spandam's speech serves no purpose to the plot, except perhaps to make the readers (or watchers) dislike him even more; when the transmission is finally cut, the only thing that matters to the ones who heard it is that the Buster Call is coming.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OuranHighSchoolHostClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OuranHighSchoolHostClub">Ouran High School Host Club</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the school's newspaper editor tries to engineer the downfall of the Host Club, only to have his plans thwarted by a recording machine disguised as a first aid kit which Kyouya placed into the newspaper room</span>.

Goto also agrees with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Arakawa&#146;s</span> observations on the reality of peace, war, and political leaders exploit chaos instead of using a measured response.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PeachGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PeachGirl">Peach Girl</a></em> evil mastermind Sae is tricked by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kairi</span> into expounding on her patented <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit">Wounded Gazelle Gambit</a> routine</span>, and how she has repeatedly made Momo look like a monster before the class.

Kit's suspicions have been risen when Victor shoots Kwan after Kit has defeated the latter in hand-to-hand combat . While paying respects to the childhood friend's father's grave, his suspicions were proven correct, but Kit was smart enough to have Victor's confession recorded on an audio tape before arresting him.

It takes him a while to turn around and see what's being displayed, and unsurprisingly the crowd he's addressing riots as the global uprising begins.
<div class="indent"><strong>Speaker:</strong> ADVENT peacekeeping forces are traveling across the world carrying the greatest gift from the elders. <em>(Scenes of refugee camps being attacked and people slaughtered in brutal crackdown attacks.)</em> A revolutionary gene therapy, yes. But so much more. <em>(Footage of humans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanResources" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanResources">being processed into green slurry</a>, packaged into cryopods and experimented on, pools filled with corpses and hordes of hybrid ADVENT clone soldiers being mass-produced.)</em> This is an end to disease. To decay. To pain. The beginnings of a new tomorrow. Available to all of us. Today. Truly humanity finally takes its rightful place among the stars. <em>(The Speaker finally notices the crowd's growing distress and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">turns around to look at the screens</a>, shortly before they rush the stage.)</em>

Superman knows that the Prankster has committed two counts of disturbing the peace but can't legally prove it (no witnesses or other evidence). He pulls multiple pranks on the Prankster and gets him so angry that he confesses to the crimes, after which Superman pulls out a microphone and tape recorder that he used to get the confession <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaughtOnTape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaughtOnTape">Caught on Tape</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em>:
<ul><li> In one of the earlier episodes, when Tommy's clown lamp mysteriously breaks, the Rugrats hold a faux court trial to see who was the one who broke the lamp, with Angelica as the prosecutor. As the episode culminates, it's revealed that Angelica was the culprit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotTheThread" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotTheThread">after the babies realize that Angelica was supposed to be taking a nap when the lamp broke in the first place, yet SOMEHOW knew what all the babies were doing at the same time</a>. In her usual demeanor, Angelica gloats about the whole thing being her doing and that the babies couldn't do anything about since they're babies. Unfortunately for her, Didi and Betty were in the other room, listening the whole time...
</li><li> Angelica Pickles, due to not liking Chinese food and wanting other things, used a prototype voice changer that her uncle invented to get several things, such as sweets, a Cynthia dollhouse (that her father promised to get if she was well behaved), and a faux surprise party for her. When Tommy's parents came home, they were about to take away the grampa's teeth (as they threatened to do so if he didn't supervise the kids), Angelica attempts to quell it, with Tommy activating the voice changer and placing it right near her mouth while she is speaking, causing them to realize just how Angelica managed to trick them big time. Needless to say, she has to eat the stuff she ordered as her punishment, and her uncle puts away the voice changer in a dark cupboard, stating that some things were better off not being invented.
</li><li> In another episode, Angelica, while backstage at her favorite kids show, was nominated as one of the new on-stage kids, and she and the other nominees listened in on the show host's conversation with her second-in-command, about her audience, and she overheard her say the secret word, and was the only one who actually heard it. She then won, and she also thought she won due to hearing the secret word (which is implied to be a very, very dirty cussword, due to various placements of cutoffs with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundEffectBleep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundEffectBleep">a person honking his horn or someone jackhammering, or in the case of her repeating the word to her mom, a very loud anguished scream being heard in the distance</a>), her parents, after initially grounding her, eventually allow her to go to the backstage showing of the show, under the condition that she not say the word. In her usual manners, she manages to trick the show hostess by making her lose control of her temper to utter that exact swear word <em>on the air</em>, to the shock of all watching, and Angelica then states that she proved that she did actually say it. The show hostess was later fired, and replaced with her second in command.

</li><li> In the thirteenth season premiere of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>, Kyle turns on the microphone backstage at a Jonas Brothers concert, causing a live world-broadcast of the confession of a long-term plan to exploit the purported myopia of devout Christians by secretly selling sex to girls under the guise of good, clean, family-friendly entertainment. And just for that extra <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> kick, the person he engineers this confession from is <em>Mickey Mouse</em>, who Cartman ends up exposing to the audience by pressing the curtain controls to raise the stage curtains. Didn't quite work, as Mickey was so powerfully homicidal that the world just knuckled under to him, waiting until his rage was spent and he went back to Valhalla to slumber and feed.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StaticShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StaticShock">Static Shock</a></em> episode "Replay" had the titular villain use an energy duplicate of Static to frame the hero for various crimes. His scheme is exposed when Richie films and broadcasts the villain gloating about his plan while Static fought his energy duplicate.

Subverted in that the detective didn't actually confess to the murder at that point. He <em>did</em> throw nosy Lois over the stair railing -several stories up.

</li><li> Done twice in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures">Tiny Toon Adventures</a></em>:
<ul><li> First at the end of "Citizen Max" where Babs makes Max confess on camera (that's simultaneously being broadcast in front of the audience he's about to speak to) that he framed Buster to make it look like he stole the test answers.
</li><li> Again in "Son of the Wacko World of Sports" where Buster films Bicycle Bob reading cue cards to make him admit his products are a ripoff. After he orders Buster to destroy the film, Buster responds it's <em>live.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> Variation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">Starscream</a> tells the Autobots that it was him, not them, that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie">offlined</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Megatron</a>... not knowing that he was being filmed by news drones.

<ul><li> Often, whenever a public figure or celebrity decides to confess to committing an action, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled">it is only because someone else has discovered it and is about to release the details</a>. A prime example is Tom MacMaster, who decided to reveal that his blog <em>A Gay Girl in Damascus</em> was a fraud only after his identity was uncovered by Electronic Intifada.
</li><li> Roger Clemens tried to do this by secretly taping a phone conversation between former trainer Brian Mcnamee so that he would admit that Clemens did not take HGH; all it proved was that Mcnamee was either telling the truth, or not a complete idiot.
</li><li> In 2006, Hungarian prime minister Ferenc Gyurcs&aacute;ny held a private speech telling his own colleagues in the Hungarian Socialist Party that they had lied to the people about the state of Hungary in order to win the elections, how they had done pretty much nothing in the previous four years, and how they "fucked up" and needed to get themselves together to make things work again. Once the recorded speech was leaked to the public, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_protests_in_Hungary">all hell broke loose as massive protests flooded the country<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, followed <em>very</em> quickly by the prime minister's resignation after being defeated in a vote of no confidence.
<div class="indent"><strong>Gyurcs&aacute;ny:</strong> I believe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">there will be conflicts, kids</a>.

</div></li><li> A recording of (former) Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich was leaked. In it, he discussed his plan to sell the Senate seat vacated by newly-elected President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a> to the highest bidder. Later, he would apologize <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint">for swearing so violently in the tape.</a> He would eventually be convicted of (among <em>many</em> other things) misuse of power and corruption.
<ul><li> Note that of Illinois' ten governors between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> and Blagojevich's term, five were tried for corruption and four were convicted. Of them, Blagojevich was the only one to be <em>impeached and removed from office</em> (the others had all resigned before things got that far).
</li></ul></li><li> Linda Tripp, as stated above, taped Lewinsky's confession. Though she caught a lot of flack for it, it should be noted that a previous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton">Clinton</a> mistress had confided in Tripp and when Tripp had to go public with it, she was smeared in the press, and poked fun at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets">with regard to her weight as in the later example</a> because it was her word against the president's.

</li><li> WikiLeaks and Anonymous seek to be the Internet version of this. In fact, the HB Gary Federal leak is a fitting example. Edward Snowden has also ventured into this territory. In 2016, the "<a class="urllink" href="http://panamapapers.sueddeutsche.de/en/">Panama Papers<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>" documents that exposed tax haven activity <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wired.com/2016/04/reporters-pulled-off-panama-papers-biggest-leak-whistleblower-history/">set records for the sheer amount of data involved<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> The "<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Tape_scandal">Teapot Tapes<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>" in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewZealand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewZealand">New Zealand</a>. Ironically the politicians at the centre of it have accused the media of "News of the World"-style tactics. Initially it wasn't completely played straight - the tapes are in the hands of the police after the initial controversy, and the cameraman who made the original recording is fighting for his reputation and bank balance in the courts. In early 2012, however, it was subsequently inverted when the recording was <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F-cEbn8_U8">leaked onto the Internet<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
<ul><li> Still in New Zealand, investigative journalist Nicky Hager's 2014 book, <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.dirtypoliticsnz.com/">Dirty Politics<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, was sourced from secret correspondence of a controversial blogger given to him by a suspected hacker. To Hager's supporters, he's blown the whistle on corruption and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropagandaMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropagandaMachine">dirty tricks</a>; to his detractors, he's a recipient of stolen property. Subverted twice however, firstly when the hacker who supplied the documents to Hager leaked further dirt on Twitter, only to go into hiding after legal threats from the controversial blogger loomed; secondly, <em>Dirty Politics</em> came right before a general election and was intended to influence the outcome, which didn't happen. Hager, however, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/24/new-zealand-elections-dirty-tricks-helped-john-key-win-another-term">insisted in a post-election essay<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItHasOnlyJustBegun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItHasOnlyJustBegun">only the beginning</a>, given the ongoing investigations being carried out, and his legal victory over the police detectives involved.
</li></ul></li><li> A number of public racial abuse incidents have been caught on smartphones. In the words of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WillSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WillSmith">Will Smith</a>, "racism isn't getting worse, it's getting filmed."
<ul><li> In 2011, a woman named <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-16051120">Emma West<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> went on a racially-charged rant against passengers while riding the bus. The incident was recorded by another passenger and uploaded to YouTube, which got West in all kinds of trouble with the court.
</li><li> Also, Tennessee radio talk show host Thaddeus Matthews made <a class="urllink" href="http://mrctv.org/blog/talk-radio-host-black-republican-candidate-get-your-stupid-ignorant-ass-out-my-studio">racist<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> as well as rude comments towards one of his guests, all caught on tape.
</li></ul></li><li> The British Holocaust denier David Irving holds the unusual achievement of self-engineering his confession. When the Jewish-American historian Deborah Lipstadt wrote in her book <em>Denying the Holocaust</em> that he was a Holocaust denier and had deliberately falsified historical evidence, he sued her for libel. Unfortunately, Lipstadt's lawyers asked Richard J. Evans, one of the finest historians in Britain (if not the whole world) and a team of experts to go through Irving's work with a fine-tooth comb and found that it was patently obvious that he had lied and cheated in order to show Nazism in a better light. His personal diary also revealed numerous instances of antisemitic and racist screeds, which he wrote down <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">and freely let them have</a></em>, seemingly not thinking they would manage to get through it all. At the end of a humiliating trial (ironic, because Irving had hoped to humiliate and financially ruin Lipstadt by suing her in the first place), he accidentally addressed the judge as "Mein F&uuml;hrer." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity,</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch">well-deserved comeuppance</a>, ensued. He had to declare bankruptcy after the court ordered Irving to pay Lipstadt's fees for the suit.
</li><li> The infamous video of 2012 Presidential candidate Mitt Romney (not knowing that he was being recorded) saying that 47 percent of US citizens don't pay taxes and he wouldn't bother trying to sway them to his side. Romney, of course, lost the election, and only ended up receiving... wait for it... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">47 percent of the popular vote</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">Defied</a> by the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_wiretapping_law">Illinois Eavesdropping Act<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Attempting to catch corrupt officers through recording them was made a felony. Courts have responded in various ways to challenges to the law, ultimately resulting in the law being declared unconstitutional by the Illinois Supreme Court.
</li><li> The "Mister Big" sting used by Canadian law enforcement (where it is legal, unlike in the US) creates this situation. If the police are confident they are know who the murderer is, but don't have enough evidence to be confident of a conviction, they set up an elaborate operation where an undercover officer will befriend the suspect and gradually convince the suspect that the undercover is a member of some organized crime group, eventually leading to the suspect witnessing supposed crimes and sometimes becoming a participant in them, all faked and staged by the authorities. If it works, they reach a point where the suspect wants in on the operation and is taken to meet the boss ("Mr. Big"). The suspect is told that the only way into the organization is to prove they won't lie to the Boss, and the way they can prove that is to reveal details about the murder, with the Boss insinuating that he already knows all about it and won't tolerate being lied to. Ideally, the suspect then confesses to the crime (while being secretly recorded) and reveals things only the real killer could know, and sometimes more evidence the police didn't know about.
</li><li> The greatest of them all is now accepted to be apocryphal - children's radio host "Uncle Don" who supposedly signed off (on a still live microphone) with "Well, that should hold the little bastards." In Poland, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends">urban legend</a> has it that a radio host finished his teddy bear show in a similar fashion, stating "And now, dear children, you can kiss the bear's ass goodbye."
