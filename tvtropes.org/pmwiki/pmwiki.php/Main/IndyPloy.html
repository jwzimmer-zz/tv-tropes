<ul><li> In the manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BattleRoyale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BattleRoyale">Battle Royale</a></em>, Shuuya has an admirable tendency to jump into a conflict to help the underdog. The problem is that he never thinks about what he'll do after he becomes part of it. He usually reveals his Indy Ploy after the conflict is already resolved and the other person asks what he was thinking.
<ul><li> And a lot of the time it turns out his plan was no more elaborate than 'jump in and hope for the best.'
</li></ul></li><li> As a leader, this is both Ichigo of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>'s strength and weakness. On one hand, he can be so aggressive, and attempt such suicidal things with such limited preparation, that it astonishes and repeatedly catches more cautious foes off-guard. On the other hand, when the villains DO know what to expect from him, his impetuosity and lack of foresight makes him a real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn">Unwitting Pawn</a>.
<ul><li> Renji has shown shades of this on occasion with varying degrees of success.
</li><li> In his fight with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shukuro Tsukishima</span>, Byakuya of all people was forced to do this due to his opponent's power to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"insert" himself into someone's past, which he used to become the person who trained Byakuya how to fight, meaning he knew all of Byakuya's abilities and tactics and could counter them easily because he was now the one who originally taught them to him</span>. Byakuya realized the only way to win was to improvise something unexpected. Later, he admitted he enjoyed it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em>: Spike "I try not to think" Spiegel is a contrast to Jet, especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> over a game of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shogi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shogi">Sh&#333;gi</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnMovie">the movie</a>. When he does make plans, they're simple and disposable; he expects them to fail, leaving him no choice but to improvise.
<ul><li> To quote the manga: "Plan A is 'Take it as it comes,' Plan B is 'First come, first served,' and Plan C is 'Wing it.'"
</li></ul></li><li> Goku from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, especially during his assault on the main Red Ribbon Army base. His plan could be best described as "keep hitting anyone who attacks until you run out of targets". Meanwhile the rest of the cast were busily trying to put together a rescue team and trying to plan out how they'd save him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21">Eyeshield 21</a></em> this will happen quite often with the Devil Bats, especially near the end of the series. It is particularly prevalent on the last kick returns and when the Japanese team uses the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dragonfly and Golden Dragonfly</span>.
</li><li> Having a strong preference for the Indy Ploy seems to be a requirement to be a member of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>. Even many of the more sane characters tend to throw themselves into fights with little forethought (Erza fits this description well), notable exceptions may be Lucy, Levy, and Fried.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em>:
<ul><li> Judau Ashta from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ">Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ</a></em> and Uso Ewin from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam">Mobile Suit Victory Gundam</a></em> are masters of this. They make up new plans as they go along, using strategies more experienced or more crazy pilots never think of. Before them, Kou Uraki of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0083StardustMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0083StardustMemory">Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory</a></em> turns out to be incredible at this, with his moment being the rather insane plan that he enacts to take out the Gundam GP-02A.
</li><li> The <em>entire</em> Tekkadan crews from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans">Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans</a></em> are experts of solving problems via improvisation, from wiring a meteor to reposition the ship, to landing mobile workers onto enemy ship via ramming on it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>: This pretty much exemplifies Inuyasha's entire approach to fighting. He even learns Bakuryuuha totally without meaning to by reacting instinctively. His unconventional fighting style is commented on by other characters on more than one occasion.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IrresponsibleCaptainTylor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IrresponsibleCaptainTylor">Irresponsible Captain Tylor</a></em>, the titular character lives his life by this philosophy. Or he's a super genius that plans everything far in advance. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation">It's hard to tell</a>.
<ul><li> In one episode, this was discussed when Tylor has a debate with Yamamoto about what happens if all plans against the enemy fails. Tylor's point was that sometimes all plans can fail and you must think fast at that point to win. Yamamoto dismisses Tylor as being an idiot, only to look in shock later in the episode, as Tylor's attempt to escape the Raalgon fleet pursuing them - after all before plans failed - resulted in the whole Raalgon fleet getting wiped out by their own actions. Leaving the crew wondering, if Tylor was just lucky, or used an Indy Ploy against the Raalgon Fleet.
</li></ul></li><li> Joseph Joestar, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureBattleTendency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureBattleTendency">second titular hero</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>, is a seasoned practitioner of these, both as a young practitioner of Ripple-style martial arts and as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderAndWiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderAndWiser">Older and kinda-sorta Wiser</a> mentor to his grandson Jotaro. Fittingly, his characterization in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders">Stardust Crusaders</a></em> draws heavily from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a>, right down to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolHat">Cool Hat</a>.
</li><li> This is Shirogane's greatest strength in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleOfWits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleOfWits">Battle of Wits</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em>. Unlike Kaguya, who can use her vast riches to plan ahead of time for every eventuality, he often has to rely on his quick wit and makes things up as he goes along. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">That said, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandRomanticGesture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandRomanticGesture">Grand Romantic Gesture</a> during the Culture Festival shows that he can be a pretty good planner if given sufficient time.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LupinIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LupinIII">Lupin III</a></em> uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnspokenPlanGuarantee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnspokenPlanGuarantee">Unspoken Plan Guarantee</a> so often that we, the audience, can't tell if Lupin's success is due to planning or luck.
<ul><li> In "The First Move Wins Computer Operation!" of the original 1971 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIIIGreenJacket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIIIGreenJacket">Lupin III (Green Jacket)</a></em> TV series, the Tokyo police department gets a supercomputer that is programmed to predict Lupin's every move. It does so extremely successfully, until Lupin realizes the way to beat it, is to throw out all his plans and act completely on whim.

However, given his rash, hotheaded nature, he is VERY prone to impulsively rush/leap/dive headfirst into a dangerous situation and figure out along the way how he will walk out of it alive.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissionYozakuraFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissionYozakuraFamily">Mission: Yozakura Family</a></em>, While Kengo does research for his missions in advance, more often than not, he improvises as he goes. For instance, when pitted against Kyoichiro:
<div class="indent"><strong>Nanao:</strong> What's our plan? <br><strong>Kengo:</strong> Just whatever?
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, Deidara prides himself with these, as it correlates with his belief that true art is a momentary concept.
<ul><li> Naruto himself has twice been described to mooks who had never seen him before as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">the one who will attack you without thinking first</a>". While he can often make up plans (even very good ones), he initially is only capable of thinking them up immediately before he has to do them. Of course, this is somewhat implied to be why he's a capable fighter; he makes up for his lack of raw intelligence with body instinct.
<ul><li> It actually works in his favor. Considering that literally everyone he's fought has pulled new and unheard-of secret techniques out of their ass when he fights them, trying to plan ahead would be a pointless exercise. What little strategy he had (at least until recent chapters) has been "spam them with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MesACrowd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MesACrowd">Shadow</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Clones</a> until they break out the big guns, and then figure it out from there." <em>The kid plans for Indy Ploys.</em>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Luffy of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> did this once or twice. At one point the main characters were making a minutely-detailed plan to invade a government-owned island. Luffy, being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">Idiot Hero</a> that he is, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">charged in at the soonest possible moment</a>, leaving his allies to beat a hasty path in after him. Not that it really mattered. They used the same plan to get the rest of the Straw Hats in and it worked. Luffy just got in early and defeated the first CP9 member.
<ul><li> His fight with Eneru may also qualify. With his "Mantra" Eneru was able to predict and counter all of Luffy's moves, so he just started making up moves on the spot in an effort to get around it.
</li><li> Two particularly interesting tactics of his; first, to allow himself to go into a daze and let instinct keep him from getting hit (didn't work because he couldn't attack without breaking the trance) and throwing his fists against the wall (they're made of rubber) to let them ricochet unpredictably.
</li><li> When Luffy <em>does</em> have a plan, it usually amounts to "let's beat up the bad guy!" Anything else, he makes up as he goes (or has to be planned by a subordinate, usually Robin or Nami, or occasionally Usopp.)

<ul><li> Most other duelists in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> have decks revolving around some overpowered combination that wins them every duel. Yugi, on the other hand, has a reactive deck with a variety of spells for every situation. What makes the series fun is seeing all the unique clever ways he uses these spells to counter his opponent's combinations. Usually even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicPokerEquation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicPokerEquation">drawing the right card</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearVillainVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearVillainVictory">right before the duel is over.</a>

<ul><li> This is generally the M.O. of just about every comic book superhero since supervillains have a tendency to attack without warning at any time. But while most of them do at least fight according to plans thought out in training or, on the rare occasion, when they're the ones tracking a bad guy instead of the other way around, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a> change their line-up so frequently that they can't even plan for their own team, let alone whatever they're up against. Winging it is what they do best.
</li><li> Like in the <em>Shanghai Noon</em> example below, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix">Asterix</a> and the Cauldron</em>, after Obelix doesn't understand a detailed plan, Asterix replaces it with "we fight, get the gold and go away" (to which Obelix replies "This one I understand!").

</li><li> In comparison to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Steve Rogers</a>' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a>-ness, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuckyBarnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuckyBarnes">Bucky Barnes</a>, after assuming the mantle of Captain America showed off his tactical sensibilities through his extensive reliance on plans made on the fly.
</li><li> Crazy comic book <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a> has twice bested Taskmaster, a character capable of beating some of the very best superheroes (the low-to-mid-level ones, anyway &mdash; little chance of him taking down Thor or Ms. Marvel, for example, except by planning) by being able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis">perfectly mimic and therefore predict</a> their fighting styles. The reason he was defeated by Deadpool, it is revealed, is that Deadpool, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">almost as crazy as The Joker</a>, literally makes up everything he does as he goes along, making him completely unpredictable.
<ul><li> The instance where he took <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Taskmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Taskmaster">Taskmaster</a> off guard by suddenly stopping in the middle of their fight and going into a breakdancing routine is a sterling example of Deadpool's M.O.
</li><li> This was also used in the DC Universe, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2000">Batgirl's</a> (Cassandra Cain) body language reading skills were foiled by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a>'s randomness. Cassandra triumphs after Oracle explains that the Joker's body language is "gibberish".
<ul><li> Which makes sense in that the only consistency in the last five or six iterations of the DC universe is that Joker literally makes up his personality as he goes along.
</li></ul></li><li> The miniseries <em>Dream War</em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover">Crisis Crossover</a> between the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Wildstorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Wildstorm">WildStorm</a> Comics and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a> universes: In a conflict with DC villains, Midnighter of the Authority usually had an advantage, due to his ability to play out every variation of a fight in his head before the first blow lands. Until he ran into the Joker and could do nothing but stand completely still because he couldn't figure out what the Joker would do.

Yet, once in a while even <em>he</em> gets caught with his pants down, and has to improvise. But if you're in his way you're better pray he <em>did</em> plan for whatever you have, because his Indy Ploys tend to involve more murder than usual-and this is a guy whose escape plan once involved <em>luring the police in an area that automatically filled with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGas">Deadly Gas</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorStrange">Doctor Strange</a> frequently goes to cases without much preparation, expecting that he'll be quick-witted enough (or have the right amulet, or know the right spell) to deal with the situation as it develops.

</div></li><li> Reed Richards of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a></em> can afford to use this as his modus operandi, since he's smart enough to pull a master plan that would take anyone else days to draw up out of his ass at random, or cobble together an interdimensional continuity de-snarler out of a handful of kitchen utensils.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a></em>: Sinestro cites this as the key reason he can never beat Hal Jordan (as much as he hates to admit it):
<div class="indent"><strong>Sinestro</strong>: You're too blasted unpredictable. Set a plotter or a schemer in my path, I'll crush their bones to dust. You've escaped that fate not because of something as silly as willpower. Nor because of your prosaic notions of justice and morality. You've survived because your actions never make sense. Yet despite yourself&#151;-and this is the truly infuriating part&#151;-your instincts always see you through.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JonahHex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JonahHex">Jonah Hex</a> is a master of coming up with plans on the fly. Given he frequently doesn't know where his enemies are, or their numbers, or sometimes even <em>who</em> they are, this is kind of a necessity. His philosophy is perhaps best summed up by a pair of quotes from <em>Hex</em> #12:
<div class="indent"><em>(Hex has just encountered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantRobot">Giant Robot</a> that is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets">Immune to Bullets</a>)</em> <br><strong>Hex:</strong> <em>*thinks*</em> Looks like a good time to switch to Plan B! <em>(runs away)</em> Shore do wish I had me a Plan B! <br><em>(several panels later)</em> <br><strong>Hex:</strong> <em>*thinks*</em> Wait!

When Nitro exploded, he vaporized the tear gas, which then mixed with his gaseous form and left him too sick to stand up, much less explode again, when he reformed. It's even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> by Spider-Man when he realized he had all of five seconds to stop Nitro before the villain exploded again.

Indeed, one could argue that this is arguably his defining trait. Despite Hermione being more clever and Ron knowing more about the Wizarding World, neither are as good at thinking on their toes the way Harry is. Contrast this with Voldemort, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">who meticulously plans everything</a> and is a big fan of playing the long game to get what he wants.

<ul><li> This is also brought up in <em>Deathly Hallows</em>:

</li><li> In book seven, there's a lengthy time where Ron and Hermione assume Harry's got a plan, and are pissed (Ron) and worried (Hermione) when they discover he hasn't got one.

He is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">good at planning too</a>, but no plan survives an encounter with the enemy, so he's often forced to make things up as they go.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThrawnTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThrawnTrilogy">The Thrawn Trilogy</a></em>, Luke Skywalker has an impressively long run of "This isn't working, I'll try something else" when he's pulled out of hyperspace by an Imperial Interdictor. Condensed, here's about half of it: "Whoa, it's practically on top of me! I'm in tractor range, I can't go to lightspeed in this gravity well, and they're hailing me. There's a freighter with it, there are no living things on board. Where's the nearest edge of the gravity well&mdash;gun for it. The freighter is between me and them, I'll send a timed proton torp to blow up the freighter, debris should shield us, okay done&mdash;damn, they're moving to keep me in the gravity well, I'll go laterally&mdash;tractored! They'll pull us in, if I can change speed I can get it to let go, I'll swing to get as close to the edge of the gravity well, then reverse-trigger the inertial compensator at full power&mdash;there, dead stop, the tractor's not on me for just a moment, I'll fire proton torpedoes to be caught by the tractor and pulled in. Done, fly! They're finally firing on me, we're far enough away, jump to lightspeed! ...We're out of range, but we've fallen out of lightspeed and now we're stranded in lightyears of empty space. Hyperdrive is dead, subspace radio is broken, we can't leave, aren't likely to be found, and can't call for help. Okay R2, let's try..."
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries">X-Wing Series</a> has Wraith Squadron. A dozen people, give or take, constantly find themselves in situations that plans could not have predicted and rapidly put together schemes, often rather complex ones, to get the desired results. For about a thousand pages worth of novels. No wonder the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is afraid of them. And their allies, too, for that matter.
<ul><li> In their first live battle, Wraiths Five and Six, plus two A-Wings, manage to trick an Imp Star Deuce into following them, by pretending to be the <em>Millennium Falcon</em>. How they do so involves precision flying, wavery shields, an obsolete battle encryption that the enemy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYouKnowIKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYouKnowIKnow">doesn't know that they know</a> that the enemy can crack, and a bad imitation of Leia saying that Han is up to his elbows in the remains of the hyperdrive and can't talk right now. Just to top it off, they later end up in the command of the inimitable then-General Han Solo himself. The loonies are running the asylum, and damn if it ain't fine.
</li></ul></li><li> Consider what happened within the first seven pages of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarWarsAllegiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarWarsAllegiance">Star Wars: Allegiance</a></em>. Han and Luke in the <em>Falcon</em> lift off a planet, are attacked by pirates, do some tricky shooting and maneuvering, and a Star Destroyer glides into the system to take care of the rebel cell being smuggled out by the <em>Falcon</em>. Han powers down the <em>Falcon</em>'s weapons and sends out a general emergency call, nominally to the planetary defenses below. The Star Destroyer tells him to state his intention and emergency, Han says that they're a medical mercy team sent out in response to a groundquake on the planet and were attacked by pirates. The Star Destroyer quickly and systematically destroys all of the pirates and tells Han that the planet is now under Imperial interdiction. Go home until the block has lifted. Han makes a show of reluctantly agreeing, and as they fly away he remarks to Luke that it's nice to obey Imperial orders now and again.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimothyZahn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimothyZahn">Timothy Zahn</a> in general likes having his protagonists get pinned down and forced to improvise repeatedly to escape. The Cobra trilogy especially is packed with this.

A notable example is #37 <em>The Weakness</em>, where Rachel, the group's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> member, takes over the Leader's role. Her 'plan' to get into the enemy's stronghold involves stealing a private jet and crashing it into a building.
<ul><li> For most of the run, <em>Animorphs</em> might as well just be called Indy Ploy: The Series. To be fair they do frequently <em>try</em> to plan everything out, but when things inevitably go downhill they just start making crap up as they go, with a result of all of them becoming really proficient. Another notable example is in #29, when everyone except Cassie gets knocked out with alien flu, forcing her to Indy Ploy her way into the Yeerk pool to rescue a yeerk who knows too much before escaping to perform on the fly <em>brain surgery</em>.

At one point he has lost access to his wardrobe and all of his disguises and needs to pass himself off as a wealthy merchant to his mark. Through a quick, complicated scam, he ends up walking into a bank and coming out half an hour later wearing the clothing of <em>the man who runs it</em>. And he only tried the ridiculous scheme after the first two, simpler ones failed miserably due to the security procedures of the bank manager... which he then turns around and uses on his successful attempt.
<ul><li> In fact, he had to have his inclination to conjure audacious, ridiculous schemes from nowhere trained out of him by his master; before that his <em>default</em> plan was "Uhhhh...", which, as his master points out, is not consistently workable in the long run.

In many ways, his characters are science-fiction descendants of Odysseus, the scheming fast thinker who dazzles his opponents with his footwork.

Thus we get a lot of plans that amount to "arrange for some backup, confront the villains, and wing it from there," and in one case even "get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeleeATrois" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeleeATrois">everyone</a> in the same place and see what happens." It gets to where it's a real surprise when, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Changes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Changes">Changes</a></em>, his elaborate scheme to break into a building and steal information goes off without a hitch. Some examples of his make-it-up-as-I-go-plans:
<ul><li> Oh, crap, giant scorpion-golem is attacking me and I can't use fire on it! Okay, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">drop a freaking elevator on it using a tunnel of wind</span>!

</li><li> Three powerful necromancers who outpower me and are backed up by armies of unstoppable undead minions.

Well, good thing I'm in the Field Museum. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Let's raise that T-Rex skeleton and get to whupping some undead ass.</span>
</li><li> In fact, Harry's tendency to wing it instead of creating a cunning plan saves him at least twice, by making potential adversaries who are accusing him of being an Evil Mastermind think about his standard M.O. Rashid the Gatekeeper's response is to practically double over with laughter; Fix the Summer Knight's response is more "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a>"...

Although, being a Napoleonic Wars-era Naval officer, and the timing of military operations being dependent upon friction&mdash;wind, rain, sea conditions, road conditions, partisan attacks, the idiot who got drunk last night, et cetera&mdash;he has no way of predicting for certain the movements of his enemies, even if he knew what they intended to do. And he's generally brilliant at it, so really no reason to complain.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em>, the Dwarves seem to mostly operate this way, dealing with every obstacle as they happen. This becomes a problem late in the book, when they turn out to have no plan for getting rid of Smaug, which Bilbo doesn't find out until after they've already pissed him off by stealing from him.
<div class="indent">They debated long on what was to be done, but they could think of no way of getting rid of Smaug&mdash;which had always been a weak point in their plans, as Bilbo felt inclined to point out.

The humans shut their computers off and attack without a pattern, by putting someone who's gone completely loopy at the controls to push all the pretty buttons. The aliens mostly just sit there while being shot at because their computers can't see a pattern and can't offer any tactical advice.
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SixteenThirtyTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SixteenThirtyTwo">1635: The Cannon Law</a></em>:

In the second book this is enforced; mind readers are spying on him, so whenever he has a good idea or sets something up he puts the knowledge of it into a magical box that removes it from his memory. The echo of the idea remains so that when it's time to put it into effect he knows to retrieve it from the box.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VampireAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VampireAcademy">Vampire Academy</a></em>, this is Rose Hathaway's usual tactic for getting out of situations. She is fast-thinking but acts without a long-term plan. Like, for example, forming an immediate escape plan in Portland, once her and Lissa's cover is blown, one involving borrowing a car and running off to Los Angeles to get lost in the crowd. It works most of the time, but she also has remarkable luck.

</li><li> Discussed in <em>Put a Lid On It</em> by Donald Westlake. The narrator &#151; a career criminal &#151; notes that criminals in movies tend to have all kinds of elaborate plans involving timetables, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanningWithProps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanningWithProps">scale models</a>, and so on.

This is partly because "the situation... is never exactly, precisely what you thought the situation was going to be." But he also notes that:
<div class="indent">[P]eople who make plans in their lives and people who make robberies are two pretty distinct character types. People who make plans are likely to make plans that eliminate the necessity of having to make a robbery in the first place.

The real thing that makes them a nightmare to fight is their ability to adapt to changing situations very quickly.

When that failed due to Michael being exposed as a fake, he decided that they didn't have enough time to come up with a new plan (which probably wouldn't work anyway since the bad guy had seen everyone in Team Westen), broke into the bad guy's hotel room, clubbed him over the head and dumped him into a truck for delivery to the authorities.

The general idea is that it's a competitive cooking show where Alton Brown periodically auctions off "sabotages" that severely complicate someone's planned recipe, forcing the chef(s) on the receiving end to come up with a workaround to produce something vaguely similar to the required dish - with a thirty minute time limit on cooking to ratchet up the tension (which is already pretty high, especially when one of the chefs has never actually made the required dish before). Then, once the dust has settled, they need to justify the result to the judge without at any stage admitting to having been sabotaged. If it wasn't for hastily improvised substitutions to cover for a key ingredient being stolen or the replacement of the usual heating tools with a burning bathroom sponge or something, nothing would ever get done.

When she brings Ros out so Tyrion can see that she is really alive, Tyrion plays along and pretends she really is the one he loves, keeping Cersei ignorant about Shae.

Most of the time, they'll <em>have</em> a plan, but it always gets thwarted, either by walkers overwhelming them or somebody deciding to act at <em>just</em> the wrong moment. Season 1 has the group plan to get a boat and head out to sea, but beyond that, they wing it. Season 2 deconstructs it when Kenny suggests that "we'll make it up as we go," only to be admonished by Mike, who says that "you can't plan to improvise."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em>:
<ul><li> The titular Phoenix Wright is essentially the videogaming world's avatar of this trope. Both he and his successor Apollo Justice rely almost exclusively upon plans built upon the Indy Ploy; especially on the first day of court when they usually have no clue who the real culprit is. Repeatedly, the decision to have new information added to a testimony involves the player character thinking something to the effect of 'if only I knew where I was going with this'.
</li><li> Although this is completely averted in the last case of the first game, when Phoenix tricks the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> by not only making them <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">incriminate themselves, but also provide a legal reason as to why the evidence Phoenix collected in an unauthorized investigation can be presented in court</span> all without said big bad knowing it. Phoenix very clearly states on multiple occasions during the final part of the case that he had planned it all out. In fact this plan will actually fool not only the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, but <em>players themselves</em>, resulting in a large percentage of people getting a game over on their first run-through, due to being tricked by Phoenix (Part of the plan was to refuse to do something that 99% of players would naturally assume they had to do, thus resulting in them picking the wrong opinion). It turns out he CAN plan things out after all.
</li><li> However, in the fourth game where the aforementioned Mr. Justice is the main character, Phoenix seems to have taken up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">a new way of doing things</a>.
</li><li> <em>Apollo Justice</em> also happens to be the game where this trope is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstructed</a>, since the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s plot to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">get Phoenix disbarred</span> actually depended on the fact that Phoenix would be flying by the seat of his pants. The rest of the game, while playing it straight, showed exactly how in the dark Apollo is, since he's being played by both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Phoenix</a> <em>and</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>.
</li><li> It should be noted that this is what makes the games so compelling because the player feels exactly this way as well (and it's the player who calls the shots!).

He's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">not the sharpest knife in the drawer by anyone's stretch</a>, but when it comes to improvising a way to save the day (and his ass), he's a freaking grandmaster.

The final mission of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> is inherently unplannable, as nobody has ever seen what is on the other side of the Omega-4 Relay and returned to tell the tale.

After the summoning screws up and summons Rozalin, Zenon's daughter instead, Adell is forced into improvising plan after plan for the next six or so chapters as he cluelessly tries to track down Zenon on his own.
</li><li> The main character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em>, Shirou Emiya, relies on this quite often, which tends to cause discomfort among his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a>. During several "strategy meetings", his allies reprimand him for his usual response of "let's just go and do it".
</li><li> The protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime">Tsukihime</a></em>, Tohno Shiki, despite constantly facing incredibly powerful vampires, never has a plan. Justified in that he really has no idea what he's going up against before he actually faces it. His main means of winning is a combination of inborn talent, inhuman instinct and calmly thinking out the situation DURING the situation. In the end, he's pretty much just making everything up as he goes along. Sometimes his partner at the time (Arcueid, Ciel or Sion usually) try to plan things out ahead of time, but those plans rarely go well. In fact, it's occasionally implied that his VERY EXISTENCE throws a metaphorical wrench in any plans anyone could come up with. This is partially attributed to the fact that no one really knows what Shiki is capable of, including himself. Thus, everyone is constantly surprised by anything he pulls off, and frequently does things in each subsequent game that would have been impossible in a prior one. In other words, in Shiki's case, it's practically impossible to plan ahead.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Runescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Runescape">Runescape</a></em>, the only way to kill a Vyrewatch is to use a weapon designed for extreme unpredictability - therefore gaining in the sheer power of incompetently planned attacks against a monster who can see coming every competent attack there is. The weapon? <em>A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFlail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFlail">flail made out of a composite of silver and mithril, with a silver sickle on the tip.</a></em> Wow.
<ul><li> In a later quest where you get a much more reliable set of weapons to fit each combat type. One of the Vyrelords helping you even comments the previous weapon is a complete joke and could be snapped with no effort. So not only it's subverted but possibly averted too.
</li></ul></li><li> During the first level of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankFutureToolsOfDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankFutureToolsOfDestruction">Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction</a></em>, the city is under attack, and every attempt Ratchet makes to get where he's going is inevitably blocked by destruction or a large and dangerous robot.
<div class="indent"><strong>Clank:</strong> Ratchet, the Planetary Defence Center is 200 cubits below us. How do you propose we get down?

Despite the fact that he's well respected by Terran and Protross alike for his sound tactical mind, he never really plans anything in advance: he just makes it up as he goes along.
<ul><li> Mengsk also used to do that during his rebel days, especially in the novels. At one point, his ship, the <em>Hyperion</em>, is confronted by Duke's <em>Norad II</em> with the usual "prepare to be boarded" speech. Mengsk sets up a siege tank in a hangar bay and opens the doors. He then heads full speed at the <em>Norad</em>, changing course at the last second in order to graze the Confederate's shields (yes, they're equipped with shields). As the <em>Hyperion</em> is passing the <em>Norad</em>, Mengsk orders the tank to fire. Duke is confused about how a battlecruiser can fire a broadside, as all their weapons are forward-mounted (a stupid design, really). When he finds out it was a tank, he just stands for a few minutes with his mouth open, letting Mengsk get away. To note, Mengsk is a student of history, especially the Age Of Sail.

So, for his new plan, he transfers his mind to one of the other Ricks, goes back to the Citadel of Ricks, then transfers it to a higher-ranked Rick, goes to a room, and teleports the entire citadel back to the prison he was originally in, thus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telefrag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telefrag">telefragging</a> both facilities at once and breaking into the level he wanted to get into in the first place.

<ul><li> The founding father of game theory (no, not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/GameTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/GameTheory">that one</a>), John Von Neumann, famously said that a random strategy is the only strategy that cannot be guaranteed to be beaten by some other strategy. So, if you are going up against someone who is smarter, with more resources, and whose likelihood of understanding your strategy (if you had one) and replying with a better one is 100%, your only option for a non-zero chance of success is an Indy Ploy.
<ul><li> This level has been reached with the best chess playing programs. They can still be beaten by human grand masters, but by far the most effective opening strategy for doing so is to make a random opening that makes no sense whatsoever. There's no way that the computer isn't going to know any coherent opening game and counter it. (Computers can use brute force to compute every possible course many moves into the future, so there's no way for a human, with much more limited ability to examine possible future states of the game, to compete with that approach. Random play allows a human to, sometimes, reach a place in the phase space of possible games where they have enough of an advantage to win.)
</li></ul></li><li> As the old adage goes, the most dangerous opponent is a complete newbie because you don't know what he's going to do.

<ul><li> Not entirely uncommon among serial authors. Often, one will have the big events plotted out (character deaths, villain appearances), but will come up with the intervening comics as he or she makes them.

He was forced to improvise and change the whole ending to his version of events for the second Megaman game. It worked out surprisingly well.
</li></ul></li><li> A few real books were written this way (the author just making it up as he goes along in one draft with no revisions), such as the novel <em>Hawaii</em>.

The only scene he even tried to write ahead of time was the climactic scene inside Mt. Doom, and the final one was still written only when the story got to it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RumikoTakahashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RumikoTakahashi">Rumiko Takahashi</a> never really plans ahead. She just comes up with the story by a chapter by chapter basis. In fact, this is <em>very</em> common among mangaka who publish works on a weekly basis, due to the small window of time they have to come up with anything. One of the more extreme examples out there is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama">Akira Toriyama</a>, who came up with his plots <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants">while he was drawing each chapter</a></em>.
</li><li> Writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SidFleischman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SidFleischman">Sid Fleischman</a> once quipped, "I'm anxious to get to my desk each morning to find out what's going to happen."
</li><li> This was actually how American football's signature feature, the forward pass, came into being. In the early 20th Century, many colleges were considering abandoning Walter Camp's football code in favor of rugby. In a game between the University of North Carolina and the University of Georgia, a punter threw the ball towards a teammate downfield while trying to avoid getting creamed by an oncoming rush. The receiver made a 70-yard touchdown (including the pass) to win the game for the UNC Tarheels, 7-0. This was witnessed by one Johnny Heisman, who related the story to Camp. Seeing a way to open up the game and make it more exciting to fans, he agreed to legalize the forward pass. Along with the abolition of the Flying Wedge Formation and the adoption of heavy protective padding, changes designed to fix the <em>other</em> problem of players being killed and crippled, the forward pass is credited with saving the game of American football.
</li><li> The Portuguese actually have a <em>word</em> for this: <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_17251_the-10-coolest-foreign-words-english-language-needs_p2.html">Desenrascan&ccedil;o.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> The Duke of Wellington said of the French generals he defeated: "They planned their campaigns just as you might make a splendid set of harnesses. It looks very well; and answers very well; until it gets broken; and then you are done for. Now I made my campaigns of ropes. If anything went wrong, I tied a knot and went on."
</li><li> Mike Tyson basically said the same thing, but more succinct: "Everyone has a plan 'til they get hit in the face."
</li><li> After he retired undefeated, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">Floyd Mayweather Jr</a> said in many interviews that he never had a plan going into a fight. He didn't study fight footage of an opponent because styles make fights, and he never based his fight plan on what another boxer was able to do against the same opponent. He would study the fighter in the middle of the fight, make the adjustments and win. An martial arts expert made a video about Mayweather's career and concluded that he would almost always lose the early rounds of a fight before figuring out how to win.
</li><li> A celebrated military mind of the 19th century, German Generalfeldmarschall <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmuth_von_Moltke_the_Elder">Hulmuth von Moltke the Elder<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, said: "No plan of operations extends with certainty beyond the first encounter with the enemy's main strength." This is usually paraphrased as "no plan survives contact with the enemy." Even if you <em>do</em> have a plan, once things get started, it can only help so much.
</li><li> T.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) repeatedly states in his memoirs that, being an archaeologist rather than a military man, he knew very little about how to fight a revolution. Therefore, in the beginning of his time with the Arab revolt he was making up a plan as he went. It was not until several months into the campaign, when he was laid up with a case of dysentery, that he had a chance to analyze the goals and methods of the campaign he had been helping to lead! He ended up almost single-handedly inventing modern guerilla warfare.
</li><li> Just about any space mission looks a lot like this. When things go wrong (and things always go wrong to a greater or lesser degree), the success or failure of the mission, and often the lives of the astronauts, depend on the resourcefulness and cleverness of the astronauts and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mission Control</a>. The Apollo 11 and 13 missions both had several examples of this. In large part this is because of NASA's tendency to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a>: if something happens that isn't covered by "flip to page 173 of the LM Operator's Handbook and follow procedure 6", it's <em>really</em> out there.
<ul><li> The mission in between, Apollo 12, was <em>struck by lightning</em> (<em>twice!</em>) during launch and was saved from having to abort only because flight controller <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Aaron">John Aaron<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Apollo13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Apollo13">"steely-eyed missile man"</a>) had seen similarly garbled flight telemetry during an earlier simulation and remembered what had worked to fix it. He made the call "try SCE to aux", instructing the astronauts to flip a switch so obscure that only Lunar Module Pilot <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Bean">Alan Bean<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (who'd been in the same sim a <em>year</em> prior) knew where it was on the console.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>: On June 6th, 1944, Operation Overlord became this trope writ LARGE even before the first troops hit the beaches. To the tune of hundreds of thousands of US and Allied troops.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsRainingMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsRainingMen">US 82nd and 101st Airborne</a> Divisions were especially good at this trope. The whole role of paratroopers is to be cut off behind enemy lines with limited supplies and often no contact with command at all. You complete your mission and hope to god the main friendly force reaches you before you run out of ideas/bullets/people.
</li></ul></li><li> Any teacher in a given children's school may have to plan like this. There's always <em>something</em> going on, derailing the education.
</li><li> Your own life. It's always a running cycle of ploys.
