If you want it, you've got to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeYourTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeYourTime">put the plot on hold</a> and embark on a five-hour <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidequest">sidequest</a>!

Also, it's unlikely the dungeon the sword is in will be uninhabited; in fact, the monsters there tend to be very XP-rich <em>anyway</em>.

<ul><li> The <em>boomerang</em> is the Infinity Plus One weapon &mdash; it can kill almost anything, <em>including the final boss</em>, in one hit, and if you still have the magic rooster, one can throw the boomerang and then fly around invulnerable. Although the Magic Rod, a mandatory weapon, is pretty much as good, if not better against certain enemies. Compared to most examples, it's very easy to obtain&mdash;you have to complete a lengthy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfDeals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfDeals">Chain of Deals</a> first, but you have to do that to complete the game anyway, and afterward you just have to visit a nondescript cave at the beach where the game started and trade away a less-valuable item.
</li><li> There's also the Level 2 Sword, which you get by hunting around for 20 Secret Seashells all over Koholint and then turning them in at the Seashell Palace. Not only does the Level 2 Sword deal twice as much damage as the regular sword, but if your health is full, the famous sword blast from the original game makes its return.
</li></ul></li><li> The Biggoron Sword in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em>. The sidequest required to get it has several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> events in it, particularly giving the saw to the carpenter's boss, where it is only vaguely hinted that the gray-skinned man possessing the saw was his son, and to boot, he's in a location (Gerudo Valley) that it is unlikely you would visit at the time you start the quest, so by the time you would finally get it, you would have missed out on using it in more than half the dungeons. If you know what you're doing, however, you can get the sword immediately after becoming an adult and winning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerupMount" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerupMount">Epona</a>, then use it in every adult dungeon, turning it into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">Disc-One Nuke</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames">The Legend of Zelda: Oracle Games</a></em>: The Master Sword, which was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">Infinity -1 Sword</a> in most of its appearances (except for its series debut in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a></em>), gets more respect here (gameplay-wise, as it is not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement">plot-relevant</a> in these games), in which it can be (optionally) obtained by linking the two games together and completing a sidequest. (The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">Infinity -1 Sword</a> in these games is the Noble Sword.) However, this requires one game to be completed, so it doesn't have much use in that game after it's obtained. (Nothing stopping players from replaying the games in the other order to get more use out of the Master Sword, though.) The Biggoron's Sword appears as well and is obtained similarly to the Master Sword, but it is swung more slowly than the standard one-handed swords and prevents Link from being able to equip anything else without unequipping it.
</li><li> The Magic Armor in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em>, which can be a major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> during boss fights. It lasts as long as you have rupees, because when you run out it becomes an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Artifact of Doom</a>, slowing Link down. The player can get around this restriction by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">collecting all the poe souls, which breaks the curse on Jovani and rewards Link with infinite rupees.</span> Of course, without a guide book around, it takes several hours of scouring Hyrule to complete this sidequest, which renders it pretty pointless in a game where the boss battles aren't exceptionally difficult.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</a></em>:
<ul><li> Being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginsEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginsEpisode">Origins Episode</a> of the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Master Sword</span>, the game has variants of it as both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">Infinity -1 Sword</a> (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in the form just called the Master Sword</span>) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in the form called the True Master Sword</span>). Both of them also count as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement">Sword of Plot Advancement</a>, and must be obtained to progress through the game.
</li><li> The Hylian Shield, which, unlike the other three shields you can get, doesn't actually take any damage. This is the best shield in the game, and is earned after beating 8 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWellButNotPerfect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWellButNotPerfect">(and only 8)</a> bosses in the Thunder Dragon's challenge.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkBetweenWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkBetweenWorlds">The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds</a></em>, finding two pieces of Master Ore and bringing them to the blacksmith in Hyrule means he will reforge the Master Sword into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">Red Tempered Sword</a>, then taking two pieces of Master Ore to the blacksmith in Lorule nets you the Golden Tempered Sword. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a></em> has a similar upgrade sequence for the Master Sword. So the base Master Sword is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">Infinity -2 Sword</a>?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Master Sword manages to be both an infinity +1 and -1 sword at the same time. When you first get the sword, its attack power only has a meager power of 30 and its energy gets drained if you "break" the sword, rendering it unusable for 10 minutes. The Master Sword is the only weapon that is reusable this way, which puts it miles ahead of other weapons, yet its low attack power won't be suitable for strong enemies. If you're in the presence of an enemy that's under the influence of Ganon, the sword's attack power doubles to 60 and its energy takes a lot longer to be fully depleted. Fully completing the Master Trials in the first DLC pack has the Master Sword powered up to 60 attack power permanently and gives the enhanced durability to boot. While you can easily find stronger weapons, they'll eventually break while the powered up Master Sword will take a long time to be depleted.
</li><li> Since all other weapons in this game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons">wear out extremely quickly</a>, and enemies do terrifying amounts of damage, armor is the main Infinity +1 Item. Ancient Armor and the Tunic of the Wild are the best defensive sets available, but both require considerable work to acquire&mdash;the former requires a lot of money and parts farmed by destroying numerous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">Guardians</a>, while the latter is the reward for completing all 120 Shrines. To upgrade them all the way for maximum defense (basically required, since un-upgraded the sets aren't particularly good and have no bonus effects), you must find all 4 fairy fountains, dump over <em>ten thousand Rupees</em> into them in total, and collect a lot of hard-to-find components to pay for the upgrades. By the time you get through all that, you're probably good enough at the game that you don't really need such high defensive stats.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors">Hyrule Warriors</a></em>:
<ul><li> An update has made the Master Sword's Sealed Skill Evil's Bane no longer exclusive to the Master Sword: You can pick up a randomly dropped weapon with a 25,000-KO Sealed Skill.
</li><li> The perfect variation of a weapon is Level-3, 5-Stars, and 8 Slots. Unfortunately, the chances of getting this kind of weapon are very low.
</li><li> <em>Legends</em> adds Level 4 weapons, upgraded versions of the Level 3 weapons with massively increased stats, ranging from 500 to 750. Naturally, the Master Sword also gets a second skill to enable it to surpass even these.
</li><li> And there is the matter of the Level 4+ weapons from Legends 's DLC maps (sans Master Wind Waker), which adds a second element to every non-DLC weapon, along with the advantages of the Level 4 weapons.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami">&#332;kami</a></em> features the String of Beads, which basically turns Amaterasu into even more of a god than she already is. It gives you infinite health and ink (the game's equivalent of magic power) and <em>ten times</em> attack power. To get it, you must collect all 100 stray beads, which entails completing pretty much every sidequest in the game, among other things. Naturally, this a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>, but since the final bead is received upon beating the game, it is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>-only item. Incidentally, this is also an instance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredAndEight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredAndEight">108</a>, since the beads are the "stray" small beads from the rosary of the mythical Princess Fuse, which broke when she committed suicide (though she's alive and well in the game world). The eight big beads are the power orbs held by her canine warriors.
</li><li> The Spur in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaveStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaveStory">Cave Story</a></em> (not so much the Sword part as the Infinity Plus One part; it's the most powerful weapon in the game). It's an upgrade to the starting weapon: the Polar Star. To obtain it, you must <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PathOfMostResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PathOfMostResistance">avoid trading it in for a superior weapon until you reach a certain point</a>. As for what the Spur does, instead of requiring EXP it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargedAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargedAttack">chargable</a> gun: tapping the shot button results in a Level 3 Polar Star, while holding down the shot button fires off a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a>, which gets stronger the longer you hold down the button before releasing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game contains a well-hidden sword called the Crissaegrim that attacks with four near-simultaneous blows at once, can strike as fast as the button is pressed, and deals significant damage with each individual hit. It also allows you to walk while attacking, whereas most other weapons don't allow you to. And you can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding">wield two of them</a>. However, it is found on only one very weak enemy in one location that has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops">a small chance of dropping the sword</a>, and thus only a few players end up getting one without knowing about it.
</li><li> There's also the Mourneblade, which is randomly dropped by Azahgals. It has the same attack as the Crissaegrim, except it only hits once. Instead, it heals 8 HP per strike, which breaks the game wide open. You don't even have to <em>dodge</em> the final boss: just hop around like an idiot swinging the sword and you'll recover more HP than he deals.
</li><li> The Ring of Varda, the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">Golden ring to rule over all!</a>". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Yes, that is the item's description in-game</a>, and appropriately so. The ring gives you <em>ridiculous</em> stat bonuses which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">absolutely unbalance the game</a>. And if one isn't enough, you can equip <em>two</em> of these things! It's so awesome that the game only allows you to collect it if you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">started a new game after you've beaten it at least once</a>. Otherwise, the monster that drops this item will drop the similar-looking Turquoises in place of a Ring of Varda, which can be sold to the librarian, but is mostly useless.
</li><li> The Alucard Shield, when used with the Shield Rod, becomes the strongest weapon in the game. If you put the Alucard Shield and the Shield Rod in each hand, press both buttons at the same time, and you can drain enemies' life away just by touching them with the shield.
</li><li> The Duplicator can be bought from the librarian for 500,000 gp, and is also only available after beating the game at least once. While equipped, it allows unlimited use of all items that would otherwise be consumed when used. (Although it does reduce your stats, but that can be fixed by the Ring of Varda.)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaAriaOfSorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaAriaOfSorrow">Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow</a></em> offers up a Crissaegrim-like weapon with slightly shorter range called the Valmanway. Unlike the previous game, where the Crissaegrim can be picked up halfway through the game if you've got the bravery and the time to waste, the Valmanway can <em>only</em> be picked up as a reward in Boss Rush Mode, which isn't unlocked until you beat the game at least once. The Claimh Solais, in the other hand, can be acquired fairly earlier in the game, provided you get Undine's soul and one of the three souls (Curly, Devil or Manticore) required to access the secret area where it lies hidden (behind the waterfall in the Underground Reservoir). This weapon is an incredibly fast greatsword with an absurd reach that deal holy damage and provides bonus to all stats.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaDawnOfSorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaDawnOfSorrow">Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow</a></em>: The Valmanway is still the ultimate (crown) sword weapon, but now it's only available through item crafting. The downside? It requires <em>two</em> boss souls, which you can only get one of per playthrough. So if you make the Valmanway, you have to give up two useful and relatively unique souls. It's incredibly worth it, though, as the Valmanway, despite limited range, absolutely destroys every early boss and most end bosses.
<ul><li> Death's Scythe. It requires you to get the Golden Axe first, a very powerful overhead weapon that can only be crafted with a very rarely-dropped soul. Once you have it, though, and once you have Death's soul, you can fuse the two together and get this weapon.
</li><li> The Gungnir. In addition to being a source weapon that can be picked up as you go through the game (meaning you do not even have to build it up from the paltry spear), most of the souls required to build the Gungnir are enemies that are <em>easily</em> farmed (and it requires no boss souls, meaning you still have a shot for the Chaos Ring). The final soul, which is in the Pinnacle, can be farmed almost comically, because the bugbears needed come neatly lined up in a row for you to kill. And once you've forged it, the normal attack hits twice and has a long reach, and the charge attack goes all the way across the screen. That's right, its attack reach is even LONGER than the gun. The only thing stopping it is off-screen damage.
</li><li> The Claimh Solais needs to be crafted, and is much slower than in Aria, but is still one of the best weapons in the game. It has a special attack that covers most of the screen and does ludicrous damage, at the cost of a fair bit of MP.

<ul><li> The Valmanway returns yet again and continues to be the single most broken weapon for Soma, an already broken character when maxed out. With the correct soul combination he can use it for what is basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">health regeneration with every hit and infinitely floating in one place out of many a boss' attack ranges with the correct soul and accessory combinations.</a> And the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> gets an infinity plus one version with the Valmanway +1. It makes the game incredibly easy for Soma, but insanely boring for anyone who ends up grouped with a Valmanway Soma. Which is likely, as 80% of players online use him for some stupidly boring reason. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWield">Oh, and did we mention you can dual-wield them?</a>

<ul><li> The game hands you a ridiculously powerful sword, the Royal Sword, for a fairly simple quest early on (A-Rank Hunter). It's one of the strongest weapons in the game, boosts <em>several</em> stats, and has only one disadvantage &mdash; a slow swing speed. Its only competition is... the Vampire Killer, which starts out ponderously weak but can be boosted with the defeat of a relatively simple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>. The Vampire Killer is weaker than the Royal Sword, but it's a lot faster and has the quite-useful Holy elemental affinity.
</li><li> Alucard's Spear and the Final Sword. Alucard's Spear is given to you by Wind, the guy who gives out sidequests, if you managed to master the Javelin subweapon (basically killing nearly a thousand enemies with it); the Final Sword is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops">rare drop</a> from a giant armored warrior that, while having only 50 hit points, is resistant to <em>everything</em>.

Namely, there are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword">Laser Blade</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalRapier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalRapier">Estoc</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">Feather Sword</a> (for swords), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerfulPick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerfulPick">Zaghnol</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterScythe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterScythe">Death's Scythe</a> (axes, with the latter being the strongest weapon in the game), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeOnAStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeOnAStick">Chauve-Souris</a> for spears, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist">Force Gloves</a> for knuckles.

To get it, you must solve a puzzle involving weights and balancing a scale out. This puzzle requires combining six hints scattered throughout the ruins, plus weighing yourself on a scale in another area (and figuring out how to translate the numbers on the scale, and that it <em>is</em> a scale), and parts of the hints have eroded away (requiring you to guess at one pair of gems). If you fail the puzzle once and didn't keep a backup save, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">it's gone for good</a>. If you succeed, it's got the highest damage per second and per hit in the game, with or without the software combo that boosts it further.

It does two to three <em>times</em> as much damage as your sword, can hit twice per throw, passes through enemies and obstacles, and ignores height and depth. Its only disadvantages are that it's somewhat slow and can't be spammed indiscriminately.

You need to restrain yourself from desintegrating enemies throughout the game to have the money to get it when it's possible. However, the thing can strip all the soft tissue from any living target in one hit and blows up the strongest robots in three shots that don't take a lot of energy compared to the more common <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">plasma gun</a>. Keep in mind that the micro missile launcher is even more destructive, but its ammo is very rare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">and it's not nearly as much fun.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityBladeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityBladeII">Infinity Blade II</a></em> has an Infinity Plus One <em>Ring</em> &mdash; the Holy Band gives you a level 10 spell (other spells currently max out at 8) which does irresistable damage and heals you for the same amount. Getting it, however, requires you to possess the Infinity Blade, defeat 4 powerful bosses (two in a row without any rest), and use two treasure maps to locate hidden items; obtaining the ring proves you don't need it to succeed.
<ul><li> But there is an even greater weapon which is called the Solar-Trans, which allows any gem put in it to receive a bonus of x10. Combine this with the fact that you can get a +5000 rainbow attack, which comes to a total price of 146 million in-game credits! To put that into perspective, going through the whole game twice will give you about a million.

It's an even trickier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> than most treasures, requiring two other treasures (one unusually placed on the same floor) to keep it from turning into a Potion of Death or an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeItem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeItem">Infinity Subtracted From One Sword</a> that does no damage.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmoredCore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmoredCore">Armored Core</a></em>:
<ul><li> The MOONLIGHT laser blade and the KARASAWA laser rifle usually fall into this category, at least in the earlier games. The former could potentially shave off half an AC's health with one hit and its blade wave produced an explosive energy burst. The latter, with the right parts, made the game laughably easier. The KARASAWA, despite its recurring status, got hit with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">nerf</a> bat after <em>AC2:AA</em>. The MOONLIGHT lost a bit of its destructive power but instead got a significant increase in blade length. Both parts in the first game have to be found in difficult and risky areas.
</li><li> In Project Phantasma, however, both get one-upped by the FINGER part, which you unlock once you top the Arena. One of the lightest parts in the game, but ridiculously overwhelming with its wide-spread, but tightly concentrated rapid fire which gives it extreme close-range power and doubled by the fact it carries 3,000 rounds. Phantasma alone can be killed in less in a minute with this thing.
</li></ul></li><li> In the Virtual Reality demo game <em>Spellfighter VR</em>, near the end of the game's only dungeon, you find the "Green Skull of Lasers" along with a note stating that it should never be assembled. Using it requires both hands; one to hold (and aim) the skull, the other to hold the jaw. If the jaw is touched against the bottom of the skull, it fires extremely powerful green lasers out of the eyes that can tear most enemies apart and makes completing the demo nearly effortless. The only drawback is that the lasers fire for a few seconds, then require a few seconds to recharge. Obviously, you can choose not to take the skull if you prefer a greater challenge, but there's no penalty for using it.

Not only does it do 100 damage, but it can also be charged to do four times as much &mdash; and this is without releasing the God Hand, which adds another multiplier to the damage.

Appropriately, the move is only available through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> and costs 600,000 gold, which is about as much as an average playthrough of the game will net the player, making obtaining it a matter of either ignoring all the powerups to save money, or spending a rather long time in the casino.

In addition to having the best possible stats, it has a siren instead of a horn, which you can use to make all CPU cars slow to a stop while they're within hearing distance! Of course, to get it, you have to unlock every other car (including the damn-good-but-not-quite-the-best car, the Alien Beetle), meaning that all you have left to do is find the hidden bonus and cheat boxes around the tracks (which there's no point in doing with any <em>other</em> car).

To get the Jet Vermillion, you had to A: beat every league (4) on Master difficulty. With the first 9 cars you unlock. You could also do B: race on the Championship Circuit 255 times. That is, all 5 laps, 255 times. You could also take a 3rd option: cheat. Either Gameshark it or use the ingame password system. What makes this an Infinity +/- 1 object is that the car itself is horrible on paper but awesome in practice, because of the one stat not listed in-game: The time it takes to decelerate after a boost runs out. Case in point: it's the car that holds the world records on every course but one, due to its inability to make one jump for a shortcut.

The idea behind the car was essentially "let's go build a race car that isn't bound by any stupid league restrictions!" The car features over 1400 horsepower and weighs only 550 kilograms, and can achieve lateral acceleration levels of 8.75 G's (in comparison, real-life F1 cars get anywhere from 2-4 depending on speed) and has a top speed of over 500 km/h. It is so fast that there is zero competition for it from any AI racers in-game and it is disallowed in all 'serious' online racing rooms. Acquiring the X2010 requires you to score at least Bronze on three time trials that feature the X2010 - the time is actually easy for anyone with simulation racing experience and a wheel, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">but scoring Gold is the hardest challenge in the entire game</a>. Only a handful of people have gotten Gold for all three trials with a standard PS3 controller.
<ul><li> On the other hand, you can actually unlock the car by either reaching A-Spec level 40 or raising your B-Spec driver to 35. It'll take a while after level 30, but hey, at least you won't have to laboriously attempt to complete the 3-race X2010 Time Trial event.

The parts comprise mainly of the Devil Tyres and Engines. Their stats are given as "unimaginable" and can take you from 0-349km/h in a matter of seconds and can stop to a standstill from the maximum speed instantaneously. They are also able to reverse to speeds of 700km/h, making the act of driving backwards faster than driving normally. They can be considered as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>, although all races, challenges, and mini-games have to be completed before being able to unlock the demonic Devil Parts.

When using Nitrous, it can reach 251 mph, can tackle corners like if they were nonexistent, and sticks to the road like it's made of glue. And without the need of slamming in performance upgrades! However, the car costs 580,000 dollars, which means you must grind a lot to get your hands on one of them. Couple it with the fact that this game can get brutally difficult at times, and it's probably best that you just stick with the aforementioned Kawasaki until you give Karol a million dollars to make everything free after beating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Booke</a>.
</li><li> Recent <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeed">Need for Speed</a></em> games, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeedMostWanted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeedMostWanted">Most Wanted 2012</a></em> and <em>Rivals</em>, tend to treat the Koenigsegg Agera and its derivatives like this. Despite being the fastest cars in the games, they still manage to be quite agile <strong>and</strong> resilient to damage. The fact that it's usually the last car to be unlocked means by the time you've gotten it, you're skilled enough to not mess up with it. <em>Rivals</em> in particular made the Koenigsegg One:1, an even more game-breakingly Infinity-Plus-One Car, a <em>free DLC Car</em>. Woe betide anyone who has to face one in a multiplayer match.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeedPayback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeedPayback">Payback</a></em> continues the trend with the Koenigsegg Regera, which is only unlocked after completing the main storyline. It is the only car in the game to break the top speed cap of 375 kph and has very strong acceleration and good handling to boot. Predictably, it has become a staple car in multiplayer playlists alongside the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TierInducedScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TierInducedScrappy">notorious</a> Porsche 911 Carrera RSR 2.8 and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Volkswagen Beetle</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy">Dissidia Final Fantasy</a></em>:
<ul><li> Each character has exclusive weapons, equippable only at Level 100, that are tailor-made to improve their unique aspects, and are usually the best weapons those characters can use (though there are some non-exclusive Level 100 weapons that are more useful). However, none can compare to Exdeath's ultimate weapon: Enuo's Scourge. Aside from its stats (which are good, but just as good as the other ultimate weapons), it has, like the other Exclusives, added effects based around the character. For Enuo's Scourge, those bonuses are Brave Point boost on block, and an effect called Riposte, which makes every attack a critical hit if done to a staggering character. Exdeath's abilities are based around blocks and counterattacks, meaning virtually EVERY hit he does will be done to a staggering opponent, reeling from their attacks being blocked. Boosting his Attack rating will make his critical hits do absurd damage, ensuring you'll be doing <em>several thousand</em> points of damage with each of his counters. And this is with a character designed to counter <em>everything.</em>
</li><li> Several of the heroes' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">EX Modes</a> involve wielding their classic "best weapon". Cloud's Buster Sword becomes Ultima Weapon, Squall's gunblade becomes Lionheart, etc.
<ul><li> An odd case with Prishe, during her EX mode she equips Destroyers, which on her original title are inferior to both the weapons used for her unique level 90 (Sphairai) and level 100 (Glanzfaust) weapons on Dissidia. However the Destroyers were the best weapon a Monk could realistically obtain for a long time. (See the Relic and Mythic entries under Final Fantasy XI below)
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The driving forces behind the events of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries">Soul Series</a></em> of fighting games are the twin swords Soul Calibur and Soul Edge. The Soul Edge was a legendary sword sought after by countless warriors. Unfortunately, said sword is actually an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Artifact of Doom</a>, whose hobbies include devouring souls, slaughtering innocents, and becoming its wielder's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Superpowered Evil Side</a>. The Soul Calibur was a sword created to destroy Soul Edge. The swords are often the ultimate weapons of the characters. Ironically, the motives of many characters revolve around destroying one or both of the swords, rather than claiming them as their own.
<ul><li> In most of the games, each character can unlock a version of one or both swords - in <em>Soul Calibur II</em>, for example, every character has Soul Edge, but only a few have Soul Calibur. Generally, though, Soul Edge will leech off your lifebar - would you expect otherwise? - and those characters who don't have Soul Calibur generally have another really souped-up weapon. Sometimes these weapons not only increase attack strength but <em>refill your lifebar at an insane rate</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss">making this the bane of your existence if you encounter the CPU wielding such a weapon in the story mode</a>.
<ul><li> Inverted with the joke weapons, like Mitsurugi's bokken, Taki's tobacco pipes, Seung Mina's broom, and Link's bug-catching net. They make weird sounds in place of the usual slashing or swooshing sound effects, e.g. the broom reminds the player of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs">a certain animated film</a>, the tobacco pipes sound like hollow tubes being swung around, etc. The game's description of these weapons always includes something to the effect of it lulling an opponent into a false sense of security and self-assuredness, making said opponent easier to take down with these "weapons".
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Soul Calibur Legends</em> for the Wii, the main character wielding a fully-powered Soul Edge with a certain amount of spirit power/mana or whatever you call it can activate a special attack that does nearly half a bar of damage to an opposing player. It IS the Soul Edge we are talking about...
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate">Super Smash Bros.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2">Left 4 Dead 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Sniper Rifle and Laser sight can be considered one such weapon. The base Sniper Rifle kills any non-special infected in 1 shot, and most specials in 2 or 3. It also has semi-auto fire capability. The problem is, if you walked and fired with it (which, given the game's gauntlet crescendos, will be very often), the accuracy is so pathetically diminished you'd be wasting more ammo than with a full automatic rifle. However, getting the Laser sight almost completely erases this problem, and it effectively becomes a shotgun (the only other non-special weapon that can cause a kill with one shot to anywhere on the body) with 300 bullets (the tier 2 shotguns all have only about 130 bullets).
</li><li> In The Passing campaign, there's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">M60</a>, a huge machine gun that never has to be reloaded, kills common infected in a single shot, and can shred a Tank fairly quickly thanks to its firepower and no reloading required. The only downside is the gun cannot have its ammo replenished and it can only be found once or twice in the whole campaign.
</li><li> The Mutation Game Mode "Gib Fest" is basically <em>a whole mode built on this trope</em>. You start off with the aforementioned M60 machine gun as your primary weapon with the Magnum as your secondary. The clincher is the M60 has infinite ammo and never has to reload. You can literally go through the entire game holding down the trigger button (which incidentally is the best way to earn one of the harder achievements) and even better if you can somehow find a laser sight somewhere along the way.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeLauncher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeLauncher">Grenade Launcher</a> tops all other weapons in the game. It's rare to find and its ammo cannot be replenished, but direct blasts to the infected kill them in a single shot and all other infected who are in the way. The weapon is the only one in the game that can cause infected to stumble, including the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> Witch. Only the Tank and the Charger are immune to being stumbled from the weapon.
</li></ul></li><li> The FarSight from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark">Perfect Dark</a></em>: an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportedAlienPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportedAlienPhlebotinum">Imported Alien Phlebotinum</a> sniper rifle that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">massively overpowering</a> and features tremendous penetration to the point of being able to shoot through almost any wall and barrier, coupled with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfraredXRayCamera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfraredXRayCamera">Infrared X-Ray Camera</a> scope that <em>tracks other players for you</em>. Yes, that's right: it can see through walls. The only disadvantages to it were a slight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SniperScopeSway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SniperScopeSway">Sniper Scope Sway</a> and a slow firing rate, but the rest of its attributes more than made up for it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Quake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Quake">Quake</a></em>, the lightning gun comes close to such a true weapon, especially when Quadded, and approaches a GM-level, Not Meant For Mortals level of weapon. If you include the 2x Rune from the quasi-official Capture The Flag mod, and yes, it did make it 8x, then no player could survive the briefest of swats from it. In fact, not much short of Superman or the magically, AKA mathematically, invulnerable could survive 8 lightning bolts at once, or, in game terms, approximately 800 dps, continuous. And that's in Quake terms, where a fighter with max armor (armor = hp there) and double health had about 450 hp equivalent. 900 hp, if you count the damage-halving rune from CTF. 1000 hp if he had that and chugged two of the max-health power ups, thus they'd last a little over 1 second under the strain. Scale that to the top end tank in the game of your choice.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands">Borderlands</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2">Borderlands 2</a></em>, any legendary item can qualify. The first game had the Hellfire, a powerful fire SMG that just decimated all in its path. The second game brings it back, and adds the Bee shield. What makes it so unique is that it's an amp shield, a new type that increases the damage of the first shot fired while the shield is charged at the cost of draining the shield. The Bee, however, <em>doesn't</em> drain when amping a shot, <em>and</em> has the highest amp damage in the game, making it able to pump out metric craptons of extra damage. It was <em>so</em> broken, that it has the dubious honor of being the first specific piece of equipment to have its stats alter in a patch.
<ul><li> There is also the Norfleet, a reward for fighting certain Raid Bosses, and can quickly cover an entire battlefield with a metric f&mdash;ktonne of elemental damage, the only downside being that you might be in the blast radius...
</li><li> The blast radius of the Norfleet works to your advantage with the Sham, an infinity+1 shield. The Sham has between a 76% to 94% chance to absorb ammo shot at you; when using the Norfleet, the insane blast radius counts as a rocket that is absorbed by the Sham almost all the time. This allows for near INFINITE rocket launcher ammo. Putting these items together turns the Norfleet from an infinity+1 sword to an infinity times 10 sword (or rocket launcher, as the case may be).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NosferatuTheWrathOfMalachi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NosferatuTheWrathOfMalachi">Nosferatu: The Wrath of Malachi</a></em>: It's only possible to get the Machine Gun late in the game. While individual shots do less damage than other guns, it has 31 bullets in a clip and fires extremely fast, and reloads quite quickly as well, allowing it to bring down any enemy with relative ease. Since you've been collecting ammo for it throughout the game, you're unlikely to run out, provided you don't use it excessively.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx">Deus Ex</a></em> has the Dragon Tooth sword. It's the strongest weapon and you can get it halfway through the game. Of course, the drawbacks of a melee weapon compared to shooting weapons are obvious. Oddly, it can't break open lockers like its regular sword counterparts can.

And reinforcement values from +10 (or +12 for weapons) onward increase those properties exponentially. However, with every new level of reinforcement the success chance decreases by a set percent, and failure at higher levels destroy the weapon/equipment. The only way to counter this is to use tickets to protect the item...at the cost of <em>all</em> reinforcement levels.
<ul><li> The Amplification process is similar, and also adds an additional stat bonus to any of the four main stats. But this is even more expensive (both material and gold-wise) and riskier to do due to the fact that it can't be used in items already reinforced and are not cursed to begin with. And every failure at an Amplification level of +7-+9 resets all Amplification levels to zero, with the aforementioned penalty of the item being destroyed at +10 or higher.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> Zigzags this trope with what is this trope in each expansion. In <em>A Realm Reborn</em>, it was the Relic Weapons, which surpassed all other weapons in the expansion. In <em>Heavensward</em>, the Relic Weapons were almost automatically superseded by the Coven weapons in the Diadem, extremely rare weapons that only show up in emergencies. <em>Stormblood</em> immediately returns to the Relic Weapons as the best.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranblueFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranblueFantasy">Granblue Fantasy</a></em> has numerous examples:
<ul><li> The Bahamut weapons not only have the highest skill boosts in the entire game, but they boost based on race rather than element, allowing them to be splashed across multiple elements. However, in order to get one, you have to fight Bahamut, one of the hardest bosses in the game, and in order to fully upgrade it, you have to fight an even harder form of Bahamut meant for High Level players.
</li><li> The Xeno weapons are the few weapons to have the Massive boost in their skills (the only other ones as of writing are Final Uncap Premium Gala weapons), have powerful charge attacks, and can be upgraded in a more powerful True form, but in order to get them, you have to participate in the difficult Xeno clash events.
</li><li> The Class Champion weapons provide boosts to their respective class lines when wielded, and getting one of them unlocks the Tier IV classes. Getting one involves farming the materials from Co-Op mode.
</li><li> In terms of characters, the Eternals/Guild Wars Characters are among some of the most powerful characters in the game. In order to get one though, you have to fully upgrade an Infinity Plus One Weapon known as the Revenant Weapon. Months of grinding are needed to gather all the materials to gather the weapons, you can only get enough copies for one fully uncapped weapon only once every time the bi-monthly Guild War event comes around, and each Eternal corresponds to a different weapon type, meaning that if you want all ten Eternals, you'll need to fully upgrade at least ten different weapons. And have fun going to through the lengthy process to fully uncap the guild war character.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokOnline">Ragnarok Online</a></em> has the godlike equipments. Each is made by a quest that takes certain almost unattainable items dropped from the castles, so only the leader of a guild can get them. AND, if that wasn't enough, the quests themselves are unlocked by having yet another uncanny quest completed by 50 diferent players. And the items ARE worth it, even.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> There is a set of weapons that are extremely difficult to acquire. So much so that they have their own rarity category, Legendary. Some of these items drop from certain bosses at ludicrously low rates (Illidan's Twin Glaives of Azzinoth, Thori'dal), others require a number of pieces of the item that drop from bosses at a high rate which combine to form a broken version of the item that has to be repaired through some sort of quest (Atiesh, Val'anyr), others combine the best of both worlds and require multiple items with ludicrously low drop rates that the player must use as part of a quest to form them (Thunderfury, Sulfuras). Additionally, the Kael'thas fight in Tempest Keep temporarily grants the entire 25-player raid fighting him a number of these items (which fade in 15 minutes or when you leave the area) as a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower">11th-Hour Superpower</a>.
</li><li> Updates to Wrath of the Lich King added two more Legendary class items: Val'anyr, a mace for use by healers that must be crafted from rare drops from Ulduar bosses, requiring a number of trips through the instance to gather them; and Shadowmourne, the sister-axe to Frostmourne, the sword borne by Arthas himself. It can only be obtained at the end of a very long questline requiring many trips through Icecrown Citadel to gather rare crafting materials and feeding the nascent axe the souls of 1000 inhabitants of the instance, culminating with the defeat of many of the hardest bosses in the instance while the wielder of the nascent axe does special actions during the battle.
</li><li> The Cataclysm brought 2 more weapons. The first being Dragonwrath, a new caster staff that requires going into Firelands for mats and in the Nexus dungeon up in Northrend. Said staff can also grant the wielder its own unique flying mount. The 2nd is the Fangs of the Father, a pair of daggers made only for a Rogue. The questline requires going into the Dragon Soul raid to gather the mats and going to Ravenholdt and Gilneas for the specific questlines.
</li><li> <em>Legion</em> gives a unique weapon to each specialization of every class. Besides growing more powerful as players advance, players acquire each one by going through a (usually) unique scenario tailored to their class and/or specialization.

<ul><li> The ultimate weapon in RuneScape is the Deathtouched Dart. It instantly kills almost anything in the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">in one hit</a>, except for a small number of bosses that are immune or are only sent to the next phase of the fight, and it also can't be used against players. Deathtouched darts can only be obtained as prizes during special events or occasionally they may be purchased for 5 million gold from the Traveling Merchant's Shop.
</li><li> The very best gear in the game are Primal weapons and armor (for Melee), Saggitarian weapons and armor (for Ranged), and Celestial weapons and armor (for Magic), and also the Hexhunter longbow, at tier 99, except for the Hexhunter longbow, which is tier 98. However, all of these items can only be used in Dungeoneering.
</li><li> In the rest of the game, the very best two handed weapons currently are the Zaros Godsword, the Seren Godbow, and the Staff of Sliske, at tier 92. All of these are obtained by fighting the superboss <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaiasVengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaiasVengeance">Telos</a>.
</li><li> The best shields in the game currently are the Malevolent Kitshield, the Vengeful Kiteshield, and the Merciless Kiteshield at tier 90.
</li><li> The best one handed weapons in the game currently are the Blightbound crossbows for Ranged, the Wand of the Praesul and Imperium Core for Magic, and the Kopesh of Tumeken and the Kopesh of Elidinis for Melee, which are tier 92. They are obtained, respectively, from defeating the superbosses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenTreesAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenTreesAttack">Solak</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngelOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngelOfDeath">Nex</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArchmage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArchmage">The Magister</a>.
</li><li> The best power armors in the game currently are Malevolent armor, Sirenic armor, and Tectonic armor, which are tier 90, although these armor sets do not include hand and foot items, although there are tier 90 power foot armor called hailfire boots, Flarefrost boots, and Emberkeen boots and tier 90 power hand items called Celestial hand wraps, Razorback gauntlets, and Ascension grips. The introduction of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Elite Dungeons</a> included items that can be used to upgrade Sirenic and Tectonic armour to tier 92 Elite versions.
</li><li> The best tank armors in the game currently are Achto Telalith armor, Achto Tempest armor, and Achto Primeval armor. These are obtained from participating in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">Mazcab Raids</a>.
</li><li> The best cape in the game is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion">Completionist</a> cape, which has better stats than any other cape and has the abilities of most of other capes in the game except for the Skill capes, which you can combine up to three of which with the Completionist cape to give it their abilities.
</li><li> The best neck slot item in the game are the amulet of souls (or), which does not have any level requirements.
</li><li> The Godsword, a two handed level 75 melee weapon, for a long time was the strongest weapon (there were no other weapons requiring a skill that high) before it was overtaken by the chaotic weapons at level 80, which are obtained from Dungeoneering. The introduction of chaotic weapons made it possible to kill a boss solo that formerly required a group. It is the most powerful melee weapon in the "Old School" version of <em>RuneScape</em>.
</li><li> The Chaotic weapons were unseated by the level 85 Tetsu (Melee), Seasinger (Magic), and Death Lotus (Ranged) equipment, which are obtained through the high-level minigame Player-owned Ports. These in turn were surpassed by the level 90 Drygore (Melee), Ascension (Ranged), Seismic (Magic), and Noxious (all three) weapons, which are obtained from various difficult bosses - and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep">these in turn were unseated</a> by the level 92 weapons mentioned above.
</li><li> However, many considered the Abyssal whip, which is tier 70, to be superior to the Godsword due to it being much faster and allowing the player to wield a shield.
</li><li> The most powerful items available to players in the free version of the game are the Corrupt Dragon items. They have the same stats as the Member's Only Dragon items, but they disintegrate after being worn for 30 minutes.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarOnline2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarOnline2">Phantasy Star Online 2</a></em> has the Austere weapons, which have the highest ATK stats in each of their individual weapon categories. They can only be obtained through one of two methods: Clearing the raid event "Progeny of the Apocalypse"/"Perennial Apocalypse" and receiving it as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareRandomDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareRandomDrop">Rare Random Drop</a>, or trading for it through an NPC named Zieg. The latter method will always give you an Austere with decent Abilities and 30 Light element, but the method to acquire one is <em>exhausting</em>; it requires you to first play the aforementioned raid event enough times to collect 100 Caligula stones and 100 Excubes to get a weaker version of the goal weapon. To actually get an Austere, you then need to farm not only that raid event more, but you also have to farm a ton of other endgame content, including Extreme Quests, Ultimate Quests, and Challenge Quests for items needed for the trade, on top of the weaker version you bought earlier. The worst part is, to finish upgrading it using the easy method, you need <strong>two</strong>; the second one is required to bring its elemental value to 60 Light, which will significantly boost its maximum damage potential. Ironically, it's only marginally better than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">Infinity -1 Sword</a>, the Orbit series, which deals a few less percent in damage but has a far more useful Potential.

The reason for this is because Gadgetron deemed the weapon too dangerous and not only discontinued it, but scattered the blueprint throughout the galaxy (the guy who gives you the thing in exchange for the complete blueprint even casually mentions it's banned in <strong>three</strong> galaxies).

The other 2 you can get in 2 side quest missions, that are the most difficult missions in the entire game (the last mission is a walk in the park after this). One involves killing an insanely powerful Warboss after going through waves and waves of looted tanks and nobs. This is the easy one. The hard one involves killing an Eldar Avatar of Khaine that is invulnerable to all melee weapons short of power fists and some ranged ones, after going through scores off Fire Prism tanks to get to him. And both of them have at least 100 times more hit points then all your units combined. And they heal.</span>
</li><li> Avitus. One of the reasons for this is another IPOS: Neverending Hail of Destruction. This godly Heavy Bolter can do ungodly amounts of damage to almost everyone (except against Monstrous Creatures or vehicles, for which the punishment is reduced, but your team will have other stuff to counter these problems anyway). If you bring it to the final battle and turn on Focus Fire frequently, Avitus can basically hold a section of the line on his own. You can't use it while wearing Terminator Armor, however.
</li><li> From the expansions, there's the Golden Armour of the Custodes and the Golden Cage for your Force Commander in Chaos Rising, a set of Powered Armour and Terminator armour, respectively; they are extremely nice to have, but are also rather hard to find and require you to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness">fully faithful to the God Emperor</a> to use.

In the second expansion, <em>Retribution</em>, we get the absolute craziest example in the Daemon Sword for Lord Eliphas the Inheritor, which has the absolute highest melee damage of any weapon in the game and which can allow him to slaughter Terminators in one hit on any difficulty, go toe to toe with bosses and emerge unscathed, and which also allow him to regenerate a massive amount of health with any hit.

Near the end of the Human campaign, Arthas and Muradin believe it is their only hope of defeating a powerful demon. When they finally find it, however, Muradin reads the description on the dais and realizes that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnholyHolySword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnholyHolySword">the blade is cursed</a></span>.

Arthas successfully uses Frostmourne to kill the demon <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(though <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> reveals it to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">Not Quite Dead</a>)</span>, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the sword steals his soul and turns him into a Death Knight</span>.
<ul><li> It fits in terms of gameplay, too, though it's only usable in one level. While wielding it, Arthas gets a boost to his damage dealt and his basic attack becomes Chaos-type, which means it tears buildings apart just as easily as regular units. When combined with Divine Shield (which, as you've maxed his level out by now, makes him invulnerable for 30 seconds), it lets Arthas actually destroy Scourge bases on his own.

The REAL <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> is the result of many dungeon runs and a painstaking amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting">Item Crafting</a>.

However, the fire rate speeds up and after five volleys its charging time is reduced to 1.1 second, faster than any shield's recharging speed. This means that given enough time, this single weapon can take down any enemy, <em>including the final boss.</em> This is also one of the rarest weapon in the game, requiring a lot of luck to obtain.
</li><li> In the same vein, the Weapon Pre-Igniter, a ship augment that lets you start off each battle with a cheery full barrage of weapons at the enemy ship. Skipping the long load times of your weapons will save you a fortune in repairs.

<ul><li> Before the Halloween Update, the best offensive item was probably Dr. Fetus, which would shoot high-damage bombs at enemies while also making placed bombs almost meaningless. To get it, you must beat what was then the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a> six times, meaning you need to be very good at the game in order to unlock it.

</li><li> The Halloween update adds Mom's Knife, which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">Difficult, but Awesome</a> that leans heavily towards the Awesome side. Unlocked by beating the new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a> as Isaac, you would throw a high-damage knife that hit frequently.
</li><li> The <em>Wrath of the Lamb</em> DLC adds Epic Fetus, unlocked by beating one of the new challenges. One-upping Dr. Fetus, it allows you to drop missiles onto enemies. What's also neat about it is that, unlike Dr. Fetus, it did not get nerfed inn <em>Rebirth</em>, and it's still one of the best items in the game.
</li><li> <em>Rebirth</em> has as its ultimate offensive item Godhead, which is unlocked by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">beating Boss Rush, Mom's Heart, Isaac, Satan, ???, and the Lamb on Hard with a One Hit Point Wonder.</span> It is an adjusted version of Sacred Heart, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">Infinity -1 Sword</a> of <em>Wrath of the Lamb</em>, with the added bonus of adding a full-damage, multi-hitting, large-radius halo around all tears.
</li><li> <em>Afterbirth</em> ramps it up even further: beating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a> with every character unlocks the Mega Beam, which is the longest-cooldown active item in the game. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">It creates a long-lasting beam that persists between rooms and instakills all enemies including bosses.</a>

</li><li> The Fulgent Impeller engine, on the other hand, has one of the most difficult quest chains in the entire game, including extremely expensive ransoms or difficult rescues of a certain prisoner at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcatraz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcatraz">Wisdom prison</a>, buying off one of the rarest products of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechanicalAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechanicalAbomination">the Dawn Machine</a> using either the Memento Mori or ludicrous amounts of supplies, crew and tactical info, snatching a secret from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation">Frostfound's deepest chambers</a>, and ferrying massive amounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KrakenAndLeviathan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KrakenAndLeviathan">Kraken and Leviathan</a> bones to Kingeater's Castle, one of the most feared places in the setting.

In New Game+, you gain the option of buying Zemurian ore shards with U-Materials at exchange stores, but it still costs 50-70 U-Materials (which are a rare random drop) per shard, and 3-4 shards per stone (the cost per shard and number of shards needed varies between games in the series) so you're likely only to end up with enough to make 1-2 new stones per playthrough if you don't have a DLC that gives more. Since there are at least half a dozen party members that can receive Zemurian weapons in each game, it's likely to take multiple playthroughs to get one for each of them (most players prioritize who gets the ones in the first playthrough based on how often they are available to be in the party in the second).

</li><li> The same goes for most of the other characters; their ultimate weapons (and some other equipment) are also 1/256 random drops from specific enemies. Ryu, on the other hand, gets the Emperor Sword, which is obtainable from a highly remote fishing spot that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">Permanently Missable</a> once you open the door to Infinity.

<ul><li> Frog has as his central life's goal the acquisition of an "ultimate" sword called Masamune. Of course, since it is obtained as part of the plot relatively early on, it is supplanted by vastly superior weapons as the game goes forward. One of the endgame quests that can be undertaken before the battle with Lavos is a quest to refine the Masamune into an even <em>more</em> ultimate sword, which is truly Frog's best weapon. However, since both the acquisition of the Masamume and the upgrading of it are plot-based, it doesn't carry over to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, and as such, a savvy player will not sell the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">Brave Sword</a> upon upgrading the Masamune.
</li><li> Giving a certain stone to Melchior late in the game will allow him to create the Rainbow Sword for Crono, arguably <em>the</em> most powerful weapon in the game, with a ridiculously high critical hit ratio (70%!!).
</li><li> The DS Remake rewards you for defeating the new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> with an even more ultimate weapon (The Dream Blade/Dreamseeker) for Crono with an even more ridiculously high critical hit ratio (<em>90</em>%!!!).

Before you can get the Rainbow Sword, for example, Lucca uses that same stone to create the Wonder Shot, a gun with randomized damage output which is, on average, the strongest weapon in her arsenal, by far.
</li><li> At the end of his personal end-game sidequest, Robo picks up two weapons: the Terra Arm and the Crisis Arm. The Terra Arm is his best weapon by stats alone. The Crisis Arm has the potential to be even stronger then that. Its damage algorithm is decided by the last digit in his current HP count. If that number is 0, it does nothing. If that number is 9...
</li><li> Ayla, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk">fights with her bare hands</a>, starts out with her weapon classified as "Fists". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrind">Level Grind</a> her enough and that will change to "Iron Fists" which confuse enemies on a hit.

Single. Time.</em> In the DS remake, you can earn an accessory from the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a> that can only be equipped to Ayla. The Valor Crest not only gives her a 50% counterattack rate when hit, but it boosts her critical hit rate. Now, imagine the possibilities of combining that with the Bronze Fists.
</li><li> Also in the DS remake, Robo can obtain a weapon with the same effect as the Bronze Fists.
</li><li> Marle's is the Venus Bow. Unlike the others, it always does 777 damage. While this tends to be less impressive in the late game (Crono's swords tend to do more than twice that with a critical), it means she does 777 damage to every enemy, <em>including</em> those with enormous defense or outright immunity to weapons. That <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime">Wonder Rock</a> that takes damage in tens and twenties, and throws a volcanic eruption as a counterattack?

It's helped by the fact that everyone can equip it. The only problem is that the tail is so rare, you will spend hours aimlessly walking around their very small spawn area because the combined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters">encounter</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops">drop rate</a> is around 1 in 16082. This subquest was expanded in the DS remake: now there are several critters that drop tails at ridiculously low rates.

</li><li> The Excalipur/Excalipoor, a sword used by an anticlimactic boss near the end; while its attack stat was incredibly high, it would usually do a ridiculously low amount of damage. That is, unless you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">threw it or used it with Goblin Punch</a>, either of which ignored its special effects...

<ul><li> What is actually <em>named</em> Ultima Weapon is the Infinity + 1, but its mechanics keep it from being useful until the final dungeon, even though you can acquire it relatively early in the game with little effort. Its attack power depends on the user's max HP and level and it ignores defense, so at higher levels, it'll do several thousand damage a swing. and with the right stat bonuses, it can easily do 9999 damage.
</li><li> The Lightbringer. It has 255 power, boosts Speed, Strength, Stamina, and Magic by 7 (+ 7 is the highest boost any equipment piece gives), and + 50 Evade and Magic Block. It also automatically scores a critical hit at the low cost of 20 MP per attack, and has a random chance to cast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyHandGrenade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyHandGrenade">Holy</a> to do even more damage. You get the Lightbringer by betting the Ragnarok in the Colosseum, which is also a very good sword in its own right, though inferior to the Lightbringer.

Some of them have bits of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>, but there literally isn't a single one that doesn't have the requisite hints in the game itself. Level 4 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Breaks</a>, on the other hand, are either stupidly simple to get, or require acts so bizarre as to make you wonder what the hell the developers were smoking. The worst is Tifa's Final Heaven, which requires you to play a piano in a flashback, choosing a particular option, then a minimum of <em>twenty hours later</em>, go back to that same piano and play the same tune from memory. And if you don't have Tifa in your party, it doesn't work. Whoops.
</li><li> The weapons themselves don't become ultra-powered in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em>, but Squall's final weapon gives him his final Limit Break: 17 consecutive hits that almost always do 9999 damage each. If he gets an 8-hit wind-up, that's 250,000 damage &mdash; more HP than the final boss has. Squall will always get the full range of hits on Ultimecia, because he gets a special Renzokuken attack sequence for the final boss.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em>, where Steiner's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> is supposedly the Excalibur II. In practice, however, his Ragnarok is the <strong>real</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a>, since the Excalibur II is more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">Bragging Rights Reward</a> than anything else. This is because you can only get the latter sword by going go from the start of the game to a point roughly halfway through the final dungeon and search in a specific area, <em>in less than 12 hours</em>. In a game that spans <em><strong>four discs</strong></em>. This time limit is infamous for making it almost impossible to get the sword on the EU version due to the game not having been adapted to the European 50Hz refresh rate, which makes it run a bit slower while the timer (which is linked to the PSX clock) runs normally. The only way to still get the sword in those versions is to exploit a bug and open the console's disc hatch whenever a video cutscene starts, which allows you to skip them and saving you <em>just</em> enough time to get the sword, if you are lucky. Note that to do all this, you will miss out on a huge amount of other content for the game-the Excalibur II really doesn't count as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> because it is all but <em>impossible</em> to get if you play the game normally.

Auron's in particular is nearly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> &mdash; it boosts his damage based on how injured he is, making it possible to deal maximum damage (and one-hit-kill most compulsory bosses) at a relatively low level if he's badly injured.
<ul><li> Yuna's Nirvana is also relatively easy to acquire and power up (and since the quest involves acquiring all the aeons, which are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> heaven, it should probably be done anyway) and it allows her to cast any spell for 1 MP.

These weapons include the Ultima Weapon (of course), the Danjuro, the Whale Whisker, the Tournesol, and the Zodiac Spear. Ironically, the Zodiac Spear, most powerful of them all, is actually the easiest of the game's uber-weapons to get...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">provided one has a strategy guide so one knows which chests not to open in the early part of the game</a>.

</li><li> <em>IZJS/Zodiac Age</em> introduce many new weapons that are upgrades to the ones from previous versions, and in addition <em>Zodiac Age</em> also makes Wyrmhero Blade accessible sooner via Trial Mode, so you'll actually get to use it time. It also introduces two new special invisible weapons that don't require license and are stronger than anything, but to get them requires insane luck or preparation: Great Trango must be stolen from Zodiark with probability of 3% or 6% with Thief's cuffs (and then you'll need to survive against Zodiark as well) and Seitengrat, the only weapon with more than <em>200</em> power, is obtained with 1% chance from a chest that appears only %1 of time.

Using these weapons gives the AP + 1 ability in the addition to the weapon's normal effects... this is the only way to get this ability. Even though these are the Ultimate Weapons, more upgrades are available. Leveling the sword to maximum power requires an additional 1.6 Million gil, though this is hardly necessary; a fully-leveled team can quickly defeat the final <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> using fully-powered Tier 2 or basic Tier 3 (Ultimate) weapons.

Each character also has a special weapon that can't even be purchased until after beating the final boss. Even then, the necessary components require prolonged farming of Yomi, a nasty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> that is as tough as anything else that the player will face in the game.

After going through an incredibly grueling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with freaking <em>Yiazmat</em> as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a></span> <em>ten times</em>, the Anastasia becomes the most powerful weapon available to Vaan. How powerful? He'll be able to take down the aforementioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> <em>by himself</em>. It doesn't even stop at ten times; in theory, with enough grinding, it's possible for Vaan to become enough of a powerhouse that he'll even one-hit-kill the final boss fight's level 100 Bahamut (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors">which his attacks are usually ineffective against</a>).

They seem to have a unique element associated with them that bosses (and Dwelgs, for some reason) are weak against. There's even one boss that can only be killed with the mystic weapons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyCrystalChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyCrystalChronicles">Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles</a></em> had a set of Infinity Plus One equipment for each of the four races. The problem? To get items created, you have to get an item's crafting scroll, and the right materials, and then take them to a blacksmith and have it made. All of the ultimate weapons require a rare drop, sometimes multiples, from the boss of a particular dungeon, and virtually require you to own a Game Boy Advance to know how to get enough points to have a chance of that drop set appearing. This is mitigated by the consolation prize: Even if the item you want doesn't appear, there's still some good loot to be had.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV">Final Fantasy XV</a></em> has one of these for every weapon type in the game. Many of them are only available after beating the main game, but a select few are available before beating the final boss without qualifying as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">-1 Swords</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note24flz');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note24flz" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note24flz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Main playable Noctis can use any weapons the player likes, with Broadswords being exclusive to him; his three teammates are limited to two weapon types each</span>
<ul><li> Noctis' best broadsword is dependent on the player's fighting style. Balmung (acquired from one of a series of hidden labyrinths in the post-game), has the highest attack stat, but suffers a damage reduction as his MP is reduced, thus limiting its usefulness in a drawn-out fight to players accustomed to perfect dodging and frequent point-warping to keep MP topped up. For MP-heavy fighting styles, the Ultima Blade serves better, acquired by upgrading Noctis' default Engine Blade three times.
</li><li> The Apocalypse (also from the hidden labyrinths) is the best greatsword (Gladiolus' primary), and gets stronger if the wielder's HP is below 30%.
</li><li> The Flayer (also also from the hidden labyrinths) is the best polearm (Ignis' secondary), and offers a whopping +80% damage to any combo finishers that land successfully.
</li><li> The Zwill Crossblades (defeat a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> during the post-game) are the best daggers (Ignis' primary), with a damage boost if the wielder's HP is full (including having had max HP reduced), <em>without</em> being reduced to weaker-than-another if it isn't.
</li><li> The Death Penalty (hidden labyrinths again, <em>or</em> defeat a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> available during the main game) is the best gun (Prompto's primary), with a 1% chance to inflict <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">instant death</a> on any enemy that isn't immune to it, which rolls for <em>every shot</em>.
</li><li> The Aegis Shield (yep, hidden labyrinths) is the best shield (Gladiolus' secondary), with a 10% chance to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sell</a> <em>any given hit</em>.
</li><li> The Drillbreaker Plus (clear an optional quest during the main game, then upgrade the Drillbreaker you get from it) is the machinery weapon (Prompto's secondary) with the best attack stat, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">but</a> every machinery weapon has a unique secondary attack, so the stat alone doesn't determine the best weapon for a given situation.

The very best are generally only obtainable in the post-game Heart Prison, at which point the only enemies worth using them on that are left are the bonus bosses in said Prison.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em>: Ultima Weapon is the recurring ultimate Keyblade in the series, to be equipped by your player character. Donald and Goofy have their own recurring ultimate weapons in the numbered titles, in the form of the Save the Queen staff and the Save the King shield. As a general rule, numbered titles have Ultima available during the main storyline, while the other titles have it hidden behind the postgame.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> has Ultima Weapon as the final synthesized item, available only after you've made everything else at least once. Save the King and Save the Queen are unlocked by completing the Hades Cup in Olympus Coliseum under the solo and timed challenges.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Kingdom Hearts II</a></em>, Ultima Weapon can once again be synthesized, this time after acquiring its recipe shortly before acquiring access to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">The Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a>. Save the Queen and Save the King can also be synthesized, with their recipes hidden in various worlds during the revisits. Fenrir (defeat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Sephiroth</a>) has a higher Strength stat, and Fatal Crest (clear the Goddess of Fate Cup) has a higher Magic stat, than the Ultima Weapon, while being worse in the opposite stat. Save the Queen and Save the King also have + versions that can be synthesized after making the originals once, with different abilities. Which particular weapon is best depends on the individual player.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts358DaysOver2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts358DaysOver2">358/2 Days</a></em>, the Zero Gear is the most powerful weapon panel, unlocking the trademark weapons of the Organization members. Ultima Weapon is instead an ability panel that provides a huge boost to any weapon's attack power.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsBirthBySleep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsBirthBySleep">Birth by Sleep</a></em> has the Ultima Weapon again, and a Keyblade made out of ice cream called Sweetstack that is slightly weaker but has a 100 percent Critical rate. The US version of the game adds No Name, which is more magically inclined than the Ultima Weapon, and the Final Mix adds the Royal Radiance, which is truly the strongest weapon in the game, combining the best qualities of all of them, and having the unique ability to fill the command gauge faster.

Both abilities previously given to other, supposedly less powerful Keyblades in <em>II</em>. Combo Boost in particular belonged to the Decisive Pumpkin, which had equal strength, often making it a superior choice for damage output against the superbosses than Ultima</span>, and Situation Boost, which made the Situation Gauge fill much faster, allowing you to access Ultimate Form, any other equipped Keyblade's forms, or Grand Magic much sooner. Best of all, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">Bragging Rights Reward</a> is even more averted due to a later patch allowing all of a cleared file's Keyblades, including Ultima, to be carried over to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, and though it now has to be upgraded like the others, it's still much stronger than most of them at Level 1<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4lrxs');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4lrxs" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4lrxs');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Only the DLC-added Oblivion is as strong in base stats</span>, and unlike them, has all three amazing abilities from the get-go.
<ul><li> Save the Queen and Save the King can be synthesized as in II, this time with + versions that have <em>added</em> abilities rather than just different ones and are thus soundly superior; the ability to synthesize Ultima Weapon, Save the Queen+, and Save the King+ is unlocked after acquiring one of every type of synthesis material save for the post-game exclusives.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a></em> has three brands of these.
<ul><li> The Devil's Arms have variable attack power based on how many enemies the character in question has killed throughout the course of the game, and you could even save the kill-count for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> for truly insane power. However, this power was only unlocked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">after beating the game's toughest boss</a> (although there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel">Brutal</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a> that's unrelated, so they're not pointless). If a given character hasn't killed enough enemies, however, these weapons won't be your tops.
</li><li> The Meltokio Coliseum has several tournaments available in the player's choice of group fights or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelBoss">Duel Bosses</a>. Clearing the highest-level solo tournaments would give each character a high-level weapon, and for most, this is their best. Because Lloyd has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceAndDiceSwordsmanship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceAndDiceSwordsmanship">individual "slash" and "thrust" stats</a> for his weapons, the weapon he gets from the Coliseum is his highest-level <em>thrust</em> weapon.
</li><li> Five characters have individually better weapons that they can get from alternative sources. Presea and Regal need to speak to certain NPCs once they've reached level 80 to obtain their best weapons. Genis gets his best as the prize from a minigame. Zelos gets his by defeating his sister in a unique event at Meltokio Coliseum. Lloyd's best <em>slash</em> weapon is obtained by defeating a recurring optional boss for the third time.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss">Tales of the Abyss</a></em> had the Catalyst Weapons, which worked roughly the same way as <em>Symphonia</em>'s Devil's Arms: weak as hell when first acquired, attack-power-based-on-kills after beating the most powerful boss in the game. Additionally, said boss also holds the best Capacity Core in the game; you can only acquire this by stealing it from her, and you can only steal from her when she's staggered, which, as you might guess, does not happen often.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia">Tales of Vesperia</a></em>: The Fell Arms work the same way. After you defeat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a>, the Fell Arms' strength increases by the number of kills that the character has acquired. Combine this with the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">cape you receive from defeating Dhaos in the 200 man melee that transforms Destruction Field into a massive attack known as Dhaos Blast</span> and Yuri becomes an absolute monster in battle. The difference here is you can keep the activated weapons on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> and they <em>remain activated</em>. Fortunately the ability to save the kill-count was removed, or they'd be the mother of all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game Breakers</a>. As it is, it still takes a good while to grind enough kills to make them the best weapons again in a new game. The PS3 version added the ability to save the kill count to the grade shop, and isn't particularly expensive either. To compensate (though barely), if you power up all the Fell Arms, the final boss gets a new third form. Also, even with the extreme attack power they can rack up, it'll barely be enough to fight the Spiral Draco.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphoniaDawnOfTheNewWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphoniaDawnOfTheNewWorld">Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World</a></em>, Emil has the Nether Traitor, which, in addition to the highest attack power of all of his weapons, has the incredibly broken Accelerate trait that allows him to lock an enemy into a permanent combo. The Regenerate 3 trait, which restores a sizable chunk of his HP periodically, is just gravy. Marta's Kismet has the highest physical and magical attack of any of her weapons, and will automatically revive her once per battle if she gets knocked out. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomDrop">Good luck getting it.</a>
<ul><li> Though not a weapon, the "Star Breaker" Gauntlets and the "Healer's Ribbon" errr...Ribbon, give you the Technical 3 skill, which means ALL ARTES cost just 1 TP. Couple that with Marta's broken speed casting late game, and you've got an infinite photon/prism sword/divine saber combo, which can trap the final boss, making sure he never TOUCHES YOU.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfXillia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfXillia">Tales of Xillia</a></em> has the Fell Arms, as well. They all drop from separate optional bosses that can be found wandering around specific field and dungeon maps, and the full potential of the weapons is only unlocked after beating the Golden Mage Knight in the bonus dungeon. However, they're practically required if you want the later boss fights on Unknown difficulty to conclude in a reasonable amount of time due to the sheer amount of HP and defense they have.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfXillia2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfXillia2">Tales of Xillia 2</a></em> continues the tradition; however, they're instead obtained by beating the postgame EX Tag Arena with the corresponding party members. The damage is now based on the number of times the character has performed a link attack, which makes it take longer to increase their damage up to the max, but unlike the prequel, getting them to this point <em>will</em> make you destroy absolutely everything in seconds regardless of the difficulty setting.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia">Tales of Phantasia</a></em> has Excalibur, a sword better than the game's purported <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a>, the Eternal Sword. To get it, you need to visit the secret dungeon below the Morlia Mineshaft (which has the most powerful enemies in the game, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">The Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a> notwithstanding). Conveniently, you also get the spear version of this, a weapon you've had once before but had it confiscated, the most powerful offensive magic spell, and the most powerful summon in the game &mdash; four Infinity Plus One Swords for the price of one dungeon.
</li><li> In later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesSeries">Tales</a></em> games (except for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the prequel of <em>Phantasia</em></span>), the Eternal Sword itself was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a>, generally won by defeating Cless, the protagonist of <em>Phantasia</em>, in some kind of arena. He's generally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsDumb">a lot stronger and faster than he was back then.</a> For extra fun, turning the difficulty up adds in either <em>Phantasia</em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage">White Mage</a> or witch. (Keep in mind, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage">White Mage</a> can <em>stop time</em>.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfEternia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfEternia">Tales of Eternia</a></em>, the Eternal Sword was only the ultimate weapon in terms of sheer power, sacrificing other stats for it. Not to mention its Time element weakens it against certain enemies. The game had a few other weapons like it too. The true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> was the Last Fencer. While not as strong in terms of sheer strength, it had no element, and the advantage of raising all stats at once. It also may or may not be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">named after one of the titles</a> Cless gets in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia">Tales of Phantasia</a></em>.

<ul><li> There are a few Infinity Plus One weapons for each weapon class. The best one is probably the Dragon Spear, which has awesome damage and an exclusive waza that also deals a lot of damage.

</li><li> You can get a two for one deal if you are playing as Harid and going for his strongest weapon; the boss guarding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> is a Dragon Ruler! You can net both Sword and Spear in one go.

If you sell off that sword after acquiring a better one, unaware of the inherent and entirely unmentioned potential, you can say bye-bye to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a>. The upside? With a bit of luck and a little more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a>, you can aquire the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> as soon as you can leave town.

It's a very real possibility that, unless you decided to spend a while mid-game grinding up levels for skill points, Roddick will have barely touched Customization by the time you get to this dungeon. Even then you may have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scum</a> a bit to make sure you don't botch the customization.

If you don't get Roddick's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> and settle for the second-best available through plot and Customization later on, the second-best sword causes elemental damage that <em>heals</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a>, just to rub it in a little bit - and you had to sacrifice the <em>real</em> second-best weapon for fighting him to make it in the first place!

It's a grind, however: the weapon only has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareRandomDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareRandomDrop">a 1 in 128 chance of dropping</a>. Ness's is actually found after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoReturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoReturn">Point of No Return</a>, and you can't even save with it without backtracking to the beginning of the last area, and can't use it for anything but <em>that</em> area and the final boss. (He at least has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">Infinity -1 Sword</a>, but that's beside the point.) The Sword of Kings, which is particularly notorious for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">Permanently Missable</a> after beating the boss of the area having the enemy that might drop it, is actually the only weapon which Poo can equip to advantage.

The real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity Plus One Equipment</a> tends to come in the form of accessories like Anne's Cross, a Karin-specific item in Covenant that makes her immune to all status ailments, recovers a small amount of health every turn, and gives a moderate attribute boost.
</li><li> Each of the Valentine family member's ultimate armor is obtained through the lottery, requiring you to track ALL the members and play at least one game with them. Some are hidden in dark dungeons, behind scenery, and saying certain things to them. You need a ticket to play the game, which aren't common. The first game even required you to activate a scene first before meeting the lottery member. The good thing is that member has Margarete's ultimate weapon.
</li><li> Yuri's ultimate weapon can only be obtained if you play a minigame to hit the Judgement Ring ten times while it speeds up at a insane rate. However, considering that Yuri fights <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Those One Bosses</a> on his own to obtain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">his ultimate transformation</a> which he can keep in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> it's worth suffering through.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> has the Monad Block, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a> only accessible the first time in January. The best weapons of each type are found in rare (yellow) chests on specific floors. They usually have 400 attack power and 99% accuracy, as well as an additional effect. Persona 3: FES, however, has even <em>better</em> weapons, which are created via the game's new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting">Item Crafting</a> feature, which top out around 450 attack and have powerful special abilities.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em>, unfortunately, is a little more annoying about it. The true best weapons for each character cannot even be found except in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, and even then can only be collected by beating down a randomly appearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>. It's not a terribly <em>hard</em> bonus boss, if you prepare properly, but each time you beat him, he'll only drop <em>one</em> item. This means that to get <em>everyone's</em> weapons, you'll have to beat the exact same boss <em>seven times</em>. Then seven times again if you want to get everyone the best armor in the game.
<ul><li> There's also an Infinity +1 Persona in the form of Izanagi-no-Okami, with absurdly high stats (his <em>baselines</em> are 80 in <em>everything</em>), and he resists everything except Darkness, Light and Almighty, as well as getting all 'Dyne' type skills, Victory Cry, Angelic Grace, Mind Charge, Megidolaon and the Amp skills for the 'Dyne'-type skills (Fire Amp, Wind Amp, Elec Amp, Ice Amp). Aside from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> One-shotting the Final Boss upon being summoned in the story</span>, the only way you're ever going to see him is in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> with a special fusion of eleven different, seemingly random Personas save for Izanagi.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em> has a few weapons and accessories that you can only get by turning your Personas into items. Among these is "Judge of the Dead" for Makoto, which increases all of her stats by 10, more than even the protagonist's ultimate weapon.
<ul><li> For Personas, there's Satanael. His stats are the highest in the game, and his elemental affinities are the game's best; he blocks Bless, absorbs Curse, and is resistant to everything else (except Almighty). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He even gets some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">Gameplay and Story Integration</a> by literally one-shotting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> after he's summoned.</span> To get Satanael, you've got to spend a ridiculous amount of yen, and find just the right Personas throughout the entire game. Mementos makes this a little easier, but it's still extremely unlikely you'll see Satanael outside of the time you're required to see him except on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> run.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Technically not a weapon, but still increases your characters' powers to ridiculous levels, the Sheriff Star is an accessory in most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms">Wild ARMs</a></em> games that you obtain after fighting Ragu O Ragula, the most difficult <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> in the largest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a> in the games.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildARMs4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildARMs4">Wild ARMs 4</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildARMs5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildARMs5">5</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildARMsXF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildARMsXF">XF</a></em>, you could make your own Sheriff Star. It was usually very pricy and often required use of the Black Market, which you shopped with character levels instead of money. This <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/file/918840/43941">graph<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> shows how hard it was to make a Sheriff Star in the fourth game from scratch, without relying on stealing or random drops. Yes, you read that right, 8080 levels and near 1.5 million gella.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenosaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenosaga">Xenosaga</a> Episode 1</em>, the AG-05, the final and most powerful A.G.W.S. available for purchase, sells for 300,000 G, a truly ridiculous sum in that game. It is certainly possible to buy it, but by time you've killed enough enemies to have that kind of money, your characters are invariably so high level that they're more powerful on foot than in the A.G.W.S. anyway!
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade">Xenoblade</a></em>, there's the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Monado III, which is obtained in the final battle</span>. It can be carried over into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, which ends up making multiple cutscenes look rather ridiculous, as they'll play out as though Shulk were using whatever inferior weapon he would normally have at those points, leading to silliness like you hitting a Mechon for massive damage, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutsceneIncompetence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutsceneIncompetence">only for Shulk and/or others to exclaim "It's not working!" in the cutscene that ensues</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChroniclesX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChroniclesX">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a></em> has the Bewitched Glaive: Receding Rust. While it doesn't have the highest attack power in the game, (that honour goes to Mighty Glaive: Galaxy Chief) it is the strongest sword which innately boosts Ether damage, which most of the strongest two handed sword arts use as a multiplier and there are multiple skills which directly boost Ether damage. On top of that it's fairly easy to obtain one which has "Weapon Damage Plus" as an innate skill. In theory it's possible to boost an Ether based basic sword to higher damage levels but it requires much more work (and luck) to achieve.
<ul><li> For Skells it's the Ares 90. It's not very good for the highest tier enemies (which require you to have very specific set ups) but for 99% of enemies in the game it will tear through them like a razor blade through wet rice paper.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChronicles2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChronicles2">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a></em>, there's Pneuma and Poppi QT Pi. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pneuma has the ability to make you be unable to die for a limited amount of time, can hit every orb in a chain attack and contains a 100 critical hit rate across the entire party along with a 50% defense and ether defense damage reduction and to top it all off, she reduces the enemies resistance to Break, Topple, Launch and Smash. You can also get Pneuma naturally through playing the story however after finishing Chapter 7 making her also count as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement">Sword of Plot Advancement</a></span>. Poppi QT Pi is the straightforward example of this trope and has the highest potential DPS in the game, but you unlock her in a sidequest in Chapter 8 and getting all the parts for Poppiswap outside of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> takes a long time to collect to fully max her out. When you do though, she can do over 200,000 damage with her regular arts at S+ trust and can take down all the superbosses in less than 3 minutes playing solo and thanks to a remarkably broken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageOverTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageOverTime">Damage Over Time</a> tactic, can end Challenge Mode bosses with over 50 million HP in less than 2 minutes (But this is when everyone is in a group to pull the tactic off).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableI">Fable</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Frying Pan weapon can either be this or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeWeapon">Joke Weapon</a>, depending on whether or not you acquired all the clues needed to find it; if you do, you'll get a massively-powerful weapon with four augmentation slots, but if you don't, you'll get a weapon with no slots which does 0 damage.
</li><li> There's also Skorm's Bow, the best longbow in the game, which you can only acquire by sacrificing someone at Skorm's temple at the right moment in the night. Although you can do this at the very beginning of the game, before getting even a single experience point, so it's really more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>.
</li><li> The Sword of Aeons in <em>Fable</em> if you're evil, or Avo's Tear if you're good, although Avo's Tear only appears in the expanded re-release of <em>Fable</em>.
</li><li> There is also the Wellow's Pickhammer, though perhaps obtainable a little early depending on how evil you act up to that point. It doesn't look all too threatening at first glance, until you notice it has two piercing augmentations on it. This weapon shreds through the health of any enemy, regardless of their armour, and even special units like the Balverines, which normally require a Silver augmentation to deal any real damage to it, will still take decent damage from this thing.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableII">Fable II</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Red Dragon pistol. You get it by completing with a perfect score in the shooting gallery. It does immense damage with a single shot, but in manual aim mode, its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">true power is realized...</a> yeah, it fires as fast as you can smash the Fire button.
</li><li> The Daichi. Only the Master Axe and Master Hammer have a higher attack damage, but even so, they're both extraordinarily slow in comparison. In the time it takes for one of their swings, the Daichi does just about three. By the time a character using those is halfway into the battle, the Daichi is done. It also doesn't hurt that its augments boost the damage, add shock damage, and make the hero more attractive.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile2Silmeria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile2Silmeria">Valkyrie Profile 2 Silmeria</a></em> has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> that epitomizes the "so hard to get that it becomes useless" issue. Getting the "Angel Slayer" requires completing the bonus dungeon ten times, each time being harder then the last. The only challenge higher than a tenth playthrough of the bonus dungeon is to start a new game on a higher difficulty &mdash; and you lose the sword when you do that. It does possibly help you fight the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRabbit">Hamsters</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile">Valkyrie Profile</a></em> also has the Angel Slayer, which is acquired in the same way, but there's a huge catch to it - it has an Attack Trust of 1, which means that every hit randomizes just what percentage of the listed attack power is used, meaning any attack could be for just one damage, or it could one-shot almost any enemy in the game. There's also the Glance Reviver, which is only a shade less powerful, but has an Attack Trust of 75 (meaning the attack is, at worst, at 75% power) and has a chance at an instant kill.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioRPG">Super Mario RPG</a></em>:
<ul><li> Obtaining the Lazy Shell equipment involves a bizarre <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest">Fetch Quest</a> that requires going <em>way</em> off the beaten path, but the end result is the best weapon for Mario and the best armor for Peach.
</li><li> The Frying Pan, although not as good as the Lazy Shell, is still a very powerful weapon, enough to allow Peach to do damage on par with Bowser. It can be bought, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">if you know where to look.</a>
</li><li> Also, the Super Suit, which is ridiculously powerful armor.

The other Action door contains Toadstool's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">Infinity Minus One weapon</a> if you haven't gotten the Frying Pan yet.
</li></ul></li><li> The Dragon Bracelet in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlueDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlueDragon">Blue Dragon</a></em>; to get it, you have to find, kill, and collect a fang from each of five dragons, four of which don't even appear until you've talked to Elder Bauhm, whose village can only be reached by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalAirship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalAirship">Mechat</a>.

</li><li> And the Black Planet pin set (also known as the Darklit Planets). The Black Planet pins are pretty good by themselves, but put all six of them in one deck and you've got what is possibly the most destructive pin set in the game, because all of them deal substantially more damage if all six are in the deck together. The catch? You only get one of the pins from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hanekoma, though if you try putting the cartridge into different DS's, you might find another one to buy there</span>, and you have to hunt down the rest by getting Noise to drop them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Incredibly powerful</a> Noise, who can only drop them on the highest difficulty level, and you have a snowball's chance in hell of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops">them dropping it without setting your HP incredibly low or chaining battles together</a>.

First, you need to get every other Magatama in the game, then go to the Cathedral of Shadows to collect the Lord's Blade, proceed to Masakado's temple, struggle past the resident monsters and hunt down and destroy the four monstrously strong guardians. Worth it though.
</li><li> <em>Nocturne</em> has one other possible contender for this title: Completing the Burial Chamber special battles in the required number of press turns awards you with perhaps one of the games greatest prizes on the second run-through: the Demi-Fiend's second Press Turn. Makes Hard Mode significantly easier after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Matador</a>.

It takes fourteen days in-game for a boss to respawn, and each ultimate weapon has <em>eight</em> forge slots, meaning you'd need nine of the boss' items to create a single fully-powered Ultimate Weapon - of which there are <em>several</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVII">Ultima VII</a>: The Black Gate</em>, the game didn't even come with the Infinity Plus One Sword, the Black Sword &mdash; it was added to the game through an expansion pack, <em>Forge of Virtue</em>. As Infinity Plus One Swords go, it ranked right up there, making the rest of the game ridiculously easy &mdash; including such things as Instant Magic Recharge, one-shot kills on ANY creature, etc. It had to be created in the expansion pack, and was useless without the demon who was trapped in the hilt. In the game's sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIIPartII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIIPartII">Ultima VII Part II</a>: Serpent Isle</em>, you wind up having it teleported away from you, and when you find it again, you must release the demon inside in order to escape the dungeon you have been imprisoned in.
</li><li> There's also a Black Sword in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/UltimaUnderworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/UltimaUnderworld">Ultima Underworld</a></em>, located behind a secret door in a hidden tomb that you can normally only find by obtaining a magic crystal shard from one of the prisoners, or failing that, by casting Reveal at the right place. It's also guarded by a Shadow Beast, which is invisible half the time without the crystal. The sword does approximately the same damage as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement">Sword of Justice</a>, but is super-accurate.

<ul><li> Goldbrand, one of the best swords in the game. To acquire it, one must swim down to an unmarked and destroyed offshore statue and talk to its head. The head will tell you to that it wants to be rebuilt, but only by this one crazy orc. Once you find the orc, he tells you that he needs a book that is only available from one bookseller. Once you recover the book and bring it to the orc, you still have to wait three in-game weeks before the statue is finished and you get the sword.
</li><li> Furthermore, Goldbrand can be upgraded to Eltonbrand&mdash;an even more awesome sword, but only if you're a vampire and complete a certain quest with a certain exact amount of gold in your inventory<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note54lnv');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note54lnv" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note54lnv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the fact that you get the message "Go to hell, Carolina" when you do suggests it was meant as an easter egg rather than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> moment.</span>.
</li><li> Despite all of that, the Black Hands Dagger is still more powerful. Each attack is guaranteed to deal three times as much damage as Eltonbrand and can even do much more sometimes. Also it blinds your opponent and heals you for as much damage as it deals... considerably more powerful than any other sword in the game (including ones you enchant yourself).
</li><li> The first expansion to <em>Morrowind</em>, Tribunal, gives you TWO of the strongest swords in the game at the end of the main quest. You have to beat a living god to get them, though.

This involves finding the biggest possible type of soul gem and filling it, which practically qualifies as a sidequest in itself and is something only very high-level players, or players who are "clued in" by various quests can accomplish. Then, the player has to either complete a long string of side quests or pay real money for the official "Wizard's Tower" mod, and game money for the appropriate equipment. With all that done, he can finally put a custom enchantment on his weapon. A common choice is both weakness to magic and magical damage enchantments, which is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>.
</li><li> Additionally, one of the game's official downloadable content mods adds Mehrunes Razor, a dagger with, among other things, a chance to instantly kill anything it hits. The dagger is found at the bottom of a nine level dungeon.
</li><li> Shivering Isles introduces the Dawnfang/Duskfang, which deals heavy base damage, heavy additional elemental damage based on time of day in-game, instantly recharges when the weapon transforms, both the dawn and dusk forms can transform into even more powerful versions of themselves when you kill a certain amount of enemies, and the fact it's a longsword means one could combine this sword with the 100% Chameleon trick to become an unstoppable juggernaut to boot.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The Spirit Sword in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandiaXtreme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandiaXtreme">Grandia Xtreme</a></em>. To obtain this weapon, the player must beat the game, travel to some of the bottom floors of a 100-levels randomly-generated dungeon in which the player can only leave every five floors, and can only return if such an "exit" was made into an entrance, at which point the exit cannot be used and the player must advance five <em>more</em> levels down just to make an exit. Making matters worse is that the sword is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops">rare drop</a> of a fairly difficult enemy which is (thankfully) not rare on these floors. The only "easy" method of ensuring the player gets it is to equip one of the more useless characters with a ridiculous rabbit-themed set of armors and skills which are likewise rare drops of equally ridiculous, and nearly impossible to kill, cute rabbit-like enemies. Even then, you will be seeing an <em>awful lot</em> of the common drops. This is not the only time the game does this to the player.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandiaIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandiaIII">Grandia III</a></em>, the Spirit Sword makes a return as the Infinity+ 1 weapon, and has an extremely similar method of acquisition, with the exception that the player must defeat the enemy, and cannot resort to stealing, running away, reentering battle, stealing, etc (as can be done in Xtreme). Luckily, this enemy is right next to a save/recovery point. Unluckily, this enemy is extremely difficult for no apparent reason.
</li><li> Neither of the first two <em>Grandia</em> games have secret weapons that could be considered Infinity+ 1 Swords. However, if one hacks items in the first game, an item called the 100 Sword will appear. It would be an Infinity+ 1 Sword had it been included in the game proper as the final weapon (the Spirit Sword) has only 70 + STR while the aptly-named 100 Sword has + 100 STR. There is also a 100 Fire Mace in the game files for no reason in particular.
</li><li> The Might Sword in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaAndTheFortressOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaAndTheFortressOfDoom">Lufia &amp; The Fortress of Doom</a></em> bests even the legendary Dual Blade.

<ul><li> Protagonist Maxim spends roughly half the game in search of Dual Blade, a weapon which will magnify his energy enough to challenge the titular villains. Yet the Dragon Blade, a prize offered at the Forfeit casino, offers much better stats (though at the cost of a weaker IP ability).
</li><li> Lufia 2 has the Infinite Plus One Ring in the form of the Egg Ring, which one gets from defeating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Egg Dragon</a>. But how to fight the Egg Dragon? You have to find all the Dragon bal....err.. eggs scattered throughout the world multiple times. After granting your wish several times, he'll fight you instead, and is one of the most vicious bosses in the game if fought legitimately, or can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">killed in one round</a>. The Egg Ring grants whomever equips it with maximum stats and will pretty much guarantee that person will NEVER die and always do max damage.

<ul><li> Mewtwo in <em>Pok&eacute;mon Red</em>, <em>Blue</em>, and <em>Yellow</em> versions. It had the highest base stat total in the game, and its strongest stat is the Special stat that governed both Attack and Defense for half of the game's types.

Mega Rayquaza has some of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">highest attacking stats</a> in the game, and good Speed and bulk to keep it on the field. On top of that, it has the unique ability to Mega Evolve without holding a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCrystal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCrystal">Mega Stone</a>, allowing it to hold another item to boost its power to even more ridiculous levels.

</li><li> In Generations III and IV, there's the Soul Dew, which increases the two strongest stats of Latias and Latios by 50%. The Lati twins can only be found by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic">roaming</a> in these games, and the Soul Dew itself is exclusive to events, but as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Olympus Mons</a>, the stat boosts make them among the hardest hitters there are.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MurkonsRefuge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MurkonsRefuge">Murkons Refuge</a></em>:
<ul><li> There are two Items of Specialness for each character class. You most likely won't find them until you reach the deepest dungeon levels, and even then you have to dive into pools and hope that you're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops">lucky enough to get one</a>. Even rarer than the Items of Specialness is the Rod of Catastrophe, an item that casts one of the highest Sorcerer spells in combat with no loss of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Mana</a> points and can be used multiple times in combat.
</li><li> There's also a literal sword, far rarer than the rod, but not as handy as a bottomless supply of free <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> CHAOS</span> spells.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Gaia Blade in the original game, when wielded by Isaac. In addition to its high Attack boost and strong Unleash, it grants a big bonus to Isaac's preferred element, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishingOutDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishingOutDirt">Venus</a>, making most of his attacks a lot stronger. It's found in a chest near the end of the final dungeon.
</li><li> The Sol Blade in <em>The Lost Age</em> and <em>Dark Dawn</em>. In both games, it is also found near the end of the final dungeon, lying in a fairly easy-to-find treasure chest in the former and being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement">Sword of Plot Advancement</a> in the latter. Despite this, it has the third-highest Attack boost in the series, and its signature unleash, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfTheSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfTheSun">Megiddo</a>, has a whopping 3x multiplier to damage. It can also only be wielded by the main protagonists.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>:
<ul><li> There is the Experimental MIRV, a cannon that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">launches eight miniature nukes at once and kills anything it hits in one shot</a>. As well as the huge cost of a single shot making it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>, getting it requires finding the place it is hidden in and finding the five password tapes for it scattered around the wasteland.
</li><li> The Mysterious Stranger's .44 Magnum would also fall into this category, as it causes roughly the same amount of damage as the MIRV in one shot. The disadvantage is that it's only available through hacking or sheer dumb luck.
</li><li> A more practical Ultimate Weapon would be Lincoln's Repeater.
<ul><li> It's the only .44 Magnum rifle in the game, it can be repaired with ordinary hunting rifles, it does a lot of damage and sneak attacks can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">one-shot-kill</a> most enemies. About its only drawback is that ammunition for it is relatively scarce, but it doesn't need very much anyway.
</li><li> Sadly, Lincoln's Repeater becomes a lot worse in the new DLC Broken Steel. Granted, you'll still be an unstoppable force of mass destruction until about Level 18, but its main appeal has always been either sniping or use in V.A.T.S. in combination with the perk Grim Reaper's Sprint, which makes you pretty much invincible as long as you can kill your enemies in one V.A.T.S. sequence. However, when regular enemies start having 1.5 times as much health as Deathclaws - who are still quite lethal - and survive your assaults quite easily, you'll be pretty much a sitting duck for the Feral Ghoul Reavers and Albino Radscorpions with the powerful, accurate but horrendously slow Repeater and those Big Guns and Combat Shotguns suddenly become a lot more appealing! The dart gun is still quite broken though...
</li><li> What can easily rival the Repeater in terms of usefulness is the Gauss Rifle added in the <em>Operation Anchorage</em> DLC. Deals nice damage (even some splash damage!), has a sniper scope and scoring a critical hit even knocks down the target for four seconds. And it uses microfusion cells for ammo which are plentiful late in the game, unlike the extremely rare .308 used by sniper rifles. Only problem is the low rate of fire as it must be reloaded after every shot. And it uses the Energy Weapons skill which can present a problem for characters leveled towards using conventional guns.
</li><li> Said DLC also earns you the Infinity +1 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor">Power Armor</a>, which due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">programming error</a>, has ridiculously high durability and will not degrade noticeably over the course of gameplay.
</li><li> <em>Fallout 2</em> also had a Gauss Rifle which fits this trope perfectly. Landing a critical to the eyes WILL kill most enemies, no questions asked. To quote the Fallout wiki: "the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs">Bloody Mess trait</a> is seldom necessary to see the most violent death animations" (which in this case means <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">blowing a sizeable hole in the target's torso</a>). Another excellent weapon is the YK42B Pulse Rifle which, while very short-ranged, deals the highest damage of all single-shot weapons in the game, even without criticals. Scoring a lethal critical literally <strong>vaporizes</strong> the target!
</li><li> <em>Point Lookout</em> has the Backwater Rifle. Although it has a 5 points less base damage and critical damage than Lincoln's Repeater, it makes up for that with a 5x critical chance multiplier, uses the much more common 10mm ammo, and is more durable. Which you'll need as everyone in that DLC has extra unblockable damage against you (and only you) with every shot.

If all nine pellets critical hit at the same time (such as in a point-blank sneak attack critical attack), the weapon's total critical damage is 9 x 40 = 360! And with the Better Criticals perk, it can go up to 540. Add in the base 80 power of the weapon, and then double the whole thing because of the sneak attack bonus, and the weapon's total damage turns 1240, quite close to that of the Fat Man itself! In fact, if the damage is increased further with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">head shot</a>, this weapon's destructive power against a single target becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">even greater than the Fat Man</a>, being able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">kill</a> even a Super Mutant Behemoth with <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcTdbkF-Jys">a single sneak attack critical head shot!<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>" To reiterate, under the right conditions this weapon can be more powerful than a nuclear explosion!

</li><li> <em>Broken Steel</em> also has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyHarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyHarry">Callahan's Magnum</a>, however the only way to get it outside of hacking is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">betray the Brotherhood</a> and use the Enclave's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat">Kill Sat</a> on their Citadel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">in the final quest</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> Sidney's Ultra 10mm SMG, which can either be looted from her dead body, or earned by finding the note from her father during "Reilly's Rangers".
</li><li> The Gatling Laser is already very powerful in its own right, but an even better unique version, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICallItVera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICallItVera">entitled Vengeance</a>, can be found at the bottom of Deathclaw Sanctuary. It's the most damaging Big Gun in the game, but somewhat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> thanks to chewing through ammo and being hard to keep in good repair.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em>:
<ul><li> The YCS/186, a unique Gauss Rifle which is even more powerful than the Anti-Materiel Rifle. As for small arms, there's the Gobi Campaign Sniper Rifle. Not as much base damage as the AMR, but is easier to handle and acquire ammo for, and has bonus critical chance and damage. Even better, Christine's Silencer Rifle from <em>Old World Blues</em> is the most powerful .308 weapon in the game, and has the added benefit of a silencer as its name suggests.
</li><li> That being said, the Anti-Materiel Rifle definitely makes a strong case for being an Infinity +1 gun itself, if only for its versatility. It can be modified to the point where it barely weighs any more than an SMG, equipped with a silencer for more covert long range kills, and takes 3 kinds of special ammo on top of its already highly damaging default ammo. One of these ammo types is the explosive round, exclusive to the .50MG class of ammo, which significantly ups the damage to absurd levels. With the right perks and skills, the explosive rounds can take down the X-42 Giant Robo-scorpion,the most tanky enemy in the game, in just 5 shots.
</li><li> The Gun Runner's Arsenal add-on adds the Bozar, a hyper-accurate Light Machine Gun with an integrated scope purchasable at the Gun Runners kiosk. Very expensive, however.
</li><li> Also from the GRA add-on is the Sprtel-Wood 9700, a unique Gatling Laser which is pretty much the <em>New Vegas</em> equivalent of Vengeance from <em>3</em>. And it can be found at a more accessible location in the game (i.e. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> not from the Brotherhood-owned Hidden Valley Bunker but at the Silver Rush store in the Freeside outskirts of New Vegas</span>), though it is offset for its very costly price tag.
</li><li> For armor, there's the Gannon Family Tesla Armor (the only Medium-weight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor">Power Armor</a>), the Reinforced Sierra Madre Armor from <em>Dead Money</em> (best Light armor), and the Elite Riot Gear from <em>Lonesome Road</em> (best non-powered armor).
</li><li> The 12.7mm SMG is hands down the best automatic weapon in the game, combining the second-highest damage per second with the weight and Strength requirement of a 10mm SMG. Add the silencer and laser sight (GRA) = total ownage.
<ul><li> The CZ57 Avenger minigun is a close second. Highest rate of fire and DPS of any weapon, twice as accurate as the standard minigun, and 50% more durable. The only drawback is the high strength requirement for optimum performance: 10 without the Weapon Handling perk, 8 with it, as well as literally half the ammunition capacity of the standard minigun (120 versus the standard's 240).
</li></ul></li><li> The Pulaski axe Knock-Knock is arguably the most powerful non-DLC melee weapon in <em>FNV</em>, and can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">obtained early</a> by a side trip to Searchlight immediately after Nipton. Bring plenty of Rad-Aways, though.
</li><li> When it comes to DLC added melee weapons, one that takes the cake, arguably, is the Blade of the West. In most cases, it acts as a sort of Infiniy-1 weapon to some of the perceived stronger weapons, outperforming the previously mentioned Knock-Knock on base value. However, it truly shines when given to the right Courier build specifically one designed to both utilize the knock down ability of Super Slam! (this perk gives weapons that use two hands a 30% chance to knock down an opponent, effectively paralyzing them) and critical hits. With a higher than normal critical hit multiplier of 1.5, you can get a 48% chance to critical hit on attacks, and as a special bonus with the weapon, you get a knock down for each critical hit, with both knock down chances stacking. Just think about that.
</li><li> Esther is hands down the hardest hitting weapon in the game, which you would expect with it being a legendary version of the Fat Man and all. You can pretty much one shot anything using this weapon, the right perks, and the right ammo. Its surprisingly versatile due to the special ammo added by the DLC. It also grants extra armor and rad resistance, something no other weapon does.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> has:
<ul><li> Spray 'n' Pray, a silenced submachine gun that packs double the ballistic damage of its vanilla counterparts, plus 15 points of <em>explosive</em> damage, further boosted by the Demolitions Expert perk. Can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">bought early on</a> from Cricket if you have the caps.
</li><li> The Overseer's Guardian, a unique Combat Rifle that has the special ability Two Shot. It's slightly less accurate than a normal combat rifle, but it does twice the damage of a regular combat rifle if both bullets hit. While it is usually sold with some variety of automatic receiver, enough ranks in Gun Nut will allow you to mod the thing for either an automatic build or a Rifleman build. And though it <em>can</em> be used as a sniper rifle, the weapon truly shines in mid-range combat, especially if you take a hit of Jet before blasting off. And like Spray 'n' Pray, it can be bought quite early on from Alexis Combes in Vault 81, provided you have the caps.
</li><li> Big Boy, a unique Fat Man. Like the Overseer's Guardian, it has the special ability Two Shot: it's slightly less accurate than a normal Fat Man, but every time it fires it launches two mini nukes while only using a single shot. It's also considered both an explosive and a heavy weapon for the purposes of damage bonuses. With even a few ranks of either perk, its damage gets pumped to the point where there will be very few enemies who can withstand a single strike from it.
</li><li> The Far Harbor DLC contains the Kiloton Radium Rifle. Being an explosive variant of the Radium Rifle, it's a straight upgrade to the aforementioned Spray 'n' Pray in every category except magazine size. It's also one of the only weapons to deal three types of damage, inflicting ballistic, explosive, and radiation damage, all of which can be improved with various perks, and can also be modified for full-auto or semi-auto fire to fit your build. It even remains powerful against Ghouls, due to the ballistic and explosive damage compensating for their radiation-induced healing.
</li><li> In the Nuka-worl DLC, the combination of Aeturnus and X-01 Quantum allows you to basically tank any damage, fire unlimited dreams of glowing red lasers, and basically shred, cook and curbstomp any enemy you come across. makes it even more fun if you're level 3000+ and nothing short of a full-scab nuclear explosion can take you out.
</li><li> The Last Minute, a fully outfitted Gauss Rifle that deals bonus limb damage, purchasable from Ronnie Shaw after the completion of "Old Guns" for the Minutemen.
</li><li> Elder Maxson's Final Judgement Gatling Laser, which has a 50% faster rate of fire, and deals twice as much damage. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">it only becomes available near the very end of the main quest line</a>, and only if you side with the Institute or the Railroad.
<ul><li> Aeternus added in the Nuka World DLC might be the most powerful weapon in game for the shear fact that its a Gatling Laser that doesn't burn through ammo due to how the game interprets its legendary effect. It may be technically outclassed by other weapons (especially with sneak criticals and what not) in terms of raw power, but they all require exotic ammo or the be point blank range. And on hard mode where ammo has weight, a pipe pistol with unlimited shots would be welcome much less a freaking Gatling Laser.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">Mass Effect</a></em>
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">Mass Effect</a></em>, all you need to unlock the Spectre-grade weapons is to acquire more than one million credits. Though there are actually Infinity Plus Two weapons as well which don't appear until your character nears level 50, as there are two tiers of Spectre weapons, and then the Infinity Plus One Bullets and weapon mods... All of which are available at a fraction of their usual price for finishing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">Pinnacle Station DLC</a>. Good thing, too, as those guns will be needed to not make playing a flurry of perfect decisions or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrialAndErrorGameplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrialAndErrorGameplay">Trial-and-Error Gameplay</a> while playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiosyncraticDifficultyLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiosyncraticDifficultyLevels">Insanity or Hardcore difficulties</a>. Needless to say, starting a new character on those difficulties will be quite rough.
</li><li> At around the same level that the Master Spectre gear becomes available, players can also begin to obtain Colossus Armor, which surpasses every other armor type in terms of damage resistance. Other armors are better in shields and/or resistance to enemy powers, but those factors aren't important. Unlike the Master Spectre weapons, Colossus Armor requires the player buy a specific license, and then <em>hope</em> they appear in shops or item containers. Fortunately, the <em>Bring Down the Sky</em> DLC allows the player to choose one of any of the three human versions, or the quarian version for completing it. Even the light version has such high damage resistance that a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a> can sustain several seconds of enemy fire on Insanity. They'll need it. And that's not getting into the Infinity +1 armor mods.
</li><li> Every class except the Soldier can equip a Bio-Amp and/or an Omni-Tool. Most amps and tools focus on one or two of three factors. The Savant variation gives the maximum bonus on all three factors. The only reason to use any other amp or tool over a Savant is if you don't have enough to go around. Similar to the Colossus Armor, they require a certain license, and have a notoriously low spawn rate. Fortunately, completing the <em>Pinnacle Station</em> DLC allows the player a strong chance to buy one at a relatively low price, and a player with a high enough persuasion skill can also get a Savant X Omni-Tool for completing <em>Bring Down the Sky</em> if they feel they don't need the armor. An Adept or a Vanguard with a Savant X Bio-Amp, an Engineer or Infiltrator with a Savant X Omni-Tool, or a Sentinel with both, will immediately see their abilities skyrocket.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Infinity Plus One weapons <em>and</em> armor are <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">for sale</a></strong>; the stuff available from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DLC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DLC">DLC</a> packs are better than any of the gear available in the game itself.
</li><li> In-game, however, there are the special weapons certain classes can choose to take aboard <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Collector ship</span>, chief among them the Widow Sniper Rifle. With the right combination of points and ammo (warp is your best bet), it's possible to one-shot almost any enemy in the game, even on higher levels. Its slow firing rate and low ammo capacity makes some people argue for alternate sniper rifles, but they're kidding themselves. Widow's where it's at. For the soldier class there's the Revenant machine gun, which packs more firepower than most of the heavy weapons and so much ammo that you can effortlessly hose down rooms of enemies without reloading. It's only balanced by a lack of accuracy, but once you have the assault rifle precision upgrade there's nothing in the game that poses any real threat.
</li><li> DLC weapons do manage to avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">Bribing Your Way to Victory</a>. All of them are significantly more difficult to aim than your other weapon options, which means they take more actual playing skill to use, which gets rewarded with a damage upgrade.
</li><li> And <em>then</em> there's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> Cain heavy weapon. Also known as the Nuke Gun, although technically speaking it isn't nuclear. It is the biggest heavy weapon ammo hog in the entire game&mdash; each shot consumes <strong>100%</strong> of your base heavy weapon ammo capacity, and most maps only contain enough ammo to fill 60%-ish of your capacity, so you can't even fire it once every mission! It takes several seconds to fire. And it can wipe out entire rooms of enemies (or an entire stage of the end boss) in a single shot.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>:
<ul><li> Not a type of weapon, but it still applies: the Phantom armors from The Citadel DLC. 80% total boost to a variety of stats (for comparison, the default N7 armor + custom parts typically add up to a 50% boost, maximum 65% with certain parts, while most armor sets add up to 60%), only available by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> breaking the score <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap">Cap</a> at the Armax Arsenal Arena</span>, limited to 1 per file. (The only other armor to reach the 80% mark is the Cerberus Ajax Armor, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">that's another story altogether</a>.
</li><li> There's also the Spectre-specific weapons, most notably the Black Widow sniper rifle - essentially the Widow from <em>2</em> with vastly more ammunition and three-round clips instead of the Widow's "bang, reload" philosophy. In the hands of an Infiltrator and fitted with the right upgrades and fully upgraded Disruptor Ammo, it can kill a Brute in three shots. Of course, it doesn't have the bonuses of the Javelin, which can - with the right upgrades - shoot clean through any cover in the game, but unlike the Javelin it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hitscan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hitscan">Hitscan</a>.
</li><li> The M-11 Wraith synergizes with the Vanguard in much the same way that the Black Widow does with the Infiltrator. Other Shotguns may cause more damage per hit, but the Wraith has the best damage-to-weight ratio of its weapon type. Fully upgraded, the Vanguard has a powerful weapon while still keeping their power recharge bonus at 200% even with a light assault rifle as a backup weapon, allowing the Vanguard to Charge around the battlefield with maximum efficiency. With a Smart Choke and a High Caliber Barrel, the Wraith can even function as a strong mid-range weapon. The Wraith's eight-pellet spread also synergizes well with the Explosive Burst evolution of the Vanguard's Incendiary Ammo, averaging an extra 400 damage per shot without power damage upgrades and allowing for frequent Fire Explosions from the Vanguard's iconic abilities.
</li><li> The M-11 Suppressor which, as Wrex notes, packs a <em>huge</em> punch for such a tiny weapon. In addition to having a huge amount of damage for a pistol, it has a 4x headshot multiplier even before any mods are added.

It's actually not that hard to gain, but requires some unconventional thinking as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it was hidden in the ground in Undine Springs after you complete mission 5 or 6. You need to dig it 5 times, while 4 times before you will be prompted that there's nothing there</span>. There is also Longinus, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> exclusive weapon of similar power and similarly one-use only. It is possible to keep both weapons until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>, but since the game limits you to 15 items maximum (including mandatory ones), it's usually not worth it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher">The Witcher</a></em>:
<ul><li> A legendary ARMOR with all the trappings of an infinity plus one sword, such as a famous wielder/wearer, it must be reassembled from various fragments, an explict quest is required to gain it and it was crafted by Gnomes.
</li><li> It's possible to get two Infinity Plus One steel swords, which are still practical because oils with different effects can be applied to each and the player can switch between them. It's also possible to get Infinity Plus One silver swords, but only one can be kept and there's only one optimal oil for silver anyway.
</li><li> Unlike most Infinity Plus equipment, the armor and swords don't come on the verge of the final fight, but the player is given a goodly chunk of story and action to make the most of them.
</li><li> Aerondight has been a staple in the series, but in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher3WildHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher3WildHunt">the third game</a>, it does more damage the more it charges, gives you 100% crit rate at full charge, and killing an enemy at full charge permanently increases its damage, which means you have a sword that never becomes obsolete or requires upgrading, which figures in nicely in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> mode. The catch to unlocking this sword is that you need to play the second DLC (which has a pretty high level requirement) and do a bunch of pretty simple missions.

There were a few nice ones, including one that required you to fuse three elementals to the blade in succession, and one that required a component you could only obtain just before fighting Maou Asura - i.e. at the very end of the game. The sequel took this even further - you now had even more combinations and possible swords. At the very end of the tree, you had the sword Hinokagutsuchi, which scored three hits, had amazing accuracy and damage, and turned its targets to <em>stone</em>. To get it, all you had to do was follow a convoluted expert-level fusion process that consumed seven original swords and sixty-seven demons. <em>For even more fun</em>, the sword could be further fusioned to create the Brahmastra, the best gun in the game, or the four pieces of your female companion's ultimate armor. (Which, bad graphics aside, looks downright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic">stripperiffic</a>.) To sum things up, in order to get the best equipment ever, you need EIGHT <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">infinity plus one swords</a>, so you have to bind five hundred and thirty-six demons, and obtain fifty-six baseline fusionable swords.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGranstreamSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGranstreamSaga">The Granstream Saga</a></em> has the Onimaru, which is twice as strong as the 'best' sword you would get normally. Surprisingly, you find it very early in the game, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> if you use the Cat's Eye somewhere in the west wall of the church basement in Arona.</span> It sometimes causes instant death to enemies if it hits them while they're performing long attacks.

What exactly does this equippable item do you may ask? Gives you an INFINITE supply of attack items, which, considering the massive power of them (up to 999 damage for many, and infinite for others), allows the user to literally flatten the opponent under a barrage of hugely damaging special attacks if they have even just one of the item they want to use. It can also, thanks to this pretty much kill the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss">final boss</a> in about ten minutes.
</li><li> To a lesser extent, the Supreme Slacks and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">100-Point Pants</a>, which are both dropped very rarely by certain enemies in the final area.

You've got the Magic Window and Mighty Meteor attacks for the bros (the former is easy infinite hit, latter gives free ultra powerful items are every use, and is good in the Gauntlet) and Magikoopa Mob/Brogger Bonker for Bowser, which are extremely powerful but also extremely easy to use to well.
</li><li> When it comes to the main gear (Overalls and Shells) in <em>Bowser's Inside Story</em>, two of each qualify. For the Bros' Overalls, you have a choice between the Master Wear, which increases Defense and SP and powering up Special Attacks, that can be gotten as early as activating the Air Pipes and defeating <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Shroobs</span>, which makes all the special attacks for the Cholesteroad availible. Getting A Rank on all gets you this. In addition, there is the A-OK Wear, which increases all stats and makes the wearer immune to status ailments, which can be bought at the Star Shop, which unlocks at Level 25. For the Shells, there is the Ironclad Shell, found in the first Bowser area of the game, Cavi Cape, but requires an ability that comes in the final area. It increases Bowser's Defense by a whopping <em>300.</em> Also, there is the King's Shell, which increases Defense (not as much as the Ironclad Shell, though), Attack, and SP with the side effect of increasing the power of Bowser's punch, which requires all of Bowser's special moves except for Shy Guy Squad and Broggy Bonker, though Magikoopa Mob is found in the final area. Broque Madame gives it to you after getting A Rank on all four Special Attacks used.

There's the Zee Egg and Star Rocket, Mario and Luigi's most powerful attacks. The former can hit the entire field for massive damage, the latter can hit a single enemy for that and they're both extremely easy to use and look awesome to boot. However, you need all Pi'illos saved for the former and the attack pieces from the final dungeon for the latter, so it'll be quite late in the game before you get them. There's also the last two badges (the Gold and Miracle Badges), which have quite devastating effects like freezing time (but are only available before about the second to last area) and pretty much everything gained in the Rainbow Rank shop. All extremely powerful, all kind of difficult to obtain and all able to make the final boss about half as difficult as he'd usually be.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario">Paper Mario</a></em>, the quite useful Lucky Day badge can only be obtained after delivering a chain of 14 letters, requiring at least thirty minutes outside of the main plot. Not to mention how long it takes to get all of Chuck Quizmo's 64 Star Pieces for all badges and 100% completion!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ParasiteEve2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ParasiteEve2">Parasite Eve 2</a></em> has two of them. The first is the Gunblade, which with the right ammunition, will deal damage in the thousands. The other is the Hypervelocity railgun. While it does have a 10 second charge up time, it also deals damage in the thousands. Both are rewards for getting the best rank in the game (which you can only do in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>)

And of course, there's Erdrick's Infinity Plus One Armor, which not only protects the hero from poison swamps and barriers, but restores his HP with every step. From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestII">Dragon Quest II</a></em> onward, the true Infinity Sword is always capable of extreme damage, but always cursed in some way.
</li><li> Later titles have the Metal King Sword which can be obtained from extremely rare drops from Metal King Slimes, collecting enough mini medals, or buying at the casinos.
</li><li> There's also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFlail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFlail">Flail of Destruction</a>, which while typically having less power than the Metal King Sword, hits every enemy in battle with standard attacks.

Many players eschew it in favor of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">the &Uuml;ber Falcon Blade</a>, which is only slightly less powerful and requires more common materials to craft.
</li><li> The Hero's Infinity Plus One Spear is the Metal King Spear. Since the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">Infinity Minus One Spear</a>, aptly named Hero Spear, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain">heals the Hero as it deals damage</a>, some players continue to use it even after obtaining the Metal King Spear.
</li><li> Yangus' Infinity Plus One Axe is found in a treasure chest only accessible late in the game.
</li><li> Jessica's Infinity Plus One Whip, the Gringham Whip, can only be obtained by grinding for an obscene amount of casino tokens. It can be worth it, as it has significantly better stats than the second-best whip and hits all enemies instead of just a group.
</li><li> Angelo's Infinity Plus One Bow, the Odin Bow, is created by combining three lesser bows: the Eros' Bow, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">Cheiron's Bow</a>, and the Great Bow. It is refreshingly easy to obtain, requiring no grinding or ultra-rare ingredients.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a></em>: The two-handed sword +3 in the bottom level of Durlag's Tower. It is one of the few +3 weapons you will ever see in the game, and found in the bonus dungeon you usually won't see the bottom of unless you're at the highest level already.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a> II</em>:
<ul><li> Anything with a +5 modifier is essentially this. The crafting system (accessed through Cespenar in the <em>Throne of Bhaal</em> expansion pack) allows you to make these weapons with the requisite components and/or money. Each weapon class has one ultimate version:
</li><li> Carsomyr: A Paladin-only greatsword that grants magic resistance and can dispel an enemy's magical barrier, <em>and</em> can be upgraded to +6 in <em>Bhaal</em>.
</li><li> Although the Crom Faeyr in <em>Shadows of Amn</em> is the best warhammer in the vanilla game, it is superseded in <em>Bhaal</em> by the Runehammer, which grants a maximum +5 THACO, more damage, a ridiculous amount of bonus damage to undead enemies and several enchantments that can be cast once per day. It also sets the wielder's strength stat to 25, which is the absolute maximum possible. Only dragons and other godlike beings have this amount of strength.
</li><li> The Flail of Ages: A multi-headed flail that does several types of elemental damage at once. Was originally a + 3 in <em>Shadows of Amn</em>, but <em>Bhaal</em> added more heads to increase it to +5. In addition, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">the + 3 version can be obtained fairly early in the game</a>.
</li><li> The Vorpal Blade a.k.a. Silver Sword. Despite being only +3, it nevertheless is capable of one-shotting anything it hits.
</li><li> Watcher's Keep has a whole host of Infinity +1 Swords throughout its five level structure (all of which can be upgraded to +5 versions), including the best axe (Axe of the Unwielding), bastard sword (Foebane), bow (Taralash), crossbow (Firetooth), dagger (Dagger of the Star), longsword (Angurvadal), mace (Storm Star), short sword (Short Sword of the Mask), spear (Ixil's Nail) and staff (Staff of the Ram).
</li><li> The Psion's Blade. A large +5 sword in Yaga Shura's lair. While there are a number of +5 weapons by this point, this weapon requires no investment like the other swords. It also gives Mind Blank, preventing the wielder from confusion, charm, or anything like that, which is by far the most annoying status effect in the game.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkiesOfArcadia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkiesOfArcadia">Skies of Arcadia</a>: Legends</em>:
<ul><li> There is a sword for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Vyse</a> that requires you to fulfill a ridiculous number of requirements to get, of which the three hardest are getting 90% of treasure chests in the game, finding every discovery, and killing 2500 enemies. Getting every moonfish in the game is another difficult requirement. Fortunately, you can get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">the second-best sword for Vyse</a> just by recruiting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateBlacksmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateBlacksmith">Ultimate Blacksmith</a>, getting a rare mineral, and then paying him to make a sword out of it.
</li><li> Final Cupil is another example of an Infinity Plus One Weapon. You see, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagicianGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagicianGirl">White Magician Girl</a>'s main weapon is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyCuteCritter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyCuteCritter">Ridiculously Cute Critter</a> that can shapeshift into a weapon. The strength of the weapon it can shapeshift into increases as you feed it these things called chams. In order to get it to its strongest form, you have to find all thirty normal chams, plus all three super chams. One of the super chams requires you to finish a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfDeals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfDeals">ridiculously long fetch quest</a> in order to get it. The upshot is that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagicianGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagicianGirl">White Magician Girl</a> goes from having the weakest primary attack in the game to having the... second weakest! Final Cupil is stronger than Aika's ultimate weapon, as it should be considering the difficulty in getting it. Final Cupil can usually do more than 600 damage per hit (never mind that at this point, Vyse's Cutlass Fury might be doing 9999 damage per hit). Though statistically, Final Cupil is stronger than even the above sword for Vyse; it's just that it's not being used by someone meant as a fighter.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>, this role was fulfilled by Starfang, a sword forged for the Warden out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThunderboltIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThunderboltIron">Thunderbolt Iron</a>, which is easily the best longsword/greatsword available in the module.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOriginsAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOriginsAwakening">Dragon Age: Origins &#150; Awakening</a></em>, however, lets you (well, not you, but Wade, but you have to find the materials for him) craft Vigilance. You only have to kill a powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> for one of the key components needed to forge it; the rest of the components aren't terribly difficult to make/buy/find. It gets better; the sword can be customized &mdash; it can be either a longsword or greatsword, made to have better accuracy and cold damage or better power and fire damage, and the blacksmith offers a choice of other extra bonuses too. This is on top of the basic bonuses the sword provides. It even has a unique appearance (which is unfortunately bugged if you installed the Warden's Keep DLC too). The sword is so awesome it even gets mentioned in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModularEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModularEpilogue">Modular Epilogue</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and seems well on its way to becoming a Soul Edge expy.</span>

However, if you played the game and its DLC packs in the release order, the Hawke's Key from the <em>Legacy</em> DLC fits the bill. Depending on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a>'s class, it is either a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicStaff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicStaff">Magic Staff</a>, a dagger, a bow, or a sword that is customizable akin to Vigilance and only usable by Hawke. Or an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBug">exploit</a> can be used to give it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">all twelve potential bonuses at once</a>.

The top example being Demonslayer, a sword that you have to find the parts of. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Due to how the damage caps, technically, <em>fists</em> are the strongest weapon.</span>
</li><li> The Level-10 guns in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freelancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freelancer">Freelancer</a></em>. You can only get them by looting a few far-flung derelict fighters, or by going trough a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolGate">Jump Hole</a> to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation">Eldritch Location</a> and fighting Nomads, the nastiest enemies in the game. They aren't the most amazing weapons due to their slow refire rate and bad long-range accuracy...but the Nomad guns actually <em>consume no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaMeter">power</a></em>, meaning that if they make up enough of your weapon loadout you can fire forever, and they're <em>deadly</em> at close range.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork">Mega Man Battle Network</a> 5: Double Team</em>:
<ul><li> To unlock super powerful Bass Cross Mega Man, you first have to complete the game on GBA so that you could complete it on Nintendo DS with a couple of bonuses.
</li><li> Some of the Giga Chips are possible Infinity Plus Ones. Many of the FortePlus/BassPlus/BassAnly chips deal far too many hits <em>not</em> to be used with Attack+ 10's, and you get them from the inevitable fight with him at the end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a>. From EXE3, FolderReturn cost a fortune in Bug Fragments and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">broke the game into little tiny pieces.</a> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MegaManStarForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MegaManStarForce">Star Force</a></em>, drawing one of the AM-seijin Giga Cards is a fantastic "kill all enemies" button.
</li><li> FolderReturn in EXE3 wasn't the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>, NaviRecycle was. The general consensus at the time was that, if you needed to use your folder more than once to win, there was something wrong with your folder. NaviRecycle, on the other hand, was essentially a replay button for the last Navi chip (essentially summons, and powered up to match), including any bonuses attatched to it. With the right 5 chip combo and a bit of luck and timing, any enemy in the game could fall to it, and that's assuming it survived the first shot...
</li><li> FolderReturn, however, additionally acted as FullCustom. Theoretically, a user could continuously end the round immediately through the aforementioned chips, until the opponent no longer had chips available. The user, on the other hand, would still have their entire folder to work with. Combined with a certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">glitch</a>, as well as legitimate customization in the game itself, the chance of this happening isn't as small as one would think.
</li><li> Oh dear god Hub.BAT. <em>Battle Network 3</em>'s is such a perfect example it hurts. It requires getting to Secret Area 3 (which in itself requires <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchEmAll">half the Standard library and at least one Giga chip</a>), fighting your way through a long, twisty path full of horrid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters">Random Encounters</a> (with a nerfed character - thanks, Press Program!), and finally fighting a twenty round chain battle with some of the most annoying monsters the game had to offer. And once you had the thing, you had to know <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">the style-specific enabler code</a>. <em>And</em> to make it worthwhile, you also had to know the compression command. However, just tossing it onto Mega Man made you <em>ridiculously</em> powerful, to the point that practically every metagame Mega Man was wearing it, halved HP or no.
</li><li> Its predecessor, HubStyle/SaitoStyle in <em>Battle Network 2</em>, is also a prime example. It had most benefits of Hub.BAT / Saito Batch, plus no elemental weakness. However, to get it, you had to S-rank every V3 Navi in the game, which in turn required completing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">WWW Area</a> first, which itself had several requirements.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InazumaEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InazumaEleven">Inazuma Eleven</a> 3</em> has a number of special abilities served as this such as Omega the Hand, Maximum Fire, and Prime Legend, though it's quite acceptable since you still get to do a lot of things after you beat the final boss.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EpicBattleFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EpicBattleFantasy">Epic Battle Fantasy</a> 4</em> has the Equilibrium sword. It reduces the damage taken from Holy and Dark by 50% each - Holy is the hardest element to resist, and Dark is generally the most dangerous. It negates enemy Dispel 100% of the time, in a game where status buffs are <em>extremely</em> important to keep. Its raw power is second only to the Anarchy sword, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">drastically reduces the wielder's defenses</a> - Equilibrium doesn't. It counter attacks with the third strongest non-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a> attack in the game, when the second-strongest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOrGloryAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOrGloryAttack">harshly debuffs the user's attack afterwards</a> and the strongest outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAttack">kills the user</a>. It inflicts the Syphon status condition when it hits an enemy, which prevents the enemy from using any abilities that require MP at all. And if all this wasn't enough, it grants the user <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutoRevive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutoRevive">Auto-Revive</a> status between turns. The catch? Not only is this weapon found at the top of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a>, which is only accessible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">with real cash</a>, but it requires you to beat <strong>four consecutive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">Boss Rushes</a></strong> on top of fighting your way through said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a>, and it's no pushover.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SouthParkTheStickOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SouthParkTheStickOfTruth">South Park: The Stick of Truth</a></em> has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KatanasAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KatanasAreJustBetter">Sweet Katana</a> which is... a completely run of the mill steel forged katana. But since the game's setting is a giant LARP most of the weapons are 2X4 wood mechanisms or blunt weapons, the Katana's standing as a legitimate bladed weapon makes it the strongest one you'll get.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em> has the Real Knife, which boost your ATK by a whopping <em>99</em> - for comparison, the second-strongest weapon only gives a 15-point boost. It is also absolutely useless, since by the time you get it there are no more random encounters and the one boss it could have feasibly been an advantage against was a long ways back. The only actual boss fight after you get the Real Knife is with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a> who makes up for it with their insane dodging skills- you can't hit them once in the entire battle until an opportunity finally presents itself to make a sneak attack. In a normal run you wouldn't get this boss and would instead get two later bosses whom the Real Knife would be really useful on... but in the run you get the Real Knife in, they're essentially killed in cutscenes. It's almost like the game is mocking you for your desire to powergame and get the strongest weapon there is.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FallenLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FallenLondon">Fallen London</a></em> has the Waxwail Knife, a weapon that boosts your Dangerous attribute by a whopping 20 levels (for comparison, the next-best Dangerous weapons in the game increase your Dangerous by 12 and are available only to players who have certain Professions or are willing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">pay Fate</a>).

Each one has extrememly high attack power and hits twice per turn, with the second attack dealing elemental damage matching the character's specialty. Though in practice, only Radune and Dhalzam seriously benefit from using their respective ultimate weapon.

Of course, since combinations of mods stacked together rarely intertwine, it's possible to obtain one mod's endgame items without going through another mod's progression, turning any such item into a potential <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> unless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseRules">a modpack creator counteracts this by gating a powerful item's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting">recipe</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">behind other mods' endgame items</a>.

It's virtually indestructible, can smash anything in its path, and has really powerful infinite ammo. The only downsides are that it only holds one person, and that it doesn't have a radio, so you can't play music while you're in it, although the latter can easily be fixed with PC mod tools.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SidMeiersPirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SidMeiersPirates">Sid Meier's Pirates!</a></em>, the Ship of The Line is the largest ship in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Frigate</a> class; it has the largest maximum gun complement of any ship, the fast speed when sailing with the wind that all in the Frigate class have, and durability second only to the sluggish Flag Galleon. There is no guaranteed spawn for a Ship of The Line, and they only appear as "New Warships" or, more rarely, really heavy-duty pirate hunters; both of which require you to <em>really</em> savage one of the non-Spanish national powers to induce. By the time you might actually get one, you will likely have no need for its thunderous 24x2 gun broadsides, and might opt to reduce its gun complement to that of a basic Frigate (32 guns total, still nothing to scoff at) so you don't accidentally overkill your targets, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility">use the extra space for more storage of captured spoils</a> so you have less need to tug other ships along for cargo overflow.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria">Terraria</a></em>: The Zenith is the most powerful weapon in the entire game, requiring several rare swords to craft including two of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Moon Lord's</a> drops and the Terra Blade (which itself requires several swords to craft and was previously this trope before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep">Power Creep</a>), among others. Your reward is a weapon that rapid-fires blades that sweep a huge area, deal huge amounts of damage per hit with multiple hits, penetrates all terrain, and costs no ammo or mana. As of the 1.4.1 update, 'Infinity + 1 Sword' is even the name of the achievement you get when you craft it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TerraTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TerraTech">TerraTech</a></em>: The MK-3 battleship cannon from Hawkeye is the most damaging weapon in the game.

More specifically, it requires completing the story mode no less than 1 and a half times, as the hangars are located in Yes/No level paths, so you have to choose one side, then the other on the next playthrough. After that, you still need about 570,000 credits to buy <em>one</em>. If you're lucky, you can sell off all your planes to earn this much just in time for the final level on the 2nd playthrough.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticNuke">Trinity</a> weapon is one of its special weapons. While you only get three of them, they'll destroy anything (including you if you don't fly away). Unfortunately, it's an unguided bomb (good for ground targets), and the majority of the game is fighting against other planes in the sky.

The Prismatic Shard itself is so rare and hard to obtain that a player might not ever get one from a normal playthrough unless they know exactly what they're doing.

Why is it funny?

In <em>Brotherhood</em> it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATasteOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATasteOfPower">only usable during the first Core Memory</a> (story mission), but if you complete all of the Assassins Guild challenges it's unlocked at the Tiber Island Hideout and does not need to be bought. Story-wise it can be unlocked about halfway through the game after recruiting one's first two Assassins, but completing the challenges may require grinding (mainly for Arrow Storms and signaling Apprentices <em>during</em> combat). The Armor of Alta&iuml;r was <em>II</em>'s Infinity Plus One Armor, granting as much Health as a complete Missaglias armor set but unbreakable, and only unlocked by clearing the six Assassin Tombs, which were mainly platforming missions.

<ul><li> THREE (in post-Gamecube versions, <em>FOUR</em>) of these. The Infinite Rocket Launcher and Chicago Typewriter are available for a million PTAs at any merchant after completing the main game once, and getting a five star rating on every level in Mercenaries earns the Handcannon, which can be upgraded to do the most damage of any weapon in the game and have infinite ammo. Beating the game on Professional mode earns the Plagas Removal Laser (aka the "P.R.L. 412") that, while taking more space than the Rocket Launcher, has the ability to put even the Rocket Launcher to shame as there's no need to worry about a friendly fire blast as the "P.R.L." stands for "Plaga Removal Laser", meaning it is only harmful to Plaga-based enemies, which are essentially ALL the enemies' type in the title (though strangely it also can affect other non-plaga-related things such as certain objects, but that's about it fortunately). The first fire mode is the uncharged blast which is basically a shortened-yet-useful Flash Grenade blast, VERY useful for dealing deathblows to plaga lifeforms released from their hosts close nearby, whilst the second fire mode is a charged P.R.L. blast that is essentially a "rocket launcher missile" in laser form, thus negating all the negative points of a Rocket Launcher, including blast damage if one idiotically fires it at VERY close range enough to significantly drop one's own HP AND no recoil either, unlike the Rocket Launcher where one needs to have a small "wait" period before launching another rocket. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8pxvb');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note8pxvb" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8pxvb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The P.R.L. 412 originally only had a single concentrated laser as its charged fire mode (though this can strangely be made into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpreadShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpreadShot">scatter shot</a> via the Ditman Glitch), the PC/HD releases and beyond has its charged shot changed into a useful scatter shot instead, though it retains its reliable singular charged laser during said scatter shot.</span> And another awesome thing about the P.R.L. 412? Aside from the requirement of clearing Professional difficulty once, it literally costs <strong>nothing</strong> to acquire it from the Merchant.
</li><li> Technically, every weapon can become one of these when fully upgraded. When all upgrades are bought, a ridiculously expensive one becomes available. For instance, the Striker gains an ammo capacity that takes roughly an hour to empty, the SMG gains damage equal to several pistol clips per bullet, and the Broken Butterfly magnum gains damage rivaled only by the Rocket Launcher and the Handcannon. Restarting the game with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> using these weapons is terribly fun. Oh, and bear in mind the Handcannon is terrible without all its upgrades. Without them it uses an ammo that is very hard to find, selling the ammo to make money for the upgrades is a simpler option.
</li><li> Believe it or not, the <em>Shotgun</em> can be this. Yes, the same shotgun you found in Pueblo that you quickly sold to buy the Riot Shotgun becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> if you upgrade it all the way. Its full customization negates the dispersion effect.

All you need to do is beat every level on Hard difficulty (admittedly, the Operation: Javier 4/6, which are full of tough enemies, including a number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpider">Demonic Spiders</a>, and end with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>, with you taking roughly 1.5 damage in 4 and double damage in 6, aren't exactly cakewalks), and your reward is a weapon with S rank Attack and Stopping Power (both of which can be raised to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankInflation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankInflation">S+ </a>, the best rank in the game, for 22000 gold each), a massive splash radius, and infinite ammo. It does need to charge between each shot, but once you've upgraded that to its maximum, it's roughly 2 seconds between shots that can wipe out any non-boss enemy on the screen.
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFrame1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFrame1">Fatal Frame</a></em> game has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> in the form of a camera upgrade. If you photograph every ghost in the entire game, which at best can be completed early through a second playthrough, the Zero function makes the game ridiculously easy &mdash; rather than have to spend time charging each shot, your camera stays at full charge all the time. It's basically the equivalent of upgrading from a flintlock rifle to a minigun. Oddly, this isn't the hardest upgrade to get; the reward from getting perfect scores in battle mode is much more challenging and virtually useless, since you're limited to equipping only one upgrade at a time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace2">Dead Space 2</a></em> has the Hand Cannon, which basically turns the game into a walk down easy street, no matter the difficulty, seeing as it has unlimited ammunition and kills in one hit. And if it doesn't kill in one hit, it'll most likely kill in about three. So what do you have to do to get it? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Beat Hardcore mode.</a> And what is it exactly? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeItem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeItem">A red foam finger which Isaac "shoots" by yelling "Bang!

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising">Dead Rising</a></em>:
<ul><li> The small chainsaw. The absolute king of weapons that could kill most bosses in six hits and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Elite Mooks</a> of the game in one or two. And if you gather the right books, it will won't break until after 2160 hits, meaning you can essentially use nothing but the small chainsaw for the entire game (except for the sniper rifle for early bosses, and the Assault Rifle or "Machinegun" for Special Forces / later bosses).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising2">The sequel</a> has two: The Six-Shooter and the Knife Gloves. The Knife Gloves are basically this games small chainsaw: only difference is that they can be built (i.e. you can have more than one of them) and no books boost its durability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> levels. The Six-Shooter on the other hand holds sixty rounds, has ridiculous accuracy, and does very good damage. Pulling it out in any boss fight is basically an instant "I win".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em>, all games pre <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, has the Rocket Launcher, a weapon that can instantly kill anything in one shot. It usually appears towards the end of the game to use against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> as a flashy finish. Depending on how well you do, you can unlock the Rocket Launcher for your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> with infinite ammo, making the entire game a cakewalk.
<ul><li> The infinite launchers from the oldschool games have one very critical drawback, though: you can't point them up or down, so some enemies are either extremely difficult or outright impossible to hit with them.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER">STALKER</a> series has the Gauss Rifle. It's very accurate due to the scope and does damage roughly equal to dropping a good-sized house on the target. It's also very heavy and has a long time between shots. Unfortunately, in the first game, you only get it very late in the game and ammo is scarce, and a sniper rifle isn't of much use at close range or indoors, where most of the fighting is at that point. In the second game, you get it literally at the end of the story and really only use it on one person. In the third game, unless you save the lion's share of the content for the post-story gameplay, you have access to it for about a half-dozen jobs. The first game also has the RPG, which <em>will</em> kill just about anything you care to point it at. Problem is it's ridiculously heavy and you're probably only ever going to find one round for it. The latter two games bring the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">RP-74</a>, a belt-fed machine gun. It's heavy, ammo for it is expensive and heavy, you can't sprint with it out, and <em>you can't aim it,</em> only fire from the hip. But good lord does it lay down the hurt. <em>Clear Sky</em> has a unique version that holds ten times the ammunition, but fully loading it will probably take up most of your carry weight.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StringTyrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StringTyrant">String Tyrant</a></em> has the twinblade which makes most of the combat trivial. Problem is that it's in the most dangerous area of the game. Still with a bit of sequence breaking you can get it early, which makes the game much easier.
</li><li> Certain unlockable-by-beating-the-game weapons in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SilentHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SilentHill">Silent Hill</a></em> series, such as the katana in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill1">the first game</a>, the Unlimited SMG in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill3">the third</a> (It's as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">broken</a> as it sounds), and all of the unlockable weapons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillOrigins">Silent Hill: 0rigins</a></em>. Others, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerupLetdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerupLetdown">sadly</a>, range from just badass to so-so to lame. If <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">Difficult, but Awesome</a> counts, there's also the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Great Knife</span> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2">the second game</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuleOfRose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuleOfRose">Rule of Rose</a></em> has multiple ones. The gun is the most powerful, on top of being a ranged weapon, but you need four perfumes in exchange for the key to it. The secret costumes come each with their own melee weapon, but they require a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>; some of them also require an easy fetch quest, but they're functionally the same. The Knight Sword is a combination of the two: you need to kill five special Imps, which then drop a knife each, which then are traded to get the Bronze\Rusty Sword, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">which then</a> must be traded back in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>. And you need to do all that again if you want it in the <em>next</em> playthrough; the only consolation is it's only slightly less powerful than the Gun, but has infinite uses.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea">Disgaea</a></em>:
<ul><li> Items in the games are ranked from 1 to 40, with 40 being the strongest. To obtain the Rank 40 equipments, you need to first obtain a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">Legendary Rank 39 equipment</a> of the same type, then dive into its Item World. Once reaching the 100th floor, you will encounter a boss wielding the Rank 40 equipment, which then you must steal. This is the only way to obtain these ultimate equipments. Additionally, Rank 40 items always have Legendary rarity.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisgaeaHourOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisgaeaHourOfDarkness">first game</a>, the rank 40 sword Yoshitsuna was the true ultimate weapon even when compared to others of its rank. A sword that was stronger than the mightiest axe (axes were the most powerful weapons but decreased your accuracy and could hit only one enemy at time), more range than guns, and increased almost all your others stats by a lot to boot. In the sequels, it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">nerfed</a> to be more in line with other ultimate weapons.
</li><li> <em>Disgaea</em> also has the Hyperdrive, which allows any character that equips it to teleport anywhere on the battlefield save for the Dimensional Gate in Item World maps. In the original, it was awarded for going through all 100 levels of an ultimate item and defeating the Item God 2 (which is level 6,933) on the 100th floor, while in the PSP and DS remakes, it is only awarded if all 100 levels are done in a row without exiting out in between. Note that the only way to revive a fallen party member is to exit out.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance">Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</a></em>:
<ul><li> A set of infinity plus one equipment: The Sequence Sword, the Peytral armour, the Sapere Aude Rod and the Acacia Hat. Each of them were capable of growing by one point in their main stat every time a certain repeatable quest is completed. These quests didn't occur very often, however it was also possible to do two-player co-operative missions that also awarded both players (or just one in the case of hunting missions) with equipment growth.
</li><li> Only the Sequencer and Peytral return with the same mechanics in the sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsA2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsA2">Final Fantasy Tactics A2</a>: Grimoire of the Rift</em>, but instead are powered up a point whenever <em>any</em> character uses an Opportunity Command, even before getting the weapon. On top of that, the two missions you get them for aren't even that difficult later on in the game.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em> has the Knight Swords, weapons only equipped by Knights, Dark Knights, and certain special classes. While Defender, Save the Queen, and Ragnarok are nothing special (they're good, but not jaw-dropping), the two standout weapons are Excalibur, which grants permanent Haste to the wielder, and Chaos Blade, which has the highest power of any weapon, grants permanent Regen, and can petrify an enemy on contact. And they're all one-handed, meaning you can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">equip both of them with the right ability</a>. You can get one Excalibur in normal gameplay (at the moment when difficulty in the game becomes strictly optional, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Orlandu</a> is equipped with it when he joins you), but Chaos Blades can only be acquired in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a>.
<ul><li> <em>FFT</em> also has the secret Javelin II, not to be confused with the base-tier Javelin. While its attack power is lower than the Chaos Blade, its attack formula is based on Strength alone without factoring in Brave as Knight Swords do&#151;and with Jump, a unit carrying the Javelin II is near-guaranteed to land <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kills</a> every turn.

<ul><li> While the final weapons for the main Lords don't really match this trope exactly (well, it is technically possible to 'miss' some of the Lord weapons like Falchion in certain games...), each game generally comes with a half dozen to a dozen S ranked weapons you can get (but don't need...unless this is <em>The Binding Blade</em>, see below). To kick this up a notch, <em>Radiant Dawn</em> has 13 SS Ranked weapons that you can hand out to your party. Granted, <em>Fire Emblem</em> games are often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> and while you don't NEED them in a technical manner, you do need them in an "Oh God, oh God, we're all going to die!" manner.
</li><li> And the gold medal of this trope goes to the Naga Tome, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGenealogyOfTheHolyWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGenealogyOfTheHolyWar">Genealogy of the Holy War</a></em>.

Said character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain">is already broken as-is</a>; with the Naga tome, she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibilityPowerUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibilityPowerUp">nigh unstoppable</a>.

<ul><li> Clever use of random dungeons, bottles (an enemy monster type that makes it easier to acquire items you summon your phantoms into), titles, and a number of otherwise "useless" job classes means that you can do this with any weapon you hold, and you can deck your entire party out with their own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">Disc-One Nuke</a> if you so choose.

</li><li> If, however, you want the item <em>described</em> as the Ultimate Sword; the Divine Blade Yoshitsuna; you have to go through 99 stages of a high level Dungeon without restoring the game; and then there is a 5-15% chance that the Dungeon Boss will have it; which you then have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameStealing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameStealing">steal.</a>

Same for the W-Up unit in the few games it appears in, because it grants a buff dependent on how many parts slots a mecha has. Mount one of these things on a four part slot mech and watch the carnage. It's even worse in Impact, where you can get TWO and mount them on the same unit.

<ul><li> The Assassin's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KatanasAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KatanasAreJustBetter">katana</a> is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysAccurateAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysAccurateAttack">Always Accurate Attack</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack">ignores enemy armor</a>, and her shotgun, Arashi, has a much longer range than the standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeShotgun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeShotgun">Short-Range Shotgun</a>.
</li><li> The Hunter carries the sniper rifle Darklance, which unlike most sniper rifles allows the wielder to move and shoot on the same turn, and the Darkclaw pistol that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack">ignores enemy armor</a>.
</li><li> The Warlock has the Disruptor rifle, an advanced assault rifle that guarantees a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit">Critical Hit</a> if used aginst psionic enemies.
</li></ul></li><li> The single-player campaign of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TelepathTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TelepathTactics">Telepath Tactics</a></em> has four, most of which get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICallItVera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICallItVera">special names</a>. Fangiss Ka, the best mace, is part of Silithis Predat's starting inventory; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Steampunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Steampunk">Steam Crossbow</a> is dropped by a late-game boss and can only be used by a promoted crossbowman; and Lyrio, the best bow, is a rare drop potentially found in an optional sidequest. There is also Aravel, an amazing rapier that grants a wide variety of stat boosts; however, it's used by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> who doesn't drop her inventory when defeated, so it's not obtainable...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">unless you exploit a developer oversight</a> and kill her in an earlier fight, in which case she <em>will</em> drop it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic">Heroes of Might and Magic</a></em> has a slew of powerful artifacts and artifact sets. The third game has a few particularly potent ones:
<ul><li> Armageddon's Blade, which offers decent stat bonuses, adds Expert Armageddon to the wielder's Spell Book, and <em>grants immunity to Armageddon to the hero's own army</em>. The stats provided by the Blade make casting Armageddon even easier too.
</li><li> The Angelic Alliance is a Set Artifact created from every artifact that offers stat bonuses to all four primary stats. The Alliance not only retains those bonuses (+21 total to every stat), it also removes the Morale penalty from mixing good and neutral troops together and casts Expert Prayer at the start of combat. The opponent could neutralize the Prayer with Expert Dispel, but this does nothing to the huge stat bonus (and good luck getting a chance to cast Dispel in the first place since the speed boost from Prayer will likely grant the army the first strike anyway &mdash; and the attack boost may very well ensure it's also the <em>last</em> strike).
</li><li> The Cloak of the Undead King is the best friend of any Necromancer or Death Knight hero. While Necromancy normally raises skeletons from defeated foes, the Cloak allows a hero to raise stronger undead instead. A hero with Expert Necromancy and the Cloak will raise <em>Liches</em> (the 5th level shooter of the Necropolis army!) instead of skeletons. An army of 1000+ skeletons is already intimidating &mdash; imagine a legion of liches. The Cloak is also a Set artifact made of three Necromancy boosting artifacts, meaning it also increases the number of undead raised.
</li><li> The Armor of the Damned is yet another Set artifact. While the stat bonuses from the combined artifacts are nice, the Armor's ability to cast Expert Slow, Curse, Misfortune, and Weakness at the start of each battle is even nicer. While the target could neutralize the debuffs with Expert Cure, the same debuffs also make it less likely they will get the chance to do it.
</li><li> The Power of the Dragon Father is a Set artifact that combines every Dragon themed artifact. On top of the bonuses provided by said artifacts, it also adds +6 to all stats, and grants units in the hero's army immunity to all level 1~4 spells. While this means they can't be buffed with spells it also means they can't be debuffed, and the only spell that can even hurt them is the fifth level Implosion.
</li><li> The second game had the Ultimate Artifacts (except for the Golden Goose, which provided a powerful non-combat advantage), acquired by finding enough obelisks to figure out where to dig. The Artifacts provided +12 to one primary statistic, +6 to two or +4 to all, which was more impressive in H2 than H3. The Price of Loyalty expansion added the Battle Garb of Anduran, a prototype Set Artifact (unlike H3's set artifacts, it only took up one slot) consisting of three items - together providing +5 to attack, defence and spellpower, while also providing maximum luck and morale to your troops <em>and</em> giving the Town Portal spell. The eponymous campaign leads you to think it is a sword of plot advancement... except it turns out towards the end of the campaign that acquiring the third piece is done in an optional mission and you can skip ahead to confronting the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> true</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> instead.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TinyHeist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TinyHeist">Tiny Heist</a></em> has the Fire Extinguisher. Not only does it have 6 uses, which is the most out of any item, but it also covers a wide range when you use it, knocking out everyone in the area. It also doesn't alert anyone, unlike some weapons that are similar when used, but alerts everyone and has a smaller range and only works once.

The only way to get it is by moving through all of the impossible dungeons of J&ouml;tunheimr, home to the Evil-God Class monsters. One Evil-God Monster requires a party of more than 20 people with the best of equipment <em>just</em> to stand a chance in fighting them. The first time we see it, however, is when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kirito uses the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterConsole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterConsole">Master Console</a> to summon Excalibur.

But almost nobody would ever want to wield Excalibur because he is an unlikeable egotistical lunatic.
</li><li> Infinity +1 Swords are apparently a dime-a-dozen in the world of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThunderboltFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThunderboltFantasy">Thunderbolt Fantasy</a></em>, with clans of monks trained from birth to protect various such swords throughout the land. However, the Sword of Divine Retribution (Ti&#257;n X&iacute;ng Ji&agrave;n / Tengyouken) is said to be the most powerful of these swords, as it is said to have been the only one that was powerful enough to slay a demon god centuries before. This makes it the target of Betsu Ten Gai who wants it for his own selfish reasons, spurring the plot of season 1 when he launches a raid on Tan Ko and Tan Hi's shrine. The only person in the world who doesn't think the Sword of Divine Retribution is as important as everyone makes it out to be is Syou Fu Kan, a visitor from a foreign land unwittingly thrust into the plot of the theft of the sword; even when he sees part of it kept by the sole survivor Tan Hi, he is still suspicious of its power. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He turns out to be right when it is revealed the sword didn't slay the demon god but sealed it away in the grounds beneath the Tan clan's monastery. And he should know because he has the Sorcerous Sword Index, a magical scroll holding <strong>thirty-six</strong> weapons far more powerful than the Sword of Divine Retribution that he has stolen from various wizards, sages, and ne'er-do-wells from his homeland to prevent them from being used for evil. One spell cast by the Absolute Phantom - Catastrophe Sword is enough to throw the aforementioned demon god into the farthest reaches of outer space.</span>

The Night of Mourning is apparently incapable of actually injuring any human, but one touch from its blade turns anyone into the wielder's mindless puppet. And the Seven Blasphemous Deaths is sentient and uses its magical powers to compel people to want it for themselves; its wielder wants nothing more than to continue to wield it and protects it from all who come near, and anyone who gazes upon it is feverishly drawn to steal it for themselves only to meet their demise and have their spilt blood empower the sword and its wielder. And <em>there are still 33 more swords we don't know about</em>.</span>

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LoneWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LoneWolf">Lone Wolf</a></em>: The Sommerswerd, the Sword of the Sun. You get it in the second book, which seems somewhat game-breaking, but its later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">awesomeness</a> makes up for it by far. To get its full potential out, you require certain Kai skills during that book: Sixth Sense gets you a description about how the sword improves your Sixth Sense, and having Weaponskill (with the sword) gives you the "extra" CS bump of + 10 instead of + 8. Some of the later books have weapons that are either even stronger than your solar blade (e.g. the Death Staff) or don't create near as much attention when trying to deal a preemptive strike (e.g. the Ironheart Broadsword). For the most part, however, the Sommerswerd is the best you're going to get, due to being unable to keep the more powerful weapons at all. <br><br><em>The Prisoners of Time</em> and the infamous Chaos Master deserves special mention. (The other foe where the Sommerswerd is a handicap is Zakhan Kimah, but there are ways around this.) As mentioned before, the Chaos Master will be a lot stronger if you fight him with the Sommerswerd than if you don't have it and are able to obtain the Ironheart Broadsword. The problem is that if you <em>don't</em> have the Sommerswerd (you can't keep the IB), the LAST battle, a doubleheader against the condemned Sommlenders and Vonotar, will be nearly impossible to survive. Any way you look at it, 1) a mighty sword of the gods being weak against two enemies out of the dozens you'll face doesn't come close to justifying doing away with it and 2) completing <em>The Prisoners of Time</em> by ANY means is an Infinity Plus One task regardless of what kind of hardware you have.
