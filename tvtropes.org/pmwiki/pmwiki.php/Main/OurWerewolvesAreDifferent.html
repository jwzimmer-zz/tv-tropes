Far and away the most popular conceit is that a werewolf is a human who has somehow become able to temporarily transform (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvoluntaryShapeshifting">usually unwillingly</a>) into a wolf that goes on to run wild (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateIdentityAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateIdentityAmnesia">rarely remembering their romp</a>). Usual methods include a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViralTransformation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViralTransformation">Viral Transformation</a> spread by being bitten, but a lot of depictions show lycanthropy as solely hereditary. Other popular causes include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse">curses</a> and typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> experiments. Like most werewolves, the classic wolf-man only transforms on the full moon, or, failing that, at night, though none of this is a <em>given</em> in modern works.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterMash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterMash">Together</a> with Count <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dracula">Dracula</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mummy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mummy">Mummy</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrankensteinsMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrankensteinsMonster">Frankenstein's Monster</a>, this is generally considered to complete the set of "classic" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterMash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterMash">horror monsters</a>. Unlike the other three, however, there is no single specific source of popular werewolf lore. The closest claim to such a source in literature might be <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuyEndore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuyEndore">Guy Endore</a>'s classic novel <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWerewolfOfParis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWerewolfOfParis">The Werewolf Of Paris</a></em>, but cinema seems to have been more definitive in terms of shaping the concept. Hence, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LonChaneyJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LonChaneyJr">Lon Chaney Jr.</a>'s character (Lawrence Talbot) from the 1941 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWolfMan1941" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWolfMan1941">The Wolf Man</a></em>, as something closer to an ape with vaguely canine features is usually regarded as providing the template that others have followed. In 1981, with dramatic improvements in visual effects and makeup now available, the classic film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHowling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHowling">The Howling</a></em>, established the modern image of a werewolf as essentially a far more convincing humanoid canine creature, especially with the head now typically having a more convincing muzzle for the face.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Werewolves did not receive the same <em>revisionist</em> treatment as vampires did during the '90s, partly due to the high probability of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure">Special Effect Failure</a> in visual media, but also because the concept is <em>much</em> more difficult to rehabilitate. While having your neck bitten by beautiful people is erotic, being torn into bloody chunks and eaten is not. And in most common depictions, werewolves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateIdentityAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateIdentityAmnesia">aren't exactly sapient in wolf form.</a> Hence, they're often relegated to supporting roles in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FurAgainstFang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FurAgainstFang">Fur Against Fang</a> storylines and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink">Fantasy Kitchen Sink</a> settings. Surprisingly, such an earlier revisionist treatment happened in medieval times for fictitious werewolves; in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalricRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalricRomance">Chivalric Romance</a>, a werewolf could be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleWolf">perfectly gentle and noble beast</a>. Then again, with the growing knowledge that North American wolves have been seriously misunderstood and are not that aggressive to humans while being devoted parents thanks to classic works like <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NeverCryWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NeverCryWolf">Never Cry Wolf</a></em>, that lends itself to a serious image makeover as potentially heroic monsters. In fact, one can take it further considering with the proper circumstances and disposition with the being in sufficiently rational control, werewolves can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouSexyBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouSexyBeast">sexy</a> or even cuddly.
</p><p>As such, the werewolf's cachet has been rising. Recent works of note include the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WolvesOfMercyFallsSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WolvesOfMercyFallsSeries">Wolves of Mercy Falls</a></em> trilogy, Jennifer Lynn Barnes' <em>Raised by Wolves</em> trilogy, and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MercyThompson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MercyThompson">Mercy Thompson</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KittyNorville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KittyNorville">Kitty Norville</a></em> books. 2010 also saw a highly-publicized remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWolfman2010" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWolfman2010">The Wolfman</a></em>, although this depiction is much more traditional than the above. And they are very popular within the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FurryFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FurryFandom">Furry Fandom</a>, usually of the more-in-control-while-transformed variety, and their depictions therein can range from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationComic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationComic">innocent</a> to outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yiff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yiff">Yiff</a>.
</p><p>The word "werewolf" is a compound with the archaic English word <em>wer</em>. Etymologically, "man" was once genderless, and <em>wer</em> referred to a male adult; compare this to the Latin <em>vir</em>, where we get the words "virile" and "virtue". Hence, the not-uncommon female lycanthrope should more strictly be a "wifwolf" (or "woman-wolf"), a term that has not seen much actual use. Generally, werewolves are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>, going back to the European Middle Ages and to the Ancient Greek myth of a king cursed by Zeus to become one. Werewolves are very popular because of qualities of opposing forces of man versus animal nature.
</p><p>A common mistake is to use the word lycanthropy to describe <em>any</em> case of a being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">able to shift</a> between human and animal forms, as the root word "lyc" specifically means "wolf" (the proper term for other animal types is <em>therianthropy</em>&mdash;or, if you like, "werebeast").<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0o8p1');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0o8p1" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0o8p1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Curiously, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_lycanthropy">clinical lycanthropy<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is a term used to describe a psychiatric condition in which a person believes that they are transforming into an animal of any kind.</span>

</li><li> Free, of Atushi Ookubo's manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em> is a werewolf of the Man-Wolf variety. His transformation is entirely voluntary and is little more than cosmetic in regards to adding physical abilities (although it gives him claws and a tail). Free is also apparently immortal: He cannot die of old age and regenerates from practically any form of damage seen so far in the show (no-one have used fire or silver on him onscreen, but the witches probably tried it at some point during his imprisonment). He's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson">an ice mage</a> and illusionist, which come from the magic eye that he took from the leader of the witches.

They're among the most man-like out there, but they still exhibit a strong wild streak, with powerful instincts that they have to constantly suppress, as well as superhuman strength, speed and senses. Their instincts are their biggest problem, since once they give in to them they start to go wild and mad; the instincts tend to be strongly affected by the moon and by specific "tempting" humans.
</li><li> Jyabura, a villain from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, possesses a Devil Fruit power that allows him to transform into a wolf or a wolf/human hybrid that looks like a typical werewolf.

As a werewolf, his primary battle strategy involves super speed. He can transform at will, but his power varies according to the phase of the moon. He once lost a fight when a cloud covered the moon. Werewolves are, pound for pound, the second strongest monsters overall in Rosario, right under Vampires. In fact, under a full moon its possible for a werewolf to defeat several Vampires at once. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Gin is able to defeat an entire branch of Fairy Tale on his own with his Tengu friend Haji, and overpower several Shuzen Vampires during the final battle.</span>

He lacks any of your typical werewolf weaknesses, and be can usually transform at will, but he'll also occasionally change at random due to flaws in the procedure that have him his powers. His wolf form also has a markedly different personality than his human form &mdash; a berserk <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> vs a meek, stuttering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FarmBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FarmBoy">Farm Boy</a> with an inferiority complex.

In addition to allowing him to pass as human, this gives him the ability to transform into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolfMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolfMan">Wolf Man</a> form as well as a hybrid form, which he uses to keep the peace in Fabletown, but also makes him vulnerable to silver, which several villains have used against him in the comic and in the game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWolfAmongUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWolfAmongUs">The Wolf Among Us</a></em>.

She didn't just do that on impulse, but so that her descendants would be a part of the planet. In more recent issues (set about 20,000 years later) the elf <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kimo</span> has learned from Timmain how to shapeshift into a wolf.
</li><li> In Fred Perry's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GoldDigger">Gold Digger</a></em>, one of the main characters is one of the last Werecheetahs. Other weres include Lions, Tigers, Rats, and Wolves. Each subspecies is able to shift between human, animal, and a "Wolf-Man" styled hybrid form. All of the weres retain their rationality in each of their forms, although they need to learn to control their instincts during childhood. Although the weres are separate species, they are capable of spreading Lycanthropy to Humans as a disease; they were originally created by a wizard as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldiers</a> before said wizard was betrayed. They have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> for everything except attacks by another were &mdash; and silver, which literally burns their flesh and souls!

</li><li> <em>Little Gloomy</em> takes place in Spooksville, Frightsylvania, where the moon is <em>always</em> out, and <em>always</em> full. Accordingly, the sizable werewolf population is a constant danger to the average citizen, with one of the only civilized werewolves being Gloomy's friend Larry.
</li><li> <em>Thicker than Blood</em> features two brothers, one of whom is a werewolf (of the manwolf variety) while the other <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">turns out to be Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, or at least something like him</span>. The werewolf brother originally only transforms on the full moon nights after being bitten on a family trip, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after drinking his brother's serum</span> he appears to change more frequently and is even stronger and more feral than usual.
</li><li> <em>In the Blood</em> is a limited series, currently held up in production due to the artist suffering from cancer, which centers on a teenager struggling with his burgeoning lycanthropy. He seems to be unable to control when his transformations occur and is styled after the classic Lon Chaney wolfman style. It's been implied in interviews that this <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is a family affliction.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAstoundingWolfMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAstoundingWolfMan">The Astounding Wolf-Man</a></em>, written by Robert Kirkman, focuses on a man who, after being infected with lycanthropy on a family vacation, uses it as a means by which he can become a superhero. His werewolf powers give him super strength and healing, but only work at night. Also on the night of the full moon he enters a feral state and can no longer control his actions.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BeastsOfBurden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BeastsOfBurden">Beasts of Burden</a></em>, it's a demon possessing someone's body, doesn't seem to be restricted by moon cycle when taking over the body, and it gives the person the ability to talk to animals. Silver bullets are still the way to go though.
</li><li> In the Wildstorm title <em>Wetworks</em>, werewolves are a separate species (as are the vampires, with which the werewolves are secretly at war), which spend most of their time in human form, but have trouble controlling their rage when transformed into wolfmen. For the first two years of the title, the titular team was employed as vampire killers by the werewolf king (originally presenting himself merely as a human billionaire concerned about the vampire problem). An interesting twist is that most werewolves find it increasingly difficult to control their rage as they get older, so most of the governing in werewolf society is done by the children.

These werewolves are huge, skeletal and vicious, and have a propensity for eating human flesh, though notably they lack the invulnerability many werewolves had, and can be killed with physical weapons. They also transform very squickily, and seem functionally ageless.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Ferals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Ferals">Ferals</a></em> focuses on a breed of very violent and strong werewolves that do not appear to have any restrictions on when they can transform. While they are certainly not mindless, they do seem prone to unquenchable bloodlust and cruelty while they are in wolf form. They fall closest to the dire wolf flavor of lycanthropy, except perhaps with a gallon of steroids thrown in for good measure.

It involves various supernatural happenings, but Goofy insists that everything has a natural explanation in the end.

Additionally, there are <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> style werewolves, which are like canon, infectious, and akin to lesser versions of the loup-garou.

</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OutlawStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OutlawStar">Outlaw Star</a> fanfic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/AFistfulOfDragonite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/AFistfulOfDragonite">A Fistful of Dragonite</a></em> Aisha of the C'tarl Tribe proudly (and loudly) proclaims she is a mystical skinchanger, a rare breed of native capable of changing her shape into a voracious, ferocious beast. Whether or not this is true is... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane">subjective</a>.
</li><li> Lycanthropy is very thoroughly elaborated in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/Dangerverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/Dangerverse">Dangerverse</a>, and given that Remus Lupin is one of the main characters, virtually all the details are plot-relevant at some point or other.
<ul><li> Lycanthropy was created when Rhea Silvia, the she-wolf who nursed Romulus and Remus, pronounced a curse on the former for killing the later. The curse is in four parts: 1) That the victim shall transform into the likeness of a wolf at every full moon. 2) That when so transformed they shall have the mind of a rabid beast as well as the body of one, attacking every human they find. 3) That as a consequence of 1&amp;2, the victim shall be forever outcast and friendless. 4) That as Rhea's sole mercy, those so cursed shall be rendered sterile, that they might never know Rhea's pain.
</li><li> Lycanthropy is caused by a combination of a virus (which induces the physical changes) and a curse (which influences the mind). If the curse is transferred, the disease can be cured, but the reverse is not true.
</li><li> Fluid exchange or blood adoption can infect humans with a dormant version of the werewolf virus. This does not cause any of the usual effects, instead manifesting as the disease lupus. However, a wizard infected with this dormant form of the virus can give others lycanthropy when in an Animagus form.
</li><li> The strength of the werewolf curse can be affected by how its victims are treated immediately after the bite. If they are treated badly, then the curse is strengthened, but if they are shown love and friendship, it is weakened. After a short time, the curse "sets" and its strength then shall be its strength thereafter.
</li><li> Any weapon can harm werewolves, but silver is especially lethal. Even a scratch from a silver blade will cause a werewolf to die almost instantly (and very painfully), and just touching silver will burn werewolves even in their human form.

They are able to change whenever they want, but the full moon compels them to change anyway. They operate with their own customs and instincts they call "the Beast", this compelling them to hunt, fuck and seek companionship with other werewolves in the form of packs. There are such things as alpha-breeds that lead these packs.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WerewolfOfLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WerewolfOfLondon">Werewolf of London</a></em> (1935), the earliest extant werewolf feature film (some silent werewolf films existed, but are now lost), introduced the moon/werewolf connection and the contagion meme. Not only does the full moon cause the infected to transform, but the only antidote for the transformation (the "mariphasa") is a fictional flower which only blooms under moonlight.
</li><li> Curt Siodmak built on the above foundation in the script for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWolfMan1941" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWolfMan1941">The Wolf Man (1941)</a></em>, and added the henceforth near-unavoidable weakness to silver. "Even a man who is pure in heart, and says his prayers at night, may become a wolf when the wolfsbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright." A less copied touch is the trait of having the werewolf seeing the mark of a pentacle on his fated next victim. Even less copied, Lawrence Talbot (the hero/villain of the movie and its sequels) can come back even after being killed with silver if his body is exposed to the light of a full moon. This happens at least twice over the course of the movies. <br><br>There are references to the use of silver against werewolves as far back as in the 18th century or more. Back then silver was considered effective against all sorts of evil entities, and wasn't absolutely necessary in disposing them. In fact there are stories of using silver against them that go back to the 16th century, and possibly earlier, it merely wasn't that common until recently when this film made it popular.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnAmericanWerewolfInLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnAmericanWerewolfInLondon">An American Werewolf in London</a></em> used a dire wolf transformation, who proves vulnerable to ordinary gunfire. It also almost single-pawedly popularised the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">horrible transformation</a> subtrope. The transformation from <em>American Werewolf In London</em> is paid tribute to in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FrightNight1985" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FrightNight1985">Fright Night (1985)</a></em> where Evil Ed (who is a wolf at the time during that scene) turns back into a human.
</li><li> The modern man-wolf style made its popular debut in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHowling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHowling">The Howling</a></em> (1981), which featured infectious werewolves who otherwise acted as a species (changing at will and possibly retaining their own minds, though with predatory instincts). It should be noted that both <em>An American Werewolf in London</em> and <em>The Howling</em> came out in 1981 (as well as the sorta werewolf movie <em>Wolfen</em>). Together, they make an almost perfect example of this trope in action. In <em>The Howling</em> a character points out that the werewolves must be killed with silver, while saying the full moon thing is just Hollywood made up stuff. In <em>An American Werewolf in London</em>, the titular character is told by his now undead friend to commit suicide before transforming during the full moon, but when the werewolf asks if he needs silver bullets, he's told to get real!

In desperation, he acquires a mystic amulet that will supposedly prevent his transformation, but all it does is keep him in a half-man/half-werewolf (think about that one for a moment) state. Until the guy he bit shows up, more werewolfish than Will and threatening Will's new love interest. Will tosses the amulet aside and quickly catches up to the other werewolf, finally looking like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolfMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolfMan">Wolf Man</a> lite before leaving.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Werewolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Werewolf">Werewolf</a></em> was wildly inconsistent in its portrayal of the titular monsters; they vary between looking like really hairy men and looking like "a bear with a bat mask." Even a scratch from a dead werewolf's <em>bone</em> is enough to transmit "werewolfism" to other people; one victim gets scratched and transforms <em>while driving</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mike and the 'bots</a> did not let this pass without comment; for instance, the sketch where Mike accidentally gets scratched by Crow and begins transforming into a "were-Crow", or "Where Oh Werewolf". The film has the gall to go out of its way to argue that its titular beast is "not a traditional white man's movie monster", but some obscure Native American curse. And then proceeds to have said werewolf behave... exactly like a white man's movie monster. It is claimed that the silver bullets only incapacitated one of the infected characters. And the inconsistent makeup seems to just show progression; they just look very hairy at the start of their transformation, and wear the bat-mask when they're fully "wolf". By the way, said werewolves aren't very tough; a random bystander gets into a fistfight with one, and <em>almost wins</em>.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Underworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Underworld">Underworld</a></em>, werewolves, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotUsingTheZWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotUsingTheZWord">lycans</a>, are from the brother strain of the virus that produced the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">vampires</a>. There are two strains of werewolves. The first came from the first werewolf, William Corvinus, and all those bitten by him. They're dire wolves, but they can never turn back to humans ever again, and they've permanently lost their minds. The second version is the ones descended from Lucian, who was born from a woman who had been turned by one of William's wolves while pregnant. They are monstrous man-wolves with jet black skin and very little hair. The latter ones go berserk on their first transformations, but as they age they can gain control. They can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">voluntarily transform</a> during the full moon, but they don't have to, and again, older ones can transform when they please. Both forms are transferred via a bite, though it's briefly mentioned that only a small percentage of humanity can be turned, and in the rest, the virus is fatal. Both forms are regenerating immortals. (Immortal to an extent anyway; silver works, but ripping their head off without silver works too). There's also Michael Corvin, who's a badass hybrid as a result of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Selene turning him near the end of the movie</span>, but resembles a werewolf far more than a vampire, likely because he was bitten by a werewolf first. He's a wolf man, and has complete and total control over his transformations, sometimes even doing partial transformations with ease.
<ul><li> Lucian is also notable for having learned precise muscle control, allowing him to expel silver bullets before they poison him. Unfortunately, this is useless against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">silver nitrate, which is a liquid</span>.
</li><li> Similar to Michael, Marcus becomes a hybrid <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by accidentally tasting the blood of a lycan</span>. However, since he was a vampire first (the first vampire, no less, which is what allows him to survive the transition), his new form is distinctly more bat-like, even including wings that allow him to fly or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice">impale</a> anyone. He still appears to fear sunlight, but that may be a psychological effect from all the centuries of fearing it and the unwillingness to test his limits. He is even tougher than Michael, although <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being put through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelicopterBlender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelicopterBlender">Helicopter Blender</a> appears to do the trick</span>.

When they turn back into a human they tear off their werewolf skin.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GingerSnaps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GingerSnaps">Ginger Snaps</a></em> trilogy.
<ul><li> The first film has its title character bitten by a werewolf on the night that she gets her first period. Unlike most werewolf movies, Ginger's transformation into the monster (which is of the Man-Wolf type) is gradual and irreversible, and there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">many ties with the onset of puberty</a>. Silver and wolfsbane (usually referred to as monk's hood) work on the werewolves, though the latter must be liquefied and injected to have any real effect. Werewolves also turn out to be as vulnerable to mundane <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarFu">vehicular manslaughter</a> and kitchen knives as they are to specific weaknesses. While the film never draws attention to it, lycanthropy is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingInTheWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingInTheWizard">portrayed about as scientifically as possible</a>, with few if any overt supernatural elements and the transformation coming off more as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">The Virus</a>.

It's revealed that the effect of monk's hood is not only temporary, but that the body gradually builds up a tolerance to it and requires ever-greater doses to stave off transformation, extending the first film's puberty metaphor to one for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticDrug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticDrug">drug addiction</a>.

But other than The Twins, the rest don't really exhibit any of the typical traits (other than Persephone using a silver bullet to kill a supposed werewolf program).

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a> has one of the oldest examples of a werewolf. A king named Lycaon tried to serve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">the flesh of his own son Nyctimus</a> as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice">meal for Zeus</a>. But instead, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards">Zeus punished Lycaon</a> by changing him into a wolf. We call the belief in werewolves '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AKindOfOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AKindOfOne">lycanthropy</a>' ever since.
</li><li> The werewolf of Western medieval tradition tended to fall in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Devil's deal</a> category<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3fqwp');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3fqwp" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3fqwp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">a basic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> applied by the Church to most sorts of evil magic</span>, with the bargainer typically gaining the ability to become a normal or dire wolf through the use of a magic wolf pelt or wolfskin belt. According to the church of the time, the Devil would <em>not</em> actually be powerful enough to change the physical forms of anyone&mdash;that level of control over the fabric of reality was reserved for God. Satanist werewolves thus weren't actually shapeshifters, just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfIllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfIllusion">illusionists</a> who liked to terrify their victims before slaughtering them. When they killed people with their bare hands and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">ate the corpses</a>, they were fully human and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">fully aware of what they were doing</a>. <em>Benighted</em> (<em>Bareback</em> to all you British readers) discusses the mythology in some detail in an appendix. <br><br>Outside the official Church line, magic was considered real and powerful (at least enough to grant powers like shapeshifting), but the legal treatment was purely based on the effects; supposedly killing a person or animal by magic was considered essentially the same as poisoning, for example (and considering that "witch" and "poisoner" were often the same word in many languages, including Latin, this made a certain amount of sense). In any case, many sociopathic serial killers of the era were considered, and possibly considered themselves to be, werewolves. Also, the crime of bestiality was often associated to werewolfism, as well. Accusations of being a werewolf were generally a subset of accusations of witchcraft, with the same deadly punishment.
</li><li> The other common variety is an ordinary man, sometimes even a man of faith, cursed to be a wolf for a certain amount of time, usually ten years. In this case they had all their normal intelligence and personality, but were trapped in the wolf's body. Notably, the cursed variety is normally described to be completely harmless, even less dangerous than ordinary wolves. Often they were described as such lousy hunters that it makes you wonder how they survived their cursed period at all.
</li><li> Rougarou <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSavageSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSavageSouth">from Louisiana folklore</a> are humans who turn into people with wolf heads every night. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Because of this, they are very lethargic when in human form.</a> They are also said to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight">enjoy eating Catholics who break Lent.</a> A rougarou can pass the curse on to someone else from the 41st day onward, no sooner. They are vulnerable to decapitation and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">Kill It with Fire</a>.
</li><li> In Slavic folklore, the process of "turning into a wolf" is sometimes interpreted very literally: one must turn around, or somersault, and land in a new shape. While holding onto a magic blade, stuck into a magic tree. If the blade is then removed by someone, the poor sorcerer-gymnast remains in the animal form. This would be the cursed variety - cursed by their own curiosity and lack of foresight. Evil sorcerers, on the other hand, usually keep track of the knife.
</li><li> Herodotus mentions a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarbarianTribe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarbarianTribe">Barbarian Tribe</a> he calls "Neuroi", who might or might not have been ancestors of the Slavs. He records that they were said to all turn into wolves for a couple of days a year. This is generally interpreted as a reflection of shamanic practices and/or belief in werewolves.
</li><li> An interesting variation was the Hounds of God. In Swedish Livonia, a man by the name of Thiess claimed that Werewolves were given their powers not by the Devil, but by God to battle the forces of the Devil. Our Werewolves Are Different indeed. So, no, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VanHelsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VanHelsing">Van Helsing</a></em> wasn't just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees">making shit up</a>, and neither was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheApocalypse">Werewolf: The Apocalypse</a></em> (see Tabletop Gaming). Neil Gaiman used this variant too, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGraveyardBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGraveyardBook">The Graveyard Book</a></em>.
<ul><li> A similar story to that of Thiess is the <em>benandanti</em> ("good walkers" in Italian). According to this legend from the Friuli section of northern Italy, these are heroic creatures born with their powers, who leave their bodies every night, wield iron bars and journey into the underworld to battle evil witches and preserve the fertility of the local farmland. Curiously, only men are said to become animal-like when they leave their bodies; women <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">ride on animals instead</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Castilian "Lobo Hechizado" (lit. "Cursed Wolf"): a man cursed to transform into a wolf in certain nights, where it is dangerous to people, <em>but</em> he can tell when he is going to transform beforehand and is gentle enough to alert his neighbors so they can hide in their houses and be safe when it happens. The identity of the wolfman is known by everyone in town, making it the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample">Ur-Example</a> of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyNeighborhoodVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyNeighborhoodVampire">Friendly Neighborhood Werewolf</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/CelticMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/CelticMythology">Celtic Mythology</a> has the Faoladh, another benevolent version of the werewolf. Supposedly they protected children and wounded men. Despite that, they still liked to abscond with livestock when they could<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note42qnk');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note42qnk" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note42qnk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">not necessarily an excessively evil thing, as cattle-raiding is very common among heroes and villains alike in Celtic legend</span>.

The usually accepted etymology for the word is <em>ber-serkr</em>, which meant "bear shirt"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5g1tw');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5g1tw" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5g1tw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Tolkien possibly had those guys in mind when he created the character of Beorn</span>. Berserkers who wore wolf pelts were called "&uacute;lfh&eacute;&eth;nar" (wolf coats). Despite their reputation in modern fiction, they actually <em>didn't</em> go berserk in battle, but were often the best trained and capable fighting warriors a lord might have; frequently asked to fight on their behalf in organized duels. The position was often translated as "Champion" in English for this reason, selected for their power and skill and distinguished by the afformentioned pelt; which was thought to give them the killing instinct of a wolf or bear.
</li><li> Werewolves are also listed as a side effect of one obscure Scandinavian folk-magic spell. If a woman stretches the afterbirth of a horse (the membrane the foal was in before coming out of the mare) between two sticks, then crawls through the opening without tearing it, it is said she shall never experience pain in childbirth &mdash; at the expense of all her boy children being born werewolves, and all of her girl children being born maras (dream witches).
</li><li> In Basque folklore, the wolfman (Gizotso) is the literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">hybrid offspring</a> of a human and a wolf, and as a result it suffers no transformation. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">Fridge Horror</a> sets in when you take into account that it also wears broken chains, as if it has just escaped someone's basement...
</li><li> A very peculiar version of the werewolf is the Galician-Portuguese lobisome(m). Despite its name literally meaning "wolf-man", the lobisomem <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallAPegasusAHippogriff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallAPegasusAHippogriff">actually turns into</a> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsEvil">black</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixAndMatchCritters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixAndMatchCritters">pig-dog hybrid thing</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> Because of emigration, the Lobisomem myth became particularly rooted in the La Plata basin in South America, to the point that its belief has been related with the persecution of the local <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maned_wolf">maned wolf<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltByAssociation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltByAssociation">inoffensive</a> and almost vegetarian. Argentina even passed a law in 1907 that declared every 7th son to be the godson of the President, in an attempt to decrease the abandonment of these children by superstitious couples. Possibly because of Guarani influence, in Brazil and Paraguay the lobisomem evolved into a furry monkey-bat thing that sucks human blood, and when on all fours it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">closely resembles</a> the modern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chupacabra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chupacabra">Chupacabra</a>.
<ul><li> Speaking of Guaran&iacute; mythology, they have stories about a being known as <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luison">Luis&oacute;n<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, who was the seventh son of Tau and Kerana and was the most accursed of them all. He was usually described as an extremely ugly, vaguely humanoid-looking monstrous canine with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSmellsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSmellsBad">rather fetid smell</a> and was often associated with death, to the point he served a similar role as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">The Grim Reaper</a> in some tales. He was said to dwell in cemeteries, burial grounds and his only source of food was the rotting flesh of corpses. In some versions, Luis&oacute;n only appears on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday night, and it was said that if Luis&oacute;n passes through a person's legs, said person will transform into a Luis&oacute;n themselves. With the arrival of European settlers, many legends began to mix with those of the foreigners and changed, and Luis&oacute;n's myth merged so much with other stories of werewolves that he eventually ended up regarded as being another generic werebeast.
</li></ul></li><li> Vampires were originally very similar to (or basically were) werewolves. In some historical lore, vampires would turn into wolves rather than bats<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0x9e9');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0x9e9" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0x9e9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the "vampires turn into bats" trope is just a bit over hundred years old in any case, only first thought up by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BramStoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BramStoker">Bram Stoker</a> when he heard of blood-drinking bats in South America</span>. The connection is made even further with beliefs that if one fails to properly dispose of a werewolf's corpse, it will rise up as a vampire.
</li><li> Pennsylvania is absolutely <em>crawling</em> with legends of werewolves. Dozens of stories from Western Pennsylvania (no such stories seem to exist east of the Susquehanna or south of the Poconos, so Philly is relatively "safe" if you believe these stories) show what many people have described as werewolves, from different witnesses, multiple times.
</li><li> Then there's <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beast_of_Bray_Road">the Beast of Bray Road<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, sighted near Elkhorn, Wisconsin. While reports vary, some of the descriptions closely resemble a Wolf Man.
</li><li> In the oldest versions of the fairytale <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleRedRidingHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleRedRidingHood">Little Red Riding Hood</a></em>, the Big Bad Wolf was actually referred to as a werewolf rather than being a wolf with sentience and speaking ability. Thus the original versions of the tale averted the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> of someone actually mistaking an animal dressed in a nightgown as being their grandmother, in contrast with the later versions that made the heroine a girl who lacked commonsense.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ForteanTimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ForteanTimes">Fortean Times</a></em> recently reported on a rabbinical rationale dating from the fourteenth century that addressed the problem of werewolves in Jewish belief. Living as outsiders in Central Europe, Jews would have been fully aware of the belief in werewolves prevalent in the Gentile world around them. The issue was not <em>if</em> werewolves existed - it was taken as a given that they <em>did</em>. Therefore G-d must have created them, or tolerated their creation by Satan. The problem was how this could be squared with Scripture. A theological argument was advanced that when G-d cursed the serpent in the Garden of Eden to lose its limbs and crawl on its belly hereafter, the Almighty, by default, bequeathed a shape-shifting ability on such creatures. Later in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>, the Nephilim come into the world and mate with the daughters of Man, thus introducing a degree of angelic stock into the human race. By default, the Nephilim included the fallen angels of Satan. By mating with human women they introduced the shape-shifting ability G-d cursed the serpent with. (which neatly explains <em>all</em> werecreatures). The issue of the rest of Israel ganging up to nearly exterminate the tribe of Benjamin comes into it too: Biblical scripture notes Benjaminites had the suspicious and thought-to-be satanic trait of being left-handed. A line in the Bible likens Benjamin to wolves who strike mercilessly from the night. Rabbinical thought asked - what if this is <em>not</em> a poetic metaphor, but literal description of a tribe of werewolves within the Jewish fold? The near-extermination of the tribe then becomes an act of ethnic cleansing - to remove the werewolf taint from Israel and allow so few survivors (as there must always be twelve tribes of Israel) who are then explicitly found wives from other tribes, so as to dilute and hopefully eradicate the werewolf taint. And after the Babylonian exile, the lost tribe of Benjamin dispersed into the world, the werewolf strain not completely removed, and, losing their Israeli and Jewish identity, became the source of the world's werecreatures...
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Romania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Romania">Romania</a> has the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pricolici">Pricolici<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

<ul><li> Werewolves have always been able to take on the normal wolf form and infect with a bite, but other details have cropped up with the evolution of the game, including the addition of a "hybrid" form equivalent to the Man-Wolf, the existence of natural lycanthropes in addition to infected ones, and the imposition of a whole new alignment (and personality) not just on the nonhuman forms but on the human(oid) as well. The game later inversed the process with the wolfwere (and subsequent varieties of beast-were), who is an evil, intelligent, shapeshifting wolf who assumes a human form to mingle in society and lure potential victims. Werewolves and wolfweres both share intense loathing for each other.
<ul><li> In 2nd edition, there was also the seawolf (an amphibious werewolf that could take the form of either a water-breathing man-wolf or a giant wolf-headed seal) and the loup de noir (a "skinchanger" werewolf who assumed wolf form by donning an enchanted wolf's pelt).

Newly-infected weres would generally start out much weaker than their default "normal monster"-level cousins and had to earn experience in beast form to get the full range of abilities, but could also eventually end up considerably more powerful (including eventually acquiring the hybrid "beast-man" form at suitably high level). The book also justifies the infectiousness of lycanthropy by making the cause of it an explicit magical virus that escaped from an Alphatian laboratory involved in shapeshifting research centuries ago and mutated into a number of distinct strains as it spread.

<ul><li> Werwolves are the archetypal lycanthropes, being hunters in the wilderness and banes of travelers, villagers and farmers. They're humanoids afflicted by an infectious curse, which gives them the ability to shift between humanoid, wolf and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolfMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolfMan">Wolf Man</a> forms in exchange for being locked into wolf form during the full moon. They can either natural (born to werewolf parents, and themselves werewolves all their lives) or afflict (born as a normal humanoid and later afflicted through another werewolf's bite).
<ul><li> Afflicted werewolves have difficulty controlling their transformations, and lose their memory and sense of self during the full moon &mdash; they'll rampage as an animal all night and then wake up with no memory of their time spent as a wolf. They can be cured of their condition before their first transformation by eating the toxic wolfsbane plant and surviving the ensuing poisoning.
</li><li> Natural werewolves are in full control of their shifts and retain their minds and memories during the full moon's change. However, they're prevalently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil">Chaotic Evil</a> and deeply contemptuous of afflicted werewolves, other lycanthropes and non-lycanthropic humanoids, viewing the first two groups as their lessers and the third as prey. They however get along fairly well with winter wolves, a breed of giant, intelligent, evil wolves capable of speech. They usually worship Jezelda, the demon lord of werwolves and the moon. Natural werewolves cannot be turned into non-werewolf humanoids by any means short of magic capable of outright changing a being's species.

Wulfen make up the vast majority of the Space Wolves' 13th Company, which disappeared into the Warp millennia ago along with Leman Russ, although the rules supplement <em>Curse of the Wulfen</em> brought the 13th Company back from the Warp to Fenris to help fight off a Chaos invasion.

These "Garou" are crusading eco-warriors trying to defend the world from the depredations of evil spirits of corruption and greed (and, to a slightly lesser extent, protect the natural world from regular human encroachment). They can change into a variety of forms at will, their go-to for a fight being a giant humanoid with a wolf's head. They frequently interact with the spirit world and travel back and forth between realms often. Werewolves can breed with either humans or wolves. To mate with another werewolf is strictly forbidden, but of course it does happen from time to time, the result being a deformed and sterile pariah.

As in the previous game, these werewolves are dreamspeaking, spirit-walking shaman types who police the border between the realms and keep spirits from setting up camp in the physical world, for the good of all. This game is called "The Forsaken" because the werewolves, called Uratha, are actually outcasts among their own kind, persecuted by other werewolf tribes as part of a blood feud dating to the beginning of the world. Werewolfery is hereditary, almost all werewolves growing up believing themselves human. Shacking up with your fellow werewolf is still a no-no and the result is a scary creature indeed. In all White Wolf games, silver is the big Kryptonite factor for werewolves. A few magical spells in "The Forsaken" use wolfsbane to rob the Uratha of their shapeshifting power for a time.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10">Ben 10</a></em> episode "Benwolf", we were introduced to an alien version of the werewolf called a Loboan (which was mistaken by everyone for a Navajo werewolf called the Yenaldooshi). It scratches the Omnitrix thus causing Ben to slowly and seemingly painlessly turn into another alien werewolf. Later, the creature is added to the Omnitrix's active list and he later dubs it Benwolf (renamed Blitzwolfer in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10Omniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10Omniverse">Ben 10: Omniverse</a></em>).

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></em> featured a somewhat unusual version in the Minerva Mink short "Moon Over Minerva". A geeky wolf, named Wilford B. Wolf, would turn into a hunky wolf when exposed to the full moon. Minerva won't give his geeky self the time of day, but she goes crazy for his moonlit self. Needless to say the short is pretty heavy on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">Fanservice</a> for both the male and female audiences. Also doubles as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouSexyBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouSexyBeast">You Sexy Beast</a>.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UglyAmericans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UglyAmericans">Ugly Americans</a></em>, werewolves turn shortly after being bitten, but retain their intelligence. They're still pretty vicious though, one tore a man's arm off just to get tickets to a magic show. After turning, that man grew his arm back, albeit very slowly (it took the entire episode just to grow the arm to half its original size). They also don't turn back, or it hasn't been shown anyway.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyBravo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyBravo">Johnny Bravo</a></em>, called "A Wolf in Chick's Clothing", involved Johnny finding out that his date was a werewolf. He went on the date anyway, reasoning that he just had to stick it out until sunrise for her to turn back into a beautiful woman. Unfortunately, it was a Wednesday, and it turns out that on Wednesdays she turns into an annoying little man named Melvin who keeps trying to show people his stamp collection.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JonnyQuestTheRealAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JonnyQuestTheRealAdventures">Jonny Quest: The Real Adventures</a></em>, the transformation into a werewolf comes because of a genetic disorder that only affects men.
<ul><li> Averted in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JonnyQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JonnyQuest">Jonny Quest</a></em> series, where a werewolf was just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScoobyDooHoax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScoobyDooHoax">"Scooby-Doo" Hoax</a> formulated by a crew of gold-smugglers.

The Wolfman can only be killed by a silver bullet. The death will only be temporary and he will heal as soon as the bullet leaves him (even if he has to rot and decay for 70 years before the bullet leaves). The only way for him to permanently die is if a lover fires the silver bullet.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> has the Whywolves, which are werewolves-like creatures born out of inquiry and <strong>bloodlust</strong>. Finn mistook them for normal werewolves at first, however, so there might be one than one type. Another episode had Finn get infected by being hugged by a "Hug wolf", a werewolf with heart-shaped hands and feet that hugged anyone it came across.

Velma becomes a werewolf very briefly (along with Fred who becomes a vampire, and Daphne who turns into a witch) as a result of the Goblin King's magic sceptor.
</li></ul></li><li> In the episode "A Wolf in Cheap Clothing" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChipNDaleRescueRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChipNDaleRescueRangers">Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers</a></em> a wolf has been robbing homes. It turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that the villain, Professor Nimnul, has been using an invention that turns him into a wolf, but in order to do so, the device must turn a wolf (in this case a perfectly innocent wolf named Harry from the local zoo) into a human. In other words, it switches Nimnul's humanity with Harry's wolf-ity</span>, making one a voluntary werewolf and the other an involuntary wolfwere.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a></em> episode "A Wolf In Peewit's Clothing", Peewit becomes a werewolf when he eats an enchanted condiment called Wolf Gravy with his dinner, and is turned back to normal by eating a garlic bud. The same thing also happens to Greedy, although only his face gets turned into something vaguely resembling a wolf. In "I Was A Brainy Weresmurf", Brainy turns into a furry blue weresmurf by being scratched by a thorny plant called wolfsbane, and is turned back to normal by wearing a garland of silveroot and garlic.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CatDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CatDog">CatDog</a></em> episode "Full Moon Ever" establishes that Dog transforms into a wolf-like state during the full moon.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerryTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerryTales">Tom and Jerry Tales</a></em> episode "Monster Con" has Jerry befriending a werewolf that acts like a playful dog. Tom also turns into a "werewolf-cat" after getting bitten by said werewolf.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Toonsylvania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Toonsylvania">Toonsylvania</a></em> episode "WereGranny" had Dr. Vic's grandmother become a werewolf who changes even when she looks at a picture of the moon or hears someone say "moon". Igor and Phil initially think that they've turned Dr. Vic's granny into a werewolf by brewing her tea from wolfbane, but Dr. Vic reveals at the end of the episode that his grandmother has always been a werewolf.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PJMasks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PJMasks">PJ Masks</a></em> has The Wolfy Kids, a trio of werewolf-like villains. Physically, they mostly resemble the beastman version of werewolves (human looking, but with claws on their hands and feet, sharp teeth, pointy ears and long messy hair). They also display typical wolf behaviour like running on all fours, howling, and biting, though they can also walk on just their hind legs, and are still capable of speech.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Popeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Popeye">Popeye</a></em> episode "The Wiffle Bird's Revenge" has Wimpy turning into a werewolf every time he says "hamburger".

They power down into their human forms, which poses a problem because the hotel has a strict "no humans" policy.
</li><li> Wulf from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em> is an Esperanto-speaking <em>ghost werewolf</em> with extendable claws which can tear up portals between Earth and the Ghost Zone. He is not shown to have the ability to shapeshift, and is presented as an anthropomorphic muscular wolf.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck">Darkwing Duck</a></em> episode "Monsters R Us", Morgana's father transforms the eponymous character into a duck-billed and poodle-like werewolf that often acts like a dog. With his new wolf form, Darkwing puts on a new alias known as "Darkwolf Dog".
</li><li> Bernard from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OKKOLetsBeHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OKKOLetsBeHeroes">OK K.O.!

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MightyMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MightyMax">Mighty Max</a></em> episode "Werewolves of Dunneglen" saw Max travel to Scotland to confront what was thought to be a murderous werewolf. Turned out that the werewolves were the immortal protectors of the land and were quite benevolent. While they did have the power to shift shape between human and wolf forms, it was not an ability they could willingly transfer via a bite. In fact, the power was being stolen by the actual villain of the episode, who had captured the pack and was milking them of essence.
</li><li> The movie <em>100% Wolf</em> is about a clan of werewolves that perform rescue operations throughout their town while transformed at night. They transform under a direct beam of moonlight and revert back in the sun. They can't be understood by normal humans when transformed but they can speak to dogs in both forms, which they ironically have a mutual animosity with, being wrongfully perceived by them as dog-eating monsters and thus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon">mistreated at any opportunity</a>. The conflict of the movie is the teenage protagonist undergoing his first transformation and becoming a small poodle instead of a large wolf. They're also vulnerable to silver, and can be locked into their transformed state indefinitely by slapping a band of it on them.

These ancient Germanic and Norse warriors were reported to having wore wolf pelts in battle and fought with unprecedented and animalistic ferocity, giving off the impression that these warriors were shape-shifters that became the animals whose skins they wore.

It affects the parts of the brain that manage a person's body image, so they actually experience shifting shape into something that isn't human, and interpret it as turning into an animal.
</li><li> There is also a genetic disease called hypertrichosis, that consists of people having hair practically in all of their skin. It is nicknamed "the werewolf syndrome".
</li><li> Porphyria, due to the fact that nails and teeth redden and people affected also have photophobia, which means they can only be out at night.
