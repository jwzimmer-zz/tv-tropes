It happened literally in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger">Great Mazinger</a></em> when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kenzo Kabuto died because the Mykene</span> and Kouji and Tetsuya <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(his biological son and adoptive son, respectively)</span> went in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> to avenge him. Likewise, the parents of Duke Fleed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and his sister Maria</span> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UFORoboGrendizer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UFORoboGrendizer">UFO Robo Grendizer</a></em> were murdered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion">the Vegan army</a>, and he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and she</span> want to avenge their deaths. And Maria also wants avenging <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her adoptive grandfather.</span>
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfroSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfroSamurai">Afro Samurai</a></em> when Justice kills Afro's father at the beginning of the series.<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then Afro does the same to Shichigoro, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge">leading to his son going for revenge on Afro</a>.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>:
<ul><li> Theresia the daughter of the Count blames Guts for his part in her father demise viva the God Hand, however Guts praises her hatred saying it will keep her alive. Though Guts was not above shedding a subtle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears">tear</a> over Theresia unfairly blaming him for the Count's well <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicHell">deserved fate</a>. Since Theresia hasn't been seen in over a hundred chapters, it's safe to assume Guts is safe from her revenge.
</li><li> In prototype-Berserk, Guts's motivation for hunting down the order of Demons, was because his mother was torn apart by them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>
<ul><li> The Grand Fisher killed Ichigo's mother and uses that against him when they fight. Ichigo is determined to resolve the matter for his mother's sake but eventually it's Isshin who does so.
</li><li> After Souken died, Mayuri captured his soul, and tortured him to death <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience">For Science!</a>. Uryuu almost kills both himself and Mayuri to avenge his grandfather, but they both survive. The storyline remains unresolved.
</li><li> In the Captain Amagai, Amagai is haunted by his father's death and wishes he could avenge it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The arc's entire plot is his gambit to destroy Yamamoto for killing his father. When he learns Yamamoto saved his father's soul from possession, he kills himself to atone for his misguided behaviour.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>
<ul><li> Averted by Son Goku when he can't bring himself to kill Frieza, who not only killed his father, but also almost extinguished his entire race. Played straight, however, with Vegeta <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeFatherLikeSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeFatherLikeSon">and his son</a> Trunks.
</li><li> Played straight with Piccolo, who was literally born to hate and kill Goku. His father Piccolo Daimaou created him moments after Goku dealt him a fatal blow and passed on his grudge to his newborn son. Piccolo actually does manage to kill Goku during their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">teamup</a> against Raditz when Goku holds Raditz in place long enough for Piccolo to hit them both with his new super move. Piccolo mellows out considerably afterwards, since he felt no satisfaction from killing Goku. He just couldn't keep hating Goku after seeing him pull off such a badass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>. Bonding with Goku's son Gohan while training him cemented the end of Piccolo's grudge.
</li><li> Gohan says something similar to Cell after he comes back in the Cell saga: "I'm glad that I can rip apart the one who killed my father with my own hands!"
</li><li> Future Trunks' father from his timeline was killed by the androids, whom Trunks later kills. His father from the present timeline is killed by Frieza, whom he kills as well. Oh and Future Trunks also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTheManHeUsedToBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTheManHeUsedToBe">splits</a> Zamasu/Goku Black (who killed Future Bulma) in half.
</li><li> Majin Buu also killed Goten's mother and ate Trunks' mother. Frieza killed Vegeta's father as well as the entire Saiyan race. Yeah, the villains do this a lot.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MermaidMelodyPichiPichiPitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MermaidMelodyPichiPichiPitch">Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch</a></em>, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kaito forgives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManBehindTheMan">Man Behind the Man</a> Sara for killing his parents. She eventually commits suicide by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollapsingLair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollapsingLair">collapsing fortress</a>.</span>
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew">Tokyo Mew Mew</a></em> anime is a mini-arc, just before the climax, where Ryou commands the titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girls</a> against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook">Giant Mook</a> that killed his parents. This was nowhere in the manga.
</li><li> In a unique villainous example, this is Malik of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a>'s</em> motivation for trying to defeat the Nameless Pharaoh. Of course, it turns out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror">his</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide">Super-Powered Evil Side</a>, generated by resentment towards his duty to the Pharaoh (specifically, his father <em>carving symbols into his back</em>), was the killer, and Malik's believing it was the Pharaoh was based on a misunderstanding.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam</a></em> features a rather harsh version of this in the case of Kamille Bidan's mother. Jerid Messa, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a> rival and already not on Kamille's good side, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">given orders</a> to shoot at a capsule if anyone attempts to retrieve it. Having been led to believe it was a bomb, he destroys the capsule holding Kamille's mother, killing her just as Kamille had reached the capsule to retrieve it. Jerid is able to feel Kamille's sadness as a sickening uneasiness, and when given the opportunity, actually apologizes for having killed his mother. He is still a bit too much of a jerk about it, though, and this death starts a vicious cycle of doom and revenge for anyone who gets close to either Jerid or Kamille throughout the series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoneWolfAndCub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoneWolfAndCub">Lone Wolf and Cub</a></em> ends <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> with Yagyuu Retsudou dying at the hands of <em>Daigorou</em>, after killing Ittou.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SamuraiDeeperKyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SamuraiDeeperKyo">Samurai Deeper Kyo</a></em> averts/subverts this with Yuya, who, after a four-year hunt for the murderer of her father figure&mdash;her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodSiblings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodSiblings">brother Nozomu</a>&mdash;discovers <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that Kyoshiro was the one who killed him. She doesn't take her revenge, but she doesn't forgive him, either.</span>
</li><li> Gene Starwind from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OutlawStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OutlawStar">Outlaw Star</a></em> has a vendetta with Ron McDougall over this act, which receives regular flashbacks throughout the series that drive home its impact, and tells him as much. Ron responds that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday">he can't be expected to remember every murder he has committed</a>, famous hit man that he is.

No one seeks vengeance for their mothers (if they're mentioned at all), although in Ike's case it's rather justified.
<ul><li> Joshua from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones">The Sacred Stones</a></em> does avenge his mother, though you only see him doing so in Eirika's path.

She then dressed as a man (not that hard, apparently, as she was described as very ugly) to fight in the wars in the Vend&eacute;e on the royalist side, evading capture until 1809. We only got her own words (i. e. her memoirs, written in 1814) for it, but she claimed once to have killed 21 men in a single battle.
</li><li> In the days of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildWest">The Wild West</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGunslinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGunslinger">The Gunslinger</a> John Wesley Hardin was famed for his bloodthirstiness and had killed two dozen or so men. Even so he ended up being released from prison because his term was up and was free to wander about doing mischief (yeah, that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment">The Government</a> for you).

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cambodia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cambodia">Khmer Rouge</a> seemed to be aware of this trope. When they executed someone, they also made sure to kill their children afterwards. The reason: "to stop them growing up and taking revenge for their parents' deaths". During their reign, Cambodia lost a third of its population, and it's conceivable that, had they held on for another decade, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayorOfAGhostTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayorOfAGhostTown">they'd have no population left.</a>
</li><li> Feudal Japan's Samurai made this a morbid tradition. The Code of Bushido makes avenging your master/teacher/father a core duty, for things like cutting him down in battle for example. As samurai tend to teach the family business to their kids as it were, the result were often blood feuds the stretch across generations &mdash; each side believing itself to be the heroic, righteous and honorable party while the other side the vile villains without self-reflective irony. This also comes with a dash of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedCultured" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedCultured">Wicked Cultured</a> as these honor duels eventually developed their own elaborate code of conduct and manners.
</li><li> This was horribly invoked by Heinrich Himmler during a speech for Navy officers: he explained he had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust">to murder the wives and the children</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">the partisans</a> and the "Jewish commissars" so that they didn't avenge the death of their fathers when they grew up...
