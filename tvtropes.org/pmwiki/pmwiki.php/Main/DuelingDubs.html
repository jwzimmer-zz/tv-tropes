<p>A peculiar phenomenon where a foreign product will get a localization in a region or language, and then get a different localization in the same language in the same region (or another where the same language is spoken). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">And another</a>.
</p><p>Why does this happen? Perhaps the first try was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation">hackjob</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagDub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagDub">comical rewrite</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HongKongDub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HongKongDub">simply sounded bad</a>, and there was demand for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/SuperlativeDubbing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/SuperlativeDubbing">significantly better localization</a>. Perhaps some new company got the rights and can't use the previous group's resources due to some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers">licensing hell</a>. Perhaps the previous dub <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup">wasn't kept around to be reused again</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>A lot of times, different English dubs are made for different international audiences &#150; sometimes to go along with an alternate-language dub in the same region; for instance, different English dubs for North America vs Europe or Asia. In these cases, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop">there is an attempt to prevent even the knowledge that other dubs exist from being in the hands of the common audience</a>. This doesn't always work.
</p><p>For some reason, a lot of alternate dubs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">tend to not get released in a home video format, and thus fall into obscurity</a>. If that <em>isn't</em> the case, then it may lead to odd scenarios where two of what is basically the same program are in direct competition.
</p><p>This trope does not cover fan-made material, so no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbridgedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbridgedSeries">Abridged Series</a> or fandubs here. A sub-trope of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Redubbing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Redubbing">redubbing</a>, in which a production receives a new dub.
</p><p>Since a few dubbing companies actually make multi-language dubs for the sake of covering the languages available in that region, that'd probably cover a different trope and wouldn't apply here. This also doesn't cover different variations of the same dub (like when certain lines are redubbed for television broadcast for content reasons).

<ul><li> Before listing any individual anime series, it is useful to mention one of the biggest reasons <em>why</em> this is so prevalent in anime: <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Animax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Animax">Animax</a></strong>. Animax is an international satellite channel owned by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sony">Sony</a> that broadcasts English-dubbed anime to several countries in South and Southeast Asia.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0pwwo');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0pwwo" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0pwwo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> They also used to broadcast Spanish-dubbed anime in several Latin American countries, but that branch went through a major format shift; see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkDecay">Network Decay</a> for details.</span> They rarely license existing English dubs for their English-language broadcasts (<em>if</em> a dub for a particular anime even exists yet, which it often doesn't, as Animax tends to pick up series early on). Unlike anime on home video &#150; where a dub ultimately belongs to the original creators in Japan so it can be used in any market that wants it &#150; Sony maintains rights to nearly all Animax dubs. As a result of all that, it is <em>extremely</em> rare for an Animax dub to appear on home video in any country; American/Canadian dubs are typically used instead.
<ul><li> Examples of series that have an alternate English dub by Animax include (but are not limited to): <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma &frac12;</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaidSama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaidSama">Maid-Sama!</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSeven">Eureka Seven</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh">Azumanga Daioh</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn">K-On!</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostStories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostStories">Ghost Stories</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog">Sgt. Frog</a></em>. Since these English dubs are often released before any North American ones exist, some fans who don't want to read subtitles will use them to get introduced to the series before an official North American release occurs.
<ul><li> There are some cases where an Animax dub ends up being the only one in existence, such as with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler">Hayate the Combat Butler</a></em>,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1zfv8');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1zfv8" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1zfv8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BandaiEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BandaiEntertainment">Bandai Entertainment</a> originally promised an (American) English dub for the series, but their increasingly dire financial situation resulted in a subtitle-only release, much to fans' irritation)</span> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ">Gundam ZZ</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VictorianRomanceEmma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VictorianRomanceEmma">Emma</a></em> and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PrettyRhythm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PrettyRhythm">Pretty Rhythm</a></em> franchise.
</li><li> Their <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em> dub is notable for being the only Animax dub legally available on home video in North America.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2ibre');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2ibre" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2ibre');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Sony's streaming service Crackle brought the Animax dubs of, among other shows, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Samurai X</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NodameCantabile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NodameCantabile">Nodame Cantabile</a></em> to American audiences. In the latter's case, it's the only official release of the anime America's ever had.</span> Since it's the only uncut dub for the show in existence, it's <em>that</em> dub that is on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NipponIchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NipponIchi">NIS America's</a> official DVD and Blu-ray releases. Worth pointing out, though, that NIS America considers the dub to be an <em>Extra</em> (rather than a feature) due to its poor sound quality.
</li></ul></li><li> The fact that many Animax productions are quite literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HongKongDub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HongKongDub">Hong Kong dubs</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3q91h');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3q91h" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3q91h');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> In reality, they can be recorded anywhere; most are made in Hong Kong or Singapore, but others come from the Philippines or even Los Angeles. Most of the ones done in South-East Asia do actually cast native English speakers from the US and Canada.</span> is the other big reason why their stuff so rarely shows up in hard copy form. However, Animax dubs (with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">one major exception</a>) are also known for having absurdly faithful (read: literal) translations. This has earned them some respect amongst purist English-speaking fans. Though you're just as likely, if not more-so, to encounter "actors" who barely speak English in some of them along with <em>many</em> cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToHimself">Talking to Himself</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The other big reason for this phenomenon existing in English is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StreamlinePictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StreamlinePictures">Streamline Pictures</a>, a Los Angeles-based licensor started around 1990 by the late Carl Macek (of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech">Robotech</a></em> infamy). It was one of the very first video companies in America to distribute non-child-friendly anime (usually just movies and OVAs) to a wider audience&#133; and also the first to go under, doing so in 1997. When they shut their doors, all their licenses reverted back to Japan, and many of the bigger ones were snapped up by other companies, who promptly redubbed them (usually because they were part of existing franchises that got picked up by the new companies).
<ul><li> Anime originally dubbed by Streamline that ended up getting redubs (several of which are discussed in detail below) include <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira">AKIRA</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LupinIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LupinIII">Lupin III</a></em> films <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheCastleOfCagliostro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheCastleOfCagliostro">The Castle of Cagliostro</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheMysteryOfMamo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheMysteryOfMamo">The Mystery of Mamo</a></em>, various <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DirtyPair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DirtyPair">Dirty Pair</a></em> productions, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SazanEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SazanEyes">3&times;3 Eyes</a></em>, and&#133; just check their page. <br><br>A slight note: Streamline was <em>not</em> directly responsible for the older dubs of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira">AKIRA</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CastleInTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CastleInTheSky">Castle in the Sky</a></em>, although they did distribute those movies and the dubs themselves were recorded by the same studio Streamline normally used, with the same voice pool.
</li><li> Streamline attempted to release and dub <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NadiaTheSecretOfBlueWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NadiaTheSecretOfBlueWater">Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water</a></em>, but they only made it to eight episodes and stopped due to financial difficulties. In 2001, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ADVFilms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ADVFilms">ADV Films</a> picked it up and redubbed the whole series from scratch using the now defunct Monster Island Studio. The ADV dub is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/SuperlativeDubbing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/SuperlativeDubbing">widely considered to be the better version</a>.

Back in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, they licensed and dubbed several anime for the UK market that ended up having other dubs by other companies in the US for a variety of reasons &#150; usually because their dubs were recorded onto PAL master tapes (which use a different framerate than America and Japan), and because it was less convenient to even <em>talk</em> to people in other countries, much less exchange materials. <br><br>These include <em>A.D.

<ul><li> Interestingly, the UK also got some of the alternate US dubs instead on later releases for various reasons (such as <em>Cobra</em> and <em>Miyu</em>), and there were quite a few Manga UK dubs that the US <em>did</em> get (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelCop">Angel Cop</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Appleseed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Appleseed">Appleseed</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CyberCityOedo808" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CyberCityOedo808">Cyber City Oedo 808</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DominionTankPolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DominionTankPolice">Dominion Tank Police</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MadBull34" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MadBull34">Mad Bull 34</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ProjectAKo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ProjectAKo">Project A-ko</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ViolenceJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ViolenceJack">Violence Jack</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeroicLegendOfArslan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeroicLegendOfArslan">The Heroic Legend of Arslan</a></em>, etc), a couple of which &#150; the two Patlabor films &#150; being released with the UK dubs before being re-released with new US dubs, and another - <em>Arslan</em> - being incomplete and finished by a US cast. Since the late 90s, it's been extremely rare for the UK (or other English-speaking markets) to get their own dubs since it's become much cheaper and easier to just port over the US-produced dubs. Some UK companies (like Anime Limited) have even funded and produced dubs of their own, but always with a US studio, with the same dubs later being recycled for the US release.
</li><li> Also, despite being recorded in the UK, these old Manga dubs still usually featured American accents, with expats from North America or with Brits <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeAmerican" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeAmerican">attempting fake American accents</a>. They were also famous (and are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">frequently mocked today</a>) for their use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb">Cluster F-Bomb</a> so that they could earn 15+ or 18+ ratings by the British Board of Film Classification &#150; Manga UK was trying to market anime as being for adults, and thought 12+ and PG ratings would make the titles seem too childish.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> franchise is the king of this trope when it comes to English dubbing. This has to do with the show having multiple rights-holders &#150; and more importantly, multiple <em>broadcasters</em> &#150; across the world over the course of two decades. Of the various companies that have handled the property, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation">Funimation</a> is the most closely associated with it, their work covering all four TV series, all movies, and all video games from 2002 on. <br><br>Throughout the Anglosphere, the Funimation dub is the only one available on home video, making many of the below entries increasingly difficult to find.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>
<ul><li> Funimation originally worked with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SabanEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SabanEntertainment">Saban</a> to distribute <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>. They put together a Vancouver-based cast (using many of the same actors as the early BLT dub of <em>Dragon Ball</em>, see below), making use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheOceanGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheOceanGroup">Ocean's</a> Studios (though Ocean wouldn't be involved beyond providing the studio space until later) to bring the show to American TV in 1996, editing the first 67 episodes and 3rd movie into 56 total episodes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Geneon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Geneon">Pioneer</a>, who had home video rights at the time, produced uncut dubs of Movies 1-3 with the Vancouver cast (giving movie 3 a <em>second</em> dub with this cast). The series aired in syndication to massive success, but Saban dropped it from their syndication lineup to make room for more shows they produced themselves. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami">Toonami</a> picked up the show about a year later. Funimation would end up distancing themselves from the work of the Vancouver actors to the point where the only way to buy the uncut Pioneer dubs outside of the original DVDs and VHSes from 20 years ago is to buy a boxset from 2013 that included the TV edits of these movies (which is also the only way to buy the Saban dub episodes aside from the original 1996-1997 DVDs). However, Chris Sabat, Funimation's voice of Vegeta as well as the director of their Dragon Ball dubbing starting from Kai, would extend an olive branch when he had Brian Drummond, the Vancouver voice of Vegeta, cast as the Copy-Vegeta in their dub of Dragon Ball Super.
</li><li> This is where Funimation's in-house dub studio began its life. When Toonami began asking for new episodes of <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> in 1998, Funimation decided to save costs by severing ties with Pioneer, and replacing the Vancouver cast of professional voice actors with nobodies who could sound kinda like them and would scream for 8 hours a day for a dollar per line (not hyperbole, believe it or not; various actors who worked on Dragon Ball around this time have talked about this). Their dub &#150; which continued in much the same manner as they had under Saban, though with an uncut version produced for home video &#150; ended up covering the entire rest of the series (eps. 68-291, Movies 4-13, both specials). They would later go back and redub episodes 1-67 and Movies 1-3 uncut, but their scripts were essentially the same as the ones used in the Saban dub. To keep consistency between these uncut redubs from 2005 and the early material just after they took over from 1999, some of the cast redubbed some of the dialogue from their original run of 68-291 (this would be first seen on the "Season" DVDs and the Dragon Boxes), mostly just for the Ginyu/Frieza episodes where they first took over. Though there are additional redubs, mostly for Vegeta, going all the way up to the end of the Cell saga.
</li><li> It's worth noting the "Remastered" dub, as the re-recordings of 68-291 have come to be known, did make some mistakes. While the actual rerecording stops at the end of the Cell saga, they did still remix all the audio, and along the way, they accidentally used work-in-progress versions of the American score using incorrect, temporary placements of tracks, and the mixing of the original Japanese score often resulted in either the music or the voices being inaudible due to improperly adjusted volumes. And to top it all off, tons of alternate takes were used for various lines, some lines were even missing (some instances were fixed after the "Orange Brick" DVDs, others weren't), and any filters on voices such as pitch shifts (like on Frieza's third form, Yakon, or Super Buu) were left out. Due to all of this, and a perception among some that the redubbings just made the transition into 68-291 even more jarring, many fans are still clamouring for Funimation to reissue the original, pre-redub version of their dub. Some are even clamouring for a home video release of the TV edit, since despite that being what Americans saw on TV, it has never been available on DVD.
</li><li> A Canadian company called Westwood media, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheOceanGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheOceanGroup">The Ocean Group</a>, produced a dub of the second half of <em>Z</em> (episodes 123-291) using the Saban dub's Vancouver-based cast, which aired in various European territories such as the UK and Holland; Canada would switch to this dub starting from episode 183.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4s8zf');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4s8zf" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4s8zf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though even when Canada was airing Funimation's dub, for episodes 68-182, they used a unique TV edit produced by Ocean, which was distinct from the TV edit airing in other territories. It's likely that Ocean's access to Funimation's production materials at this time was how the Westwood Ocean dub got into production.</span> This dub used the same script and video master as Funimation's dub, which was airing in the US, Australia, and New Zealand.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note55mq9');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note55mq9" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note55mq9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Canada and Europe still aired Funimation's dub for episodes 68-122, and the UK reverted to Funimation's briefly during the Fusion saga, though Ocean's dub was used for all reairings of those episodes.</span> Precisely why and how this dub was produced remains a mystery.
</li><li> One common misconception about this dub is that it was produced by AB Groupe, who produced the French dub and handled most of the European distribution of Dragon Ball. In truth, their role in this dub was simply distribution, though because Ocean eventually got ahead of Funimation, AB Groupe ended up providing the video master for the last few episodes.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Dragon Ball</em>
<ul><li> In the US, two very short-lived dubs of <em>Dragon Ball</em> were created: one for five episodes and a combined version of Movies 1 and 3 in 1989 by Harmony Gold, and one for the first thirteen episodes and movie 1 in 1995 by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation">Funimation</a> working with Vancouver-based Josanne B Lovick productions, and recording at the Dick &amp; Rogers Sound Studio. Harmony Gold's dub of the first five episodes were presumed lost until 2020, when a fan effort to locate these lost episodes found tapes containing the dub. (though the dub for movies 1 &amp; 3 were readily available online, ripped from a taping from a TV airing). The Harmony Gold dub is understood to have essentially been produced as a pilot, only airing in a few test markets in America before Harmony Gold decided not to go ahead with dubbing the full series. The 1995 dub, these days known as the BLT dub (due to confusion about who produced it) or the Trimark dub (named after its home video distributor) was syndicated by a company called Seagull, and was given poor coverage and absymal timeslots, thus found little to no success. Funimation severed their ties with the companies involved, tying up the home video rights to these first 13 episodes until 2009 (though thanks to Trimark, later Lionsgate holding the rights for so long, this 1995 dub is readily available on DVD, since the original 1995 DVD only went out of print in 2009). Gen Fukunaga would later imply in an interview that the poor handling of this 1995 dub may have been an intentional effort to skip to the more action-orientated portions of the show which he thought would fare better among an American audience. Toei didn't agree to this until the poor performance of Dragon Ball in 1995 lead Funimation to seek to pitch <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> as a new show to Saban to syndicate in the US, which they found much greater success with. Funimation would later come back to <em>Dragon Ball</em> in 2001 while they were dubbing the Cell saga of <em>Z</em>, though due to poor marketing, poor timing, and the fact that Funimation could not release the first 13 episodes uncut in the States until 2009 due to the rights being held by a different company, it didn't fare all that well in ratings and home video sales compared to <em>Z</em>, or even <em>GT</em>.
</li><li> There are <strong>four</strong> competing dubs of the first <em>Dragon Ball</em> movie &#150; One by Harmony Gold from 1989 using an LA-based cast (produced as part of a compilation with Movie 3), the second by Funimation and various Canadian partners in 1995 (two versions of this dub were made, one with the names Funimation would eventually use, and the other using Harmony Gold's names, which was rediscovered by Tanooki Joe in 2019), the third by AB Groupe in the early '00s with an uncredited cast of English-speaking actors living in France (see below), and the fourth being Funimation's uncut dub in 2010 (which only took that long to come out because the license for it was previously owned by Trimark, then Lionsgate when they purchased Trimark in 2002). Harmony Gold's dub was a fairly faithful translation of the Japanese original with some censorship, then the 1995 dub made some alterations to that but still kept it fairly faithful, then Funimation's 2010 dub arbitrarily removed and changed dialogue from the '95 script to make theirs. AB Groupe's is its own mess, essentially being a poor re-translation of the French dub of the movie. Funimation also redubbed Movies 2 and 3 in 2000, just before they started dubbing the TV series proper; in those cases they did <em>not</em> recycle Harmony Gold's scripts (naturally, Harmony Gold isn't known to have written one for Movie 2), though the jury's still out on whether they would have got better results in Movie 3 if they had.
</li><li> Westwood media and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheOceanGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheOceanGroup">The Ocean Group</a> also recorded a dub for both <em>Dragon Ball</em> and <em>Dragon Ball GT</em> for broadcast in Canada and Europe. The scripts for GT were their own translations of the Japanese scripts (and a far cry from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation">cut-and-paste</a> scripts Funimation were using), while Dragon Ball used a modified version of Funimation's script, with various corrections and miscellaneous adjustments (though a few episodes were entirely rewritten based on the original Japanese scripts). These dubs also used the original Japanese score, and kept the tone faithful to the original Japanese shows. However, to save money, the head of Ocean, Ken Morrison, had the recording moved to the new low-budget Calgary-based "Blue Water" studio, with a new Calgary-based cast. This really stung for the Vancouver actors, especially since some of them had even auditioned and been cast for these dubs before the call was made to move them to the cheaper Calgary-based cast. Strengthening the misconception that AB Gropue, rather than Westwood media, produced these and the Ocean dub of <em>Z</em>, AB Groupe provided the video masters used for these dubs.
</li></ul></li><li> Other bits of the franchise:
<ul><li> AB Groupe, who produced and distributed the French dubs, while also holding distribution rights for the franchise throughout Europe, dubbed certain movies and specials for Europe using a FIFTH set of voice actors &#150; in this case, the same actors who dubbed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko">Code Lyoko</a></em> &#150; with a script directly and poorly translated form the French dub. These dubs became incredibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">memetic</a> among fans for their laughable writing and voice acting, and have been nicknamed the "Big Green" dubs, because of how characters refer to Piccolo. And yet, this was the official dub that was used when the movies and TV specials aired in the UK, after Westwood's <em>GT</em> wrapped up. Interestingly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">they are the only one of these alternate dubs that aired in Europe to be released to home video in any form, with the ''Z'' movies and specials having been released on DVD in the UK and Holland; AB's dub of the GT special, and the three ''Dragon Ball'' movies were not released, only airing on TV, and only in the UK</a>.
</li><li> Coming all the way from Malaysia, we have the "Speedy" dub, produced &amp; distributed by that company as a bootleg dub to cash in on Dragon Ball's success with these bootleg VCDs of the movies and some early episodes of the series. Like the Big Green dub, the Speedy dub is infamous among fans for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation">"Blind Idiot" Translation</a> &amp; abysmal voice acting, both of which are arguably worse than the Big Green dub. Additionally, the Speedy dub's soundtrack frequently distorts as a result of being transferred from what one can assume to be a decayed tape. It also seems that they didn't have proper isolated music and SFX tracks to use for dubbing, so at times, they seem to have simply constructed their own. This dub covers Dragon Ball movies 2 to 4, all 13 Dragon Ball Z movies, and even the first 10 episodes of Dragon Ball Z.
</li><li> Creative Products Corp. produced an English dub for <em>Dragon Ball</em> and the first two thirds of <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> for the Philippines, along with <em>Z</em> movies 6, 10, and 11. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">Aside from the movies and a CD of their dubs of the music from the shows and movies, nothing of this dub circulates online.</a>
</li><li> Animax dubbed the <em>Dragon Ball</em> anime at Omni Productions in Hong Kong for their Southeast Asian stations in 2005. This dub is quite obscure and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">impossible to find</a> &#150; it's only known at all because it was mentioned on a couple of its voice actors' resumes, and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eTVLvvWlys&amp;t=37s">a brief clip containing no dialogue of the fight between General Blue and Taopaipai turned up in one actor's demo reel<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> The Tokyo-based Frontier Enterprises was also reportedly behind a dub of the first <em>Dragon Ball</em> movie in 1987&mdash; predating the Harmony Gold dub by two years&mdash; owing to its existence on a <a class="urllink" href="http://hk.linkedin.com/in/dickhostvo">voice actor's resume<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (although erroneously listed as "DBZ"). Further information has yet to surface; it's speculated that it was screened exclusively on Japan Airlines flights like most of Frontier's other dubs, and the obscurity of <em>Dragon Ball</em> outside of Japan at the time, combined with the fact that it never reached English-speaking airwaves, means that it's unlikely any surviving audio exists outside of the original master audiotapes (wherever they may be).
</li><li> and&#133; there's probably <em>still</em> some dubs to find! <a class="urllink" href="http://www.kanzenshuu.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=11126">This Kanzenshuu forum thread even has a handy chart!<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li></ul></li><li> Ocean recorded a dub of <em>Dragon Ball Kai</em> for an unknown producer, though it has yet to be broadcast anywhere. Kix UK looked to be picking it up, but certain industry insiders have suggested Funimation allegedly tried (and still are trying) to make sure it doesn't air. What aired on Kix was Funimation's dub. Thankfully, a company in Canada called Wow Unlimited, who are starting up a new TV channel, are picking it up. But, unfortunately, due to the difficulty in gathering funds for a new TV channel launch these days, it's unknown how long until they actually start up.
</li><li> Even with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, Toonami Asia contacted LA-based <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BangZoomEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BangZoomEntertainment">Bang Zoom! Entertainment</a> to produce a dub for the SouthEast Asian market, while Funimation has theirs' on Toonami US.
<ul><li> Hilariously, the Funimation dub of <em>Super</em> takes this trope to its logical conclusion by casting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianDrummond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianDrummond">Brian Drummond</a>, the voice of Vegeta for the Ocean dubs, as Copy-Vegeta and having him fight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherSabat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherSabat">Christopher Sabat</a>'s Vegeta.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> For many years, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> was known for its original dub by Toronto-based Optimum Productions. The first two seasons were handled by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiCEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiCEntertainment">DiC</a> in 1995 and were heavily edited with five skipped episodes and the two-part season one finale merged into one episode. This dub ranged from an alright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism">Woolseyism</a> to a downright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation">Cut-and-Paste Translation</a> depending on the episode. The dub was originally canceled mid-way through the second season, but received funding by <em>Irwin Toy</em> in Canada to do the last 17 episodes in 1997. Pioneer later worked with Cloverway (a US branch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToeiAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToeiAnimation">Toei</a>) in 1999 to release the movie trilogy to video with the original cast from Optimum, with both edited and uncut versions released. When the series found success on Cartoon Network's Toonami block in the US, Cloverway worked with Optimum to dub the third and fourth seasons in 2000. This dub was released uncut on DVD and lightly edited on TV and VHS, but is notorious for its sloppy quality, with almost the entire cast changed because of its quick production schedule. It was also infamous for making Sailor Uranus and Neptune "cousins" instead of lovers. Cloverway was unable to dub the fifth and final season <em>Sailor Moon Sailor Stars</em> because of licensing issues, and the series fell out of print in 2005. A complete redub has been rumored since at least 2009 (with FUNimation publicly expressing interest), but it wasn't until 2014 that a new unedited dub courtesy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VizMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VizMedia">Viz Media</a> and Los Angeles-based Studiopolis premiered to coincide with the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoonCrystal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoonCrystal">Sailor Moon Crystal</a></em>. It's covers all five seasons, including the infamous final season, as well as other media previously left alone, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">skipped episodes</a> and the 5 shorts. According to Viz, the materials for the original dub weren't kept, and the parts that do still exist are in poor condition. There's also possible rights issues with DiC's version, such as the ownership of their original music. There is somewhat of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a> as a result: many fans consider the Viz dub to be <em>miles better</em> than the Optimum dub, while others have mixed feelings about the Viz dub, saying that it's not as memorable as the Optimum one and in addition it's lifeless and stale (a point proven by the dubbing of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nephrite/Neflite's death</span> which became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DullSurprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DullSurprise">Dull Surprise</a> compared to the more emotional performances given in the DiC dub) and has some poor casting choices.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> premiered on Netflix, it was redubbed into English, Spanish (Latin and European), French, German, Brazilian Portuguese and Italian. While the English and European Spanish versions feature completely different voice casts, the rest of the dubs brought back quite a few of the the original actors.
<ul><li> The English re-release left quite a few people scratching their heads over the casting choices and literal re-translations (ie. "The Third Children"), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TiffanyGrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TiffanyGrant">Tiffany Grant</a> included. She also confirmed that she was able to re-audition for Asuka, but was not chosen to reprise her long-running role.
</li><li> If you include the <em>Renewal</em>, Latin America (Mexico and Brazil) had three dubs of the series in total. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VictorUgarte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VictorUgarte">V&iacute;ctor Ugarte</a> voiced Shinji in all three Spanish dubs, while nine Brazilian voice actors dubbed their characters in all three versions.
</li></ul></li><li> There are 3 official English dubs of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, plus a couple of test-dubs:
<ul><li> There's the currently-ongoing dub by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation">Funimation</a> covering 500+ episodes, 1 game, and 3 movies.
</li><li> There's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation">heavily</a>-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerize">edited</a> dub by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment">4Kids</a> &#150; 104 episodes (edited down from 142) and 3 games.
</li><li> And then there's the fairly obscure Odex dub produced for Southeast Asia that covers the first 104 episodes.
</li><li> There's also a rarely-seen test dub from Chinook/Blue Water that was produced by Toei to sell the series to TV stations, as well as another one made by Odex with a different cast to sell the series for South-East Asian television. Funimation also made a test dub themselves with a different cast when they originally attempted to get the series before 4Kids.
</li><li> Of the three main English dubs, Funimation's is generally considered to be very good, with praise for its faithful adaptation and most of its voice acting (particularly its leads). While it has its detractors, reception has been good enough for it to last for almost fifteen years and counting. The 4Kids dub, on the other hand, gained negative reception due to its heavy censorship. The Odex dub is noted for its extremely faithful script, but it is infamous for its low production values, small pool of actors (really noticeable for a series that practically defines <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a>), and constant cast changes, although it did get slightly better toward the end of its run.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ScienceNinjaTeamGatchaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ScienceNinjaTeamGatchaman">Gatchaman</a></em> is particularly notable for how its dubs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BattleOfThePlanets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BattleOfThePlanets">were</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GForceGuardiansOfSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GForceGuardiansOfSpace">mostly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EagleRiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EagleRiders">rewrites</a> until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ADVFilms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ADVFilms">ADV Films</a> finally gave it a straight dub:
<ul><li> An early alternative English dub titled "The Gutman" <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020720024152/http://www.users.bigpond.com/BASE_KOALA/Gatchaman.Archives/Englishdub.htm">was said to have been produced in the late '70s<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, although little is known about this version except that it had 39 episodes. It may have been made only for the intent of airing it in the Philippines (before they licensed Sandy Frank's version), although there is also speculation that it was a failed English dub directly commissioned by Tatsunoko Productions-Yomiko before the sale to Sandy Frank.
</li><li> <em>Battle Of The Planets</em> was the first, released in 1978. As its page details, it was heavily censored from the original source material. Due to the popularity of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>, Sandy Frank decided to edit in space stock footage and voice-overs that suggested various battles were actually taking place in outer space. He also created the character of 7-Zark-7 to fill in any time gaps left behind by censoring death and destruction. This dub technically covered the whole original series, but reduced the episode count from 105 to 85. It was popular in the US when it was on TV, but has been off the air since the mid-80s (though it is mostly on DVD and also on Hulu).
</li><li> <em>G-Force: Guardians of Space</em> was an attempt in 1986 by Sandy Frank to revitalize interest in the <em>Gatchaman</em> license for international territories, with Turner Program Services at the main helm for production. While this version stuck a little closer to the source material (i.e.: no Zark, less censorship), it was still watered down significantly and the name changes were criticized, along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FillingTheSilence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FillingTheSilence">a synthesized backbeat that was used to fill up all silent moments</a>. It also had a very low budget, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToHimself">only six voice actors in the whole cast</a>. This dub only went to Episode 87 of the original series, and also reduced the episode count to 85 (skipping episodes 81 and 86). The dub had no real conclusion and ended on a cliffhanger. It mostly aired overseas, with only four episodes airing on TBS in the US solely for contractual obligations, until the mid-90s when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> ran it as a timeslot filler. It's pretty obscure, with only a few episodes on DVD, although it has its nostalgic fans.
<ul><li> There was also an earlier attempt at "G-Force" done in 1985, with Atlanta-based voice talent (including future <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a> actress Faith Salie). It only dubbed episode 26 as a test pilot, but the project fell through when Turner rejected the adaptation (citing it to be too expensive) and went with Fred Ladd and a Los Angeles-based production team.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SabanEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SabanEntertainment">Saban Entertainment</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EagleRiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EagleRiders">Eagle Riders</a></em> from 1996 was not based off the original <em>Gatchaman</em> (due to Sandy Frank holding the license), but was derived from the two sequel series <em>Gatchaman II</em> and <em>Gatchaman Fighter</em>. It was still heavily censored, with later episodes being cut and spliced together, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie">Never Say "Die"</a> in effect. The series' (combined) episode count was also reduced from 100 to 65. Like the above G-Force dub, this dub was only briefly shown in the US, but it did get a full run in Australia. It's notable for featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BryanCranston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BryanCranston">Bryan Cranston</a> as the voice of Joe&#133; long before starring in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MalcolmInTheMiddle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MalcolmInTheMiddle">Malcolm in the Middle</a> and winning an Emmy for playing Walter White in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad">Breaking Bad</a></em>.
</li><li> In addition, Urban Vision dubbed the 90s 3-part OVA remake in 1997 with Sky Quest Entertainment. It's a mostly straight dub, but a few names were localized (though they're usually cited as the most faithful set of localized names compared to past attempts). On an interesting note, Jinpei's voice actress (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MonaMarshall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MonaMarshall">Mona Marshall</a>) also voiced the character in the above-mentioned Eagle Riders dub, and Joe's (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardCansino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardCansino">Richard Cansino</a>) voiced Ken.
</li><li> Of course, ADV's 2005 dub is finally accurate and covered all 105 episodes of the original series, and has been entirely released to DVD and Blu-ray. Their studio also redubbed the above OVA series for their 2013 re-release of the franchise, with successor company Sentai Filmworks holding the license outright after Sandy Frank's rights finally expired. Sentai also dubbed/released the 1978 compilation movie in 2015, and also handled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GatchamanCrowds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GatchamanCrowds">Gatchaman Crowds</a></em>. They also rescued <em>II</em> and <em>Fighter</em>, but were released only on DVD subtitled-only.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> has its edited 4Kids dub (by far the best known), the short-lived 4Kids uncut dub that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation">Funimation</a> distributed (15 episodes recorded, but only 9 released), and a Singapore dub which is also uncut. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShamanKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShamanKing">Shaman King</a></em> likewise has an edited 4Kids English dub and a short-lived uncut version.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <em>Digimon</em> series has its Saban (season 1-3)/Disney (season 4) version as well as Filipino and Singapore dubs.
</li><li> <em>Digimon Xros Wars</em> has a Saban dub produced under the title <em>Digimon Fusion</em>, while an earlier alternate dub by William Winckler Productions was produced in 2011 (under the title <em>Digimon Fusion Battles</em>) and managed to be aired in Malaysia. Both dubs feature localized names, with the lead being called "Mikey" in the Saban dub and "Gerry" in the William Winckler version.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperMilkChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperMilkChan">The Super Milk-chan Show</a></em> is a bizarre example. It has two separate complete dubs; <em>both</em> were made by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ADVFilms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ADVFilms">ADV Films</a> &mdash; There's an "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagDub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagDub">Americanized</a>" dub that was broadcast on The Anime Network, and a straight dub that was broadcast on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">[adult swim]</a>. Both dubs were recorded near-simultaneously with the exact same voice cast (except Tetsuko for some reason). They were even both included on the same DVD release, although not on the same discs due to how the "Americanized" dub was edited. As you can imagine, nobody can agree which one is better.
</li><li> This has happened multiple times with English dubs of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioGhibli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioGhibli">Studio Ghibli</a> films, due to some of the studio's work making it out before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> locked up international distribution rights for the entire catalogue (except <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GraveOfTheFireflies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GraveOfTheFireflies">Grave of the Fireflies</a></em>, which has its own entry further down the list):
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MyNeighborTotoro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MyNeighborTotoro">My Neighbor Totoro</a></em> has two English dubs &#150; the original, put together by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StreamlinePictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StreamlinePictures">Streamline Pictures</a> for its initial American release; and Disney's later one, produced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnLasseter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnLasseter">John Lasseter</a> and starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DakotaFanning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DakotaFanning">Dakota Fanning</a>.
</li><li> The same could be said for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NausicaaOfTheValleyOfTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NausicaaOfTheValleyOfTheWind">Nausica&auml;</a></em>&#133; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity">except that nobody wants to admit</a> that "Warriors of the Wind" exists, it being one of the most infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation">Cut and Paste Translations</a> in the history of the medium. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Miyazaki himself</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">wants everyone to forget about that version</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note64dgy');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note64dgy" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note64dgy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Although this is indeed Miyazaki's opinion on "Warriors", the words expressing it were uttered by Studio Ghibli co-founder and longtime producer Toshio Suzuki, who said (translated), "Please remove the memory of this version of Nausica&auml; from your mind." Fans have <strong>gladly</strong> obliged.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CastleInTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CastleInTheSky">Castle in the Sky</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KikisDeliveryService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KikisDeliveryService">Kiki's Delivery Service</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PorcoRosso" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PorcoRosso">Porco Rosso</a></em> likewise have alternate English dubs commissioned by Japan Airlines long before Disney's versions existed (though <em>Castle</em> was also shown in movie theaters in the United States during the summer of 1989). They were done by Streamline&#133; though see that company's entry near the top of this page for an explanation.
<ul><li> In terms of official availability, the dubs of <em>Castle in the Sky</em> and <em>Porco Rosso</em> were included on the initial Japanese DVD releases, but <em>Kiki</em> remains relegated to an older laserdisc set.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Arrietty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Arrietty">Arrietty</a></em> has two English dubs. The first dub was made by Studio Canal for a quick theatrical release in the UK and Australia using British actors; The second dub was produced by Disney for the North American market using Hollywood talent, and came out the the next year. This version <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarketBasedTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarketBasedTitle">renamed the film 'The Secret World Of Arrietty'</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">gave several of the character American names</a> in an attempt to market the film to a more mainstream audience. Fans' opinions on the dubs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">were set in stone before either saw the light of day</a> &#150; the UK version was automatically deemed superior. However, professional reviewers were much more positive about the American dub. North American fans were <em>not</em> happy when Disney announced that only the American dub would be included on its domestic DVD/Blu-ray (and that the UK DVD/BR would be region-locked to Europe), although both dubs can be obtained through the Japanese Region A Blu-rays. Ironically, as of today, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SaoirseRonan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SaoirseRonan">Saoirse Ronan</a> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLovelyBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLovelyBones">The Lovely Bones</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Brooklyn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a></em>) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHolland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHolland">Tom Holland</a> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManHomecoming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManHomecoming">Spider-Man: Homecoming</a></em>), the stars of the British dub, are now a lot more well known than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BridgitMendler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BridgitMendler">Bridgit Mendler</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidHenrie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidHenrie">David Henrie</a> from the US dub (both were stars of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WizardsOfWaverlyPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WizardsOfWaverlyPlace">Wizards of Waverly Place</a></em>).
</li><li> In an odd case of this trope, <em>Kiki's Delivery Service</em> and <em>Castle In The Sky</em> have alternate versions of their Disney dubs: the former removes the ad-libbed lines and new pieces of music, while Castle In The Sky changes the reorchestrated soundtrack back to the original and also removes several ad-libbed pieces of dialogue.
</li></ul></li><li> There's two English dubs of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SazanEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SazanEyes">3&times;3 Eyes</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StreamlinePictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StreamlinePictures">Streamline Pictures</a> made a dub of the original four OVAs in 1995 before shutting down. Shortly after, Orion Pictures picked up where they left off and released the first two episodes of the sequel series with the same cast before <em>they</em> shut down leaving a release of the third and final episode in limbo. There's a rumor that a dub from them was released in the UK and Australia by Manga Entertainment, but this has never been proven true. In 1999, Pioneer Entertainment (later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Geneon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Geneon">Geneon</a>) rescued the series and made another English dub with New Generation Pictures featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">late-90s</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel">Disney Channel</a> stars like Brigitte Bako, Christian Campbell, and various additional cast members brought over from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em> cartoon, notably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdAsner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdAsner">Ed Asner</a>. It was even voice directed by Greg Weisman, the creator of that show. This dub covered all four episodes of the original series and all three episodes of the sequel series. Only the New Generation dub is available on DVD (albeit now out-of-print). The original Streamline/Orion dub, while it has its fans who remember it very fondly from the mid-90s, is only available on VHS.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em> has multiple incomplete dubs &#150; Toei dubbed about 30 episodes themselves (through a company called M&amp;M Communications) around 1977, in an attempt to sell the series. It was recorded in Hawaii, and the episodes had managed to air there. In the US, the edited-down <em>Tranzor Z</em> saw broadcast in 1985 (through 3B Productions). This dub was recorded out of Los Angeles, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GreggBerger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GreggBerger">Gregg Berger</a> voicing the lead role. Meanwhile, the Philippines aired Toei's version and then continued dubbing where it left off. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">Allegedly the Philippine version was shut down by order of Ferdinand Marcos himself</a> (which is also said to have happened with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VoltesV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VoltesV">Voltes V</a></em>).
</li><li> A rarity for a show of its length, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em> has two <em>complete</em> dubs. The first dub made was the infamous "Samurai X" dub produced by Sony for Animax and recorded at Animaze in Los Angeles &#150; which, though technically uncut, still toned down the dialogue significantly. A couple years later, another dub was produced by Media Blasters and recorded at BangZoom studio in Burbank. The Media Blasters version is more well-known in North America because it aired on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami">Toonami</a> and is (well, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">was</a></em>) available on DVD, but Sony's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Samurai X</a></em>, previously unknown in North America despite being recorded there, is becoming better known due to it running for awhile on streaming sites Hulu and Crackle. This is perhaps the most literal case of dubs going directly in competition with each other on this page so far. Interestingly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardCansino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardCansino">Richard Cansino</a> voices the title character in both dubs, and many other voice actors had roles in both productions.
</li><li> There are two dubs of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GiantRobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GiantRobo">Giant Robo</a></em> OVA, one by Manga Video with Animaze and one by Anime Works (the anime division of Media Blasters) with NYAV Post. The DVD Boxset includes both if you're interested, and there really is quite a difference - Manga Video's dub plays <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Genya as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild">Psychopathic Manchild</a>, while Anime Works' depicts him as a suave <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind">Diabolical Mastermind</a>. The difference is interesting to say the least. Also, the Anime Works dub has a consistent cast for the entire series, while the Manga dub, which had to be produced and released over the years the OVA took to be completed, had multiple examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">The Other Darrin</a> between episodes.
</li><li> The first animated <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LupinIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LupinIII">Lupin III</a></em> theatrical film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheMysteryOfMamo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheMysteryOfMamo">Mystery of Mamo/Secret of Mamo/Lupin vs. the Clone</a></em>, has been said (erroneously, it turns out; see below) to have the most dubs in one language for one film: Toho made an English dub in 1978 for Japan Airlines to be shown as an in-flight movie during transpacific flights; Streamline recorded a dub in 1995 for North America; Manga recorded their own dub in 1996 for release in the UK and Australia; finally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Geneon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Geneon">Geneon</a> redubbed the film in 2003 using their cast from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIIIRedJacket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIIIRedJacket">"Red Jacket"</a></em> (this dub was released in Australia in 2006 and the UK in 2008). All except the Geneon dub have become extremely rare&#133; or were until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiscotekMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiscotekMedia">Discotek</a> picked up the film's license and lived up to its pledge to put <em>all four dubs</em> on the DVD. The differences between them are <em>significant</em>.
<ul><li> Essentially, the 1978 Toho dub is the most faithful to the original Japanese, even as it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">Anglicizes the names of every major character except for, oddly, Lupin</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note75y9n');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note75y9n" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note75y9n');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Jigen becomes Dan Dunn, Fujiko is renamed Margo, Goemon is dubbed simply "Samurai", and Zenigata becomes Detective Ed Scott.</span> The Streamline dub plays it fairly loose with the dialogue and even looser with pronunciation, but it does call Lupin by his proper name. The Manga UK dub exists <em>because</em> Streamline's dub used Lupin's name (due to proximity to France, they had to change his name to "Wolf" to avoid being sued); this dub is an odd duck, with dialogue sometimes changing significantly to the point that characters' personalities and motivations are altered, especially Fujiko. The Geneon/Phuuz dub&#133; well&#133; if you've seen the first season of "Red Jacket", you know what you're going to get &#150; no one can deny it's well-acted, but the dialogue is even more schizophrenic in its fealty to the subtitles than the Streamline dub.
</li><li> A bit of latterly research has shown that <em>Mamo</em> isn't the king of this. Turns out the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheTreeOfMight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheTreeOfMight">The Tree of Might</a></em> has it beat. There's Saban's TV-edited dub, Pioneer/Ocean's uncut dub, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation">Funimation</a>'s uncut redub, AB Groupe's "Big Green" dub, and a version that is on Speedy's Malaysian VCD. That's <strong>five</strong>, and unless something new appears on <em>Lupin</em>'s end, that beats out <em>Mamo</em> by one (unless you don't count Saban's TV Edit due to its being a hackjob, but even then we've got a tie&#133;)
<ul><li> As mentioned above, the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> TV series itself has several: Harmony Gold's test dub, Funimation/BLT Productions' short-lived dub, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation">Funimation</a>'s in-house dub, AB Groupe/Blue Water, Creative Productions (Filipino), and Animax Asia! Most of those weren't completed, and a couple are believed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">lost</a> but still, the first five episodes of <em>Dragon Ball</em> have had at least <strong>six</strong> English dubs recorded for each!
</li><li> The second <em>Lupin III</em> movie, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheCastleOfCagliostro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheCastleOfCagliostro">The Castle of Cagliostro</a></em> contains two dubs. The first dub was made in the 90's by Streamline Pictures, while the second dub was made in 2000 by Manga Entertainment using the Animaze studio. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerize">There's also a toned-down version of the Manga dub that removes most of the profanity</a>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em>'s been pretty lucky with one consistent dub for the whole franchise (though handled by more than one company). However, the 10th Anniversary Special (<em>Mastermind of Mirage Pokemon</em>) got two dubs. The first was for the initial television broadcast, and was notable for being the first production to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">the new voice cast</a> following a change in companies. This dub was so detested that the voice cast was re-evaluated, and a few recasts took place (most notably Ash) for future media. The special was later redubbed with the updated cast (and others, who were now better used to their roles) and included as a special feature on the original Movie 8 DVD.
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GalaxyExpress999" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GalaxyExpress999">Galaxy Express 999</a></em> movie got dubbed twice; a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation">Cut-and-Paste Translation</a> from New World Pictures, which is only available on VHS, and a second, more faithful dub in the mid-90s from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VizMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VizMedia">Viz Media</a> and Ocean Studios, which was also only available on VHS until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiscotekMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiscotekMedia">Discotek Media</a> released it on DVD in 2011 and Blu-Ray in 2018.
</li><li> It took over 30 years, and three separate tries for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em> to finally get a complete English dub:
<ul><li> The first was the 2003 edited "Knights of the Zodiac" dub from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiCEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiCEntertainment">DiC</a> on Cartoon Network using Toronto-based voice talent (with Tim Hanaguchi as Seiya). It was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation">heavily censored</a>, with edits like blood being painted black or blue to represent "magical energies," among many others. It's most famous for its theme song, which was a cover of "I Ran" from Bowling For Soup. The show bombed in the US (even at the time, children could tell that the show was old), and was canceled after 40 episodes, with only 32 actually being broadcast on Cartoon Network (all 40 aired on YTV in Canada).
</li><li> A second dub with a Houston-based voice cast (featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IllichGuardiola" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IllichGuardiola">Illich Guardiola</a> as Seiya) was produced simultaneously by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ADVFilms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ADVFilms">ADV Films</a> for DVD because they had sub-licensed the home video rights from DiC. This dub was completely uncut, and covered the first 60 episodes. ADV wanted to continue their dub, but they couldn't go farther than the episodes DiC had sub-licensed to them. They did attempt to license the series outright after DiC's license expired, but unfortunately that didn't work out.
</li><li> In 2013, Cinedigm released the first 73 episodes to DVD subtitled-only, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiscotekMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiscotekMedia">Discotek Media</a> released the first four films and "The Lost Canvas" series to subtitle-only DVD, but all of those releases flopped.
</li><li> Netflix produced a new uncut English dub of the original series from 2019-2020, which eventually covered all 114 episodes of the original series. It was also recorded in Houston at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SentaiFilmworks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SentaiFilmworks">Sentai Filmworks</a>, but uses a completely different voice cast from the ADV dub (with Bryson Baugas as Seiya). This is the same voice cast that was used for Netflix's 2019 reboot.
</li></ul></li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimbaTheWhiteLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimbaTheWhiteLion">Kimba the White Lion</a></em> TV series was dubbed by NBC in 1967 and then re-dubbed for Canadian syndication in the late '80s. The original dub is the only one available on video (although a few random episodes of the Canadian dub are on DVD, as they managed to fall into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicDomain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicDomain">Public Domain</a>).
</li><li> The 80s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AstroBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AstroBoy">Astro Boy</a></em> TV series was dubbed twice. There's the more well-known Nippon TV dub done with US actors based out of the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1982, but also the edited one produced for Canada using fairly well-known Montreal-based voice actors in 1986. The Nippon TV dub aired in English-speaking countries around the world to much popularity, especially in Australia, and was sold to a few local stations in the US. The Canadian TV dub was only produced to fill the legal Canadian-content queue, and thus was only shown in Canada, where the show also became fairly popular. Both dubs were edited, but while the Nippon TV dub only suffered from light editing (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfOrder">and changes to the episode order</a>), the Canadian dub was a full-on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation">Cut-and-Paste Translation</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CrayonShinChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CrayonShinChan">Crayon Shin-chan</a></em> has had four different English dubs. Aside from the more familiar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation">Funimation</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagDub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagDub">Gag Dub</a>, it received two much earlier relatively straight dubs from Vitello and Phuuz Entertinment that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">never aired in America</a>, despite being made there. It also had a dub made by LUK Internacional in 2015 that was released on the Nintendo 3DS eShop.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GoShogun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GoShogun">Go Shogun</a> movie <em>The Time &Eacute;tranger</em> was dubbed for US release by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CentralParkMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CentralParkMedia">Central Park Media</a> and for UK release by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MangaEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MangaEntertainment">Manga</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis">Bubblegum Crash</a></em> was dubbed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnimEigo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnimEigo">AnimEigo</a> for North America, but there's also the Manga UK English dub for Europe. The original AD Police Files OVA also got dubs from both companies, however the original Bubblegum Crisis has only one dub (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnimEigo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnimEigo">AnimEigo</a>'s), since a different company (MVM Films) got the UK rights and carried over that version.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> got an English dub by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheOceanGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheOceanGroup">The Ocean Group</a>, but several years earlier, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationMovie">Compilation Movies</a> for the same story had gotten their own English dub by Animaze. While the quality of the TV series dub is contested, most <em>Gundam</em> fans like to pretend that the movie dub <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity">simply doesn't exist</a> (although the pronunciation of the mecha's name as "Gun-damn" became something of an in-joke among English fans). Its bad quality is acknowledged by the cast/crew, and is usually blamed on the creator having a tight control on its production, and demanding weird choices.
</li><li> A similar thing happened to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em> franchise. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em> was dubbed by Animaze. But by the time Bandai licensed GITS:SAC compilation movies "The Laughing Man" and "Individual Eleven", they could no longer afford the LA-based unionized studio, so those compilations were dubbed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheOceanGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheOceanGroup">The Ocean Group</a> with a different cast.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MamoruOshii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MamoruOshii">Mamoru Oshii</a>'s second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em> film, "Innocence", was dubbed twice due to license issues. The movie was first licensed in North America by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Dreamworks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Dreamworks">Dreamworks</a>, who decided to release it without any English dub at all (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">and SDH subtitles to boot!</a>), much to the fans' anger. Then it was licensed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MangaEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MangaEntertainment">Manga</a> &amp; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MadmanEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MadmanEntertainment">Madman</a> for the UK and Australia markets respectively; they hired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardEpcar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardEpcar">Richard Epcar</a> (Batou's VA) to get the <em>Stand Alone Complex</em> cast together and record a dub.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8ngrg');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note8ngrg" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8ngrg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Although this dub uses the GITS:SAC cast, it notably does NOT use the same translator, scriptwriter, or voice director.</span> <em>Then</em>, after Dreamworks's license lapsed a couple years later, Bandai picked up the film and decided to redub it with the entire Animaze crew. Both dubs ended up on Bandai's DVD, and also showed exactly why Bandai commissioned the redub &#150; the masters Epcar used for the first dub had been pre-converted to the standard European framerate of 25fps; when that audio was back-converted to the American/Japanese standard of 24fps (4% slower), it made Manga's dub sound distorted.
</li><li> The first two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Patlabor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Patlabor">Patlabor</a></em> films were dubbed twice into English. They were first dubbed in the mid-90s by Manga UK for release internationally. However in the US, after Manga Entertainment lost the licenses, Bandai Visual picked up the films in the mid-2000s and produced new dubs for them with a new LA-based cast while the original dubs continued to be distributed in Europe and Australia. Neither cast is consistent with the OVA/TV series or third film, both of which have their own casts.
</li><li> There's the 1985 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech">Robotech</a></em> English dub by Harmony Gold, and there's also the faithful, uncut 2005 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Super Dimension Fortress Macross</a></em> English dub from ADV Films.
<ul><li> There is also an earlier, failed adaptation of <em>SDF Macross</em> by Harmony Gold (<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrcqJ-IHU5Q">with its own theme song<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>), that had lasted only three episodes and predated <em>Robotech</em>. The first episode was later included as a special feature on a DVD, while the VHS of the three episodes is tough to come by. This version was discontinued due to the fact that HG wanted to air <em>Macross</em> in syndication, and had needed more episodes to do so, so they went forward with the better-known adaptation.
</li></ul></li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em> movie was originally released in America in the late 1990s with an English dub by Animaze (produced by Media Blasters), years before Creator/Funimation's English release of the TV series. Funimation finally released the movie in December 2011 with a completely new English dub using their voice cast from the TV series. This leaves the second movie, "Poltergeist Report" as the only part of the franchise without a Funimation dub &#150; it being licensed and dubbed in the mid-90s by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CentralParkMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CentralParkMedia">Central Park Media</a>. However, Funimation says they are trying to get the film and invoke this trope (since the franchise is a darling of the company), but there are complicated legal issues to untangle first.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Appleseed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Appleseed">Appleseed</a></em> anime movie has two English dubs. The original one from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Geneon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Geneon">Geneon</a>, recorded at Animaze, was scrapped in favor of a new one from Houston-based Sentai Filmworks (the former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ADVFilms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ADVFilms">ADV Films</a>) using their in-house studio (now called Seraphim Digital) for consistency with the second film, which was released by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a> using Seraphim. The Seraphim cast was mostly carried over to Funimation's dub of the recent TV series, as well as the <em>Appleseed Alpha</em> prequel (not released in Japan), leaving only the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OVA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OVA">OVAs</a> (dubbed and released about 20 years ago by Manga UK) without a dub with the Texas-based cast. We should note that <em>both</em> dubs for the first film are on Sentai's Blu-ray release, but their DVD (which came first) only contains the original Animaze dub. Sentai's stated reason for the redub is that they felt the audio quality of the original dub was too poor to justify being the sole English dub on a Blu-ray. They've done this for a few other older films as well, most notably <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GraveOfTheFireflies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GraveOfTheFireflies">Grave of the Fireflies</a></em> (see below).
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SpaceAdventureCobra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SpaceAdventureCobra">Space Adventure Cobra</a></em> movie has two English dubs, both released in 1995. The Manga UK dub for Australian and UK VHS came first, and was a bit liberal in it's adaptation. Notably, it replaced all the music with songs from <em>Yello</em> (best known for <em>Oh Yeah</em> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FerrisBuellersDayOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FerrisBuellersDayOff">Ferris Bueller's Day Off</a></em>). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StreamlinePictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StreamlinePictures">Streamline Pictures</a> released their own English dub in some North American theaters a month later with the original music intact and a more accurate script (ironic, considering Streamline's notoriety for liberal dubs). They planned on releasing the film and the TV series to VHS, but were unable to due to their parent company (Orion Pictures)'s financial woes. However, it was issued on VHS by Urban Vision, and even "replaced" the Manga UK dub in Australia and the UK due to Manga losing the license to the Yello music. Hulu's stream and Discotek's DVD also feature solely the Streamline dub. Discotek tried including the Manga UK dub, but once again ran into issues with the music, and the fact that it was recorded onto PAL tape. However, it did turn up on a French DVD.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StreetFighterIIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StreetFighterIIV">Street Fighter II V</a></em> has two English dubs. The better-known one is the Manga Entertainment/Animaze version sold in North America and in Oceania (with the same cast as the original animated movies). The other was made by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ADVFilms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ADVFilms">ADV Films</a>' UK branch for Britain/Ireland (it was recorded in Houston). The latter has only a Region 2 VHS release since ADV-UK disbanded years ago. As such, it's hard to locate any copies outside of secondhand European VHS bins.
</li><li> The classic anime film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GraveOfTheFireflies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GraveOfTheFireflies">Grave of the Fireflies</a></em> was redubbed by Sentai Filmworks for the film's 2012 Blu-Ray release. The film was first dubbed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CentralParkMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CentralParkMedia">Central Park Media</a> and Skypilot Entertainment in 1998, and that dub had been carried over for years, including on Sentai's DVD release (and ADV's before that), and was even included on the Blu-Ray as a bonus feature. The reason for the redub is mainly because the master elements for the original dub are long gone and its sound quality was considered unacceptable for Blu-Ray. The mixed opinions of the old dub probably didn't help either.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DinosaurKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DinosaurKing">Dinosaur King</a></em> had a regional Singapore dub along with the mainstream US licensed version &#150; ironically, the US one was on broadcast in Singapore while the regional dub went straight to video, picked up by some department stores to screen in the toys section. The main appeal of the "Singapore dubs" you'll see a lot in this section is that, unlike versions edited for US broadcast, they keep the OP and ED intact.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RockLeesSpringtimeOfYouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RockLeesSpringtimeOfYouth">Naruto: Rock Lee &amp; His Ninja Pals</a> has two English dubs recorded a year apart from each other. One produced in Hong Kong for Disney XD Asia and the other produced by Viz Media and Studiopolis and streamed on Hulu.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MegaZone23" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MegaZone23">Mega Zone 23</a>'s history of English dubs is quite interesting:
<ul><li> Let's start with the 1986 release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech">Robotech: The Movie</a></em> from Harmony Gold and The Cannon Group. Carl Macek was unable to get the license to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossDoYouRememberLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossDoYouRememberLove">Macross: Do You Remember Love?</a></em> to use for a <em>Robotech</em> film, so he got <em>Megazone 23</em> instead and retooled footage from <em>Part 1</em> to tie-in to <em>Robotech</em> since it had the same character designer and was animated on 35mm. The entire film was recorded twice before Cannon was happy. In the final version, the dialogue had little to do with the original script, the character names were changed, many scenes were omitted, and scenes from <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDimensionCavalrySouthernCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDimensionCavalrySouthernCross">Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross</a></em> were spliced in, all due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>. A new ending was also animated by the original producers to end the film on a more positive note. The film never made it past test screenings in the US due to it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto">being considered too mature for children</a>, but was released to some success in Latin America and Europe. It has never been officially released to home video in it's complete form, but many a bootleg can be found among <em>Robotech</em> fans.
</li><li> An English dub of <em>Part 2</em> was also done by Harmony Gold in 1987, but with a partially different voice cast and completely different set of character names. This "International" dub was done as a "teaching tool" to assist Japanese speakers learn English, and was included with the Japanese laserdisc release. Interestingly, this dub's opening scene splices in footage from the "retooled" ending of <em>Robotech: The Movie</em>.
</li><li> Carl Macek and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StreamlinePictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StreamlinePictures">Streamline Pictures</a> later gave <em>Part 1</em> a straight dub in 1994 with some of the same voices as the "International" <em>Part 2</em> dub, as well as the <em>Robotech</em> film, but with all the original character names and dialogue. They intended on doing <em>Parts 2</em> and <em>3</em> as well, but Orion Pictures' corporate problems resulted in all Streamline releases being halted. There's a rumor that a Streamline dub for <em>Part 2</em> was produced and screened at a convention, but this hasn't been proven real.
</li><li> Manga UK released a pretty straight dub of Part 3 on VHS for the UK in 1995 that was also shown on the British Sci-Fi Channel. Of course, the voice cast for this was completely different.
</li><li> It wasn't until 2004 that the entire trilogy was finally given a consistent dub, this time by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ADVFilms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ADVFilms">ADV Films</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TekkamanBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TekkamanBlade">Tekkaman Blade</a></em> has two dubs, both using the "Teknoman" title and that were dubbed by Saban. The one aired on UPN Kids renamed the main character "Teknoman Slade" and only lasted 26 episodes. The alternate dub covered 43 episodes (out of 49) and kept the Japanese opening, but still used Saban's English theme for the end credits. There were also a few voice differences between each, including the main character: Bob Bergen voiced "Slade" in the US-aired dub, while another actor named David Thomas voiced "Blade" in the overseas version. Media Blasters' DVD release used the international dub masters, to the disappointment of fans who had nostalgia for the UPN version (which would seem to have been made and aired after the "International English" dub).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SuperPig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SuperPig">Super Pig</a></em> had two English dubs, one by Saban titled "Super Pig" and one that aired in the Philippines under the title "Super Boink". While Saban's dub replaced the BGM and opening and closing themes, Super Boink kept all the original music. Saban's version did not get a TV deal in North America, but was used as the basis for other international dubs and briefly aired in the UK and Australia.
</li><li> In a rather bizarre situation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MakotoShinkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MakotoShinkai">Makoto Shinkai</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FiveCentimetersPerSecond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FiveCentimetersPerSecond">5 Centimeters per Second</a></em> got dubbed twice into English, once by Houston-based <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ADVFilms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ADVFilms">ADV Films</a> and once by LA-based <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BangZoomEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BangZoomEntertainment">BangZoom</a>. ADV made their dub and released it to DVD in early 2008&#133; right before their collapse resulted in the film's rights being snatched up by then-upstart Crunchyroll, who gave the film a new English dub. Bandai later sublicensed the redub and put it out on DVD, and it was also featured on Discotek's recent DVD release. ADV's dub, which garnered a ton of praise upon its release and is the one preferred by Shinkai fans, is exceedingly rare today (mostly because fans who own a copy know how irreplaceable it is and refuse to give it up for anything).
<ul><li> There's never been a straight answer as to why Crunchyroll decided to redub <em>5cm/s</em> rather than just use ADV's dub. One rumor is that the Japanese producers were disappointed in ADV's handling of the film and wanted a more accurate dub from a different company &#150; this makes little sense, however, since ADV (via its successor company <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SentaiFilmworks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SentaiFilmworks">Sentai Filmworks</a>) is still the "go-to" licensor for Shinkai's work &#150; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ChildrenWhoChaseLostVoices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ChildrenWhoChaseLostVoices">Children Who Chase Lost Voices</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheGardenOfWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheGardenOfWords">The Garden of Words</a></em>. A more likely explanation is that Crunchyroll yanked the <em>5cm/s</em> license at a point when no one knew who actually owned what of ADV's assets and figured it would be easier to just commission a new dub rather than wait for the debris from ADV's collapse to settle.

Though the last one covered more of the series (supposedly all 195 episodes), little is known about it and episodes are difficult to find.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VoltesV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VoltesV">Voltes V</a></em> had an English dub that aired in the Philippines in the late '70s, dubbed by Questor International (with English versions of the opening and ending themes). It also had an English dub produced as a compilation movie titled <em>Voltus 5</em>, by Uniprom Films and Toei (although it did not dub the opening). Both dubs are notable for having the same English names used for the cast. 3B Productions<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10lb6t');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note10lb6t" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10lb6t');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> who were responsible for the <em>Tranzor Z</em> dub of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></span> would later re-release the compilation film in 1983, but with the Japanese opening switched out for a new instrumental.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MayaTheBee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MayaTheBee">Maya the Bee</a></em> had an American English dub by Saban Entertainment in 1989, although an earlier UK-produced dub also existed and had aired in Australia a few years prior (on ATV10). Little was known about the first English dub for a while, other than it used the same opening theme that was heard in European adaptations of the series, however the British dub can now be found on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>.
</li><li> At least thirteen episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicKnightRayearth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicKnightRayearth">Magic Knight Rayearth</a></em> were dubbed for TMS International in 1995, but the lackluster ratings of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> led Fox Kids and other networks to pass on the series and it was shelved.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note117091');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note117091" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note117091');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> It is known that Ocean dubbed the first episode as a pilot, and that TMS used a different studio (Summit Media Group) for a 13-episode series, though it is unconfirmed on whether or not the later studio also redubbed the first episode for the TV run.</span>. The first episode was shown at select anime conventions a few years later, and revealed that it would have had a replaced opening theme and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">renamed protagonists</a> (Luce, Marine, Anemone). After the license lapsed, Media Blasters released their dub in 1999, which was produced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BangZoomEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BangZoomEntertainment">BangZoom</a>, kept the characters' names, and covered the whole series.
<ul><li> If it counts, the OVA remake "Rayearth" was released in the US by Manga Entertainment, who produced a dub with Taj Productions in New York with yet another cast, even though Manga had worked with Bang Zoom before.
</li><li> Media Blasters supposedly had pilots dubbed for the first episode by Bang Zoom, TAJ, and even Coastal Carolina to decide which studio to use.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaptainHarlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaptainHarlock">Captain Harlock</a></em> had two failed English dubs: The first was by ZIV International in 1981, which covered four episodes (1, 9, 2, and 3). However, while the first two episodes adapted had a relatively straight dub (aside from some name changes), the latter two episodes ventured into more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagDub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagDub">Gag Dub</a> territory, had more name changes<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1201ww');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1201ww" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1201ww');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> (Tadashi Daiba was renamed "Tommy Dexter" in the initial dubbed episodes, but "Tommy Hairball" in these ones)</span>, and a different voice cast. The second dub was by Harmony Gold in 1985, titled "Captain Harlock and the Queen of 1000 Years" It was a heavily-edited <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation">mash up of Harlock</a> with another Matsumoto series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/QueenMillennia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/QueenMillennia">Queen Millennia</a></em>. It lasted 65 episodes, with segments of episodes being cut and pasted from both Harlock and Millenia. However, this version also flopped, and is hard to find. Another obscure dub of Harlock was produced by William Winckler Productions in 2010, though in the form of two compilation films that mashed up several episodes from the series.
</li><li> The anime adaptation of <em>Captain Future</em> also had two incomplete dubs, neither managing to cover all 53 of its episodes. The first adaptation by ZIV was released around 1981, and dubbed episodes 5-8. Harmony Gold would later release a compilation film adaptation of the first four episodes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/CrusherJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/CrusherJoe">Crusher Joe</a></em> received a heavily edited English dub by Jim Terry Productions in 1988, titled <em>Crushers</em>. A later dub by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnimEigo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnimEigo">AnimEigo</a> was released in 2000.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AquarionEvol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AquarionEvol">Aquarion Evol</a></em> has received two English dubs. One produced by Funimation and the other made airing in on <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxLhknoD9po">TV2 Malaysia<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HanaNoKoLunlun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HanaNoKoLunlun">Hana no Ko Lunlun</a></em> was first released in English by ZIV International in 1980 under the title <em>Angel</em>. It had a '70s disco-type opening theme replacing the original, and briefly aired on HBO. At least two episodes were released on VHS tape, but it is unknown if the dub got any further than that. Harmony Gold would later release a compilation film adaptation titled <em>Flower Angel</em> in 1985. Most recently, William Winckler Productions also went the compilation route and edited the series down into two movies, both under the <em>Lun Lun the Flower Girl</em> title. None of these dubs are widely available these days, with the most recent version only airing in Japan as a way of assisting viewers in learning English (similar to the Megazone 23 example).
</li><li> The 1977 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato">Space Battleship Yamato</a></em> film had a little known English dub pre-<em>Star Blazers</em>. This version actually calls the ship the Yamato and preserves some of the Japanese names such as Captain Okita and 'Gorgon" enemy leader Desler. Curiosly, this is not the same 1977 Yamato compilation film that most purchasers of the Voyager Entertainment Yamato collection might have seen. It is still a compilation and is identical in every way (aside from cut footage). But this has a different ending. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13zasp');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note13zasp" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13zasp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Apparently this is the first version of the film shown in Japan, where it has alternate footage of what the crew finds at Iscandar: Starsha had died and left them a recording as well as the Cosmo Cleaner. </span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatch">Yo-Kai Watch</a></em> has two dubs. A Southeast Asian dub, produced by Medi-Lan Ltd. for Medialink Animation International Ltd. that airs on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToonamiAsia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToonamiAsia">Toonami Asia</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a>, and Okto, which is a straight dub and retains the Japanese names of the characters, as well as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic">Verbal Tics</a> for characters like Komasan. The other dub is an American dub, produced by Sprite Animation Studios for Dentsu Entertainment USA, Inc. that airs on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyXD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyXD">Disney XD</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel">Disney Channel</a> in the US, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Teletoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Teletoon">Teletoon</a> in Canada, Cartoon Network in the UK, and GO! in Australia. While the American dub is somewhat edited, it's mostly faithful to the Japanese version. It is also closer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YokaiWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YokaiWatch">the translated games</a>.
<ul><li> The 3rd season of <em>Yo-Kai Watch</em> also had two English dubs. The first dub was from SDI Media in Los Angeles and contained a different cast from the dub of the previous two seasons. The second dub was made by an unknown studio in Miami for Viz Media Europe, which aired on Cartoon Network in South Africa in 2019. The weird part is, despite the dedicated dub for Africa implying a lack of distribution rights on the newer episodes of the Los Angeles dub, Cartoon Network apparently swapped back-and-forth between some episodes of <em>both</em> dubs. Crazy, right?

<ul><li> The 2005 anime was dubbed into English thrice. The American dub, produced by Bang Zoom! Entertainment, aired on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyXD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyXD">Disney XD</a> and is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation">Cut-and-Paste Translation</a>.

Unlike the American dub, the UK dub is much more faithful to the Japanese version, but uses the name changes from the former dub. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3ydvbjmJhY&amp;feature=youtu.be">Another English dub has recently began airing on Disney Channel India<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> The film, <em>Stand by Me Doraemon</em>, was dubbed into English twice. There's the American dub that was produced by Bang Zoom and screened at the 27th Tokyo International Film Festival and released on the Japanese iTunes Store. The other dub was produced in the Philippines and released in Malaysia.
</li><li> The 1979 anime of <em>Doraemon</em> had five English dubs. The first English dub was made around 1985 by Canadian studio Cinar, as <em> The Adventures of Albert and Sydney</em>, covering 150 episodes. It was originally going to air on Superstation WTBS, but it was cancelled before making it on the air. This dub apparently only aired in Barbados. <em>Albert and Sydney</em> has a different theme song, a changed setting, and changed character names. The second English dub was made in the 90's in Malaysia by Speedy Video. Like the first English dub, the characters' names were changed (except for Doraemon) and had some edits to change the setting and deleted and/or toned down scenes that are questionable. This English dub also had tight voice acting and audio quality. The third English dub was also made in the 90's in Singapore. It is more faithful to the Japanese version and is mostly uncut. The fourth English dub was a British <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagDub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagDub">Gag Dub</a> that was comissioned by MTV Europe and made in the 90's (like the Malaysian and Singaporean English dubs), but was never aired and was only released on a VHS that was given to the voice actors of the dub. The fifth dub was a pilot made by Phuuz Entertainment. The five English dubs are hard to find on the internet, but some episodes of the Malaysian English dub and the beginning of the MTV Europe dub can be found on YouTube.

The first one was of the pilot episode done by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheOceanGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheOceanGroup">The Ocean Group</a>. The second one was by Voiceovers Unlimited and aired on Channel i in Singapore. The third one was by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment">4Kids Entertainment</a>. Both Voiceovers Unlimited and 4Kids only dubbed the first season.

However, the HD remaster of the show in Japan included extra scenes not included in the original version of the show, and were thus never dubbed. When Funimation rescued the series in 2015, they successfully funded a redub of the series through Kickstarter that would include the extra scenes in their new DVD and Blu-ray release (the original Ocean dub would be included as a bonus feature without them). This is the <em>third</em> time Funimation has replaced an Ocean dub with their own cast following <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ShakuganNoShana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ShakuganNoShana">Shakugan no Shana</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SakuraDiaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SakuraDiaries">Sakura Diaries</a></em> has two dubs, both from <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADVFilms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADVFilms">ADV Films</a>. When they first released the show to VHS and DVD in 2001, they accidentally used the censored broadcast masters for their release, as well as their dub, which they had farmed out to Monster Island Studios in Austin. They later released a subtitled-only boxset in 2002 with the uncensored episodes. In 2005, they reissued the series in an unedited boxset with an unedited dub with a new cast from their regular Houston studio.
</li><li> The 80's anime of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Perman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Perman">Perman</a></em> had three English dubs. The first English dub was made in the early 2000's for airing on <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TV2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TV2">TV 2</a> Malaysia. The second English dub was made in the late 2000's-early 2010's for Nickelodeon India. The third English dub is current and is made for Disney Channel Southeast Asia.
</li><li> The 2002 anime <em>Mirmo Zibang!</em> has two English dubs. The first one was made by Viz Media and <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoPro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoPro">Sho Pro</a>. The second English dub was made in Singapore by Voiceovers Unlimited. Both the Viz Media /<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoPro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoPro">Sho Pro</a> dub and the Voiceovers Unlimited dub are pretty hard to find online.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PopTeamEpic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PopTeamEpic">Pop Team Epic</a></em>: Kinda. In the Pop Team Story segment in first half of episode 9, Joseph's dialogues are in English. In the original Japanese version, Joseph was voiced by two people of Japanese descent with fluent English. (One of them is <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnimeMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnimeMan">The Anime Man</a>, a YouTuber who played the grown-up Joseph and also provided the English translation.) However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation">Funimation</a> had Joseph's dialogues retranslated, and gave him new voices in their English dub.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BtX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BtX">B't X</a></em> was originally licensed in North America in 2006 by the short-lived Illumitoon, who dubbed the first 14 episodes, but only the first 8 made it to DVD from Westlake Entertainment, the rest airing exclusively on ADV's The Anime Network. The dub was recorded in Dallas, TX with many voice actors regularly heard in dubs from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation">Funimation</a>. Anime Midstream rescued the series, and released the first 25 episodes to DVD in 2018 with a brand new dub.

The first dub was produced by the US branch of Malaysia-based IYUNO Media Group and recorded at Miami-based Studios VOA, which is something unusual these days. Despite the studio doing everything they could to perfect the dub, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">Netflix only used the first takes</a>. That October, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherMarty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherMarty">a new dub</a> was produced by LA-based <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BangZoomEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BangZoomEntertainment">Bang Zoom! Entertainment</a>, who had already established a relationship with Netflix. The Bang Zoom dub has a more faithful translation as opposed to the VOA dub.

The dub featured a mostly British cast (a rarity in anime dubs), and featured Regina Reagan voicing Chiyoko at all three age versions of the character. The film was reissued in North American theaters in 2019 by Eleven Arts, featuring a brand new dub produced by VSI Los Angeles. This dub mirrored the Japanese version by having three actresses voice Chiyoko at different age points (Abby Trott, Erin Yvette, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CindyRobinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CindyRobinson">Cindy Robinson</a> respectively).
<ul><li> Kon's next film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TokyoGodfathers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TokyoGodfathers">Tokyo Godfathers</a></em>, was similary released in theaters and DVD by Sony Pictures sub-only but an English dub was created for Animax by Omni Productions in Hong Kong. In 2020, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GKIDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GKIDS">GKIDS</a> released the film to theaters and later to DVD and Blu-ray with a new English dub by NYAV Post in New York and Los Angeles.

<ul><li> Some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Dreamworks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Dreamworks">Dreamworks</a> films have some of the guest stars voices re-recorded in different English-speaking countries with more local celebrities. For instance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek">Shrek 2</a></em>, Joan Rivers (Red Carpet Announcer) and Larry King (Doris) were dubbed over by Kate Thornton and Jonathan Ross respectively for the UK version. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SharkTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SharkTale">Shark Tale</a></em>, Katie Current was voiced by Katie Couric for the US, Fiona Phillips for the UK, and Tracy Grimshaw for Australia.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Robots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Robots">Robots</a></em>:
<ul><li> Loretta was played by Natasha Lyonne for the US, Cat Deeley for the UK, and Jackie O for Australia.
</li><li> On an additional note, the UK version of <em>Robots</em> has Mr Gasket (Rachet's father) dubbed over by Terry Wogan, Eamonn Holmes re-dubbing the two roles of Stephen Tobolowsky (Bigmouth Executive &amp; Forge) and Vernon Kay as the Trashcan Bot. Also, Aunt Fanny's name is shortened to Aunt '"Fan", as the word "fanny" is UK slang for the female genitals.
</li><li> For the Australian version of <em>Robots</em>, the voices of the Watches ("Don't buy us; we're fakes!") in the train station, were dubbed by six children who had won a competition to appear in the movie. A voice coach trained them to speak with an American accent to blend in with the rest of the movie.
</li></ul></li><li> When <em>Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree</em> was released with <em>The Blustery Day</em> and <em>Tigger Too</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheManyAdventuresOfWinnieThePooh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheManyAdventuresOfWinnieThePooh">as a compilation movie in 1977</a>, Bruce Reitherman's dialogue as Christopher Robin was re-dubbed by Jon Walmsley, who originally did the same character in <em>The Blustery Day</em>. (This was done due to the character having American accent in the first featurette, as opposed to British, which caused complaints from pre-Disney fans. However, Reitherman's singing lines are left un-dubbed during "Little Black Rain Cloud" and "Mind Over Matter" and oddly, Timothy Turner's dialogue as the character in <em>Tigger Too</em> is also kept intact.)
</li><li> The 2005 CGI film adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMagicRoundabout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMagicRoundabout">The Magic Roundabout</a></em> was re-dubbed and edited in North America as <em>Doogal</em> &#150; which, not coincidentally, also stripped out a lot of the British humour of the original dub. The American version is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">roundly</a> hated.

<ul><li> The film had a U.S. dub and a U.K. dub. The American dub was made in 1983 and was shown in theaters. The voice actors were a mix of voices that may be familiar to those who regularly watched Kung Fu Theater dubs as well as voice actors who would go on to achieve recognition in anime dubs and Western Animation (example: a pre <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech">Robotech</a> Cam Clarke as the voice of Peewit). The 1979 U.K. dub had a completely different cast sporting thicker U.K accents, as well as electronically enhanced Smurf voices. The musical numbers were completely different in both versions. Today, only the U.K dub can be found, but it is believed that the American dub is still in someone's warehouse.
</li><li> There have actually been two different versions of the U.S. dub. While they are nearly the same, both versions use different voice actors for Papa Smurf, and in the 2nd version, Johan (pronounced as "Yohan" in the 1st version) is called John. (A unofficial 2008 DVD release by Televista somehow has a mixture of both versions in has Johan being called "(Sir) John" up until the scene where he and Peewit first arrive at the Smurf village.)

The first dub was probably released in theaters, and the second was bundled free with some cheap DVD player bundles in the early days of DVD technology. Both versions contain the same voice cast, but the second dub contains completely different songs and several scenes were either re-arranged or cut (and the rapping dog has a different voice).
</li><li> The German film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMagicVoyage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMagicVoyage">The Magic Voyage</a></em> (known in Germany as: Die Abenteuer von Pico und Columbus, which translates to: The Adventure of Pico and Columbus) has actually gotten two English dubs produced. The first English dub was produced by Alias Film and it is rare and hard to find. It can be found on Malaysian VCD releases distributed by Berjaya HVN Sdn Bhd. Plus the original music heard in the original German version was kept. The second (and rather more infamous) English dub which had a more well known voice cast (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DomDeLuise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DomDeLuise">Dom De Luise</a>, Corey Feldman, and Mickey Rooney), but with a new composed soundtrack was released for the home video market by Hemdale Home Video and still can be commonly found on VHS and DVD copies in North America and other western territories.

The American dub has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarratingTheObvious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarratingTheObvious">a narrator explaining every single plot point</a> as well as several character names, plot points and some terminology being changed (eg. druid to wizard) so American kids can understand it. The British dub has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianBlessed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianBlessed">BRIAN BLESSED</a> as General Caous and is sadly long out of print.
</li><li> <em>The Mansions of the Gods</em> has a Canadian dub and a British dub. The British dub is exactly the same as the Canadian dub, only with a few voices replaced.

The American dub of the first movie has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DomDeLuise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DomDeLuise">Dom De Luise</a>, best known for his co-starring with Burt Reynolds and voicing comic relief characters in several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonBluth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonBluth">Don Bluth</a> films as Bull, and was coincidentally released by Vestron Video through their Children's Video Library label that they also released Don Bluth's first film, <em>Banjo The Woodpile Cat</em> through, while the British dub, released by Video Collection International, has Peter Woodthorpe (best known as Gollum in both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RalphBakshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RalphBakshi">Ralph Bakshi</a>'s and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BBC">BBC</a>'s radio adaptations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordOfTheRings">Lord of the Rings</a></em>) as the voice of M&aring;ns.

The second movie is a rather stange case, however, since both English dubs have American-sounding voices, including the British dub's voice for Peter/Pelle.

The export dubs were released on video in the UK during the '90s and later were released on DVD in the U.S., extinguishing the Titan versions from the market, although Media Blasters managed to include the Titan <em>DAM</em> dub as an audio option for their first troubled release in 2011.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheReturnOfGodzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheReturnOfGodzilla">The Return of Godzilla</a></em> has two dubs. The original export dub (featuring many of the typically recognizable but unidentified Hong Kong dubbers of the time) was released subtitled on video in a few European countries and later made it to the UK in 1998. Of course, there's also the more well known American re-edit <em>Godzilla 1985</em>, dubbed in Los Angeles (Lara Cody, who lent her talent to a couple of Streamline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioGhibli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioGhibli">Studio Ghibli</a> dubs voices Naoko), which interestingly was released theatrically in the UK before the export dub. When Kraken Releasing brought the film to DVD and Blu-ray in 2016, the original export dub made its official debut in the US due to the <em>Godzilla 1985</em> version being caught up in legal complications; ironically, now <em>that</em> version is unavailable on any format newer than VHS, and will likely never be officially released again.

The other is the U.S. dub, which almost entirely replaced this version internationally, featuring a new score by German composer Peter Thomas. <em>Almost</em> every major foreign version used this dub as a basis. The incomplete HK dub was only recently bootleg telecined and later slapped onto the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShoutFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShoutFactory">Shout! Factory</a> Blu-Ray as a bonus track. Interestingly, a good two minutes of this dub was heard on some earlier DVD releases of the U.S. dub for some unexplained reason.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackieChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackieChan">Jackie Chan</a>'s Hong Kong films from his early and Golden Harvest days are among the absolute rulers of this phenomenon. They are usually divied up among the original dubs comissioned in Hong Kong or the UK for exportation abroad (sometimes shortened or rescored), the more often than not heavily altered theatrical and direct-to-video U.S. versions, and the dubs for home video consumption prepared in Hong Kong. The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PoliceStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PoliceStory">Police Story</a></em> is rather notorious for possessing a whopping <em>four</em> main dubs for a live action film:
<ul><li> The first was prepared at the time of the film's release, and featured the original Michael Lai score, but only saw official release on an obscure Dutch PAL VHS until 2018. In this dub, Jackie's Ka-kui character is given an English name, "Kevin". Has a classic '80s HK cast, with voice actors like Matthew Oram (Inspector Wong), Barry Haigh (Sergeant Mao), John Culkin (Kevin), and Simon Broad (Cheung, the lawyer).
<ul><li> The version of this dub that saw wide release was a shortened export version, featuring the same dubbing, but a new, fully synth score recorded by Kevin Bassinson, and also shaved off about 12 minutes from the original Hong Kong cut, giving it a more action-oriented pace with fewer comedy scenes.
</li></ul></li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NewLineCinema" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NewLineCinema">New Line Cinema</a> acquired the rights to some of Chan's films in the late nineties, they had the export cut re-dubbed and re-scored with a recycled soundtrack by J. Peter Robinson, and Ping Wu (perhaps most well known as the Chinese takeout delivery man who sued Elaine from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em>) dubbing Ka-kui/Kevin, now named "Jackie". This version only saw tape, laserdisc, and cable releases before being phased out in the early 2000s, when the uncut HK cut became the dominant version.
</li><li> A third dub was commissioned around 2000, which saw distribution by Media Asia in PAL territories like the UK, and was featured on the initial HKL DVD in 2001. This has Jack Murphy (as Ka-kui, again named "Jackie" like the New Line dub), Andrea Kwan (Selina), and Rik Thomas (Inspector Wong) among the cast. Has different Anglicized names for most of the characters that are somewhat closer to their Cantonese names.
</li><li> Finally, the fourth dub was recorded around when Fortune Star made their 5.1 mix of the film, which had a remixed soundtrack with new foley and the like. Has much of the same cast as the 2000 dub, but with a lot of better performances and better casting decisions.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PoliceStory2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PoliceStory2">Police Story 2</a></em> also packs four dubs under much of the same circumstances of its predecessor:
<ul><li> The original English export version was dubbed by General Screen Enterprises, Ltd. in the UK, and was shortened by 10 minutes from the Hong Kong theatrical version. This has Daniel Flynn providing the voice of Jackie, whose character is again named Kevin. It only saw release on VHS in the UK and Europe, before it was included as a bonus feature on Eureka's 2018 Blu-Ray.
</li><li> New Line Cinema produced their own dub of the export version concurrently with the first film's, and likewise the cast is exactly the same. It also saw release on tape, laserdisc and cable.
</li><li> The full-length Hong Kong theatrical cut was dubbed in 2000, again for Media Asia's PAL region releases. Has essentially the same cast as the 2000 dub of its predecessor, the only major difference being Rik Thomas assuming the role of John Ko.
</li><li> The longer Japanese cut was finally dubbed concurrently with the first film's fourth dub, and shares the same cast. Its first releases was the Dragon Dynasty DVD in 2006.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuperCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuperCop">Police Story 3: Super Cop</a></em> had an uncut export dub recorded in the UK, again with Daniel Flynn providing Jackie's voice, who is once again named Kevin. This version was released on VHS there, while America got the abridged Dimension Films U.S. theatrical version, simplified to just <em>Supercop</em>, in 1996. Notable for having Chan and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichelleYeoh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichelleYeoh">Michelle Yeoh</a> loop their own lines for the new dubbing, which retains the Kevin Chan name for Jackie's character.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrunkenMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrunkenMaster">Drunken Master</a></em> and its 1994 sequel both pack two dubs per film:
<ul><li> <em>Drunken Master</em> was originally shipped with a standard Hong Kong recorded dub. Wong Fei-Hung and Beggar So were anglicized as "Freddie Wong" and "Sam Seed", and voiced by voice actors Warren Rooke and Rik Thomas, respectively.
<ul><li> The second dub was recorded in the UK, and has Daniel Flynn dubbing Jackie Chan, whose character name is retained as Freddie Wong. Beggar So was renamed "So Hai". Has seemingly replaced the original dub and has appeared on most commercial releases, the original dub becoming somewhat rare and sought after by many fans of Chan's films.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Drunken Master II</em> had an export dub recorded which retained the original music and effects from the Cantonese version, but cut the widely considered poor taste ending, where Wong Fei-Hung has become brain dead after guzzling industrial alcohol during the final battle. This dub has seen release on Warner Video Asia's DVD, which also has abridged Cantonese and Mandarin tracks that conform to the deletion of the ending.
<ul><li> The film was given a U.S. theatrical release by Dimension Films in 2000 as <em>The Legend of Drunken Master</em>, which replaced the original music and sound effects, and had Chan looping his own lines for the new dubbing. Part of the original ending is kept, but ends before Fei-Hung's state can be shown.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheYoungMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheYoungMaster">The Young Master</a></em> was initially given a shortened English export version dubbed in Hong Kong, with some exclusive footage, a new music score by Ryudo Uzaki and Akira Inoue featuring the English theme song <em>Kung Fu Fighting Man</em> performed by Jackie Chan. A new, straight dub of the Hong Kong theatrical version was recorded for DVD in the UK, and yet another for the U.S.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DragonLord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DragonLord">Dragon Lord</a></em>: Three dubs, all based on the general release Hong Kong version; A shortened English export version dubbed in Hong Kong, the also shortned U.S. Dimension Films version with a bad Jackie Chan soundalike, and the uncut dub of the theatrical cut for DVD in the UK. 88 Films' UK Blu-Ray release has the export and DVD dubs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ProjectA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ProjectA">Project A</a></em>: Two dubs. The uncut UK export dub by General Screen Enterprises, and the edited direct-to-video Dimension Films U.S. version.
<ul><li> <em>Project A Part II</em> packs three dubs: The original shortned UK export dub, the uncut dub of the Hong Kong theatrical cut for DVD in the UK, and the edited Dimension Films U.S. home video dub.
</li></ul></li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyLuckyStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyLuckyStars">Lucky Stars</a></em> trilogy:
<ul><li> <em>Winners and Sinners</em> packs three dubs: The original export dub (which removess a brief karaoke scene) was released on VHS in the UK and on DVD in the Nordic countries. The second dub was recorded for the UK Hong Kong Legends DVD, and the third for the U.S. Fox DVD.
</li><li> <em>My Lucky Stars</em>: Three dubs again. The shortened General Screen export dub released on VHS in the UK and U.S. and on DVD in the Nordic countries, the uncut dub of the HK theatrical cut used on the UK Hong Long Legends DVD, and another recorded for the U.S. Fox DVD. <em>Twinkle, Twinkle Lucky Stars</em> was surprisingly spared from this practice, posessing only its original export dub.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WheelsOnMeals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WheelsOnMeals">Wheels on Meals</a></em> has two dubs: The original General Screen Enterprises UK export dub with a different, funkier music score by Keith Morrison (an alias of Japanese composer Toshiyuki Kimori), and a later Fortune Star redub for DVD. The UK Blu-Ray by Eureka Entertainment carries both.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeartOfDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeartOfDragon">Heart Of Dragon</a></em>: The original HK export dub released on VHS in the UK and U.S. and DVD in the UK, and the Fortune Star re-dub featured only on the U.S. Fox DVD. The 88 Films Blu-Ray carries only the export dub.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ArmourOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ArmourOfGod">Armour of God</a></em> has three dubs: The original export dub done in Hong Kong, the Dimension Films version of the shorter export cut with a new music score and Jackie voicing himself, and the Media Asia/Fortune Star dub used on current home video releases of the uncut Hong Kong version.
<ul><li> Its sequel, <em>Operation Condor</em>, was surprisingly spared from the usual practice of having its original UK export dub replaced by a newer redub on later home video releases. On the other side of the Atlantic, Dimension Films released their own Americanized theatrical version in 1997 with new dubbing and Jackie ADRing his own lines.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DragonsForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DragonsForever">Dragons Forever</a></em>: The original UK General Screen dub of the shortned export version with some alternative scenes, and the dub of the Hong Kong theatrical cut for DVD. Both are on the 88 Films BD.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Miracles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Miracles">Miracles</a></em> was dubbed twice: Once in the UK for its shortened export version, and once in Hong Kong for the DVD in the UK. The Blu-Ray by 88 Films only includes the shorter export version.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IslandOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IslandOfFire">Island Of Fire</a></em> has two: The original HK export dub used in the UK, and the U.S. <em>The Prisoner</em> dub featuring a new score.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwinDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwinDragons">Twin Dragons</a></em>: Two dubs. An uncut export version dubbed in Canada, and the shortened 1999 U.S. Dimension Films theatrical version where Jackie dubs himself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CityHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CityHunter">City Hunter</a></em>: Two dubs. The original Doug Stone Enterprises export dub, released in the UK on VHS and DVD, and the Fortune Star re-dub first featured on the U.S. Fox DVD. Both are on the Eureka BD relaese.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CrimeStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CrimeStory">Crime Story</a></em> is a strange case of two and a half dubs. The original Doug Stone Enterprises dub was released on video in the UK, and in the U.S. a modified version was released that changed Eddie's name to "Jackie" and also brought on somebody doing a bad Jackie Chan impression to revoice his lines. When the film was released on DVD in the UK, a new standalone dub was recorded in Hong Kong.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thunderbolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thunderbolt">Thunderbolt</a></em>: Two dubs. The original export dub recorded in Hong Kong (available on some Warner Bros. Asia DVDs like the Japanese two-disc set), and the New Line Cinema re-dub used in the U.S.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UltraSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UltraSeven">Ultraseven</a></em> had two different dubs: The first was produced in the mid 1970s when the series aired on Hawaii's KHON-TV, and the second was done by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Cinar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Cinar">Cinar</a> in 1985 for Turner Programming Services. Despite its rather amateurish voice acting, some fans believe that Hawaiian dub is the better of the two; however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">only a handful of dubbed episodes survive</a>. However, on the other side of the coin, some fans think that the Hawaiian dub wasn't all that good, and the Cinar dub was actually better.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UltramanTiga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UltramanTiga">Ultraman Tiga</a></em> also has 2 dubs: an edited <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagDub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagDub">Gag Dub</a> produced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment">4Kids Entertainment</a> that only lasted 25 episodes, and an uncut Asian-English dub that currently has only the first 2 episodes publically available.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TotsTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TotsTV">Tots TV</a></em> has two different English dubs: the original for the UK and another for the US. In the UK version, Tilly speaks in basic French, while the US version had her speak Spanish. The original UK dub tends to be the more well-known version, whereas the US version (which aired on PBS) is hard to find save for two rare VHS releases ("The Tots Find A Treasure Map" and "Lovely Bubble Surprise") and an episode uploaded to the website <em>Understanding 9/11: A Television News Archive</em>. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note171ql7');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note171ql7" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note171ql7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Many PBS affiliates, including the national feed of PBS used on said site, aired nothing but children's programming all day to entertain the kids who had nothing to watch due to non-stop coverage of the attacks interrupting rival blocks <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FoxKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FoxKids">Fox Kids</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KidsWB" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KidsWB">Kids' WB!</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OneSaturdayMorning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OneSaturdayMorning">Disney's One Too</a></em>.</span>

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Oh My Goddess!</a></em> has two known English translations. This is odd because one of those is the highly-regarded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DarkHorseComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DarkHorseComics">Dark Horse</a>/Studio Proteus translation that ran from 1996 to 2015 (and received significant revisions when DH reprinted the first 20 volumes from 2005 to 2012); the other is a much more recent translation for the UK market.
</li><li> Both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh">Azumanga Daioh</a></em> and the first 5 volumes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Yotsuba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Yotsuba">Yotsuba&amp;!</a></em> were originally released by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ADVFilms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ADVFilms">ADV Manga</a>, with <em>AzuDai</em> even made available in a slightly revised omnibus edition. Then ADV collapsed and went bankrupt (the anime side resurrected, but the manga line did not), and Yen Press picked up the licenses. When Yen reprinted both series, they opted to completely retranslate them to fit with their house style (near-literal accuracy, as opposed to ADV's tendency toward <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism">Woolseyism</a>). Interestingly, Yen's <em>Yotsuba</em> reprints, as well as the next 5 new volumes, were handled by one of ADV's former translators (volumes 11 and onward were not because that translator passed away during the hiatus between volumes).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em> had two official translations that never got finished. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VizMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VizMedia">Viz</a> version started as a monthly comic series in 1989, which was canceled due to low sales (lasting only eight issues), but was resumed years later in 1995 (due to the popularity of Streamline's dub of the movie), only to be canceled again in 1998. Viz would eventually lose the license to Gutsoon Entertainment, Coamix's short-lived English division, which published the <em>Master Edition</em> version of the series that lasted nine volumes from 2002 until Gutsoon's departure from the market in 2004. Whereas the Viz version featured flipped artwork and has a heavily localized translation with different names (most notably the martial art schools of Hokuto Shinken and Nanto Seiken became the "Sacred Martial Arts of the Great Bear" and "Southern Cross" respectively), the Gutsoon edition retained the right-to-left orientation and had a more literal translation, but features fully colorized artwork.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina">Love Hina</a></em> has had <em>four</em> English translations. There was a short-lived "bilingual edition" from Kodansha meant for the Japanese market; there's Tokyopop's 2002-3 translation for North America; there's the Chuang Yi translation for Singapore (done at the same time as Tokyopop's); and now there's the Kodansha USA omnibus translation. For the record, Tokyopop's translation is fairly liberal, usually flows well, but has serious copy-editing issues (especially in Volumes 2-5 and 9). The Kodansha USA translation is, typical for them, much more accurate but rather dry as a result.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> manga has three complete English translations. There's the original 1998 one from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Tokyopop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Tokyopop">Tokyopop</a> (then known as Mixx), which made use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiC">DiC</a>'s localized character names (except Usagi, who was called "Bunny" instead of "Serena") and was a very liberal adaptation. When Kodansha USA rescued the series in 2011, their releases featured a new, far more literal translation using the original Japanese names/terms. It was frequently criticized for being <em>too</em> literal to the point of being awkward to read (essentially the opposite criticism of Tokyopop's version). They also translated <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodenameSailorV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodenameSailorV">Codename: Sailor V</a></em>, which Tokyopop never touched. Kodansha reissued the series beginning in 2018 in special "Eternal" editions with a brand new faithful translation that read far more naturally.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SlamDunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SlamDunk">Slam Dunk</a></em> was originally translated in North America by the now-defunct Gutsoon Entertainment for their manga anthology <em>Raijin Comics</em> published from 2002 through 2004. This version of <em>Slam Dunk</em> lasted only five volumes before the publication folded. Viz Media later rescued the license and proceeded to translate the whole manga from 2008 through 2013. <a class="urllink" href="http://sporadicsequential.blogspot.com/2008/03/you-let-yourselves-get-spanked-by.html">A comparison of both versions can be seen here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew">Tokyo Mew Mew</a></em> manga has three English translations. Tokyopop's translation was the original, but it was ditched for a new one from Kodansha USA (like Yen Press, Kodansha has a house style that favors near-literal translations). There's also one from Singapore-based Chuang Yi for Southeast Asia.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeadmanWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeadmanWonderland">Deadman Wonderland</a></em> was originally published in English by Tokyopop, but they only released 5 volumes before their closure. The series was left in limbo until the anime found surprise success on Toonami, and the manga was rescued by Viz Media, who restarted the series with a new translation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket">Fruits Basket</a></em> was published by Tokyopop in the early 2000s, and was highly successful, becoming the #1 selling shojo manga of all time in the US. However their editions went out of print following their closure. Yen Press picked up the series in 2016 and began reissuing it in omnibus volumes with a new translation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimagureOrangeRoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimagureOrangeRoad">Kimagure Orange Road</a></em> was originally released digital-only in 2013 by Hivelinx before transferring to Digital Manga's eManga service, featuring a heavily panned translation that was very literal in style and accused by fans of reading very dry on top of its sloppy presentation and numerous typos. In 2016, a successful Kickstarter campaign was raised for a physical release and a digital reissue featuring a newer, and far more professional, translation that was released in 2018-2019.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SPYxFAMILY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SPYxFAMILY">SPY &times; FAMILY</a></em> originally received a digital translation by Manga Plus up through chapter 12 (including the first extra chapter), released simultaneously with the Japanese version. The series then got licensed by Viz Media, who took over the simulpub translations from chapter 13 and did their own translation of the previous chapters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UruseiYatsura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UruseiYatsura">Urusei Yatsura</a></em> was originally published in English by Viz Media (then called Viz Communications) beginning in 1989 under the title <em>Lum * Urusei Yatsura</em>, but was canceled after eight issues. Years later, it was resurrected in Viz's <em>Animerica</em> magazine under the title <em>The Return of Lum * Urusei Yatsura</em>, and 9 graphic novels were released, skipping some chapters, and covering roughly the first 11 volumes. However, Viz dropped the series again in 1998. 21 years later, Viz relicensed the series, and began releasing it in 2-in-1 omnibus volumes with a brand new translation. The first volume was published in February 2019.

</li><li> Similarly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysEpicYarn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysEpicYarn">Kirby's Epic Yarn</a></em> changed the voice of the narration, as well as some of the lines in the opening narration.

(Like Event titles and the characters' titles on the Boxing Ring stage). Additionally, in the British version, the character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DuckHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DuckHunt">Duck Hunt</a> is known as "Duck Hunt Duo".
</li><li> While both American and British versions left the Japanese voice track on, it's quite apparent that US-based Aksys Games' localization of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgarestSenki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgarestSenki">Agarest Senki</a></em> is far superior to UK-based Ghostlight's localization.
</li><li> Most of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ApeEscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ApeEscape">Ape Escape</a></em> games have been released in the UK with a different English voice track than North America.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InazumaEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InazumaEleven">Inazuma Eleven</a></em> on the Nintendo DS was released in Europe with a translation based on the Animax Asia anime dub, using a completely new cast of British VAs. Fast forward a few years, when Inazuma Eleven was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">re-released on the 3DS</a>, it was given an entirely new dub featuring LA voice actors. Interestingly enough, other than changing "football" to "soccer", the script was almost entirely unedited from the EU release, which had the strange effect of mingling American accents with British colloquialisms and slang.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em> has separate English localizations for North America and Europe.

In particular the American version turned the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> DJ Octavio into much more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Large Ham</a>, gave Spyke a Cockney <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunetikAksent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunetikAksent">Funetik Aksent</a>, and made Marie much more of an acerbic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note18f9u3');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note18f9u3" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note18f9u3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2">Splatoon 2</a></em>, on the other hand, used the same English dialogue for both the European and American versions of the game, with only the Splatfest dialogue having slight variations between regions. </span>

Bizarrely enough, the PSN and XBLA versions of <em>SOTN</em> still use the classic PS dialogue, making this trope more apparent, rather than attempting to hide it as is usually so when a "replacement dub" happens.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon">Harvest Moon</a></em>:
<ul><li> As of late, Natsume and Xseed have been fighting over the American translations of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory">Rune Factory</a></em> series, with Natsume having translated Rune Factory 1 and 2, and Xseed translating <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactoryFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactoryFrontier">Rune Factory Frontier</a></em>. After Xseed got Rune Factory Frontier, however, Natsume got the Rune Factory series <em>back</em> and translated <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory3">Rune Factory 3</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactoryOceans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactoryOceans">Rune Factory: Tides of Destiny</a></em>. Then, <em>Xseed</em> managed to get <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory4">Rune Factory 4</a></em>
</li><li> The translation fight between the two companies continues with the surprise announcement that Xseed will translate the next game in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon">Harvest Moon</a></em> series, now renamed to <em>Story of Seasons</em> because Natsume still owns the rights to the <em>Harvest Moon</em> name. As Xseed is owned by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarvelousAQL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarvelousAQL">Marvelous AQL</a>, the developer of the <em>Harvest Moon</em> series, it's reasonable to assume that Xseed will translate the series from now on due to it being closer to Marvelous than Natsume is. Natsume isn't giving up, though, as it has been announced that Natsume is developing their <em>own</em> <em>Harvest Moon</em> game; many are assuming that, despite no longer translating <em>Bokujou Monogatari</em> (the name of the series in Japan) games, Natsume is trying to cash in on the series regardless by pretending they still own it by continuing the usage of the <em>Harvest Moon</em> name.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a>:</em>
<ul><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear1">Metal Gear</a></em> has three official English localizations. There's the British MSX2 version, which due to space constraint issues only kept 86 of the Japanese version's 155 radio messages and suffered from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation">obvious Engrish</a>. Most notably it refers to the player's cigarettes pack as "CIGAL" and constantly misspells the word "destroy" as "destoroy" due to the use of preset keywords to compose most of the text. The second and better known translation was the NES version, which was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReformulatedGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReformulatedGame">reworked port</a> which had a wider release. It kept all the radio messages, but still suffered from Engrish and the game itself had some drastic changes from the MSX2 original. A more faithful conversion of the MSX2 version was later included in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3">Metal Gear Solid 3</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Subsistence</a></em>, with this new version having a completely revised translation. Despite the existence of the other translations, it is the NES version that gets quoted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2">Metal Gear Solid 2</a></em> during the crazed A.I. Colonel sequence and later on by Miller in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVGroundZeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVGroundZeroes">Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a>: The Twin Snakes</em> for the GameCube was originally planned to retain the voice track from the original PlayStation version. However, the voices from the PlayStation version were not recorded in a soundproof studio, causing certain traffic noises in the background to become audible when the master files were processed on the GameCube's more advanced sound chip, resulting in the need for a new voice track. The differences between the two dubs include the lost of certain characters' accents (namely Mei-Ling, Dr. Naomi and Nastasha), the replacement of Greg Eagles with Rob Paulsen as the voice of the Cyborg Ninja (Eagles still voiced the DARPA Chief in the new version), updated playing instructions (due to the different button layout of the GameCube controller and the addition of updated mechanics from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty">the sequel</a>), and certain lines that were localized in the original script were replaced with more literal translations, resulting in some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItSoItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItSoItSucks">questionable changes</a> that were considerably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation">unnatural sounding</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note19g881');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note19g881" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note19g881');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For example, when Otacon is asked by Snake about making Metal Gear REX's radome a weak point, he clarifies "It's not a weak point&mdash;I like to think of it as more of a character flaw" in the original dub. In the remake, the line was changed to the more redundant sounding "It's not a weak point&mdash;more like a weakness." The original Japanese script used the terms <em>jakuten</em> and <em>yowami</em> respectively, which have similar meanings, but different nuances.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The 2002 remake of the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> completely replaced the voice acting from the original 1996 version out of necessity due to the addition of new plot events and changes to the tone and delivery of the existing ones. Specifically the original voice acting was done in an intentionally slow and stilted matter since the English versions of the game did not have subtitles and lead developer Shinji Mikami said that he did not want players to miss out on important clues during cutscenes. Additionally, the script for the 1996 version was written by the developers themselves, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation">who were not exactly fluent in English</a>, resulting in weird lines that has since become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme">iconic</a> to the series, most notably Jill Valentine's grandiose title of "Master of Unlocking", which have been referenced in later games in the series. Ed Smaron, who voiced Barry Burton in the remake, wanted to retain the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">narm</a> aspect of the dialogue, but the developers of the new version insisted on a more serious tone for the script.
</li><li> The PC Engine version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjaGaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjaGaiden">Ninja Ryukenden</a></em> (aka <em>Ninja Gaiden</em>) has an English language setting with a translation that is completely different from the earlier NES version. Notably, Joe Hayabusa keeps his original name (he was renamed Ken Hayabusa in the NES version) and the Jaquio becomes the "Devildoer".
</li><li> Konami's <em>X-Men</em> arcade game got a new voice track (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToHimself">with only two voice actors</a>) for its Playstation Network re-release. However, this dub kept the laughable lines from the original dub ("The White Queen WELCOMES YOU TO DIE!!!") for tradition.
</li><li> Diddy Kong Racing's voice track was redone for its Nintendo DS re-release in the mid-2000s from its original N64 release. This was pointed out in X-Play's review for the re-release with Morgan Webb saying "I miss the old Genie!"
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SilentHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SilentHill">Silent Hill</a> HD Collection</em> featured new voice tracks for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2">Silent Hill 2</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill3">Silent Hill 3</a></em> due to Konami's refusal to pay royalties to the original actors. The scripts for both games remained the same (despite initial plans for rewrites), with only the performance changed. Ultimately, the released version of the <em>HD Collection</em> retained the original voices for <em>2</em> (giving players a choice between the old and new voices), as the cast for that game agreed to drop their royalties demand out of respect for the fanbase, but the original voices for <em>3</em> were still missing.

This happened because the network couldn't afford to license the original American vocal track, so they produced their own, using local English-speaking actors. Apparently Singapore's "content cue" meant that a certain amount of Singaporean programming had to be shown on television (Japan and Canada have similar laws). Voice acting counts, and redoing the vocal track locally was actually the cheaper option.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur">Arthur</a></em> had two voice actors for the title character in the sixth season. It originally had Justin Bradley, but when Mark Rendall voiced him for season 7, he re-dubbed all the season 6 episodes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> was that they did this because Justin Bradley's voice was too whiny for when Arthur was upset. The Mark Rendall version is the only one that airs in North America now, but the Justin Bradley version can be heard outside of North America and on older versions of the DVD and VHS releases.
<ul><li> The show also has a rare BBC-exclusive dub, where the main characters were redubbed by British actors.

The Canadian dub is made in 2014 and and full episodes of this dub are very hard to find on the internet. Also, just about every special (except for the upcoming "The Rise of Norman-Man", which didn't have a redub yet) had a Canadian dub for US/Canadian release.
</li><li> The French cartoon <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Insektors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Insektors">Insektors</a></em> had an American dub and a British dub. The American dub was more faithful to the original.

The second dub by Nigel Planer was made for Channel 4 in the early 1990s, to cover certain episodes which have not yet received an English translation (along with new re-tellings of episodes previously narrated by Thompson; a majority of which were released to VHS in 1993 and 1997). Reruns of the show on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Boomerang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Boomerang">Boomerang</a> randomly switched between the two re-dubs, although a majority of episodes during this run included Planer's narration.
<ul><li> The show also received an American dub, renamed "The Magic Carousel", which was featured in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Pinwheel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Pinwheel">Pinwheel</a></em> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a>. It was a more faithful word-to-word adaptation of the original French dub. In this dub, the characters have their own voices (as opposed to the British version which featured a narrator voicing all of the characters) and retain their names from the British version, with the exception of Dylan and Mr. McHenry keeping their original French names (Flappy and Mr. Young, respectively) and Mr. Rusty having Mr. McHenry's name.

<ul><li> All series from <em>Noddy's Toyland Adventures</em> onward (with the exception of the 2009 installment <em>Noddy In Toyland</em>) have both a British and North American dub.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNoddyShop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNoddyShop">The Noddy Shop</a></em>, the show that broadcast the North American dub of <em>Noddy's Toyland Adventures</em>, has two versions: one with the <em>Noddy</em> segments with the North American dub which aired in the US and Canada and one with the original British Noddy segments, which aired elsewhere. The framing device segments remained untouched, save for the logo during the opening sequence being changed (the US prints have the <em>Noddy</em> logo, while overseas prints use the <em>Noddy In Toyland</em> logo.)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Olivia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Olivia">Olivia</a></em> has a UK English dub and an American English dub. That, and they couldn't afford to keep paying the celebrity guest stars' royalties.

Like in <em>Little Einsteins</em> and <em>The Backyardigans</em>, words are changed to fit British terminology, but sometimes, other words are changed, most commonly during the incidental musical numbers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeppaPig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeppaPig">Peppa Pig</a></em> had an American dub produced in Miami that was only seen during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a>'s short-lived children's block "Tickle-U" back in 2005-06.

The American dub <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">is now lost</a>.
<ul><li> Similarly, the American dubs of two other British cartoons, <em>Little Robots</em> and <em>Gordon the Garden Gnome</em>, have not been seen anywhere in over ten years.
</li></ul></li><li> The 2013 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterRabbit">Peter Rabbit</a></em> series has two English dubs. The American dub can be heard on Nickelodeon or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NickJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NickJr">Nick Jr.</a>, while the British dub can be heard on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBeebies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBeebies">CBeebies</a>.
</li><li> The first two seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pingu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pingu">Pingu</a></em> were given two dubs each. The latter was done by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HITEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HITEntertainment">HIT Entertainment</a> in 2002, due to the original soundtracks having been greatly worn out. The re-dub features different music, re-recorded "penguin dialogue", and the "Pingu Dance" intro and ending title cards from seasons 3 and 4. The original versions of the episodes still air in the UK on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBeebies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBeebies">CBeebies</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine">Thomas the Tank Engine</a></em> has two English dubs: one for the UK, and one for the US. In addition to having different narrators and, in later seasons, different voice actors, there are several small differences between the dubs due to different terminology, culture, and political correctness. Not only that, the first two seasons have a <em>third</em> English dub due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeCarlin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeCarlin">George Carlin</a> replacing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr">Ringo Starr</a> as Mr. Conductor on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShiningTimeStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShiningTimeStation">Shining Time Station</a></em>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WheresWally" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WheresWally">Where's Wally/Waldo</a></em> animated series has two English dubs, although this is justified due to the fact that the title character is known as "Wally" in the UK and "Waldo" in the US and Canada. Both dubs where produced simultaneously with the same voice actors, the only real difference between them was that every time the name "Waldo" was spoken, the actors had to rerecord their lines to accommodate the "Wally" dub.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub">Winx Club</a></em> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RainbowSrl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RainbowSrl">Rainbow SpA</a> rules this trope when it comes to non-anime English dubs:
<ul><li> A straight English dub produced by Cin&eacute;lume in Montreal, Canada covers Seasons 1-4. It's featured on some international DVDs as the alternate English-language track, and most foreign language dubs were sourced from this one. It is also used by Cinedigm on their complete season 1-2 DVDs in the US.
</li><li> The first two movies were also dubbed into English, but this time by Dubbing Brothers USA in Los Angeles, using voice actors mostly known for anime like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CindyRobinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CindyRobinson">Cindy Robinson</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherCoreySmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherCoreySmith">Christopher Corey Smith</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ErinFitzgerald" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ErinFitzgerald">Erin Fitzgerald</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephanieSheh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephanieSheh">Stephanie Sheh</a>. These were only shown in some theaters in South-East Asia and were featured as an alternate language track on some foreign DVDs.
</li><li> The heavily-edited and censored 4Kids dub, recorded in New York, covered Seasons 1-3. It was released to DVD by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation">Funimation</a>.
</li><li> Nickelodeon's English voice cast recorded for the specials covering Seasons 1-2, the entirety of Seasons 3-6, and the first two films. Seasons 5 and 6 were co-productions with Nick and Rainbow (both operated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Viacom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Viacom">Viacom</a>), during which the animation was done to match Nickelodeon's English voices.
</li><li> The seventh and eighth seasons were dubbed in English by DuArt Film &amp; Video (the same studio currently handling <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em>) and its successor, 3Beep. Despite being recorded in New York, the cast is completely different from the 4Kids dub, although the voice director is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LisaOrtiz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LisaOrtiz">Lisa Ortiz</a>, who voiced Musa and Icy in that version.

<ul><li> Inevitable in Spanish, where both Spain and Latin America get different dubs. In the 21st century, only a couple Latin dubs have been broadcast in Spain, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether">Drawn Together</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Coco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Coco">Coco</a></em>.
</li><li> In Latin America, some productions have multiple dubs because of different distributors. These dubs may be made in different <em>countries</em> (most often Mexico, but sometimes the USA, Venezuela, Argentina, Chile or Colombia). One wiki has a category <a class="urllink" href="http://es.doblaje.wikia.com/wiki/Categor%C3%ADa:Doblajes_simult%C3%A1neos">describing the Dueling Dubs trope<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, as well as another category for <a class="urllink" href="http://es.doblaje.wikia.com/wiki/Categor%C3%ADa:Redoblajes">redubs<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://doblaje.fandom.com/es/wiki/Categor<!--C3-->ADa%3ADoblajes_alternos">slightly modified dubs<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> In Brazilian Portuguese, some TV shows and movies have separate dubs made by different distributors. Most of these dubs are produced in different cities (usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Usefulnotes/SaoPaulo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Usefulnotes/SaoPaulo">S&atilde;o Paulo</a> or Rio de Janeiro). Most older productions have at least two dubs because the original audio no longer exists in most cases, or because of alternate rights. Fans are known to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">ensure the original dubs still exist online</a> if only for nostalgia.
</li><li> European Portuguese dubs are only produced for children's movies and series. While most mature series/movies are dubbed in Brazil, they are only subtitled in Portugal.
</li><li> Most films since 1994 have two French dubs: one for Canada, and another for Europe. However, most TV shows have a single French dub (usually made in France or Belgium). However, most recent Canadian shows have a single French dub done in Canada instead (Canadian broadcasters must air a certain amount of Canadian-made programming).
</li><li> Whenever a movie (animated or live action) is released in Japan, each broadcaster produces its own dub of said movie. Some Japanese dubs may be released direct to video or theatrically. Older movies tend to have more existing dubs.
<ul><li> Similarly, in South Korea, the three main broadcasters (KBS, MBC, and SBS) own their respective dubs, which may not air on a competitor's channel.
</li></ul></li><li> Since Chinese is a language with many dialects, most productions have dubs made in Taiwan, China (Mandarin) and/or Hong Kong (Cantonese).
</li><li> There exist alternate Islamic Arabic dubs of everything from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DinoBabies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DinoBabies">Dino Babies</a></em> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CyborgKuroChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CyborgKuroChan">Cyborg Kuro-chan</a></em>. The difference? There's no music, the theme song's a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasheed">nasheed<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (being sung a capella), and most of the time characters state religious things about Islam. However, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToadPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToadPatrol">Toad Patrol</a></em> has a Islamic Arabic dub but not a regular Arabic dub.
<ul><li> The Islamic dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> (which renamed Conan to Kamal, meaning "Perfect") actually caused controversy among Arab otakus. Funningly enough, multiple sources say it was done by Venus Company, the same studio that did the more well-known secular dub aired on Spacetoon and other channels accross the Arab world.
</li></ul></li><li> It's common for films to have multiple Turkish dubs, mostly depending on the medium. TV broadcasts (depending on the channel), theatrical release, home entertainment, and streaming.
</li><li> In Poland and Russia, it's very common for non-children's productions to have alternate voice-over dubs. Both countries have gradually begun to dub more mature works (and blockbuster films) with full casts.
</li><li> Dozens of films have alternate Hindi dubs, mostly for theatrical release, home entertainment, streaming, and TV airings (mostly for different channels).
</li><li> In the 2010's, Sony Pictures decided to redub a lot of their old material (ranging from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastEmperor">The Last Emperor</a></em>) in Argentina for whatever reason (likely to avoid paying royalties to the original dub actors). Most of these redubs were done by either Caja de Ruidos or Palmera Record. The Argentine dub of <em>Seinfeld</em> has so far only aired on the Canal Sony pay TV channel (Amazon Prime Video keeps the original Mexican dub).

It's speculated this was done so that the original voice actors wouldn't be paid royalties, and also because the original lead voice actress was arrested for drug possession.
</li><li> Both original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Patlabor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Patlabor">Patlabor</a></em> movies were re-recorded in Japanese with the original cast for the 5.1 re-release. The performances in the re-voiced versions aren't considered as good.
</li><li> The movie compilation trilogy for the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> was re-recorded in Japanese in 2002 in 5.1 with new sound effects and the original cast, with the exception of the ones that were deceased.

</li><li> The <em>2.0</em> version of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em> film was re-voiced in Japanese with updated sound effects and the original cast, with the exception of the Puppet Master, where Iemasa Kayumi was replaced with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YoshikoSakakibara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YoshikoSakakibara">Yoshiko Sakakibara</a> for creative reasons.
</li><li> The <em>Kai</em> version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> was also completely re-voiced in Japanese despite just being recycled footage from <em>DBZ</em>. This was due to the original audio master tapes for <em>DBZ</em> being long destroyed, and impossible to mix in 5.1. Most of the original voice actors returned, although some did not (or were deceased).
</li><li> A weird variation: when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Doraemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Doraemon">Doraemon</a></em> was localized into English, that version was broadcast on Japanese TV primarily as a way to help Japanese viewers to learn English and familiarize them with American culture and its differences from Japanese culture. This version also had an alternate Japanese-language track with the regular seiyuu re-recording their respective roles.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBorrowerArrietty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBorrowerArrietty">The Borrower Arrietty</a></em> has two Latin American Spanish dubs, one produced by Disney made at Producciones Grande, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MexicoCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MexicoCity">Mexico City</a> and another one produced by Zima made at Elefante Films in Cuernavaca, Morelos. The Disney dub is available on streaming and in TV broadcasts. The Zima dub is only available on the Mexican DVD release. Both dubs have Arturo Casta&ntilde;eda and Miguel &Aacute;ngel Ruiz as Sh&#333; and Spiller, respectively.

In 2014, all of those movies were redubbed more faithfully to the Japanese scripts... maybe <em>too</em> faithfully, to the point that most of the dialogues keep Japanese grammar syntax and are filled with archaic wording, in order to give the watcher the feeling of watching Japanese people trying to speak Italian. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">It's not exactly appreciated by everyone.</a> A few of the original voice actors participated in both dubs, including three in <em>Totoro</em>, Sonia Scotti in <em>Spirited Away</em>, two in <em>Mononoke</em>, two in <em>Kiki</em> and three in <em>Castle in the Sky</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Golion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Golion">Golion</a></em> got dubbed in Italian both in its original form and as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Voltron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Voltron">Voltron</a></em>.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToonDisney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToonDisney">Jetix</a> dub was so detested by the Hungarian fans that when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Animax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Animax">Animax</a> picked up the show (or to be precise, its uncut Japanese version), they opted to start from scratch and kept only the voices that suited their characters best (such as Sasuke's). Well, until they had to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">recast</a> some of them, that is.
</li><li> It also received two Czech dubs; the first one for Jetix and the second one for Animax.
</li><li> It also received two Malay dubs. The former was dubbed by Filem Karya Nusa Sdn. Bhd. for TV3 Malaysia and the latter was dubbed by EmasKarya for Animax Asia. The voices from the latter dub returned for the spinoff <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RockLeesSpringtimeOfYouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RockLeesSpringtimeOfYouth">Naruto: Rock Lee &amp; His Ninja Pals</a> for airing on Disney XD Malaysia.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech">Robotech</a></em> has been dubbed into Latin American Spanish twice. Most Hispanic fans grew up with the original (which featured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JesusBarrero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JesusBarrero">Jes&uacute;s Barrero</a> as Rick and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatriciaAcevedo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatriciaAcevedo">Patricia Acevedo</a> as Lisa), and thus, hate the new dub with a passion.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em> ("<em>Samurai X</em>") and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em> was ran twice in Indonesia, each for a different TV station. In a rare case, the latter dubs are considerably inferior than the earlier ones, especially for <em>Kenshin</em> because it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationTrainWreck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationTrainWreck">translated from American translation</a>. As for <em>Sakura</em>... the earlier dub was exceedingly great (they got Sakura's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe">Moe</a> <em>right</em>!), that people can't help but feel that the latter dub (which did have issues) was a let-down.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Sailor Moon</em> has only one Italian dub for the main series, but the first movie has two Italian dubs, one by the same company as the series using the same cast, and a more faithful redub with a totally different cast. The company behind the redub planned to redo the main series, but the franchise's legal issues kicked in before they could release any more of their planned redub. When the series was reissued on DVD in 2010, the licensor confirmed that they considered redubbing the series from scratch, but couldn't afford it.
</li><li> Likewise, there are two Tagalog dubs of the <em>Sailor Moon</em> anime. One was used for the original release back in the 90s (With a Tagalized opening sang by then unknown Angelika Dela Cruz, who also was the 1st dub voice of the titular character), and the other is a more faithful redub for the recent reissue. Some fans believe it was only redubbed because the elements to the original Tagalog dub likely no longer exist.
</li><li> The series was also dubbed into Thai twice for likely the same reason as in the Philippines. Both Thai dubs use the same voice cast and script, but the new dub is considered better because of the higher recording standards, and the actors' experience in their roles.
</li><li> In addition, South Korea also has two dubs of <em>Sailor Moon</em>. The first dub was a straight-up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteTranslation">Cut-and-Paste Translation</a> with almost 50 episodes worth of content cut from the show. It puts the 90's-era English dub to shame in terms of editing (the Korean dub covered the whole series and STILL had fewer episodes than the English dub, which didn't even reach the last season). Korea got an uncut redub beginning in 2013, although with poorer voice actors.
</li><li> There are also reports of multiple dubs of <em>Sailor Moon</em> airing in mainland China, including one of the first movie being dubbed by a <em>local TV station</em>.
</li><li> Greece also has two dubs. One dub aired in the 90s and covered the whole series. The other aired in the early 2000s and covered seasons 1-2. It used the same script (complete with the same translation errors) and a new (lesser-received) voice cast. Like the Italian example, it was also canceled because the series' infamous legal issues.
</li><li> Poland got a second <em>voiceover</em> for the series (where one narrator reads all the dialogue with the original voices audible) in 2011, replacing the one from the 90s, but it wasn't until 2015 that any part of the series got a full proper Polish dub, beginning with the <em>R</em> movie.
</li><li> Russia first received <em>Sailor Moon</em> in the 90s with a <em>voiceover</em>-style dub with only a couple voice actors (and the Japanese audio still audible), but a proper redub with a full voice cast premiered on TV in 2018, although as per the norm with Russian dubs, the cast is still small <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToHimself">with only two male voice actors</a>.
</li><li> The first season of <em>Sailor Moon</em> was dubbed in Brazilian Portuguese in the 90s, but the rest of the series wasn't dubbed until years later with a different cast, to much controversy among fans. A DVD release was attempted in 2010, but it started with the S season because the dub masters for the <em>Classic</em> and <em>R</em> seasons is lost, and the release was canceled due to poor sales. A different company picked up the license in 2018 and plans on reissuing the series in 2019 with a brand new dub, with fans lobbying for the original voice cast from the <em>Classic</em> season.

After Disney bought Primer Plano's Argentine theatrical rights, they choose to release the film in cinemas with the Argentine dub instead of the Mexican dub. Since then, the Argentine dub is the more commonly seen of the two, being broadcast on TV, and released on DVD and on streaming services. The Mexican dub only aired on HBO and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">it's considered lost</a>.
</li><li> Several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioGhibli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioGhibli">Studio Ghibli</a> movies have two Brazilian Portuguese dubs, due to having different rights holders. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KikisDeliveryService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KikisDeliveryService">Kiki's Delivery Service</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MyNeighborTotoro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MyNeighborTotoro">My Neighbor Totoro</a></em> both have dubs exclusive to the Discovery Kids channel, made at the Vox Mundi studio in Sao Paulo. The former film was originally dubbed at Dublavideo (also in Sao Paulo), while the latter was dubbed at Double Sound in Rio de Janeiro.
<ul><li> When both movies premiered on Netflix, they were again re-dubbed at Vox Mundi with many of the same voice actors. <em>Spirited Away</em> was also re-dubbed, but at MGE Studios, with Selma Lopes (Yubaba/Zeniba) and Priscila Amorim (Chihiro's mother) reprising their roles. Haku was voiced by Felipe Drummond in the first dub, and by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeRelative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeRelative">his younger brother Eduardo</a> in the Netflix dub (which Felipe himself directed).
</li><li> The standard dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheCatReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheCatReturns">The Cat Returns</a></em> was made in Sao Paulo at the Sigma Studio; a dub made in Rio aired on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBO">HBO</a>, but is currently lost.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em> has two Hungarian dubbings: one made in 2004, the other in '06. Only Bat&ocirc;'s voice actor (Gabor Vass) stayed consistent between them.
</li><li> Filipino dubs are a strange case. When an anime finishes airing on one TV station, and eventually the station loses the rights to air it, a competing TV station will pick up the rights, and re-dub the show with its own cast, sometimes, even getting an actor from the previous dub to voice a different character.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> has two dubs: one for TV5 and one for Hero TV.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicKnightRayearth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicKnightRayearth">Magic Knight Rayearth</a></em> also has two dubs: one on ABS-CBN (The main trio's names are Luce (pronounced like Lucy), Marine and Anemone, and had a dubbed version of the opening) and the GMA version (which uses the original names and the original Japanese opening).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/MachineRobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/MachineRobo">Machine Robo</a> Rescue</em> has two Tagalog dubs too: One for GMA and one for Hero TV, the voices and dialogue are nearly identical.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersEnergon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersEnergon">Transformers Energon</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersCybertron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersCybertron">Transformers Cybertron</a></em> have two Hungarian dubs. The originals (produced by Mafilm Audio), debuting on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> in 2004 and 2005, had good casting, but were met with contempt due to the new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">name changes</a>. The second versions (BTI Studios), shown on Megamax in 2013 and 2014, use a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InconsistentDub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InconsistentDub">confusing mix</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers">Marvel comic</a> translations and the old dub names. Apart from a few returning voices, both of the new dubs have cheaper casts. <em>Energon</em>'s new dub also translated the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeSong">Theme Song</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ScienceNinjaTeamGatchaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ScienceNinjaTeamGatchaman">Science Ninja Team Gatchaman</a></em> has also had cases of multiple dubs in other countries, due to its already complicated adaptation situation:
<ul><li> A Spanish adaptation of "Battle of The Planets" (<em>La batalla de los planetas</em>) was released in 1980, though only 59 of the 85 episodes were dubbed (which was also the case for the French dub). An adaptation of the "G-Force" version was later released in the early '90s. There are also two dubs for the <em>Gatchaman</em> sequel series: A straight dub of Gatchaman II that aired in the early '90s on Antena 3, followed by an adaptation of Saban's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EagleRiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EagleRiders">Eagle Riders</a></em> version (<em>Comando Aguila</em>) that aired on the same network in the later portion of the '90s.
</li><li> France had a French adaptation of Eagle Riders, along with a compilation film adaptation of Gatchaman II titled "Gatchman, le Combat des Galaxies"
</li><li> Italy's dub of the original series was (mostly) adapted from "Battle of the Planets", although both sequel series were straight adaptations of Gatchaman II and Fighter. However, a dub of "Eagle Riders" was also later produced.
<ul><li> Although the Italian translators did use Sandy Frank's scripts for the first series, they opted for keeping the characters' original names, save for Jun becoming "Pretty Jane"/"Pretty Jun". This dub also did eventually use the final four Gatchaman episodes and the other sixteen skipped by Sandy Frank, although they broke "Battle of the Planets" continuity by suddenly having no Zark and using different title cards. Italy was able to acquire these episodes due to actually having licensed Gatchaman before Sandy Frank gained the worldwide distribution rights.
</li></ul></li><li> In an unusual case, South Korea had a straight-on adaptation of Gatchaman II, yet also had previously made a two-episode OVA summarizing the series with in-house Korean animation and altered designs (traced and recolored from the original cels). This OVA was later dubbed into Spanish as the movie "Heroes del Espacio", making yet another Spanish-language adaptation of Gatchaman II.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VoltesV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VoltesV">Voltes V</a></em> had a Tagalog dub in 1999, which aired on GMA. However, Hero TV later acquired the series for cable airing (Since GMA still owned the free TV airing rights) and produced their own dub in 2005, titling it <em>Voltes V Evolution</em>. It wound up a controversial decision, as Filipino celebrities were cast as the characters, causing older fans to feel disappointed by the voice changes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first season, the last 10 episodes of Season 2 and Season 3 were redubbed in Italian between 2009 and 2014, and aired in the summer of 2014. Many inconsistencies in the old dub were fixed (Kanto towns kept their English names during Seasons 1-2 and various attacks were translated differently than the games up until halfway Season 7 - except Thunderbolt which was corrected only in Season 11), they gave consistent VAs to the characters (not counting various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">voice changes</a> like Brock, Gary and Meowth, in the older dub every Officer Jenny/Nurse Joy had a different voice while now every Jenny has the same voice as the others, same for Joy), replaced the Italian openings with translated versions of the English ones and gave completely new voice actors to Misty and Giovanni (who now has <em>six</em> different Italian voices as a result). But on the other hand, this dub has some issues (like Cubone being called "Orphon", the name it had <em>in the Beta translation of Red/Blue</em>, for some reason). Bizarrely, while Alessandra Karpoff (Misty) was replaced by Benedetta Ponticelli in the redub, Karpoff returned for her cameo in <em>Sun &amp; Moon</em>.
</li><li> It also has two Hindi dubs. The first and best-known dub produced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CrestAnimationProductions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CrestAnimationProductions">Crest Animation Productions</a> and later Sound &amp; Vision India for Cartoon Network, and another one produced in-house by UTV Software Communications for Hungama TV. Some Indian fans were not happy that when the re-runs of the older episodes came, the voices have changed, much to their surprise. Also, Nachiket Dighe, who dubbed Tracey Sketchit, Chili and Reggie in the 2003 dub, returned in the 2014 dub as Ash Ketchum.
</li><li> For some unknown reasons, the episode "Hypno's Naptime" was dubbed into Norwegian twice. All the other episode only have one dub though.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> A number of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> episodes have two Hungarian dubs, but unlike most examples here, both were done by the same people, at the same time and based on AB Group's French dub, but only one version was ever released officially. Years after the series' cancellation, fans purchased much of the then-unaired episode dubs, many of which were non-finalized studio recordings that differed from what would have ended up on television. Some had certain lines missing and had bad audio quality, but when the series got re-aired in 2013/2014, it turned out the broadcast versions had their issues as well: episode 223 had some scenes where the French voices were still clearly audible, whereas the studio version didn't have this problem.
</li><li> The <em>Dragon Ball</em> movies have two Italian dubs each: at first they were voiced from a completely different voice cast with a script faithful to the original, and later got a second dub with the same voices and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerize">adaptations</a> from the regular series. Curiously, <em>Battle of Gods</em> and <em>Resurrection of F</em> are both voiced from the cast of the first dub of the older movies rather than the regular one. Many initially tought that it was done because Paolo Torrisi (the voice of Goku in the series) died, but the truth is that they wanted a dub faithful to the original version and so the "faithful dub" cast was prefered (Actually, Piccolo's voice from this other cast died too a year before and was replaced).
</li><li> <em>Dragon Ball</em> first aired in Italy in 1989, with a completely different cast than the movies and the redub.
</li><li> The original little-known Latin American dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> lasted only 50 episodes, and was based off the US Harmony Gold dub of the series (which itself is pretty obscure, having only actually dubbed 5 episodes out of the 50 or so that were translated). The other one is better known and received.
</li><li> The Harmony Gold version itself was adapted into a few languages, and a couple even call Goku "Zero" to this day.
</li><li> <em>Dragon Ball</em> also has two Brazilian Portuguese dubs: Gota Magica (which aired on SBT and cable), and Alamo/DPN (which aired on Globo, cable and DVD). The latter dub contains most of the franchise's standard voices. While some of the actors appear in both dubs; only Mario Jorge Montini (Umigame) and Marcelo Campos (General Blue) kept their characters.
</li><li> When <em>Battle of Gods</em> was released in Brazil, the film got two Portuguese dubs. One was done at the Clone studio for DVD, while the other was done at the Unidub studio with most of the anime cast. The Clone dub is often considered to be just as bad as the dub for <em>Dragon Ball Kai</em>, as many of the series actors were not available.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuperBroly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuperBroly">Dragon Ball Super: Broly</a></em> has two Latin Spanish dubs for some bizarre reason: one produced in Mexico by Labo with the regular cast for the <em>Dragon Ball</em> anime dubs plus some Startalents, and one in Argentina by Palmera Record.
<ul><li> There are also two Italian dubs: one made for cinemas and one for TV, with the DVD/Blu-Ray release featuring both audio tracks. The two dubs have the exact same cast, with the main difference being that the first one is faithful to the original while the second features the same adaptation changes as the main series (so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">Piccolo is called Junior</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerize">Beerus is referred as a Lord of Destruction rather than a God</a>, etc.)
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira">AKIRA</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Akira</em> has two German dubs, one in 1991 and one in 2005.
</li><li> <em>Akira</em> also has three Brazilian Portuguese dubs. One was released on VHS from the &Aacute;lamo studio. Another was done at the Capric&oacute;rnio studio for cable TV. The third was done by Mastersound for the film's DVD release. Both the cable and DVD dubs feature Guilherme Lopes as the colonel.
</li><li> The film was also dubbed into Latin Spanish three times: twice in Mexico, and once in Argentina. The most circulated dub is the second Mexican dub, which originally aired on the long-defunct Locomotion channel. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IrwinDaayan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IrwinDaayan">Irwin Daay&aacute;n</a> voiced Shotaro in both Mexican dubs.
</li><li> The film also has three European Spanish dubs: 1992 for theatrical release, 2002 for DVD, and 2004 for a DVD re-release. Interestingly, both DVD's also contain the original dub. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlbertTrifolSegarra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlbertTrifolSegarra">Albert Trifol Segarra</a> voiced Tetsuo in the first and third dubs.
</li><li> The film has two Italian dubs. The first one (made in 1992) was wildly inaccurate, as it was based on the American version. The redub was made in 2018 for the movie's 30th anniversary, based on the Japanese version.
</li></ul></li><li> This was particularly endemic with any anime from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SabanEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SabanEntertainment">Saban Entertainment</a> that had been dubbed before they picked up the rights. In some cases, the shows were not dubbed in that country, but for the most part they were. As examples:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheLittlBits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheLittlBits">The Littl' Bits</a></em> was dubbed twice in French (<em>Lutinette et Lutinou</em> / <em>Les lutins de la for&ecirc;t</em>) and Spanish (<em>Belfy y Lillibit</em> / <em>Los Bits</em>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HoneybeeHutch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HoneybeeHutch">Honeybee Hutch</a></em> was dubbed twice in French (<em>Le petit prince orphelin</em> / <em>Micky l'abeille</em>), Spanish (<em>Jos&eacute; Miel</em> / <em>La abejita Hutch</em>) and Italian (<em>L'ape Mag&agrave;</em> / <em>Un alveare d'avventure per l'ape Mag&agrave;</em>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HakushonDaimao" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HakushonDaimao">Hakushon Daimao</a></em> was dubbed three times in Spanish (<em>Yam Yam y el genio</em> / <em>Bob embotellado</em> / <em>La familia genio</em>) and twice in Portuguese (<em>G&ecirc;nio maluco</em> / <em>Bob o g&ecirc;nio</em>).
</li><li> <em>Jungle Tales</em> was dubbed three times in Norwegian (<em>Jungelpatruljen &#150; Jungelens helter</em>). Two of them were made for the VHS releases, while one was made for broadcast on Fox Kids. The first VHS dub is considered to be the worst for its amateurish voice acting.
</li><li> <em>Saban's Adventures of the Little Mermaid</em> have two Norwegian dubs. The first one was for VHS and was basically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HongKongDub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HongKongDub">Hong Kong Dub</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSongRemainsTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSongRemainsTheSame">did left the theme song in English</a>, the second one were made for airing on Fox Kids and were of better quality, did dub the theme song and is fondly remembered.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Kaibutsu-kun</em> was dubbed into Hindi twice. There's the Pogo TV dub and the current Hungama TV dub.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> was dubbed twice into European Spanish: A DVD dub that covered only the first 25 episodes; and a TV dub that aired on Antena 3 (covering over 400 episodes). Jonatan Lopez voiced Shinichi Kudo in both versions (until episode 80, when the TV dub moved from Barcelona to Madrid). The TV dub had two dubs of episode 80 (one in Madrid, and one in Barcelona).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon">Doraemon</a></em>:
<ul><li> The 1979 anime was dubbed into Italian twice. The first dub aired on Rai 2 in 1983, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">changed the names of most of the characters</a>. The second dub was produced in 2003 by Mediaset and aired on Italia 1, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop">then later moved to Boing and Hiro</a>. Due to the huge popularity of the second dub, Mediaset would later dub the movie <em>Doraemon: Nobita's Dinosaur 2006</em> (<em>Doraemon: Il dinosauro di Nobita</em>) and the 2005 anime into Italian using the same voice actors, except for Sewashi's voice actor who was replaced with Nobita's voice actor, Davide Garbolino.
</li><li> The 1979 anime was originally dubbed into Mexican Spanish in 1981-82 by SISSA - Oruga. This dub is now long-lost, and a better-known dub was made in 1999 at Sonomex and Candiani.
</li><li> The 1979 anime of Doraemon also had two Castilian Spanish and European Portuguese dubs. The dubs are made by LUK International S.A.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Ojarumaru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Ojarumaru">Ojarumaru</a></em> was dubbed into Cantonese twice. There's the TVB dub and the Cable TV Hong Kong dub. Both dubs had dubbed the same amount of episodes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn">K-On!</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>K-On</em> was dubbed in Malay twice. There's the NTV7 dub and the Animax dub. The latter covered both seasons.
</li><li> It also received two Cantonese dubs. There's the TVB dub and the Animax dub.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DrSlump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DrSlump">Dr. Slump</a></em> has two Italian dubs. The first one was done in the 80's and covered only a small bunch of episodes. The second dub, released in 2003-2004, uses the same cast of voices that did the 90's remake series and covered the entire series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> was dubbed dubbed in Italian twice. The first one aired on television in the 80s and was changed quite a bit from the original Japanese version. For example, Amuro Ray was renamed Peter Ray and Char was called Scia. The second dub was by d/visual and released on DVD. This dub was more faithful to the Japanese version.
</li><li> 1969 anime film <em>Flying Phantom Ship</em> (Soratobu Yuureisen) was one of the first anime films to be dubbed into Russian and shown in the USSR. It has three dubs.
<ul><li> The first one made in the Soviet Union was slightly censored with some scenes being cut, some redrawn and some dialogue changed, which shortened the movie by 3 minutes and 38 seconds. Nevertheless the soviet dubs back then were of realy high quality in terms of voice-acting and Flying Phantom Ship wasn't an exeption.
</li><li> Since then the movie got a new full translation made by MC Entertainment without any changes to the source material, albeit it was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceoverTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceoverTranslation">voiceover translation</a> with more poor quality voices.
</li><li> The third dub was made in 2009 by Reanimedia, well-known to many russian anime-fans by their high quality of dubbing and localiztion, this time getting a dub which, unlike the MC Entertainment one, was able to compete with the soviet version in terms of quality, featuring actual theatrical actors.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> has two French dubs. The first dub only covered the first 52 episodes, while the second dub (made in Belgium) covers the whole series.

The TV dub generally used newer actors, while the DVD dub got as much of the original cast as they could.
<ul><li> The four original movies have two Italian dubs. One keeps the voice cast from the anime dub, while the second uses completely different voice actors and is more faithful to the original.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MayaTheBee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MayaTheBee">Maya the Bee</a></em> has 3 different European Portuguese dubs.
<ul><li> The first dub was televised by RTP and aired in the late 1970's. It was the only dub to air on television. It uses a different instrumental for the theme, and all episodes were dubbed.
</li><li> The second dub was produced by Prisvideo (currently known as Pris Audiovisuais) and was released on VHS in 1996 and DVD in 2003. 30 episodes were released across 6 DVD's.
</li><li> The third dub was produced by RBA in 2008. Flip (Carlos Macedo) and Willy's (Peter Micheal) voices from the second dub were carried over to this dub.
</li></ul></li><li> The first two seasons of the 90s Anime version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoomins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoomins">The Moomins</a></em> have two Norwegian dubs each. The first one was made for airing on the channel NRK and was latter released on DVD. The second one was made for VHS and done by Salut Audio &amp; Video APS. The TV dub was more consistent with the voices while the VHS dub <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">did have the characters change their voice actors alot</a>.

DVD/Blu-Ray releases have the three different dubs, while other airings alternate: Pay TV channel Man-Ga uses the first dub, Netflix the second and Italia 2 the third.
</li><li> There are two Cantonese Chinese dubs of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Tamagotchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Tamagotchi">Tamagotchi</a></em> with different voice actors; one airs on ViuTV while the other is broadcast by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TVB" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TVB">TVB</a>. There are a few differences between the dubs besides the voice actors as well, such as their titles (the TVB version is called &#23541;&#29289;&#21453;&#26007;&#26143; [<em>Ch&#466;ngw&ugrave; f&#462;n d&#466;u x&#299;ng</em>] and the ViuTV version is called &#20182;&#23229;&#21733;&#27744; [<em>T&#257;m&#257;g&#275;ch&iacute;</em>]) and Himespetchi's catchphrase "Gigakyun!" not appearing in the ViuTV dub.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> had three Italian dubs. The first one was the original. The second one was released in 2019 for the Netflix release, and was retired after a week because of its poor reception due to the dialogue adapter (Gualtiero Cannarsi, the same behind the Studio Ghibli dubs as said above) and his obsession for overly literal translations that often result in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation">complete nonsensical dialogue</a>. A third dub was released in 2020, this time based on the script for the 2019 English redub, which was better recieved (except for the fact that "Berserk" is mispronounced as "Bersherk").
<ul><li> On the same folder, the <em>Death and Rebirth</em> and <em>End of Evangelion</em> movies got <em>four dubs</em>. The first one was done in 2005 and had almost all the cast of the main series dub reprising their roles, except for the voice actors for Misato, Kaworu and Shigeru Aoba. The movies were then redubbed in 2009 in between the release of the first two <em>Rebuild</em> movies, this time with the entire original cast. And then there are the two Netflix dubs as for the main series.

As an example, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WalkingWithDinosaurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WalkingWithDinosaurs">Walking with Dinosaurs</a></em> and its sequels got many different dubs in Hungary, the record being held by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WalkingWithBeasts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WalkingWithBeasts">Walking with Beasts</a></em>: One dub for the VHS release, another one for the TV debut, and a third for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiscoveryChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiscoveryChannel">Discovery Channel</a> cut. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InconsistentDub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InconsistentDub">All completely different.</a> Notably, each version changed the series title.

<ul><li> Same thing with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFutureIsWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFutureIsWild">The Future Is Wild</a></em>. The version that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnimalPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnimalPlanet">Animal Planet</a> aired (along with all its recuts) got dubbed independently from its "more official" broadcast on a public service TV station (whose translations found their way into the book of the series).
</li></ul></li><li> <em>OceanWorld 3D</em> was originally dubbed in Italian by the comedic trio Aldo, Giovanni and Giacomo. The dub was poorly recieved, since it turned a serious documentary about the extinction risk of sealife into a comedic farce. The DVD/Blu-Ray edition redubbed it in a more serious way, albeit keeping the original one as an alternative audio track.
</li><li> The Hungarian science channels Spektrum and OzoneNetwork often broadcast documentaries produced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheHistoryChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheHistoryChannel">The History Channel</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiscoveryChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiscoveryChannel">Discovery Channel</a>, which means many of these end up with two or three dubs.

<ul><li> Disney just loves this trope overseas:
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</em> was dubbed in Italian three times: once in 1938, again in 1972, and a third time in the early 1990's. The 1938 dub had rhyming dialogue, and is quite interesting to watch, even for non-Italian viewers. However, that style of dubbing went out of fashion and the more straightforwardly-dubbed 1972 version is the only one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">officially</a> available today. The 90's dub was made for a bootleg VHS release.
</li><li> The film has also been dubbed in Latin American Spanish three times: in 1938 (Los Angeles), 1964, and 2001 (both Mexico). Of the three, the 1964 one is considered the best and the classic (supposedly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney">Walt Disney</a> himself really liked this dub). The 2001 dub was made due to Lupita P&eacute;rez Arias (the singing voice of Snow White in the 1964 dub), having sued Disney for not paying the royalties on the use of her voice. After her death in 2005, the 1964 dub has occasionally aired on TV since 2010, with certain channels often switching between this and the 2001 dub. Interestingly, Francisco Colmenero appeared in both Mexican dubs: as Happy in the 1964 dub, and as the narrator in 2001. The dwarves' names weren't translated in the first two dubs.
<ul><li> Spain produced its own dub in 2001 because of the lawsuit.
</li></ul></li><li> It also received three German dubs; the original in 1938, one in 1966 and the current one in 1994. The second dub tries to be more "child-friendly", while the third dub actually caused controversy.
</li><li> It also has three French dubs; the original from 1938, another from 1962, and the current from 2001. The reason why Snow White was fully redubbed in 2001 was because Lucie Dol&egrave;ne (who voiced Snow White in the 1962 French dub) sued Disney over the copyright of her voice and won, instead of her part being redubbed (like with the French dubs of The Jungle Book and Beauty and the Beast), Snow White was redubbed.
</li><li> The film was also redubbed in Danish in 1980.
</li><li> The film also had three Japanese dubs: the first from 1957, the second from 1980, and the third from 2007. Only the 1980 dub is considered official, since the others were made by independent studios. The 2007 dub was made for the public domain only and isn't released to home media.
</li><li> It was also redubbed into Swedish in the early 1980's.
</li><li> In the Netherlands, the film was originally dubbed into Dutch in 1938 and again in 1984. The 1984 version received a partial redub in 1992, with Snow White and the Dwarfs' voices left un-changed. There was also a soundtrack dubbing in 1973 for a storybook adaptation, resulting in a total of three and a half Dutch dubs.
</li><li> There are also three Finnish dubs; one in 1962, one in 1982, and one in 1994. The 1962 dub only dubbed the speaking parts; the songs were used from the 1938 Swedish version.
</li><li> It also received two Hungarian dubs; the first was done in 1962 and the second was done in 2001.
</li><li> It was also dubbed into Brazilian Portuguese twice: the first from 1938, and again in 1965. The 1938 dub is long lost (only recordings of the songs are known to exist), while the 1965 dub is the official version currently being used.
</li><li> The film also had two Thai dubs. Both versions are nearly the same, though Snow White, the Prince, and Grumpy have different actors in the second dub.
</li><li> There are two Polish dubs: one from 1938 and the other from 2009, which was probably made because the first dub was filled with outdated language. Plus, the quality of the original dub made some words hard to understand.
</li><li> It also received two Norwegian dubs, one from 1983 and again in 1994. Unn Vibeke Hol voiced Snow White in both dubs.
</li><li> It was also dubbed into Albanian twice: once in 2000 for TV (with the songs left in English) and again in 2005.
</li><li> The film has two Putonghua dubs: the first (unofficial) for VHS and the second (official) for TV. While the VHS dub left the songs in English, the TV dub re-used the songs from the Mandarin Chinese dub.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pinocchio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pinocchio">Pinocchio</a></em>:
<ul><li> There are four Japanese dubs: one in 1958, the second in 1983, the third in 1986, and the fourth in 2007. The second dub was revised in 1995, replacing Pinocchio's voice actor.
</li><li> The film was also dubbed into German twice. The original was done in 1951 and the new one from 1973. While the original dub is currently lost, the latter one tries to be more "child-friendly". Georg Thomalla voiced Jiminy Cricket in both dubs.
</li><li> It was also re-dubbed into Swedish in 1995.
</li><li> There are also three French dubs; one in the 1940's with New York actors, one in 1946 and one in 1975. The 1975 version received partial revisions in 1995 (to revert the original French name of Jiminy "Grillon" ("Cricket" in French) to Jiminy Cricket as the original) and 2003 (re-dubbing a line from Lampwick). The 2009 Platinum Edition DVD, while mostly containing the 1975 dub, oddly uses "When You Wish Upon a Star" from the original 1946 dub and leaves the mentions of "Jiminy Grillon" intact, but keeps the 2003 redub of Lampwick's line.
</li><li> It was also dubbed into Brazilian Portuguese twice; the first was done in the 40s, and again in 1966.
</li><li> It also recived two Hungarian dubs, the original from 1962 and the second (and current) from 1999.
</li><li> It was dubbed into Danish three times, the first from 1950, the second from 1978. In 1995, the second dub was partially re-dubbed, replacing Pinocchio's voice.
</li><li> It also had two Dutch dubs, the first from 1949 and the second from 1995.
</li><li> The 1947 Italian version of the film was given a partial redub in 1963 to the song "When You Wish Upon a Star" due to the previous version being in low quality. Subsequent releases, since 1993, retain the original 1947 version.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Dumbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Dumbo">Dumbo</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Dumbo</em> received two Latin American Spanish dubs. The original dub was made in 1942 for Argentina, and the second dub was made for Mexico in 1969. Interestingly, the 1942 Argentinian dub has the Song of the Roustabouts left in English, though TV airings in Spain used this dub with the 1969 version of the song. Coincidentally, the 1969 Mexican dub recycled the brief Clown song from the 1942 version.
</li><li> It was also dubbed into German twice; the original dub from 1952 was distributed by RKO, and the current dub from 1976 was directed by Heinrich Riethm&uuml;ller.
</li><li> The film was also dubbed into Brazilian Portuguese three times: once in 1941, again in 1973, and the third in 1998. After the third dub was commissioned, the 1973 dub has occasionally aired on the Disney Channel and was released a couple of times on DVD and Blu-Ray in certain European regions, until a European Portuguese dub was made for the film's 70th anniversary release in 2010.
</li><li> It was also received two Hungarian dubs; the first in 1989 and the second in 1991. Curiously, both dubs used nearly the same voice actors, except for a few minor characters.
</li><li> The film also has four Japanese dubs: the original theatrical dub from 1954, a television dub from 1979 (partially re-dubbed in 1981 for NHK), a 1983 theatrical re-release dub (which later aired on WOWOW during the 1990s), and a 1985 dub used for all home video releases of the film in Japan.
</li><li> It also was dubbed into Swedish three times: first in 1946, again in 1972 by Doreen Denning, and the third time in 1996 by Monica Forsberg. Interestingly, the 1946 dubbing was made in the USA with Swedish-Americans. Also, the first DVD release with the 1996 re-dub incorrectly lists the 1946 voice credits at the end.
</li><li> It was given two French dubs as well; once in 1947 and again in 1980. Canadian VHS releases used the original 1947 dub until 2001, while European VHS releases began using the redub beginning in 1991.
</li><li> It was also dubbed into Czech three times: The first was done for its theatrical release in 1970, the second was made for TV Nova in 1994, and the current was done for home media in 2000.

</li><li> The film also got two German dubs; the original one from 1950 and again in 1973.
</li><li> It also received two Finnish dubs; the first in 1969 and the current in 2005.
</li><li> The movie was also dubbed into French three times: in 1945, 1978, and 1993. G&eacute;rard Hernandez voiced the owl in both redubs.
</li><li> In Hungary, the film was given two dubs; once in 1961 and again in 1993.
</li><li> It also had two Italian dubs; the first in 1948 and the second in 1968. Gianfranco Bellini participated in both dubs, as adult Bambi in the original and Flower in the second.
</li><li> It was also dubbed into Japanese twice; once in 1957 and again in 1993.
</li><li> In Poland, the movie was dubbed twice; the original in 1961 and the current in 1999 (this one wasn't released until 2005).
</li><li> The movie had three Brazilian Portuguese dubs: the first from 1943, the second from 1969 by Riosom, and the current from 1991 by the Delart studio. Since the first two dubs are lost, only Delart's dub is currently available. The 1969 and 1991 dubs were both directed and translated by Telmo de Avelar, while Aloysio de Oliveira translated the songs.
</li><li> It was also re-dubbed into Swedish in 1986.
</li><li> It also received two Hindi dubs; the first one was made produced by Main Frame Software Communications for Disney Channel India and the other for another channel and home video by Sound &amp; Vision India.
</li><li> There are also two Albanian dubs and two Dutch dubs.

<ul><li> There are three Japanese dubs. For the film version, the original dub was made around 1984/85 and released to VHS and laserdisc, while the third dub was made for the Disney Channel in the 1990s. The second dub was made in 1991 to the featurette versions ("Bongo" and "Mickey and the Beanstalk").
</li><li> It was also dubbed into French two (and a half) times; once in 1950 and again in 1993 (for the featurette versions) and 1998 (for the film version). In the original French dub, the "Mickey and the Beanstalk" segment was censored for unknown reasons. About 10 minutes were removed and the end was even fully cut, therefore making the movie somewhat confusing.
</li><li> The German version is a bit complex:
<ul><li> The "Mickey and the Beanstalk" segment was dubbed first in 1966, but heavily edited to remove the narration sequences. With the exceptions of Susanne Tremper as the Harp (who also re-dubbed Snow White in the same year) and Gernot Duda as Willie, the original dub for this cartoon is also rather weak. All of Donald's dialogue remains in English, a few scenes of the cartoon are shown without the accompanying narration, the second half of the song "My, What a Happy Day" is cut and part of the song "Eat Until I Die" is left un-dubbed without any voices.
</li><li> The "Bongo" segment was then dubbed in the 1970s. While all the songs were left in English (with the exception of "I'm a Happy-Go-Lucky Fellow"), a 1990s TV special, "Jiminy Crickets Rezept f&uuml;r's Leben" (which translates to "Jiminy Cricket's Recipe for Life") has them dubbed.
</li><li> The original 1966/1970s dubbing for both shorts can be found on a 1980s VHS cartoon compilation also featuring the original 1950s German dub of the short "Ben &amp; Me".
</li><li> The entire film version was later dubbed in 1992, with the narration for "Bongo" being kept intact from the original version (though the segment's songs are agan left in English, despite having been dubbed in the aforementioned TV special).
</li></ul></li><li> It also received two-and-a-half Italian dubs; starting with the original dub for the film in 1952, which was released to VHS twice in the 1980s and again in 1997. Then, there's the 1992 dub for the stand-alone version of "Mickey and the Beanstalk" with Ludwig Van Drake. Finally, there's the 2003 DVD dub, which is entirely the same as the 1952 dub, but for the "Beanstalk" segment, re-uses the voices from the 1992 dub of the stand-alone version. The only elements from the 1952 dub that are kept for this segment are a few scenes that have Edgar Bergen's narration overlapping, such as "My, What a Happy Day" (although the Harp's one speaking line and second song, "My Favorite Dream" are still used from the re-dub) and a few lines from Willie (notably his dialogue in the entire ending scene where he lifts Bergen's roof, searching for Mickey).
</li><li> It also has four Brazilian Portuguese dubs: the first from 1949, the second by Herbert Richers from the 1980s, the third by S&amp;C Produ&ccedil;&otilde;es Art&iacute;sticas from 1993, and the fourth by Double Sound in 1999. Interestingly, all that remains of the 1949 dub are the songs (which appeared in Richers' version). The 1993 dub was made to the Ludwig Von Drake "Mickey and the Beanstalk" segment only.
</li><li> The original Norwegian version from the 1950s was partially re-dubbed in 2004, replacing the voices of Mickey, Donald, Goofy, and Willie.
</li><li> The film was also partially re-dubbed into Swedish for the 2004 DVD and VHS release, with Jiminy Cricket's frame story and the <em>Bongo</em> segment keeping the original dub from 1950 directed by Per-Axel Branner, whereas <em>Mickey and the Beanstalk</em> was given a new dub. The full original dub can be found on a rental VHS tape released in 1985.

<ul><li> <em>Cinderella</em> had two Latin American Spanish dubs; the original was done in 1950, and the second in 1997. The redub was made due to a royalty dispute between Evangelina Elizondo and Disney because of the copyrights of her voice. That's also why Spain dubbed it that year.
</li><li> The German dub received a partial redub in 1992. Originally the opening narrator was Erika G&ouml;rner, the voice of Drizella, but in 1992 the narrator is a man. The main change they made was to explain that Cinderella is the English name of Aschenputtel (German for Cinderella) and thus she is called Cinderella in the film. Otherwise the film remains unchanged.
</li><li> It also received two French dubs; once in 1950 and again in 1991.
</li><li> It was also dubbed into Dutch twice.
</li><li> The film also had two Swedish dubs, with the latter being done in 1967 (only 17 years after the original). <em>Probably</em> because the Swedish language had changed too much in this lapse of time. Interestingly, Sif Ruud voiced the Fairy Godmother in both dubbings (with her also doing the voice of the narrator in the current dub).
</li><li> It was also dubbed into Japanese twice. The first was done in 1961 and again in 1992.
</li><li> It also had two Finnish dubs; one in 1967 and the second in 1992. There was also a "Read and Listen" storybook cassette dubbing released in 1984.
</li><li> The movie was also re-dubbed in Italian in 1967. The re-dub is considered a significant improvement over the original 1950 version. It is also the first Disney film to receive an Italian re-dub.
</li><li> It received two Slovak dubs as well; once in 1970 and again in 2012. Interestingly, O&#318;ga &#138;alagov&aacute;, who voiced Anastasia in the first dub, returned as the voice of the Fairy Godmother for the second dub.
</li><li> The original 1961 Polish version was also re-dubbed in 2012.
</li><li> It was also dubbed into Czech twice: the original in 1970 and and the current in 2005. Hana Talpov&aacute; voiced the Fairy Godmother in both dubs.

<ul><li> 'Alice in Wonderland'' received two French dubs. The original was made in 1951 and the new one was made in 1974. For late-90s re-issues of the movie, a weird mix mistake appeared in the 1974 re-dub, in which it used the 1951 version of the song "Painting the Roses Red". This was corrected in later releases.
</li><li> It was also re-dubbed into Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish in 1998.
</li><li> It was also dubbed into Brazilian Portuguese twice; once in 1951 for theatrical release/home video, and again in 1991 for the SBT channel. SBT's dub <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSongRemainsTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSongRemainsTheSame">leaves all the songs in English</a>.
</li><li> The film was originally dubbed into Japanese in 1973 and aired on TBS (Tokyo Broadcasting System) in 1979 and 1981. The 2nd and more common dub was made in 1984, which later received two partial redubs (once in 1990 and again in 2005). The 1990 version only re-dubbed certain songs, while the 2005 version received a lot more translation corrections and changes in names, dialogue, and lyrics. Most of the characters in the 2005 edit have the same voice actors from the original 1984 version, except for the Dodo.

<ul><li> <em>Peter Pan</em> was dubbed into Hungarian twice. While the first was done sometime in the 1980s, the current was done in 1998.
</li><li> It was also re-dubbed in Swedish and French twice; both languages were originally dubbed in 1953, and again in 1992.
<ul><li> Both French dubs have Jean-Henri Chambois as Captain Hook and Henri Labussi&egrave;re as the small pirate.
</li></ul></li><li> The film was also re-dubbed into Italian in 1986. The Italian Blu-Ray release of the movie includes both audio tracks, and so <em>Peter Pan</em> is the only Disney movie whose Italian dubs are both available at the same time.
</li><li> It also has two Thai dubs: the first from the 1990s and the second from 2003.
</li><li> The movie was also dubbed into Japanese four times: the first from 1963, the second from 1982/83 for TBS, the third from 1984 for VHS and laserdisc, and the current from 1992.
</li><li> Like <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, the film received a TV-exclusive dub into Brazilian Portuguese in the 1990s.
</li><li> It was also dubbed into Norwegian twice.
</li><li> It also had two Danish dubs, the first from 1953 and the second from 1998.
</li><li> It was also dubbed into Finnish twice, the first from 1969, and the second from 1992.

<ul><li> <em>Lady and the Tramp</em> was dubbed into Danish twice; once in 1956 and again in 1996.
</li><li> There are also two Italian dubs. The first from 1955 and the redub from 1997. The 1997 version was widely criticized by fans and is considered to be the worst of Disney's Italian re-dubs. Because of this, fans wrote a petition to bring back the original 1955 dub, which has been retained since the 2006 DVD release.
</li><li> It was also dubbed into German twice; the original one from 1956 and the new one from 1968. Harry W&uuml;stenhagen voiced Tramp in both dubs.
</li><li> It was also re-dubbed into Latin Spanish in 1997. The Latin dub was commissioned either because of a lawsuit from Peggy Lee (the English voice of Darling and the Siamese Cats), or from Roberto Espriu (the Latin voice of Tramp).
</li><li> The film also received three French dubs: in 1955, 1989, and 1997. In Quebec, only the 1955 and 1997 dubs were released, while the 1955 dub was never released on VHS in France.
</li><li> It was also dubbed into Japanese twice; the first in 1956 and the second in 1989.
</li><li> It also had two Polish dubs; once in 1962 and again in 1995.
</li><li> The movie was dubbed twice into Brazilian Portuguese. The original dub was produced in Los Angeles, and the second was made in Rio de Janeiro in 1997. Since then, the original dub occasionally airs on TV. In the first dub, Aloysio de Oliveira and Rosina Pag&atilde; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToHimself">voiced half of the characters</a>.
</li><li> It also received a Swedish redub in 1989, with Olof Thunberg reprising his role as Trusty.
</li><li> It was also dubbed into Greek twice: 1975 and 1997.
</li><li> It was dubbed into Czech twice, the first from 1974 and the second from 1997. The reason why the second dub was created was because the royalties for first dub were too high. Also, Inka &#138;ecov&aacute; who voiced Lady in the first dub, returned as the speaking voice of Peg for the second dub.
</li><li> It also had two Finnish dubs, the first from 1966, and the second from 1984.

<ul><li> To the disappointment of many viewers, the film was re-dubbed into Latin Spanish in 2001 from its original 1959 dub. The original dub was loved by many viewers. It's another dub that Walt Disney himself is said to have approved of before his death. The 2001 dub was commissioned for the same reason as <em>Snow White</em>: Lupita P&eacute;rez Arias (Aurora's singing voice) sued Disney over royalties for her work. The new dub is often considered a disappointment for simply not living up to the original, and for sounding lifeless and stale. Also, some of Maleficent's lines were revised because the language was apparently inappropriate for the audience.
</li><li> It was also dubbed into Polish twice; the first was done in 1962 and the second in 1995.
</li><li> French too. The 1981 dub is considered a significant improvement over the original 1959 version.
</li><li> It was also dubbed into Japanese twice: 1960 and 1995.
</li><li> It was also given two Swedish dubs, once in 1959 and again in 1980.
</li><li> The film also had two Hungarian dubs; the first was done in 1966 and the second was done in 1995.
</li><li> It also received two Dutch dubs, with the current being done in 1996.

</li><li> The film also had two Polish dubs; the original from 1969 and the newer from sometime during the late 90s. Similar to the original Finnish version, Archimedes is a female in the 1969 dub.
</li><li> For the Swedish version, an audio mistake appeared on subsequent home video releases of the film beginning in the 1990s. The original version (as well as the first VHS release from the 1980s) also dubbed the final chorus singing "Hail king Arthur, Long live the king!" at the end of the film, but later releases used an instrumental version instead.

<ul><li> There are two Brazilian Portuguese dubs; the first was done in 1968, while the second was done for its 2014 Blu-Ray release using the same translation. Bagheera, Hathi, Kaa and Shere Khan's voice actors reprised their roles from the 2003 sequel in the redub. Also, all of the songs have been noticeably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutoTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutoTune">autotuned</a> in the redub.
</li><li> Before the film was dubbed into Dutch in 1979, there was a soundtrack dubbing in 1969, made for LP. This version was re-released for CD in 1992.
</li><li> It was also dubbed into Finnish twice; the original one from 1968 (by Reino B&auml;ckman) and the new one from 1993 (by Pekka Lehtosaari). Interestingly, the dubbing directors for both dubs also voiced Baloo, while the original 1968 version has Bagheera voiced by a woman.
</li><li> The film was re-dubbed into Japanese in 1994, while extracts of the original 1968 dub can be found on the Sing-Along Song releases of "You Can Fly" and "The Bare Necessities".
</li><li> It was also given two Czech dubs; the first in 1975 and the second in 1994. Ji&#345;&iacute; Jel&iacute;nek voiced King Louie in both dubs.
</li><li> The French version of "My Own Home" was re-recorded in 1997 with Claire Guyot (the voice of Ariel) replacing Lucie Dol&egrave;ne who had sued Disney France for the copyrights on her voice, and won. Guyot, who was unaware of this at first, later told that she would've have never agreed to do so knowingly. Subsequent releases, since 2007, retain the original 1968 version, though North American releases still use Guyot's version.

</li><li> It also received three Persian dubs. One in 1976, a second in 1981, and the third made around 2010. George Petrossi voiced the title role in the latter two dubs.

<ul><li> This movie has an interesting case with this trope: in most countries, the first dubs cover the original featurette versions ("Honey Tree", "Blustery Day", and "Tigger Too"), with the second dub covering the compilation film version.
</li><li> For example, the Swedish version had all three shorts dubbed first (1967, 1969, and 1977 respectively), and then (re-)dubbed together for <em>The Many Adventures</em> in 1992.
</li><li> The same case goes for the Italian version: with the film version being dubbed in 1997. Interestingly, "Honey Tree" and "Blustery Day" were originally dubbed theatrically in 1967 and 1970 (and released on VHS in 1982 and 1983) respectively, while "Tigger Too" had a direct-to-VHS dub in 1986.
</li><li> Likewise to the Danish version, with the <em>Many Adventures</em> film being dubbed in the 1990s. The original dubbing of the shorts were never released to VHS though, although the 1966 dub of "Honey Tree" was released on LP.
</li><li> For the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGSBK1Jz8Hs">original Finnish dub of the shorts<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, "Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree" is the only one to exist, having only two actors (Ritva Lehtel&auml; and Reino B&auml;ckman) providing the voices for all of the characters. (The full dub can be heard on the LP soundtrack.) No other information is known about "Blustery Day" or "Tigger Too", except that the former was dubbed in 1969. The "Many Adventures" compilation film was later dubbed by Pekka Lehtosaari in 1997, and used for all Finnish home video releases.
</li><li> For the German version: the three shorts were originally dubbed in 1967, 1971, and 1975. Afterwards, the "Many Adventures" film version was later dubbed in 1994 for TV and later released to home video, beginning in 1997/98.
<ul><li> Curiously, the original German dubs of the featurettes made Rabbit and Roo females. (The redub corrects this, interestingly keeping the theme song from the original dubs, albeit with a few lines changed.) Also, Erich Kestin (who voiced Pooh in the 1967 version of "The Honey Tree") died before "The Blustery Day" was dubbed four years later. In order to maintain continuity, Walter Gross, who later voiced Pooh in <em>Blustery Day</em> and <em>Tigger Too</em>, re-dubbed said character for "The Honey Tree" in 1971. (The same 1971 edit also replaced the original voice for Christopher Robin for unknown reasons.) The original 1971-75 German dubs were last released on VHS in 1995, as part of the "Kinderbuch-Klassiker" series (the German equivalent of the "Storybook Classics" series in the USA) along with "A Day for Eeyore" (newly dubbed at the time).
</li></ul></li><li> Also the same case with the Brazilian Portuguese version. "Honey Tree" and "Blustery Day" were originally dubbed in 1969, with "Tigger Too" being dubbed in 1974. All three shorts were released together with the original dubs as a "first dub". The newer dub of the film was later made in 1997, with the transition scenes finally getting dubbed. Selma Lopes voiced Kanga in both dubs.
</li><li> Same goes for the Latin Spanish version, with the film being dubbed in 1998. An interesting difference between both versions is that in the original dubbing of "The Honey Tree" and "The Blustery Day", Flavio, the original Spanish voice for Pooh, gave the character a Mickey Mouse-like voice. For the original 1974 dub of "Tigger Too", Pooh, Roo, and the narrator were given new voice actors. One of the voice actors, Luis Bayardo, who voiced Pooh in "Tigger Too", later reprised his role as the same character in the 1998 dub of the film.
</li><li> Originally, the first French dub covered the shorts in 1967, 1970, and 1978, respectively. Sometime between the theatrical French release of <em>The Many Adventures...</em> compilation version in 1977 and the Canadian VHS release of the film in 1996, additional dubbing was made to the framing sequences and epilogue. The film version later had a new dub made in France in 1997, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerCarel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerCarel">Roger Carel</a> (Pooh, Piglet and Rabbit) and Henry Djanik (Owl; also voiced Eeyore in the new version) reprising their character roles from the original dub. The new dub was only released once on VHS and laserdisc, as all future home media releases contain the compilation edit of the original dub.
</li><li> The Hungarian version dubbed the shorts first in 1988 and then the compilation movie in 1997. The newer dub features most of the same voice cast (Christopher Robin, Kanga, and Gopher's voice actors were replaced).
</li><li> There are two Greek versions of the <em>Many Adventures</em> compilation film; the latter is a partial redub for DVD, replacing only Pooh and Piglet's voices.
</li><li> The three shorts (including "A Day for Eeyore") were originally dubbed into Dutch for TV (NCRV) in 1986. After <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNewAdventuresOfWinnieThePooh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNewAdventuresOfWinnieThePooh">The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh</a></em> was dubbed in 1991; "A Day for Eeyore" was re-dubbed in 1993, followed by re-dubs of the other three shorts in 1995, which ended up being the version used for <em>The Many Adventures</em> starting in 1997. (Oddly, because "A Day for Eeyore" was the first to be re-dubbed, "Honey Tree", "Tigger Too", and "Many Adventures" re-use the unique overture and main theme song from that short.)
</li><li> The film was dubbed into Japanese six times: one for theatrical release, one by Pony/Bandai, three Buena Vista dubs, and one that aired on WOWOW (1992).
<ul><li> First dub, 1970: <em>Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree</em> was the first to be dubbed into Japanese. This version was later released on VHS (and laserdisc) in 1989 and again (this time, on VHS only) in 1995 and 2002. The Sing-Along Songs videos ("Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah" and "You Can Fly") also uses this dub for the selected songs included from the short.
</li><li> 1984: The first dub made for <em>The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh</em> was released on VHS and laserdisc in 1985 and 1987. The 1984 version of <em>Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day</em> received its own VHS release in 1988, with additional dubbing made to its original opening credits narration.
</li><li> 1990: <em>Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too</em> receives a separate Japanese dubbing on VHS and laserdisc; later re-released to VHS in 1996.
</li><li> 1993, TV dub for WOWOW: The second Japanese dub made for <em>The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh</em>. This version includes the same voice actors from the 1990 dub of "Tigger Too", except for Pooh and the narrator. Interestingly, this dub also re-uses several songs from the 1984 version (such as the theme song and "Heffalumps and Woozles" for example), while other songs were either partially ("The Rain, Rain, Rain Came Down, Down, Down" and "Hip-Hip Pooh-Ray") or entirely ("Little Black Rain Cloud" and "A Rather Blustery Day") re-dubbed.
</li><li> 1997: <em>The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh</em> was given a home video redub in 1997, which was used for all subsequent releases. This time, the voice actors here (except for Christopher Robin, Rabbit, and the narrator) reprised their roles from the 1993 dub.
</li></ul></li><li> There are also two Norwegian dubs. The original was made only for the "Tigger Too" featurette in 1974, while the second one was made for the compilation film in 1997.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore</em> was dubbed into Japanese three times: in 1984, 1990, and 1997.

<ul><li> Several foreign dubs of <em>The Little Mermaid</em>, made during the film's original 1989-90 release, were either partially or entirely re-dubbed for the late-90s re-release. The most likely reason is that Disney USA wanted to replace Ariel voices that were too different from the original Jodi Benson. Other reasons claim that it was a specific request by Disney USA in Europe, which imposed the re-dub of the film, when it re-released in theaters to test their new DTS mixing device designed in their lab.
</li><li> For example, it was re-dubbed in Finnish in 1998, no one knows why (except for the folks at Walt Disney Finland). The old dub was of good quality and fondly remembered by those who saw the movie on VHS in the early 90's. Some actors reprised their roles in the new dub, most notably Ursula's Finnish voice, but the majority of the main cast were played by different people.
</li><li> The movie was also re-dubbed in Germany in 1998. Disney never exactly said why they did so, citing vague "it's now closer to the original", while the real reason most likely were outstanding payments to the original dub voice actors. This move pretty much killed the movie's reputation in Germany, as the new dub was seen as an atrocity, due to the voices, the changed dialogue, and especially the songs, which were borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation">"Blind Idiot" Translation</a>. Obviously someone had not considered that the changes from the original in the first dub were there for a good reason. Disney finally caved in when they created the Diamond Edition in 2013, making both dubs available to ensure that sales would not bomb as they did with the DVD.
</li><li> In Denmark (which, coincidentally, is the country of the story's origin), Laus H&oslash;ybye replaced Nikolaj Bohm as Flounder in 1999. The songs were partially re-dubbed as well.
</li><li> It also received two European French dubs; the first in 1990 and the second in 1998. Ariel, Carlotta, and Ursula's French voice actresses reprised their roles in the 1998 dub, but the majority of the main cast were played by different people. Also, the redub retains the 1989 version of "Poor Unfortunate Souls". Like the German version, the 1998 re-dub was highly criticized by French fans and specialized press. Because of this, it only remained on the 1998 VHS and 2000 DVD, while the original 1990 dub has been retained since the 2006 DVD, after multiple petitions.
</li><li> The 1989 Brazilian Portuguese version received a partial redub in 1997; here Kiara Sasso replaces Gabriela Ferreira as Ariel's singing voice (add that the lyrics to "Part of Your World" were changed, and there is quite a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a> regarding which is better), and Andr&eacute; Filho as Sebastian re-recorded "Under the Sea". (The original 1989 recording of the song can still be heard on the 2006 soundtrack.) Also, the Diamond Edition accidentally omits Ursula's line "Keep singing!" as she takes Ariel's voice.
</li><li> The 1991 Japanese version had its songs re-dubbed in 1997.
</li><li> The movie also had two Greek dubs: the original from 1991 and the current from 1998.
</li><li> Same goes for the Thai version, which had also its two dubs made in 1991 and 1998.
</li><li> The film was also dubbed into Albanian twice (2006 and 2013).

<ul><li> When the movie was re-released in 2002, the song "The Circle of Life" was re-recorded in Egyptian Arabic and Polish. The rest of the dubbings for both languages remained the same.
</li><li> There are two Tamil dubs: one was officially done in 1995 with the songs dubbed and the other was done later, but with no songs dubbed.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pocahontas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pocahontas">Pocahontas</a></em> has two Serbian dubbings: one was done in 2009 for TV, but the songs weren't dubbed, and sometime in 2019, it will have the songs dubbed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBraveLittleToaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBraveLittleToaster">The Brave Little Toaster</a></em>:
<ul><li> The film was dubbed in Czech twice. The first was made in 1992 for VHS. In this dub, Lampy is made a female, the non-human characters all had electronic-sounding voices and all the songs were blandly spoken, rather than sung. The 2004 DVD dub improves significantly over the original.
</li><li> It was also dubbed into Brazilian Portuguese three times; the first was done in 1988 by VTI in Rio de Janeiro. Both redubs were commissioned in S&atilde;o Paulo, with the second dub from 1996 by Gota M&aacute;gica, and the third dub from 2009 by Studio G&aacute;bia. In the 1996 dub, Lampy, the Hanging Lamp, the Stereo, and the Hearse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShesAManInJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShesAManInJapan">are females</a>. Ivo Roberto voiced Plugsy in both the 1996 and 2009 dubs.
</li><li> The movie was also re-dubbed into Japanese in 2000.
</li><li> There were also two Icelandic dubs; once for TV and again for home media.
</li><li> It also had two Dutch dubs; once in 1995 for VHS and again in 2005 for DVD.
</li><li> The film also received three Russian dubs. The first was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceoverTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceoverTranslation">Voiceover Translation</a> and made exclusively for VHS in the Soviet Union, while the second two (from the Russian dubbing companies EA and ORT) are fully dubbed. The 1st was done exclusively for TV in the late 90s, while the 2nd dub was done in 2000. Interestingly, both versions have the Toaster voiced by a male actor, instead of a woman, while the first dub made Lampy a female. The 2nd dub is the most common out of the three and is the only version to be preserved on home media. However, this is considered to be a slightly poor dub: while most of the movie's dubbing job is okay, the songs (with the exception of "City of Light", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSongRemainsTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSongRemainsTheSame">which remained entirely in English</a>) vary between a mix of dubbing a few lines, using a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceoverTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceoverTranslation">Voiceover Translation</a>, and leaving some parts in English. However, in the 1st dub (the rarest and hardest to find), the songs are fully dubbed and given accurate translations.
</li><li> There are reports that there are two versions of the Croatian dub - the first version (often mistaken to be the Serbian dub) only dubs parts of Worthless while the second version dubs all the songs. Otherwise both versions are the same.

</li><li> It was also dubbed three times in Latin Spanish: twice in Mexico (1989 and 1997), and again in Argentina. The latter two dubs have the songs dubbed, except "The Girls of Rock &amp; Roll" and "Diamond Dolls" in the Argentinian dub.

The second dub even changed the title of the film to include more puns and rhymes.

</li><li> It also has two Brazilian Portuguese dubs: the first by Mastersound for DVD, and the other for SBT.
</li><li> The film was also dubbed into Hungarian twice; the original from 1988 (which aired on MTV 1) and the newer from 1991 (which aired on HBO). The songs are only dubbed in the first version.
</li><li> There are also two Czech dubs; the original 1975 theatrical dub by Barrandov, and again in 1990 for airing on &#268;ST.

<ul><li> The film received two Brazilian Portuguese dubs, with the latter being done for the 2011 DVD release. While the songs in both versions are left un-dubbed, the newer version only dubs "Peewit's Ballad". Also, the first dub re-names Johan and Peewit "Jo&atilde;o" and "Gui", whereas the second dub uses their names from the UK English dub (John and William).
</li><li> The European Spanish version of the film was dubbed three times; once in 1979, again for a 1980 LP soundtrack and again for the 2010 DVD. The 1979 dubbing seems to be a more faithful translation to the original French dub, while the 2010 DVD re-dub seems to be closer to the 1979 UK English dub (the most commonly available version, compared to both this and the 1983 American English dub). Because of this, the first two songs, "Peewit's Ballad" and "Gentle Lady" (which are left untranslated in both dubs) are played in French in the 1979 dub, and English in the 2010 re-dub (which also leaves the Smurfs' working song untranslated).
</li><li> It was also dubbed into Latin Spanish twice; the first time in the 1980s and again in 2011 by Candiani. Interestingly, both dubs use much of the same cast from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a></em> series.
</li><li> It was also dubbed into Italian twice; first in 1981, and again in 1983 by Grupo Trenta, with most of the series cast. TV airings of the film used to randomly switch between the two dubs, but later airings and DVD releases use only the original dub from 1981 (except for Peewit's final line, which is kept from the second dub, since the audio track of the original dub was damaged in that point). Interestingly, both dubs have the songs left either partially or entirely in French, as well as the original instrumental music for the Smurfs' party sequence replaced by another song ("La festa della luna") sung to the tune of "Yankee Doodle".
</li><li> It was also dubbed into Hungarian twice: once in 1978 and again, ten years later, in 1988.

</li><li> It also has three Latin Spanish dubs; two for Mexico (1989 and 1997) and one for Venezuela (1994). The first Mexican dub was made at the Grabaciones y Doblajes studio, with big-name voice actors (i.e. Arturo Mercado as Charlie, Francisco Colmenero as Carface, and Diana Santos as Anne-Marie); this dub is available on all DVD releases in both Latin America and Spain. The other two dubs have occasionally aired on TV, but are impossible to find anywhere else.

<ul><li> There are two competing Latin American dubs that were recorded around the same year (2000). The more prominently-known dub was produced by Sensaciones Sonicas and Warner Bros. and had toned-down language, as well as leaving the musical numbers in English. The other dub, produced for pay TV and USA Blu-Ray by Intersound SA and Paramount, dubbed the musical numbers and contained stronger language, although it has also been criticized for using too literal translations for the songs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EduardoGarza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EduardoGarza">Eduardo Garza</a> (Stan), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LilianaBarba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LilianaBarba">Liliana Barba</a> (Kyle), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoseAntonioMacias" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoseAntonioMacias">Jos&eacute; Antonio Mac&iacute;as</a> (Cartman), and Carlos &Aacute;guila (Mr. Garrison) voiced their characters in both dubs.
</li><li> It also received two dubs in Hungary. The production of the first version was fueled by a dose of ignorance on the dubbing directors' part. As the show's dub was very popular, the movie became quite disliked for not keeping the series cast (except Stan, Cartman, and one apiece of Mr. Garrison, Jimbo, and Ned's recurring voices), though it wasn't half bad. This is why the second dub got produced, a full decade later, for using the then-current voices from the series. This counts as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">Moment of Awesome</a> for the channel that ordered the new dub, Filmm&uacute;zeum (now Film M&aacute;nia), as it was purely a gesture of kindness towards the fans. They even ran a series of ads mocking the older dub. Peter Bozso (Stan) and Gabor Csore (Cartman) voiced their characters in both dubs.

The second dub, universally regarded as inferior due to its amateurish voice acting and mangled translation work, was made for a 2003 DVD release.
</li><li> The first Hungarian dub was made for the VHS release by a company called Televideo sometime in the 90s, but calling it a dub might be generous: it was five actors talking over the movie, not really paying attention to when, which, and how many characters were speaking, and the translation in general was <em>odd</em>, if witty. The other dub was made by Masterfilm for a cheap bargain-bin DVD released by the Mirax company around the early 2000s. Also featuring voices that vary from scene to scene, this version is notorious for the added profanity and overall shoddy translations.
</li><li> It also has two Italian and Brazilian dubs.
</li></ul></li><li> After the <em>The Daltons</em> cartoon (and the <em>Go West</em> film) made a huge success in Italy, in 2015 most of the old <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LuckyLuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LuckyLuke">Lucky Luke</a></em> movies were redubbed with the new voice cast from the aforemented film and series.

<ul><li> Like Disney, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> franchise is nearly as famous for doing this
<ul><li> The Hungarian dubs have a long history:
<ul><li> Original Trilogy, first dub &mdash; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em> was the first to be dubbed, in 1982. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em>, previously only available with (some very bizarre) subtitles, received a made-for-TV dub in '84. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em> was a step back, in that it was again shown only with subtitles. Fans had to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">Keep Circulating the Tapes</a> 'till '93, the date that marked the first instance all three movies became available on VHS. <em>ROTJ</em> finally got dubbed at this point. All three dubs were, sadly, <em>extremely</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InconsistentDub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InconsistentDub">inconsistent</a>, and that of <em>ROTJ</em> was particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">So Bad, It's Good</a>.
</li><li> THX dubs, 1995 &mdash; the first attempt at creating a consistent dub for the entire trilogy. Most of the characters received their now-famous VAs here, but the dub was soon overshadowed by...
</li><li> Special Edition, 1997 &mdash; the most widely available versions... mostly through piracy, until the 2011 Blu-ray came along, marking the first time this dub became obtainable through legal means (it was originally created solely for TV broadcasts). The voices were, more or less, consistent throughout, though Vader curiously retained his old THX voice actor for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em>, and due to a major sound-editing blunder, they somehow erased his iconic breathing noise from the entirety of <em>Empire</em>.
</li><li> Special Edition dub 1.1? Though the Blu-ray reached back to the '97 dub, instead of opting for yet another complete revision, some extended scenes and added sounds of course had yet to be dubbed. As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">Vader's "new" voice actor had passed away in '05</a>, they had to call in his THX voice for these, which was quite jarring. The breathing hasn't been reinstalled either.
</li><li> Prequel Trilogy dubs. Can be considered separate from the OT dubs, as most recurring characters received new voices. Only Vader kept his '97 VA.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note24xd93');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note24xd93" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note24xd93');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Palpatine was also dubbed by the same actor as in the very first <em>ROTJ</em> dub, but that's probably coincidental. Curiously, that's the dub in which Vader's '97 VA debuted, too, only to be forgotten by a series of subsequent redubs.</span>
</li><li> And you may also wanna count an ancient voice-over, with a single person talking over the original audio track.
</li></ul></li><li> For the Czech dubbing of the original trilogy, each film was dubbed three times:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em> was dubbed for theatrical, VHS (Bonton Home Video), and Blu-Ray releases.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em> was dubbed twice for home video (Guild/Bonton Home Video) and again for the Blu-Ray release.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em> was first dubbed for VHS twice; the first in 1992 and the second in 1995. The third dub was made in 2011 for TV Nova airings and the Blu-Ray release.
</li></ul></li><li> The Japanese dub history for the original trilogy is a little complex:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em> was dubbed into Japanese five times. The first was made for the original theatrical release, the second and third dubs were made for TV airings in 1983 and 1985 respectively, the fourth was made for VHS releases (Laserdiscs of the Trilogy were always subtitled), and the fifth dub was also made for TV airings in 2005. <em>The Story of Star Wars</em>, an abridged audio adaptation of the film that used audio clips from the movie, also had a Japanese dub, resulting in a total of six Japanese dubs. Goro Naya, who voiced Ben Kenobi in the audio adaptation, reprised his role for the fourth dub, while Yusuke Takita played him in the third and fifth dubs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em> received four Japanese dubs. The first was made for its original theatrical release, while the second and third dubs were made for TV in 1986 and 1992, and the fourth dub was made for home media.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em> only had two Japanese dubs; the first in 1983 and the second for VHS versions. C-3PO's voice actor reprises his role in the second dub.
</li></ul></li><li> The original trilogy was re-dubbed in Brazilian Portuguese in the 1990s, then five of the movies (except <em>A New Hope</em>) were re-dubbed in 2015, just in time for the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens">The Force Awakens</a></em>. Peterson Adriano did not return as Anakin Skywalker in the prequels because he no longer works at the dubbing studio (Delart). Interestingly, Isaac Bardavid voiced Obi-Wan Kenobi in at least two versions of each of the original trilogy.
</li><li> The Latin American Spanish dub deserves a mention:
<ul><li> The Original Trilogy was first dubbed in Los Angeles, California, the first two at ESM, under the direction of Salvador Najar, the voice of Luke, <em>Return of the Jedi</em> at Magnum, under the direction of Roberto Alexander, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">the second voice of Luke</a>.
</li><li> There were also alternate Mexican dubs produced for T.V. airing of <em>A New Hope</em> and <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> Almost nothing is known about these dubs, and they're believed to be lost.
</li><li> The special editions were then dubbed at Mexico at Ultra Video (with casting done by Audiopost) under the direction of Carlos Pont&oacute;n, along with partial redubs for later releases recorded at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SDIMediaDeMexico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SDIMediaDeMexico">Prime Dubb</a> under the direction of Javier Rivero. Arturo Mercado reprised his roles as Lando and Yoda from the original dub of Episode V.
</li><li> The 2006 DVD release of the original cuts in the US has Castilian Spanish instead of Latin American Spanish.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> For the 20th anniversary re-release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ETTheExtraTerrestrial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ETTheExtraTerrestrial">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</a></em> in 2002, several foreign-language versions were re-dubbed. Examples include Brazilian Portuguese, French, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Latin Spanish, and Spanish European.
<ul><li> For the Italian and European Spanish versions, the re-dubs were only included on the 2002 DVD release, as the original dubs were made available on Blu-Ray at the request of fans.
</li><li> Unlike the above example, the Japanese Blu-Ray release includes both dubs.
</li><li> There are also three Czech dubs. The original theatrical dub from 1983; the second dub from 1992 for VHS; and the third and current dub from 2002, made available on all subsequent home video releases.
</li></ul></li><li> The history of Hungarian dubs is well documented. There are several major, distinct categories:
<ul><li> Communism retained a high quality product of Hungarian culture: Excellent dubs! <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PannoniaFilmStudio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PannoniaFilmStudio">Pannonia Film Studio</a> (the production company of state owned television) employed the national stars and first rate actors of cinema and theater at the time, their dubs were of very high quality. To this day, Pannonia dubs are fan favorites, especially since the translators often employed successful Woolseyism of their own.
</li><li> Counter-intuitively Capitalism brought a low quality product to Hungary: Not-so-good dubs! Since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PannoniaFilmStudio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PannoniaFilmStudio">Pannonia Film Studio</a> retained the rights of its dubs, commercial TV channels often opted to simply have films re-dubbed rather than pay the (often high) fee... with lesser-known actors, who often first saw their script during actual production. These "re-dubs" are infamous for their syndicated edits and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation">"Blind Idiot" Translation</a>.

<ul><li> If the Spanish and Mexican theatrical versions of the film still existed (Spain got the Japanese cut, Mexico got <em>Gigantis</em>), there would be three separate Spanish dubs (of course spread across two dialects).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhenHarryMetSally" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhenHarryMetSally">When Harry Met Sally...</a></em> has two Korean dubs: one for MBC and the other for SBS.
<ul><li> The film has four Japanese dubs: one by Soft, one for Nippon TV, a third for Japan Airlines, and a fourth for All Nippon Airlines.
</li><li> The film has three Brazilian Portuguese dubs: one that aired on Globo in 1993, another for TV and streaming, and a third for Telecine.
</li><li> It also has four Latin Spanish dubs: three in Mexico, and another in Venezuela.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMysterians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMysterians">The Mysterians</a></em> interestingly also has two different French versions. Like the situation in the U.S., there is a theatrical version based on RKO's cut, and a later home video dub based on the Japanese version.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaidersOfTheLostArk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaidersOfTheLostArk">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a></em> fell victim to this in Germany. When the original German dub was created in 1981, they for some reason screwed up and created a really bad Dolby Stereo mix <em>and</em> managed to lose the original German speech tapes. Due to the bad production of the mix, it proved impossible to separate the speech from it to create a new 5.1 mix (as done with <em>Star Wars</em>) and they were forced to create a new dub in 2008 when the movie went HD, where apart from the voice of Indiana Jones, all voices were new. The old dub is well-loved and the new one caused <em>enormous</em> bad blood, so bad indeed that Paramount decided right away when creating the Blu-Ray that both dubs should be available on it. Thankfully, the sequels had much higher production quality in the dubs and they were spared this fate as a remix was trivial (access to 6-channel magnetic sound made it easy).
<ul><li> The exact same thing happened in Italy too, except that the Italian redub changes Indiana's voice too... weird thing, since the original voice actor was still available (and reprised the character for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheKingdomOfTheCrystalSkull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheKingdomOfTheCrystalSkull">Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</a></em> too).

Thankfully, starting with the DVD, only the original dub is used; however, the other dub has its fans, and so both dubs are available on the Blu-ray.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goodfellas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goodfellas">Goodfellas</a></em> was given <em>five</em> Hungarian dubs: The first dub from 1991 was released on home video and broadcast on HBO and TV3.

</li><li> The second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Trinity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Trinity">Trinity</a></em> movie got a new dub in 1980, also including cuts, to make it a comedy (although the movie already was funny on its own).

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FirstBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FirstBlood">First Blood</a></em> has a fourth Brazilian Portuguese dub for the SBT channel, also by Herbert Richers (with a few of the same actors).
</li><li> <em>First Blood</em> has five Japanese dubs: two for NTV, one for TV Asahi, one for Fuji TV, and one for TBS. The cast of the second NTV dub returned for the sequels, but Sylvester Stallone's voice actor from Asahi assumed the role in <em>Rambo 3</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> There's two Latin American Spanish dubs for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hellboy2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hellboy2019">Hellboy (2019)</a></em>: One dubbed in Mexico exclusively for that country, handled by Imagem Filmes, and another one done in Argentina, handled by Digi Cine.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGun">Top Gun</a></em> has two Latin Spanish dubs: the original made in Los Angeles in the 1980's by Intersound and a newer dub in Mexico made by SDI Media de Mexico. TV airings ping-pong between the two dubs.
<ul><li> The film has two Portuguese dubs: one by Telecine (TV), and another by Alamo (re-releases).
</li></ul></li><li> In 1997, all of Brazil's voice actors entered a strike. To counter this, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanAndRobin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanAndRobin">Batman &amp; Robin</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLostWorldJurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLostWorldJurassicPark">The Lost World: Jurassic Park</a></em> had dubs made in Los Angeles for the VHS and TV (most nostably, both protagonists had the voice of the late Ubirajara de Castro - aka Bira Castro - best known as the announcer for TNT and Fox). Both would later get dubs done in Rio de Janeiro. And while the new <em>Jurassic Park</em> dub is official, amusingly, on home video only the old <em>Batman &amp; Robin</em> dub is available (which even arguably enhances the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">So Bad, It's Good</a> quality for <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p10u_ndnFZw">how the performances are so<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Camp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Camp">campy</a>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Parasite2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Parasite2019">Parasite</a></em> got a Brazilian dub for streaming. And given it was made by a non-traditional studio in Belo Horizonte, dubbing fans were expecting paid channel Telecine to commission another from a studio in Rio, and rejoiced when it was confirmed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BillAndTedsExcellentAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BillAndTedsExcellentAdventure">Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure</a></em> has three Hungarian dubs: one made for HBO in the early '90s, one made for the now-defunct network TV3 in the late '90s, and one made for MGM in the late 2000s. The original is notable for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation">subpar translation</a> that neutered a lot of jokes. The second dub is even stranger for giving the exact same voice actors to the two leads as before, but their roles got switched. While still far from perfect, this one had a better script but toned down the profanities. It even re-titled the film from <em>Bill &eacute;s Ted olt&aacute;ri kalandja</em> (<em>Bill and Ted's Awesome Adventure</em>) to <em>Bill &eacute;s Ted zseni&aacute;lis kalandja</em> (<em>Bill and Ted's genius adventure</em>). The third dub kept the 2nd title but recast all the voices. This version was made in a cost-effective Romanian dubbing studio as part of a larger incentive to produce cheap Hungarian dubs with cheap Hungarian voice talent for numerous classic films for potential TV broadcasts.
<ul><li> The sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BillAndTedsBogusJourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BillAndTedsBogusJourney">Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey</a></em>, has two Hungarian versions, one made sometime in the '90s and one made at the same time as the first installment's MGM dub. The MGM version kept the same voice cast as their dub of the first film. The first dub recast every character and is thus inconsistent with every other dub of either movie.

In all four cases, the newer translation was used in the 2017 film:
<ul><li> European French (Le Petit Musc in 2000, Bayard in 2013). Most of the character names are changed in Bayard's edition.
</li><li> German (Ueberreuter in 2000, Panini in 2012). Except for Mr. Krupp, all the character names are changed in Ueberreuter's version.
</li><li> Norwegian (Cappelen Damm, then Schibsteds)
</li><li> Swedish (Egmont, then Bonnier Carlsen). The Bonnier Carlsen translation changed most of the character names, except for Mr. Krupp and the kids.

The first dub was aired once on TV in the original worldwide airing, while the second dub is available in the <em>The Day of the Doctor</em> single DVD release and the third one is in the <em>50th Anniversary</em> boxset.

It aired on television and released on home video. That's all they wanted, right? One consistent dub, yes? Well, you are wrong. In 2015, when Netflix got the rights to have the series in Latin Spanish dubbed format, they did not get the rights to use the audio. SDI Media M&eacute;xico was contacted to redub the episodes with a new translation and new voice actors. Some fans didn't like this because the original dub was considered to be a childhood classic. And to top that off, this dub is only available in the United States towards Latin American Spanish speakers. The first season was also redubbed into French, German, Polish, Japanese, and Brazilian Portuguese.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Thunderbirds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Thunderbirds">Thunderbirds</a></em> has two Italian dubs. The first one was made in 1974, covered only the first season and was heavily edited to make each episode 20 minutes long. The season got a new dub (this time with no cuts) in 1993. In 2003, this second dub was aired for the last time along with season 2 being finally dubbed. For some reason, later airings used the first dub, with subtitles on the scenes that were missing back then.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> has at least three Russian versions.

</li><li> There also exist two Dutch dubs: the first was made in Dutch-speaking Belgium for Playhouse Disney covering the first two seasons and the second in the Netherlands covering all four seasons.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow">The Muppet Show</a></em> was dubbed into Hungarian twice. The original was done by MTV around 1980-1983, while the new version was made by Film M&aacute;nia (formerly known as Filmm&uacute;zeum at the time) during 2003-2004.
<ul><li> It was also dubbed into Latin Spanish three times. The original dub was made during the show's original run (1976-1981) by CINSA and is currently extinct. The second dub was made for the two VHS volumes of "It's the Muppets" in 1993, and the third dub was made in Argentina during 1999-2001 by Palmera Record.
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of Muppets, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em> also has multiple dubs in certain languages, often as a result of package programs (like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PlayWithMeSesame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PlayWithMeSesame">Play With Me Sesame</a></em> or <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OpenSesame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OpenSesame">Open Sesame</a></em>) airing after local versions have ended or other package programs. A few examples:
<ul><li> Poland has two (there was a local version with dubbed American segments in 1996 and one with only dubbed American segments in 2006)
</li><li> Denmark has three (A dubbed version of Open Sesame in 1992, a dubbed Elmo's World in the late '90s/early aughts, and a packaged block in 2009)
</li><li> Sweden also has three (a local production with dubbed American bits in 1981, Open Sesame in 1996 - which retained the original Swedish voices of Grover and Cookie Monster, and more recent dubs of several American spin-offs, which have the second dub's Ernie and Bert).
</li><li> Spain had a package dub in the late '70s, three iterations of the local production, and a few dubs of the American spin-offs.
</li><li> Bizarrely enough, on the (now-cancelled) Russian production, despite only having one local production with dubs of American bits (taken from Open Sesame), dubs of later segments (like Play with Me Sesame and Global Grover) re-cast the majority of the American Muppets with completely different voices (save for Bert and Elmo), even with the Open Sesame bits still being included in episodes.
</li><li> Italy had an early version of Open Sesame in the '70s and package dubs in the aughts.
</li><li> Portugal had an early Open Sesame in the '70s, a local production in the late '80s and early '90s, and two dubs of Play with Me Sesame.

<ul><li> Likewise, the series was dubbed in Slovak three times. The original was produced in-house by Slovensk&aacute; telev&iacute;zia (STV) in the 1990's, while the second was made for DVD, and third for Dajto (a channel aimed at young, active men) in 2013.
</li><li> There were two Greek dubs: the VHS dub from Studio 87' and the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANT1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANT1">ANT 1</a> dub from SPK Video Film Television.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooWhereAreYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooWhereAreYou">Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!</a></em> has two different Japanese dubs. The original was done in the early 1970s, and changed the names of all the characters, and created a new theme song using the original opening footage. The new dub is more faithful to the original American show (though it uses "Kuruppa" as Scooby's name in homage to the 70s dub), and was so successful, the Japanese dubbing studio that recorded it was called back to dub other Scooby-Doo media into Japanese using the same voice actors, such as the Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo show (with Naoki Tatsuto as Scrappy) and several of the DTV movies (Zombie Island, Witch's Ghost, Alien Invaders, Cyber Chase etc.).
<ul><li> It was also dubbed into Russian twice. The first was done for the STS Channel in 2011, and the second was made by Pythagor Studios around 2012-2013. The latter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSongRemainsTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSongRemainsTheSame">has the theme song left in English</a>.
</li><li> For the Swedish version, the 2nd season was dubbed twice: the first for TV3 in 1993, and later for DVD in 2005.
</li><li> The show didn't get a Norwegian dub before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LateExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LateExportForYou">2015</a>. However one episode was dubbed for the "Cartoon Crack-Ups" DVD back in 2001. Only the voices of Scooby and Velma appeared in both dubs.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo</em> received three Polish dubs. The original was made for VHS releases, while the second was made for TV airings and the third for DVD releases. There's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceoverTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceoverTranslation">Voiceover Translation</a> that exists as well.
<ul><li> It was also dubbed into Greek three times. The first dub was made by Studio 87' for VHS in the 1980s, the Audio Visual dub aired on MEGA from 1990-1992 and the third for Boomerang and DVD was done in the Sierra Recordings studio.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>The Scooby-Doo Show</em> had three Russian dubs, not counting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceoverTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceoverTranslation">Voiceover Translation</a> from 1997. The original dub was made in the mid-90s for NTV and Varus Video (VHS), the second was done in 2000, and the third was made during 2011-2012.
<ul><li> The show was also dubbed into Swedish twice: the original from Media Dubb and the newer from Sun Studio.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfTheGummiBears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfTheGummiBears">Adventures of the Gummi Bears</a></em> had its first 52 episodes dubbed in Russia in 1992, but the masters for the original dub were lost (although TV rips of them were preserved by fans), and a new dub was commissioned in 2009. The second dub covered all episodes, made a different and more faithful translation of the opening song, but preserved the traditions of the original along with the same character names, and is generally considered just as good.
<ul><li> Greece got two dubs too. The first one by Studio Cross was done for ERT, and the second dub was for Disney Junior by Sierra Recordings. One of the Studio Cross dub's episodes ended up as an alternate audio track on a Russian DVD (the rest of the episodes were probably the Sierra dub).
</li><li> There were also two Slovak dubs made: the original by STV from 1992, and the new one by Telev&iacute;zia Mark&iacute;za from 2003.
</li><li> The show also had two dubs in Japanese.
</li><li> For Poland, it's a bit complicated, there is one TV dub with suplement re-dubs for some epsiodes (along with a <em>really</em> obscure lektor translation):
<ul><li> The 1st original TV dub was made by the studio Telewizyjne Studia D&#378;wi&#281;ku in years 1991-1994 (which was basically Polish Television's studio)
</li><li> In later years some episodes were re-dubbed (according to the production code they are: 30-33, 39, 48 and 64) by the studio Master Film with different voices for some characters (but with the same version of theme song from the 1st dub). One of the reasons of the redub creation is probably that master tapes of Polish dub of episodes 30-33, 39 and 48 have been mysteriously lost, while the first dub of episode 64 (which was rerun with its 1st dub durring its 2007-2008 run on TVP1) has "To be continuted" notice at the end translated with a VO saying "Doko&#324;czenie za tydzie&#324;" (Continuing next week), where that notice translated in such way could make sense when the show aired with only one episode a week (like it was originally during Sunday "Walt Disney przedstawia" block during Sunday "Wieczorynka" blocks).
</li><li> A 3rd dub (which by looks is suplementar to 2nd dub) was done for two VHS releases in 1996 (and their later DVD reissues) from Imperial Entertainment (also made by Master Film), but with a different lyrical recording of the theme song.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Like above example this same happened to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987">DuckTales (1987)</a></em> in Poland. The first Polish dub was aired in 1991-1993. (but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987">DuckTales (1987)</a></em> were first shown in Poland in 1989 with voiceover) After decade the masters for original dub mysteriously lost, a new dub was made in 2004-2005, but it didn't premiere until 2007, when MiniMini shown began to show the 1980's DuckTales series. Henryk &#321;api&#324;ski voiced Duckworth in both dubs.
<ul><li> <em>DuckTales</em> is very complicated in Finland: there exists the original TV dub from 1990, and the newer TV dub done in 2013, both under the title of <em>Ankronikka</em>. However, reportedly some episodes also received additional dubs for home video. Both TV dubs were made for Nelonen and reruns of both of the TV dubs air on Fox Finland.
</li><li> The series was also dubbed into Brazilian Portuguese twice; once for VHS and again for TV.
</li><li> It also received two Czech dubs.
</li><li> Two Japanese dubs exist: the first done in 1988 and the second in 2004.
</li><li> The pilot episode had two partial redubs in Italian: The first was done for the series's brief <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop">Channel Hop</a> to Canale 5, and had Donald Duck's old voice actor Franco Latini replaced with his current voice actor Luca Eliani. The second was done for the release of the series on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyPlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyPlus">Disney+</a>: as back then the pilot was dubbed only in the movie format and not as the individual episodes, all the extra scenes that were absent in the original dub were dubbed for the platform. Ironically, the Italian version of the platform haves only the last season of the show.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChipNDaleRescueRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChipNDaleRescueRangers">Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers</a></em> has two Hungarian dubs: one from 1991-93 on TV-1 (though a few actors were replaced in season 2), and again in 2004 for RTL Klub. &Eacute;va V&aacute;ndor (Chip) and Hug&oacute; Gruber (Monterrey Jack) voiced their characters throughout both dubs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin">TaleSpin</a></em> has two Hungarian dubs: one from 1993-97 on TV-1 and RTL Klub (much like <em>Chip 'n Dale</em>, a few actors were replaced in season 2), and again in 2003 for Story4. Five of the supporting voice actors kept their characters throughout.
<ul><li> The series has two Brazilian Portuguese dubs: one for TV (Herbert Richers), and another for VHS (S&amp;C).
</li><li> For European French, only the theme song was dubbed twice, this was done to match the different titles used for the dub (Super Baloo was used for French broadcasts, and Looping was used for broadcasts in Quebec, Belgium and Switzerland).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CareBears1980s" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CareBears1980s">Care Bears</a></em> was dubbed into Brazilian Portuguese four times. The original and most fondly-remembered dub was made in 1986 for SBT, while the second dub was made for Rede Globo. The third dub was made by SC for home video releases and the fourth dub was made by Double Sound for Boomerang in 2004.
<ul><li> The Latin Spanish dub is even more complicated, with the original series being dubbed in Panama, Chile and Venezuela; while the movies were dubbed in Mexico.
</li></ul></li><li> In order to air on Jeem (Al Jazeera's children channel) Disney movies and series which were dubbed in Egyptian accent were re-dubbed into Modern Standard Arabic (fusha).
</li><li> In Spain and Latin America, it is common to find a different Spanish dub for pretty much every show or movie that airs in both areas, but when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeManAndTheMastersOfTheUniverse1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeManAndTheMastersOfTheUniverse1983">He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (1983)</a></em> aired on TVE in Spain, it did (if not accidentally) used the Latin American version, which was dubbed in Mexico, although it does have a Castillian Spanish dub for Home Media releases.
<ul><li> <em>He-Man</em> also received a DVD-exclusive Brazilian Portuguese dub.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNewAdventuresOfWinnieThePooh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNewAdventuresOfWinnieThePooh">The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh</a></em> was dubbed into Russian twice. The original was done in 1993 and was last shown in 2005. The newer was done in 2010 by Disney Character Voices International. Rumor has it the redub was due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers">legal issues</a> with the original translations of the names.
<ul><li> The show had its first 11 episodes dubbed in Swedish by Media Dubb from 1988 to 1990. The rest of the episodes were later commissioned during 1991-1993 by KM Studios, which also re-dubbed those same 11 episodes.
</li><li> For unknown reasons, the original theme song was redubbed in Poland for reruns. The episodes were, however, left intact.
</li><li> In Greece, the show aired on Mega in the 90's. Later, several episodes were redubbed for DVD.
</li><li> There are three Brazilian Portuguese dubs. One by Herbert Richers for TV and VHS, one by Doublesound for TV, and one by S&amp;C for a rare VHS release. Gopher (Marco Ant&ocirc;nio Costa) and Eeyore (Luiz Brand&atilde;o) had the same voices in the Herbert Richers and Doublesound dubs. S&amp;C's dub uses the character translations from the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheManyAdventuresOfWinnieThePooh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheManyAdventuresOfWinnieThePooh">The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh</a></em>, but with a different voice cast.

The history behind the dub is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">very complicated</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsALongStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsALongStory">to say the least</a>. <a class="urllink" href="http://doblaje.wikia.com/wiki/South_Park">Another wiki has attempted to chronicle the alternate dubs and changes in production.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> To sum it up:
<ul><li> The first two seasons have at least three dubs in existence: One for the Mexican channel Televisa, one aired on Locomotion, and a 2011 version aired on MTV. The first two of these dubs were produced simultaneously through 1998-1999.
</li><li> The Mexican dub was produced at the Audiomaster 3000 studio, which was owned by Televisa. This dub is now considered lost to the point where the season 1 opening sequence cannot be found), other than the episodes that have circulated on internet uploads or that were rerun on MTV Latinoamerica. The Audiomaster dub of "Chickenpox" did inexplicably appear on Televisa's season 2 DVD release, while the Audiomaster dub of "Merry Christmas Charlie Manson" is available on a Christmas DVD. Most of the other episodes used the 2011 BVI dub track.
</li></ul></li><li> Dubbing for seasons 3-9 was passed through two different studios in Miami (Globecast and Kitchen Inc.) when it aired on Locomotion (and then MTV Latinoamerica after season 6), but they kept the voice cast and the director from BVI's version for the most part. Globecast handled seasons 3-5, while The Kitchen took over from the sixth season on.
</li><li> The Kitchen's license expired after the ninth season, causing BVI Communications (the original studio behind the Locomotion seasons 1-2) to acquire it. BVI had first redubbed season 7 as MTV did not have the tapes for the dub, and later redubbed seasons 1, 2, and the season 4 episodes "Timmy 2000" and "Trapper Keeper" (later aired in place of the banned "200" and "201"). Although on the DVD releases, the original Kitchen dubbing of season 7 is the one that can be heard. BVI folded after the first half of season 15, causing Studio Center to temporarily pick up the license before it then shifted hands back to The Kitchen.
</li><li> There are two different versions of "Rainforest Schmainforest": the original by Globecast, banned later on for the Costa Rica mockery, and a redub by Studio Center. There's also an unreleased, third version of the episode that was also dubbed by Studio Center but was considered too profane.
</li><li> There is a French dub of the series that has been ongoing, as well as a short-lived Quebecois adaptation that only covered season 1 (initially only the first five episodes were aired, but the latter half of the season was later shown through reruns). A French dub of the film also exists, along with a more obscure Quebecois dub.
</li><li> In Italy, the SEFIT-CDC Group (based in Rome) dubbed the first four seasons of the show although it underwent some censorship, particulary cutting episodes that had heavy references to pedophilia or mockery of Catholicism ("Cartman Joins NAMBLA", "Do The Handicapped Go To Hell?", and "Probably"). It also contained softened dialogue. After production of the dub was suspended and the show moved channels from Italia 1 to Comedy Central, a new adaptation by ODS was commissioned, starting at season 5 and moving on to cover the rest of the show. As the studio was based out of Turin and not Rome, the entire cast was replaced. ODS would also go back and redub the first four seasons for consistency, including the episodes that were originally cut or heavily censored.
</li><li> The Polish dub originally covered Season 1. In 2011, seasons 11 onward started being dubbed, with only Ike having the same voice in every version.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em> has two Italian dubs. One for the defunct Junior TV channel, which covered 52 episodes. The second dub, which aired on Italia 1 and Nickelodeon, covers the whole series.
</li><li> There are two Polish dubs each (the second ones were done in late 2000s for Nickelodeon Poland) for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CatDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CatDog">CatDog</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWildThornberrys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWildThornberrys">The Wild Thornberrys</a></em>.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CatDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CatDog">CatDog</a></em> also received two Czech dubs.
</li></ul></li><li> In Italy, there are two different dubs for all the three seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em> and the movie. Seasons 1-2 were redubbed in 2008, with Diego Reggente and Giovanni Petrucci (Respectively Optimus Prime and Sparkplug Witwicky's first voice actors in the original dub) coming back on their characters while Germano Basile reprised his role as Bumblebee from the second dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersTheMovie">Transformers: The Movie</a></em>. The second dub of Season 3 was originally going to be done along with the first two seasons, but because of many issues they had to scrap that. A new dub of that season was done in 2011 by a cast made by the hosts of <em>Contactoons</em> (a cartoon container program that aired the series in that period) and a bunch of students from a Turinese voice acting school<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note25xdro');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note25xdro" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note25xdro');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Some of which became more famous voice actors: for example, Silverbolt's voice actor later voiced Ryo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DevilmanCrybaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DevilmanCrybaby">DEVILMAN crybaby</a></em>, while Blurr's voice is mostly known nowadays as the voice of Clyde from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse">The Loud House</a></em></span>, resulting in an inferior job compared to the redub of the first two seasons. The same team also dubbed "The Rebirth", which was skipped back then to follow the Japanese continuity with <em>The Headmasters</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em>: Because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a> does not own the international rights to the show's earlier seasons, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nelvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nelvana">Nelvana</a> produced its own dubs in most languages.
<ul><li> The Hungarian dub is also complicated. The original dub aired on a channel called KidsCo and was made by SDI Media. The second dubbing, complete with new voices (apart from Erika N&aacute;ray as Wanda) and name translations, was commissioned by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a>, and created by Labor Studios. Later, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel">Disney Channel</a> and SDI continued the series where KidsCo left it off. A number of voice actors changed during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop">Channel Hop</a>. (N&aacute;ray's Wanda sounds quite higher in Nick's version). Nick, meanwhile, held onto the Labor dub. Eventually the SDI dub emerged victorious from the duel, as Nick abandoned its own version after barely a season. This time, no recasting of voice actors took place &mdash; they just brought over the entire SDI gang.
<ul><li> However there are reportedly more shows that, when having aired on KidsCo, received fully new dubbings, confusing many kids in the process.
</li></ul></li><li> The Danish dub is a wierd case. Both the Disney Channel and Nickelodeon air it, the former airing only the first seasons, the latter airing the newer seasons... which means two dubs, of course! They only share a few voices, which include Cosmo, Wanda, Vicky and Timmy's parents. The opening also has the same lyrics between versions, they're only sung by different actors. But the most glaring difference between the two dubs is that, in the Disney Channel version, Timmy's voice is a teenage-like, low-pitch voice, while in the Nickelodeon dub has a <strong>very</strong> high-pitched voice. Very ironic and, needless to say, confusing. And to top it all off, both dubs are plagued with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InconsistentDub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InconsistentDub">inconsistency</a>.
</li><li> The Russian version was handled a lot like the Hungarian version. The show originally aired on KidsCo, instead of TNT like other Nickelodeon cartoons in Russia, and then on the official Nickelodeon channel. The former channel only aired the first four seasons, while the latter aired season five &amp; onwards. Like in Hungary, a number of voice actors changed during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop">Channel Hop</a>.
</li><li> It was also dubbed in Czech three times. The first dub was made for Supermax (which is now lost), the second for Disney Channel, and a third by SDI Media for Nickelodeon.
</li><li> Poland has two dubs, too. The first one was made by SDI Media and aired on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel">Disney Channel</a> and later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a>. The other, short-lived dub covering seasons 3-4 was made by Toya Sound Studios and aired on KidsCo (though it was rerun on Disney Channel a few years later).
</li><li> There are also two Arabic dubs, one for Disney Channel and one for Spacetoon.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RoliePolieOlie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RoliePolieOlie">Rolie Polie Olie</a></em> was dubbed into Arabic twice. The first one (done in Syria by Venus Company) aired on SpaceToon, while the second one (done in Egypt) premiered on Disney Channel Middle East and later aired on KidsCo.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfSuperMarioBros3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfSuperMarioBros3">The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a></em> were both dubbed into German twice; once for Super RTL and again for KidsCo.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em>, yet again, in Hungarian. The original dub was created back when the show initially aired during the 90s on HBO, and is considered a masterpiece by many. In reality, it had its problems, and only covered the first half of the series. This dub was thought to be lost until 2010, when several episodes were reran on television with it (the rest of the HBO episodes are still unavailable). The second dub, made sometimes during the 2000s for a DVD release and later television showings, received criticism for its sub-par casting choices and lazy translation work. This version originally also covered just half of the episodes, and only Alfred and the Scarecrow retained their original voices. Around 2010, certain episodes were broadcast for the first time on the TV station Viasat6 with a third dubbing variant, which recast all the voices. Finally in 2017, the rest of the series debuted on the channel RTL Spike &mdash; these episodes used most of the still available voices from the DVD dub and a much improved translation. Despite this, there still doesn't exist a single dub variant that covers all episodes. Some are still broadcast with the old HBO dub, and the bizarre Viasat6 episodes haven't been in circulation for a long time.
<ul><li> The show reiceived two Arabic dubs, the first one is distributed by Young Future Entertainment and dubbed by Venus Center for Spacetoon and the second one was dubbed by Image Production House for MBC 3 and Cartoon Network Arabic.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> was aired in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh">Quebec</a> as a European French dub. Fans didn't like it. After the show was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCancelled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCancelled">Un-Cancelled</a> (and had been running in English), they made a local Quebec French dub starting with season 8. Fans liked it even less.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones">The Flintstones</a></em> has at least four dub variations in Hungary. The first is the classic... damn, full-on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic">Cult Classic</a> original one, famous for its rhyming dialog &mdash; but besides that, the SFX and music were also redone. Thought to be lost for years, until a TV station managed to dig it up recently. The other, still fairly well known dub was made using modern dubbing techniques, still used rhymes, but had a new voice cast. This is the one modern folks are most familiar with. Then, there exists a VHS-only dub, which is <em>very</em> obscure, and again mustered up new voices. Finally, the most recent one, which features yet another complete recast, and this version, for once, <em>wasn't</em> written in verse.
<ul><li> For the Swedish version, seasons 1-4 were originally made by Media Dubb. Media Dubb International later dubbed seasons 5-6 for TV3, while the entire series was re-dubbed by Sun Studios for Cartoon Network and Boomerang.
</li><li> In Poland, the series was shown in TVP in 70s, dubbed (by "Studio Opracowa&#324; Film&oacute;w" in Warsaw). In late 80s, Hanna-Barbera Poland produced in TVP's dubbing studios a new dub for VHS release of some episodes. In 90s, the series was shown in TV again (also by TVP through "Hanna Barbera Hour" block) but this time with voice-over. In 1998 the then-newly launched Polish feed of Cartoon Network started showing a new, third dub which is the only official dub shown in TV since then.
</li><li> There are six Italian dubs of the series. The first dub, from 1963, covered part of season 1. The second dub, from 1968-1975, covered parts of seasons 2 and 3. The third dub, from the late 1970's, covered seasons 5-6, and the un-dubbed episodes from seasons 1-3. The fourth dub, from the 1980's, covered season 4 and the last 8 episodes of season 3. The fifth dub, from the 1990's, re-dubbed a few episodes from seasons 1 and 4; Sergio di Stefano reprised his role as Barney from the second dub. The sixth dub covered a few episodes; this dub aired on Mediaset and was released on home video.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheJetsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheJetsons">The Jetsons</a></em> was dubbed into Swedish twice. The first was done by Media Dubb for TV3 and Cartoon Network, while the second was made by Sun Studio for Cartoon Network only. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">Sun Studio's dub renames the characters</a>. (George to Haley, Jane to Stella, Judy to Ella, and Elroy to Olle.)
<ul><li> There are two Polish dubs: the first was made by Polskie Nagrania, included on VHS and later aired on TVP2 in 1991 and the second one was made in 1998 for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a>. The series actually premiered in Poland much earlier (in the first half of 1960s), but it was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceoverTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceoverTranslation">Voiceover Translation</a>.
</li><li> It was also dubbed into Hungarian three times. The original dub was made for TV-2 in 1990, the second dub was made for VHS in 1993-1994, and the current dub was made around 2003-2004 for Cartoon Network, Boomerang, and DVD.
</li></ul></li><li> When Finnish pay-tv channel MTV3 Juniori that focuses on quality children's programming started airing animated series from the 80's and 90's for nostalgic purposes, they had to redub them all, because they were not allowed to use the old dubs made by another channel. The new dubs were also used for later DVD-releases of some the shows. The new dubs were of great quality, but the intended nostalgic effect of airing those shows didn't work out because the familiar voices were replaced.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Adaptation</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWindInTheWillows1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWindInTheWillows1983">The Wind in the Willows</a></em> from the '80s was dubbed twice in Finnish: a dub with one actor playing all the roles released only on video, and one with several actors and aired on TV.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em> has two Japanese dubs, but only one covered the whole series. The other is fairly obscure (being briefly broadcast on a smaller satellite station), and was called "Powerpuff Girls Underground". For the record, it only lasted 26 episodes. The other dub is far better known, and was even broadcast on TV Tokyo before finishing its run on Cartoon Network Japan. The cast for that dub was also used for the movie and the Christmas special.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em> has two Russian dubs made for two different channels, one of which was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceoverTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceoverTranslation">Voiceover Translation</a>. Both translations seem to have almost the same script. The 2x2 voiceover only covers the first season, while the other one covers all four. When 2x2 started airing books 2-4, they used the dub instead of voiceover. Strangely, Korra's VA is the same in both versions. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouLookFamiliar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouLookFamiliar">Even more strangely</a>, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossDressingVoices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossDressingVoices">the same VA that voiced Aang</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a> dub.
</li><li> Several early-dubbed Latin Spanish episodes from the first two seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BobTheBuilder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BobTheBuilder">Bob the Builder</a></em> ("Bob's Barnraising" and "Wendy's Busy Day" for example) were redone to keep up with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalEvolution">vocal continuity</a> of a few characters. (For example, in the early-dubbed episodes, Muck and Roley's Spanish voices were originally deeper, while Lofty's voice was a tad bit higher.)
<ul><li> For the Russian version, only the theme song was dubbed twice; with the latter version being done for DVD releases and subsequent airings on JimJam.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends">Garfield and Friends</a></em> has two Japanese dubs: one on WOWOW, and the other on Cartoon Network Japan.
<ul><li> It also has two dubs in Hungary, one made for MTV<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note26o8kl');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note26o8kl" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note26o8kl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">No, not <em>that</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV">MTV</a>, but Magyar Telev&iacute;zi&oacute;, the original Hungarian public service network</span>, and one for RTL Klub. Besides sharing Garfield's voice actor, they're fairly different &mdash; the more recent one for example didn't dub the theme song.
</li><li> There were also two Polish dubs: one on Polsat and its related channels (which was basically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceoverTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceoverTranslation">Voiceover Translation</a> with dubbed theme songs), and the other (fully dubbed) on TVP1.
</li><li> Brazil has at least three, one in the VHS releases, the best-known one that aired on TV, and a third for the DVD (that only got season one released).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a></em> has three different Greek dubs. The series was originally dubbed on ERT, but the masters for the original dub were lost and only 45 episodes are known to have been saved. The second dub was mainly used for VHS releases, while the more recent dub first aired on STAR and exists currently on DVD releases.
<ul><li> The show also had two German dubs. The original dub was made only for the first two seasons on ZDF from 1983-1984. This dub was widely forgotten (and currently extinct), after the more recent and well-known dub first aired on Tele 5 in 1988. Aside from sharing Gargamel's voice actor, the second dub also featured a new cast and kept Clumsy's English name intact. (The ZDF dub occasionally named him "Trotteli" from the comic books.)
</li><li> The Polish version (known as <em>Smerfy</em>) is a bit complicated:
<ul><li> The series was originally dubbed from 1987 to 1999 on TVP. Seasons 1-3, 5, and (partially) 6-8 were done first, while seasons 4 and 9 (and the rest of season 7) were later done in the 90s.
</li><li> In 2005, TVP re-broadcasted seasons 5, 6, 7, and 9 in 2005, but at the time, a majority of the original master tapes were either lost or damaged. So, from 2006 to 2009, seasons 1-4 were redubbed by TVP's personal studio with new voices for some characters (but with the same recording of the theme from the original dub), though some episodes kept their original dub intact. Several episodes that have not received a Polish version yet were later dubbed for the first time in 2010.
</li></ul></li><li> In Czechoslovakia/the Czech Republic, the show's first five seasons were originally dubbed on the channel &#268;ST from 1988 to 1993. Seasons 6 through 8 were later dubbed from 1997 to 2000 for the channel TV Nova, and then the entire series (including season 9) was re-dubbed in 2010 for TV Barrandov.
</li><li> It also had two Arabic dubs. While the latter was made for the Arabic Cartoon Network (presumably because Turner Broadcasting could not get the rights to broadcast the original, as that dub's rights are held by Spacetoon), the original dub was restored for online and DVD releases. The first dub was distributed (and possibly dubbed) by a company called Fimali, as seen in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.retrojunk.com/content/child/credits/page/3977/the-smurfs/4#/content/child/credits/1221/show">that dub's credits<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. The show airs on both Spacetoon and Cartoon Network nowadays, so kids are confused by the original 80's dub and the new dub.
</li><li> It was also dubbed into Brazilian Portuguese twice. The original was done for Rede Globo by Herbert Richers in 1982 and the newer was made for DVD at Dublavideo in 2011.
</li><li> There were also two Turkish dubs as well; both were done for TRT, while the newer was preserved for Cartoon Network.
</li><li> The show also had two dubs in Finland. The first dub was made for VHS releases. It was basically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceoverTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceoverTranslation">Voiceover Translation</a> over the Swedish dub with the songs (and the theme) remaining in Swedish as well. The second (fully dubbed) aired on MTV3 Juniorilla.
</li><li> It also has two Serbian dubs (not counting a old voice-over from the 1980s): one in 2009 for TV on B92 and the other in 2011 for DVD.
</li><li> The series was dubbed into Croatian twice, first during its original run in the 80s by TVZ and then a second time later on in the late 90s/early 2000 by HRT. While the first dub is mostly absent from official releases on DVDs and VHS tapes as well as TV re-runs, several season 1 episodes with the original dub are featured on the DVDs and re-runs and the rest are no longer officially available.
</li><li> The show has also received at least four Slovenian dubs. There's the original TV dub from 1987, a home video dub from the early 2000s, the 2011 DVD re-dub by SDI Media, and the 2014 TV re-dub by Studio Menart for POP TV. Most of the voice actors from the 1987 dub reprised their roles in the 2014 POP TV re-dub.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfSuperMarioBros3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfSuperMarioBros3">The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3</a></em> has two dubs in Finnish. The original was made in 1998 for VHS tapes released by Finnkino, and the redub was made in 2013 for DVD.
<ul><li> It was also dubbed into Brazilian Portuguese three times. The first dub by Herbert Richers does not use the original background music from episodes 15 to 26, being replaced by Isao Tomita compositions. A second dub was made by BKS for a VHS release. The third dub, made by Uniarthe for DVD in 2006, was negatively received, and Toad was renamed to "Todd".
</li><li> It also has two Greek dubs.
</li><li> There are two European Portuguese dubs as well: one on SIC, and the other on KidsCo.
</li><li> It was also dubbed into Hungarian twice; once in 1993 and again in 2006.
</li><li> It also had two French dubs; with the redub being made exclusively for KidsCo.
</li><li> The show also received two dubs in Spain. The 1st dub is a more accurate translation of the English version, whereas the 2nd dub had many changes and mistakes (particularly regarding to character's names and episode titles).
<ul><li> It was also dubbed into Latin Spanish twice; the Los Angeles dubbing is more well-known than the short-lived dubbing from Mexico. The voices from the former dub returned for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a></em>.
</li><li> On another note, there's also a difference between the Latin American and the 2nd Spain dub title of the series: In Latin America, the duo is known as the Super "Mario" Brothers, with "Super" being an adjective to "Mario" which is their last name, whereas in Spain, they are the "Super Mario" Brothers, with "Super Mario" being sort of their last name.)
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Most of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> shorts were dubbed multiple times in Italian. Curiously, the DVD sets keep older dubs of some shorts.
<ul><li> The shorts were originally dubbed into French during 1962 and then again around 1997.
</li><li> It was also dubbed into Spanish multiple times.
</li><li> The earliest Brazilian Portuguese dubs of the cartoons were done twice during the 1960s by Cinecastro and TV Cinesom respectively. (A comparison between the '60s dubbings of a Bugs Bunny cartoon can be seen <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZvIFJdIs5U">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.) The newer dubs were commissioned in the 90s by Herbert Richers.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em> has two Hungarian dubbings. The original aired on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a>, while the newer one (retitled "<em>League of Superheroes</em>") debuted on RTL Klub. Although the voices were recast, the new version features many returning voice actors from a number of previous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC</a> dubs, including the show's very own original dub &mdash; for instance the new Superman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleReprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleReprise">has already been</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ManOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ManOfSteel">another Superman</a>, as well as John Stewart in the original dub.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarTrekTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarTrekTheAnimatedSeries">Star Trek: The Animated Series</a></em> got dubbed twice in Germany. The first dub was made for ZDF, who made the series "kiddie-friendly" by removing several episodes and editing the remaining episodes to half-length. When Paramount heard negative talk of the dub from enraged fans in 1994 during the preparations for releasing the series on VHS, they got all the dub voice actors and responsible people that did the second half of TOS (that series got dubbed in two waves, the second one in the late 80's) and made a more faithful dub. This dub is also used on DVD.
<ul><li> The animated series was also redubbed into Brazilian Portuguese in 2016.
</li></ul></li><li> Because the rights for the Italian dub of the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpaceGoofs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpaceGoofs">Space Goofs</a></em> are expired, in 2014 the whole season was redubbed&#133; but for some reason it was done by a completely different voice cast and with a translation very faithful to the English script, detail made more clashing when season 2 came into reruns some months later and it kept the original dub with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism">his own particular adaptation choices</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Stoked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Stoked">St&#333;ked</a></em> has two Romanian dubs. One produced by Ager Film in Bucharest for Disney Character Voices International (a Disney subsidary) just for Disney Channel airings and the other one produced by BTI Studio in Oradea for Megamax. The latter dub covers both seasons.
</li><li> The first two seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeppaPig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeppaPig">Peppa Pig</a></em> have received two Polish dubs. The first dub was produced by GMC Studio which is distributed on DVD by SDT Film and aired on <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMini">Mini Mini</a>+, while the second one was produced by TVP in their own dubbing studios Telewizja Polska Agencja Filmowa. However, starting from the third season the GMC Studio dub also airs on TVP's channels.
<ul><li> The Italian dub is usually recorded in Rome, but for some reason the second season was recorded in Turin. That season was redubbed by the usual cast in 2013.
</li><li> The Latin American Spanish dub was originally done in Venezuela in 2006 for Boomerang. When Discovery Kids acquired the rights to <em>Peppa</em>, they redubbed the whole series in Mexico.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget">Inspector Gadget</a></em> has two Greek dubs. Both share the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeForeignThemeSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeForeignThemeSong">Alternative Foreign Theme Song</a>, heard <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcEt-L-DTbo">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, although infrequently the newer dub uses the English theme and the older dub uses <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/v/wDWWtMFrCsA?start=00&amp;end=59">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. The two dubs handle credits differently. The opening of the old dub overlays the credits onto the intro and cuts out the Inspector Gadget title at the end. The new dub uses the English intro as the source of the video portion. As for the closing credits, the old dub appears to repeat the opening credits, whereas the new dub uses the original credits and ending theme. A voice can be heard giving dub credits. After the last "Inspector Gadget" and announcer finishes giving the dub credits, Dr. Claw says his "I'll get you next time Gadget. NEXT TIME!" (or equivalent line) in Greek.
<ul><li> There are two Italian dubs too. The first one was based on the French dub, using the character names from that dub, having a translated version of Noam Kamiel's remix of the classic theme song and even had Gadget speaking with a French accent. The second dub was based on the English version.

Various TVP channels had shown only the first 16 episodes of 2nd season while TVN had shown the whole series (and dubbed the whole 1st season and remaining episodes of season 2 plus those 6 episodes in studio "Master Film"). Currently DHX Media distributes dubs as they were shown on TVN.
</li><li> There are also two Arabic dubs. The original from the 1980s, made for Tele-Pictures Promoters International S.A., changed the names of the characters, had an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeForeignThemeSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeForeignThemeSong">Alternative Foreign Theme Song</a>, and was rather cheaply made (as in they didn't use the official M&amp;E track and instead used the original English audio track but overlaid it with Arabic pop music, muting it whenever the characters spoke in English to allow the Arabic voice actors to talk over it). In addition, some episodes <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2ph8mpJE48">had a woman give a preview of the episode to the viewers<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. The newer one, which is available on the Arabic version of the official Inspector Gadget YouTube channel, keeps the original English theme (but leaves it instrumental) and the original names (and uses the official M&amp;E track).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget2015">Inspector Gadget (2015)</a></em> has two Hungarian dubs, one for Boomerang, and another for M2 that was more faithful to the dub of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget">original series</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Babar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Babar">Babar</a></em> has three Arabic dubs. One was done by Al-Markaz Al-Arabi Studios in Jordan in the 1980's for broadcast on various regional television stations, and another was done by Venus Company in Syria in the late 90's-early 2000's for Eastern Vision S.A. and Spacetoon, likely because the elements to the original dub were lost. The third one was done by Neo Productions in Egypt (probably for KidsCo). The first two dubs have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeForeignThemeSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeForeignThemeSong">different theme songs compared to the original version</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMagicSchoolBus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMagicSchoolBus">The Magic School Bus</a></em> was dubbed twice in Arabic. The first was done by Venus Company for Tele-Pictures Promoters International S.A. and the second was done by a unknown studio for Jeem.
<ul><li> Because of alternative rights holders, the series has Netflix-exclusive dubs in European Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, Japanese, French, German, Italian and Polish. Patrizia Scianca (Ralphie) and Emanuela Pacotto (Janet) returned for the Italian Netflix dub, while most of the Brazilian cast returned for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMagicSchoolBusRidesAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMagicSchoolBusRidesAgain">The Magic School Bus Rides Again</a></em>.

One was broadcast on the Panda Biggs channel, another for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a>, and another is shown on RTP 2 channel. The latter dub completely changes the name of the series and of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">many of the characters</a> to names that are common in the country. The Cartoon Network dub keeps the original names of the characters and keeps the name of the series closer to its original English name. Sandra de Castro appeared in the Panda and SIC dubs, and Ana Vieira appeared in the Panda and Cartoon Network dubs as various female contestants.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory">Dexter's Laboratory</a></em> had originally an Italian dub made in Rome for its first airing on pay TV, but it was redubbed in Milan for subsequent airings on regular channels, which also replaced the older dub on pay TV. The only episode of the Roman dub still available today is "Chicken Scratch", available as an extra on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a> Movie</em> DVD.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TopCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TopCat">Top Cat</a></em> was dubbed twice in Polish. The first was for VHS releases by Polskie Nagrania, and was called Kot Tip Top (lit. Tippy Cat). Because the first dub was incomplete, a new dub called Kocia Ferajna (lit. Catfellas) was made for Cartoon Network's Poland feed.
</li><li> In the Italian dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu">Wakfu</a></em>, Yugo's voice actor was replaced in Season 2, and for some reason they also redubbed Season 1 with the new Yugo voice. Curiously, this new dub of season 1 is used only for airings on Cartoon Network Italy, while airings on the free channel Boing and Netflix keep the original dub with Yugo's first voice.
<ul><li> Almost same thing happened with first 8 episodes of 2nd Season of the Polish dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball">The Amazing World of Gumball</a></em>, where they redubbed all of Gumball's lines (by the way in the 1st dub of those episodes, Mi&#322;osz Konkel's voice already cracked) in those episodes with his current actor (Jakub Zdr&oacute;jkowski).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MagicAdventuresOfMumfie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MagicAdventuresOfMumfie">Magic Adventures of Mumfie</a></em> has two German dubs. The first covers the Mumfie's Quest arc and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Mumfie's White Christmas special</a>, while the second half covers the post-Mumfie's Quest episodes, and also had character name changes. For example, Mumfie, who was originally called Mamfie, changed his name to his English one, and Scarecrow changed his name from Vogelscheuche to Strohkopf (which means "blockhead" or "idiot" in Germany.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SupermanTheAnimatedSeriesS2E16To18WorldsFinest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SupermanTheAnimatedSeriesS2E16To18WorldsFinest">The Superman-Batman Movie: World's Finest</a></em> got two different Italian dubs, one for airings inside <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries">Superman: The Animated Series</a></em> and one for the DVD release. The amusing fact is that, while the first dub was done for the cartoon and so uses the regular voice cast for Superman characters while giving new voices for the Batman cast, the DVD version was dubbed in Milan, and so used the regular cast from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note29ha0s');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note29ha0s" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note29ha0s');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It was actually dubbed years later than the Batman series, since Harley Queen's voice actress is the same heard only starting with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBatman">The Batman</a></em></span> with new voices for Superman characters.
</li><li> In the early years of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>, the promotional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DVD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DVD">DVDs</a> with demo dubs of "The Ticket Master" were distributed across the Europe and Latin America. (The Greek and Quebec French demo versions were hosted on the respect local editions of official MLP website.) The voice cast (and of course, dialogue translation) in those demo dubs are different from later-produced broadcast dubs. The Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian dubs in the discs distributed across Baltic region are perhaps the only versions in these languages with multiple voice performers: the versions broadcast on TV each have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceoverTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceoverTranslation">single voice actress narrate over like TV news interpreters</a>. But other than that...
<ul><li> In some of Central and Eastern European languages, there are dubs each produced for Minimax and various other channels (notably Serbian with Mini Ultra; the Mini Ultra dub also aired on the public TV channel RTS 2). Hungarian has the same episodes redubbed, all broadcast on Minimax. In Slovenian, there are two versions each produced for Minimax and free-to-air generalist Pop TV.
<ul><li> The Hungarian dub notably redubbed the episodes where Babs Seed and Derpy Hooves were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossDressingVoices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossDressingVoices">accidentally voiced by men</a>, as well as some of the ponies' singing voices in Season 2.
</li></ul></li><li> There are two Cantonese versions of the show: one is first released on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DVD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DVD">DVDs</a> and then broadcast on PCCW's Now Hong Kong and <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViuTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViuTV">Viu TV</a>; the other, uploaded by Hasbro Hong Kong's YouTube channel, has some of character and location names in English remain intact, and some songs sung in Cantonese (sometimes, the YouTube channel seems to upload some episodes from the former<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note303n12');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note303n12" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note303n12');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">As in 'former' and 'latter', not 'previous name'.</span> dub, where all the names are translated in Chinese, and the singing part of the songs in English are kept).
</li><li> Not counting the demo DVD, the Croatian dub first arrived on the scene in November 2014, airing on HRT 2. Three years later - in November 2017 - RTL Kockica began airing the show as well with an entirely new dub, providing the country with two dubs of contrasting qualities (the original, for example, came with strangely common audio mixing errors<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note31sz0t');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note31sz0t" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note31sz0t');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">with some audio taken from Serbian Mini Ultra dub</span> while the newer one does its best to avoid them).

The reason for the redub was due to complaints from some parents to NRK (Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation) that SpongeBob's original voice was annoying. As a result, since the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpongebobSquarepantsMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpongebobSquarepantsMovie">first movie</a> retains the older voices, the Blu-Ray release of said film presents it in English with Norwegian subtitles, as not to confuse modern viewers (or likely because Paramount Norway couldn't redub the movie with the new voice actors due to them being busy with the current dub and other projects) <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note32z6mx');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note32z6mx" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note32z6mx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> You can find the dub of the movie on the Norwegian feed for Netflix.</span>.
<ul><li> The series has two Turkish dubs: one for CNBC-e, and another for Nickelodeon. Oya Pros&ccedil;iler voiced Sandy Cheeks in both dubs, while some of CNBC's voice actors returned for the first movie.
</li><li> SpongeBob in general tends to have this a lot. One ridiculous example is that there are <strong>8 Persian dubs</strong>.
<ul><li> Several only covered a select few episodes. For example, Asia Resane Cinema Home Entertainment's dub only covers four episodes from season 9. Glory Entertainment's covers 22 episodes from 5 seasons. It was released between 2014 to 2017. Homa Media's covers only <em>2 and a half episodes</em>.
</li><li> IRIB <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TV2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TV2">TV 2</a>'s dub is one of only two dubs to be official. It covered 2 seasons and was released from 2011 to 2016. The other official dub is MBC Persia's, which started at season 9.
</li><li> Parsian Studios' dub is the only complete dub, and has gained infamy on the internet for it's <a class="urllink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/international-entertainment-project/images/c/c5/Sandypsimcensor.png">poor censorship<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> and the fact that it has been used for <strong>military propaganda.</strong> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ii9DZlYCqU">No, we're not kidding.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>

Originally part of Season 3 in the US, the episode (along with "Land before Prime") was rescheduled to air during Season 2 in Hungary to make up for two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">missing episodes</a>. It then received a new dub when airing as part of Season 3.

There was a dub that aired on TNT and Nickelodeon in the mid-late 2000's, and a more recent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceoverTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceoverTranslation">Voiceover Translation</a> on Paramount Comedy (the Russian equivalent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ComedyCentral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ComedyCentral">Comedy Central</a>).

This dub was originally aired (on all places) on Disney Channel Israel, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop">later moved to Zoom</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WolvesWitchesAndGiants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WolvesWitchesAndGiants">Wolves, Witches and Giants</a></em> got two Norwegian dubs. The first one was made for airing on the Channel <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TV2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TV2">TV 2</a>, while the second one was made for the DVD release.
</li><li> The classic series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FiremanSam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FiremanSam">Fireman Sam</a></em> has two Norwegian dubs: one that was aired on television and one that was made for VHS tapes released by Viking Media.
<ul><li> There also seem to exist two Croatian dubs: one for a unknown channel that has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeForeignThemeSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeForeignThemeSong">Alternative Foreign Theme Song</a> and the more recent one for HRT.
</li><li> Also for some reason, in addition to the well-known Polish dub for TVP, there exists a lesser-known voiceover translation.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SylvanianFamilies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SylvanianFamilies">Sylvanian Families</a></em> has two Norwegian dubs, one made for the VHS release and the other one for airing on Fox Kids.
</li><li> The first four seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine">Thomas the Tank Engine</a></em> has two Norwegian dubs. One for TV and one for VHS. Interestingly enough, Trine Lossius Borg who did the narrator voice in the first two seasons of the TV dub also voiced the narrator in all four seasons of the VHS dub.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpaceGhostCoastToCoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpaceGhostCoastToCoast">Space Ghost Coast to Coast</a></em>: When the show first aired, a Latin-Spanish dub was produced by Turner Broadcasting System in Los Angeles at Springwest Productions. In 1999, after six seasons were dubbed and Turner was purchased by TimeWarner (now called Warner Media), a new dub was commissioned by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a> at the Venezuelan company <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EtceteraGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EtceteraGroup">Etcetera Group</a>, who had already established a relationship with Warner (with notable examples of their work for them being the 1990's Warner Bros. Saturday morning cartoons (including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures">Tiny Toon Adventures</a></em>), the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAU">DCAU</a></em> (which, at that point, consisted of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries">Superman: The Animated Series</a></em>) and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Beetlejuice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Beetlejuice">Beetlejuice</a></em>). The LA dub is mostly forgotten about (though it has been seen on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TBS">TBS</a> broadcast), while the Venezuela dub has been credited as cementing Warner's partnership with Etcetera, which still continues to this day.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall">Redwall</a></em> has two Russian dubs: one by the SV-Kadr studio for TNT and one made by Ukraine's Pilot studio. The Pilot dub was made as part of a larger incentive by companies to produce quality Russian dubs of TV shows using cheap Russian-speaking Ukrainian talent (a notable other example being the early seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em>, also dubbed into Russian by Pilot)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StreetSharks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StreetSharks">Street Sharks</a></em> has two European Spanish dubs - one by Studio XXI in Galicia and one by Alta Frecuencia in Seville. The second dub has almost all the characters speaking with Southern Spanish accents, and the result was somewhat odd. There were a few changes in the script (notably, the main characters still adress themselves by their real names, and Dr. Piranoid's name is really Piranoid, from the start), and it's curious to hear how Piranoid is the only character in the show without a Southern Spanish accent.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PostmanPat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PostmanPat">Postman Pat</a></em>: The 2004 series has at least three Polish dubs: one by TVP (which continued the tradition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToHimself">Talking to Himself</a> from previous series, as Jerzy Kramarczyk still voices all the characters in this dub), one by Start International Polska for CBeebies, and one by Master Film for MiniMini.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/NoddysToylandAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/NoddysToylandAdventures">Make Way For Noddy</a></em> has two European Portugese dubs. The first, <em>Abram Alas para o Noddy</em>, aired on RTP and Canal Panda in 2002, while the second, <em>A&iacute; Vem o Noddy</em>, was made for JimJam in 2016.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyBravo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyBravo">Johnny Bravo</a></em> has two Hungarian dubs. The first aired on the channel TV2 around the turn of the millennium and only covered the early episodes. This dub is considered lost, the sole fact still known about it is Johnny's dubbing actor (J&oacute;zsef Kerekes). A second dub was produced in 2007 to be aired on Cartoon Network, Boomerang and Viasat3. Despite being more recent, the 2nd dub featured plenty of oddities and inconsistencies, for example the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover">crossover</a> episode with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooWhereAreYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooWhereAreYou">Scooby-Doo</a></em> used neither the voices, nor the established terminology from the otherwise relatively consistent Hungarian <em>Scooby</em> dubs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfTintin1991" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfTintin1991">The Adventures of Tintin (1991)</a></em> haves two Italian dubs: the first one was done in 1992 and aired on Rai Uno, while the second aired from 2011 onwards on Italia 1 and Boing and is now available on both Netflix and Prime Video.
