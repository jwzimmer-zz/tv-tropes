<div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>A lot of media (especially science fiction and fantasy) features societies with no gender restrictions. Women fight alongside men, in the same combat roles, in command, and so on. Because it's a societal norm, no one considers this unusual. Hereditary monarchies can be ruled by women as well as men, despite a real-world historical restriction on women ruling the kingdom in many countries.
</p><p>This is <strong>not</strong> the same as splitting the sexes up into segregated units. When this trope is used, mixed units are the norm, and by extension often a completely integrated society as well in which the <em>only</em> difference between the sexes, in a social sense, is that one can get pregnant and the other can impregnate. In a Science Fiction story where test-tube-and-incubator babies are common, even this is removed and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamusIsAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamusIsAGirl">if the soldier is encased in armor, you can't tell what gender he/she is</a>, and it doesn't matter anyway.

Stories where the majority of military units are male and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple">occasionally</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSquadette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSquadette">you find a girl</a> do not apply. Nor do militaries where women are common but are restricted to certain roles (especially if those are noncombat roles). Nor do stories where there are women in combat roles, but they are consistently portrayed as falling into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl">Faux Action Girl</a> trope.
</p><p>This can be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified Trope</a>, especially in futuristic settings where advances in technology have made physical differences like gender more or less irrelevant for soldiers. In medieval fantasy settings, authors may introduce some form of safe, reliable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyContraception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyContraception">Fantasy Contraception</a>, or the existence of inborn magic powers can be portrayed as making differences in size and strength less relevant, or there may be other social pressures encouraging gender equality (although all of these may or may not be convincing, depending on how well they're handled). If the setting is not Earth and/or the characters are not normal humans, they may just have less sexual dimorphism. On the other hand, there are also plenty of cases of lazy or thoughtless worldbuilding, as well as cases where the author simply felt they needed no justification beyond <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>There are a wide variety of possible reasons for this. Sometimes it's pure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal">Author Appeal</a>: the author thinks a mixed-sex military setting is simply more awesome than a segregated one, or wanted to write about heterosexual relationships within such a setting, or wanted to have a female protagonist in such a setting without having to worry about showing her struggling with prejudice (which would become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anvilicious</a> rather quickly). In role-playing games (video or tabletop), it may be done to make sure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun">players are never penalized for wanting to play a character of their own gender</a>. Sometimes it's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">Author Tract</a> (or, in the best case scenario, a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped">Some Anvils Need to Be Dropped</a>), with the author trying to make a point about how gender restrictions are good or bad.

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em> series, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePolice">TSAB</a> Armed Forces (and probably the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChurch">Saint Church</a> Knights) make no gender distinctions whatsoever (although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobablyFemaleCast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobablyFemaleCast">most notable characters are female</a>, but that comes with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">the genre</a>, not the setting), and there isn't even a single instance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldntHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldntHitAGirl">Wouldn't Hit a Girl</a> in the series. In-universe, this is justified by magic equaling out biological differences between genders (an average female mage is just as strong and durable physically as a male one&mdash;and much more so than a male muggle), and by the TSAB being so short on hands, they'll employ anyone with magical talent, regardless of other considerations.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em>: Despite carrying the label of "training for girls" by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">Fanon</a>, in the anime, the gender ratio of Coordinators is equal to that of Trainers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam</a></em>. Captain Bright: "This is the military! Gender is irrelevant!" Although Kamille does note that women serving in the military in equal capacity is a relatively new development for the Universal Century.
<ul><li> Even back in the One Year War, it's shown that the idea of women serving on the front lines isn't unheard of.
</li><li> It also becomes a recurring element in a number of <em>Gundam</em> works later on, especially for the Universal Century. It's also very much present in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam">&forall; Gundam</a></em>, also directed by Tomino.

Even in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleSixtyThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleSixtyThree">Nyotalia</a> version, the ladies are just as capable.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>. Mortality rates are so high for the military, and the situation facing humanity <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessWar">so desperate</a>, that gender is completely irrelevant. Female soldiers are everywhere, occupying the same roles as their male peers, and held to the same standards. We see leadership in the form of Squad Leaders like Rico and Rene, and Mikasa being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a> is not considered unusual. It is also noteworthy that the artwork also focuses on the androgynous look of most female soldiers, thanks to realistically athletic builds and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnkemptBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnkemptBeauty">lack of focus</a> on their looks. Matters are helped by advanced technological gadgets that, with enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a>, allow even the tiny, 90-pounds-when-soaking-wet Krista be a formidable force of destruction on the battlefield. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> even states that gender has no bearing on the story, and welcomed readers to decide the gender of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGender">ambiguous</a> characters like Hange and Nanaba as they please.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, there are plenty of female commanders in the military of both Britannia and (what we see of) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeassAkitoTheExiled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeassAkitoTheExiled">Europia</a>. About half of the Knights of the Rounds (a Britannian military unit second only to the Imperial Family) that we see in the series are female. There are also many prominent female scientists, particularly in what we see of Europia. In the end, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> there is no issue with the deceased emperor's sister inheriting the throne as opposed to one of the many surviving half-brothers</span>.

</li><li> The first generation of warriors in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore">Claymore</a></em> started like this. However, it is implied that there were more male than female warriors. However, it quickly became apparent that men with yoma-powers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderRestrictedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderRestrictedAbility">can not handle well</a>, so that after that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade">only women were made warriors</a>.

<ul><li> The military in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens">Aliens</a></em> is integrated. The only mention of gender in the military happens when Hudson asks Pvt. Vasquez if she has ever been mistaken for a man, and she replies "No. Have you?" <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Alien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Alien">Alien</a></em> is an even more extreme example. The script was specifically written to only call characters by their last names and ranks to make them as gender neutral as possible, so as to avoid standard horror movie gender tropes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GIJane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GIJane">G.I. Jane</a></em>. The film's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">aesop</a> is that militaries should be this way. The main character runs into the gender barrier when she joins up for the grueling SEAL training program (even receiving preferential treatment at first that defeats the whole purpose of integration) not simply because she's a woman, but because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreTheExpendableGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreTheExpendableGender">Men Are the Expendable Gender</a>. Interestingly, Master Chief Urgayle also cites a real-world limitation of this trope, discovered when the Israelis and Russians both tried to field gender-unified combat units: men seem to have an instinctual urge to protect women, even when the women in question are fellow soldiers. In the case of the Israelis, this led to a degradation of unit cohesion, as the male soldiers would abandon their mission to rescue wounded female colleagues. (The Russians abandoned the idea of employing female combat soldiers, while the Israelis began using segregated combat units of both all-male or all-female combat soldiers.)
</li><li> Odd variation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy">Guardians of the Galaxy</a></em>: not only is the Nova Corps (an armed force) gender-neutral, <em>so is its prison</em>, the Kyln. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Gamora" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Gamora">Gamora</a> and at least one other female prisoner are mixed in with the male prison population.

</li><li> Kingsmen, evidently, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingsmanTheSecretService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingsmanTheSecretService">Kingsman: The Secret Service</a></em>. Nobody bats an eye at Amelia and Roxy's efforts to get into the agency. This gets particular notice when all three remaining candidates, including Roxy, are tasked with seducing a young woman and nobody makes any indication of her task being harder or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOnGirlIsHot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOnGirlIsHot">sexier</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarshipTroopers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarshipTroopers">Starship Troopers</a></em> not only featured men and women serving in the same infantry unit, they even shared the same bathroom and shower facilities. High school sports teams are also mixed, so this is wider than just the military.

Heinlein</a> and is <em>very</em> different in the details. There <em>are</em> women in the military in Heinlein's book, but they're segregated by service: the Mobile Infantry is exclusively male, the Navy is at least mostly female (there apparently are some male Naval officers, but Rico doesn't ever actually mention meeting any and pilots are exclusively female); the two groups are segregated physically on the transport ships, only meeting at formal dinners (and even then only the officers).

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TanyaHuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TanyaHuff">Tanya Huff</a>:
<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Quarters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Quarters">Quarters</a></em> series plays this trope totally straight. Interestingly, though, it also draws attention to the trope by referring to many minor or background characters by their occupation &mdash; "two guards", "a secretary" &mdash; a few lines before the gendered pronoun is used. The reader then realizes that the guard or secretary to which s/he had unthinkingly assigned the "conventional" gender is, in fact, just the opposite. It is worth noting that in this series, sexual orientation is no object either; even <em>royal weddings</em> can be same-sex.
</li><li> The main character of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ConfederationOfValor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ConfederationOfValor">Confederation of Valor</a></em> series is a female <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">Space Marine</a> Gunnery Sergeant. More generally, the Confederate armed forces have more men than women, but this seems to be a simple case of men being more likely to sign up.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Circleverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Circleverse">Circleverse</a></em>, although told mostly from the point-of-view of female characters, features more-or-less gender parity within the religion, the army, and society at large. Some cultures have more restrictive views of the roles of women, but the viewpoint characters visiting said cultures always point this out.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TortallUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TortallUniverse">Tortall Universe</a></em>: The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BekaCooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BekaCooper">Beka Cooper</a></em> trilogy approaches this (although lady knights are still uncommon and there's plenty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableFeminineGoalsAndTraits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableFeminineGoalsAndTraits">comments about female Dogs</a>), but a religious movement called the Cult of the Gentle Mother is sweeping through and starting to influence things, much to the wrath of the protagonist. From later-set books, we know that it does take over and become the norm for later protagonists to struggle against.
</li></ul></li></ul><h3><strong>By Work:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlexisCarew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlexisCarew">Alexis Carew</a></em>: This is true in most countries and in New London's core worlds: there are more men than women in the military but this is mostly down to physical strength (aircraft pilots are split nearly evenly, whereas <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">Mini-Mecha</a> crewmen have to be able to service their machines under fire). However, many planets on New London's fringe have slid backward into patriarchy and sexism is more common.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AngelMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AngelMage">Angel Mage</a></em>: Gender discrimination doesn't seem to exist in this world. In fact, most positions of authority are held by women, with all Cardinals seen or mentioned being female. It's also mentioned that Kings of Sarance are by tradition expected to scheme ineffectually against the Queens (the real rulers).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em> allegedly there are as many female and male soldiers among the Andalites, but one sees almost only male ones.
<ul><li> But it's playing with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Hork-Bajirs</a> right now. The Yeerks use them regardless of gender because both genders are strong.
</li><li> Even when the Auxilary-Animorphs are created, gender does not matter in the selection of the original Animorphs.
</li></ul></li><li> A few places in the setting of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnnalsOfTheWesternShore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnnalsOfTheWesternShore">Annals of the Western Shore</a></em>. Gender seems to influence the division of labor, but they lack the sexism seen elsewhere. Namely the Uplands (the setting of the first book) where women can be clan leaders, and Ansul, where women used to have pretty good rights until the Alds took over.
</li><li> The United Space Forces in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArrivalsFromTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArrivalsFromTheDark">Arrivals from the Dark</a></em> appear to accept both genders equally. However, female officers are contract-bound to avoid pregnancies for the 5-year term. On the other hand, every book features a man as the main character.
</li><li> The island kingdom of Ithicana from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBridgeKingdomArchives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBridgeKingdomArchives">The Bridge Kingdom Archives</a></em> is so threatened by its neighbours that everyone needs to take part in its defense. Women train and fight alongside men and among Watch Commanders the number of men and women is roughly equal.
</li><li> The Imperial States of America in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Caliphate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Caliphate">Caliphate</a></em> deploys female soldiers in the field and no one in their side bats an eyelash about this, unlike the titular Caliphate which is a virulently misogynistic place that expects women to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">only wives, daughters, mothers or sex objects</a>. The main hero (an American soldier) discusses this with a slave girl from the Caliphate that back in his home, despite its many, <em>many</em> faults, at least women enjoy the same rights as men which floors her since she would never dream of such thing in the place she grew up.
</li><li> The <em>Celaeno Series</em> by Jane Fletcher. In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RangersAtRoadsend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RangersAtRoadsend">Rangers At Roadsend</a></em>, the protagonists are two female Rangers, members of a kind of elite unit in the military.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCulture">The Culture</a></em> takes this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. Not only have they left gender roles far behind, but part of their standard set of genetic enchantments is also the ability to go through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">fully functional sex change</a> (over the course of several months) at will. The protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePlayerOfGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePlayerOfGames">The Player of Games</a></em> is considered a bit odd because he's never even tried being female.
</li><li> In Western nations in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DarkShores" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DarkShores">Dark Shores</a></em> women work, fight, rule and are generally treated as equal to men &mdash; empress Ereni is a ruler and a warrior, and the most accomplished general in Gamdeshi army is the sultan's daughter. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> in the East, where women are treated as property of their men (fathers, brothers, husbands).
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>:
<ul><li> Dwarfs, initially. It turns out to be more complicated than that later on; <em>biological</em> sex seems to be genuinely inconsequential except for procreative purposes, but traditional dwarf culture has no concept of femininity and both sexes look like men, so they're basically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace">One-Gender Race</a> of men that just happens to have two different kinds of genitals. Traditionally, anyways. Midway through the series (beginning with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FeetOfClay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FeetOfClay">Feet of Clay</a></em>), some more modern female dwarfs begin to admit to being female and adopt human-style feminine behavior, which is controversial but increasingly popular. Whether this correlates with their biological sex depends on the dwarf; a female dwarf in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UnseenAcademicals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UnseenAcademicals">Unseen Academicals</a></em> is heavily implied to be biologically male.
</li><li> The desert-dwelling, combat-loving tribe of the D'Regs count as well.
<div class="indent"><strong>Carrot:</strong> Klatchians have very strict ideas about women fighting. <br><strong>D'Reg:</strong> Yes, we expect them to be good at it! We are <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">D'Regs</a></em>!
</div></li></ul></li><li> In Steven Brust's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragaera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragaera">Dragaera</a></em> series, the culture of the Dragaerans is like this, with women being just as likely to be pugnacious brawlers as the men. There is some slight amount of gender bias that occasionally pops up, such as when two female Dragaeran warriors ponder whether a male Dragaeran could possibly be attracted to a woman who could defeat him in a fight, but they eventually decide that it wouldn't matter. On the other hand, the human Easterners, who are based on real-world medieval Hungarians, tend to have a more real-world bias on gender roles.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EarthsChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EarthsChildren">Earth's Children</a></em> books by Jean M Auel.
<ul><li> The Cro-Magnon don't really care what gender does what in most parts of their life. A woman can hunt and a man can take care of the kids. The role of Shamans, however, is apparently often restricted to those we might now call genderqueer (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">as is common in many</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> cultures).
</li><li> Averted with the Neanderthals, in whom gender roles are so rigidly defined that they have become part of their genetic make-up. Thus men cannot learn women's skills such as cooking and gathering plants, while women cannot learn men's skills such as hunting. In addition, only men can become leaders or Shamen, but only women can learn the use of healing plants.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheForeverWar">The Forever War</a></em> is similar to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarshipTroopers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarshipTroopers">Starship Troopers</a></em>, but features a fully gender-integrated military... which before the end of the war is also fully homosexual as Earth society has moved on about a thousand years, literally.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GentlemanBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GentlemanBastard">Gentleman Bastard</a></em> sequence, there are female pirates, thieves, soldiers, sailors, and bouncers in about equal number to their male counterparts. This is never remarked on as being out of the ordinary. In fact, within their culture, rather than women being banned from sailing for fear of bringing bad luck, ships are <em>required</em> to have at least one woman on board, to avoid bringing the wrath of the sea god (though a female cat will do at a pinch).
</li><li> This is the case in all levels of society in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGreatLibrary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGreatLibrary">The Great Library</a></em>. Women serve as soldiers, scholars, spies, merchants, and any other occupations just as easily as men do, and gender is never brought up as being an issue.
</li></ul><ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>, women and men both serve in pretty much all positions of the Ministry of Magic, are Aurors (the wizarding equivalent of police officers), are teachers and heads of Hogwarts, and run their own businesses. Both genders also balance family lives (taking care of the home, dealing with the kids, etc.) and having careers and lives of their own.
</li><li> Men and women are Heralds in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MercedesLackey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MercedesLackey">Mercedes Lackey</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeraldsOfValdemar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeraldsOfValdemar">Heralds of Valdemar</a></em> stories. It's notable when a character or culture segregates the sexes for any reason. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyContraception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyContraception">contraceptive powder</a> allows control of reproduction.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> series, this is pretty much the default for the major interstellar polities. In the story, the reactions to integration by Grayson and Masada (both worlds being effectively religious patriarchies, with the latter treating women as nothing but property) often play a major role in the plot. Certain biological differences are still addressed, such as requiring all women in the service to be fitted with a 5-year contraceptive implant. If a woman decides to have a child, she may petition to have the implant deactivated but will be transferred to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceStation">Space Station</a> or a planet-side post. As the novel states, it may not be fair, but neither is biology. Then again, the Manticoran Navy does cover up to 75% cost of "tubing" a baby (i.e. putting the fetus into a tube to be grown to term), so a pregnant woman doesn't have to be "out-of-commission" for the full 9 months. The medical technology is so good that tubing is considered an outpatient procedure (i.e. no overnight hospital stay). At the same time, Honor's mother laments that many women are missing out on the "experience" of giving birth. Meanwhile, the other women think that she's insane for suggesting that.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames">The Hunger Games</a></em>: District Thirteen in <em>Mockingjay</em> seems to be this, particularly when it comes to their military. For that matter, the actual Hunger Games are deliberately set up with an equal number of boys and girls, and the audience makes bets on the contestants according to their skill and temperament, not their gender.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ImperialRadch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ImperialRadch">Imperial Radch</a></em> trilogy, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GalacticSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GalacticSuperpower">Galactic Superpower</a> of the Radch doesn't even have a societal concept of gender; since the viewpoint character is Radchaai, most characters are never explicitly gendered or sexed. One Radchaai character is outright confused at how another culture seems so fixated on which genitalia people have.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle">Inheritance Cycle</a></em>, there is almost no societal difference between male and female elves. They're both equally good at fighting, magic, what-have-you. They even dress the same and have the same hairstyles; when Arya disguises herself as a human woman, she admits she's always been a bit puzzled at the notion of women's clothing, and of men and women having different societal roles. The other three major races seem to abide by the concept that women stick to domestic work, with a minority of women in positions of power and almost none in combat. It is said that Urgal women, like men, gain station by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">defeating foes</a>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">we don't see any Urgal women until the very end of the series</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IslandInTheSeaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IslandInTheSeaOfTime">Island in the Sea of Time</a></em> and its sequels, the Republic of Nantucket's military allows both men and women to serve in combat roles. It also allows gays and lesbians to serve openly.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLeftHandOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLeftHandOfDarkness">The Left Hand of Darkness</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UrsulaKLeGuin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UrsulaKLeGuin">Ursula K. Le Guin</a> takes the basic idea so far it almost becomes disqualified as an example, as the human-descended people on the planet Gethen are all of both sexes (or neither); they take turns becoming "male" or "female" for reproduction. The human-as-we-know-it protagonist is really confused by this even after years of living there as an ambassador of sorts.
</li><li> The titular city-state in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Liavek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Liavek">Liavek</a></em> anthologies is very egalitarian gender-wise, including the military.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLostFleet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLostFleet">The Lost Fleet</a></em>, set far in humanity's future, both the Alliance and Syndic militaries and civilian governments appear to be completely gender-equal. Women are found at the same rate as men at every level of command from Alliance Senator on the Grand Council down to the average crew member on a warship.
</li><li> In the <em>Lyremouth Chronicles</em>, the average witch, wizard or, heaven forbid, sorcerer, is infinitely more powerful than the average muggle, and the chances of their appearance are completely random. When mistreating someone based on their gender as a child can lead to getting a fireball to the face as an adult, gender differences quickly fall to the wayside, and almost all jobs have an equal number of both genders in all roles. Averted outside the Protectorate where most of the action takes place, however; while inside it, new Witches and Sorcerers are protected by their kind, outside, they're mostly seen as a threat and eliminated as quickly as possible, leading to much more patriarchal or matriarchal societies (based on how much the different genders have been tinkered with by the local sorcerers).
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MalazanBookOfTheFallen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MalazanBookOfTheFallen">Malazan Book of the Fallen</a></em>, most of the cultures are largely equal-opportunity when it comes to daily life and war, especially the dominant Malazan Empire which considers itself egalitarian in all aspects. Two noted exceptions are the Tiste Edur tribes where the women rule the house and the men are warriors and the mercenary/holy order known as the Grey Swords, who are noted as unusual for not allowing women into their ranks. That also changes when they switch patron deities from the Boar of Summer to the Wolves of Winter and take in female recruits to supplement their torn ranks.
</li><li> Troll society in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaledictionTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaledictionTrilogy">Malediction Trilogy</a></em> works like that. What matters is a troll's level of magical power. Female trolls become warriors and mixed-blood work in mines alongside men.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMortalInstruments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMortalInstruments">The Mortal Instruments</a></em> shows a whole series of female <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nephilim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nephilim">shadowhunters</a>. They also have their share in the fight against demons and other evil creatures.
<ul><li> Even with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">fairies</a>, it is common for both men and women to fight.
</li><li> When a clan battles with vampires or werewolves, then both genders join in the fight.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OldKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OldKingdom">Old Kingdom</a></em> has no barriers to gender equality whatsoever. This is in sharp contrast with its non-magical neighbour to the south, Ancelstierre, which is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Fantasy Counterpart Culture</a> of early 20th-century Britain.
</li><li> The Colonial Defense Force from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OldMansWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OldMansWar">Old Man's War</a></em> series is mixed-gender, with males and females getting the same assignments. Justified in that every member of the CDF is issued a genetically-engineered body, with identical physical capabilities regardless of gender. (And since the genetic engineering leaves them all sterile, female soldiers never get sidelined by maternity leave.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians">Percy Jackson and the Olympians</a></em> and all his spinoffs and sequels, boys and girls fight side by side against monsters. Both genders can earn the respect of their comrades in combat, and there are about the same number of fatalities in combat for both genders.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidDrake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidDrake">David Drake</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RCN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RCN">RCN</a></em> series, despite the 18th and 19th century-style culture of the Republic of Cinnabar, the presence of women in combat roles is entirely unremarked upon. In the series, two of the deadliest characters in armed combat are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBookworm">Adele Mundy</a> and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler">"maid" Tovera</a>, the biggest and toughest crewmember is a woman, Mistress Sand is in charge of the Republic intelligence service, and Leary's official second in command is a woman as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall">Redwall</a></em>'s later books do this. The first book had female combatants on the heroes' side, but no mention of female <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> at all.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EclipsePhase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EclipsePhase">Eclipse Phase</a> most obviously follows this trope and goes beyond it. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transhuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transhuman">transhuman</a> future where bodies are just a shell that can be swapped easily (although expensively), and all bodies come with built-in immunity to sexually transmitted infection and can choose if they become pregnant or not, any and all conventional ideas of gender have pretty much fallen by the wayside. In the game, you have a separate gender for your body and mind and it's up to the players how they deal with that. Unless you do very extensive research, there is no real way to KNOW what gender a person is, whether they want to act male or female. Since not all people are human, or indeed humanoid, the issues presented in the game much more strongly run along species/artificial life prejudice than gender.
<ul><li> Slightly subverted in the case of the 'Fury' morph. This is a combat body that is built to be strong and tough and kick some serious butt, but the designers made them all women to give them a better inclination towards teamwork and less naked aggression.
</li></ul></li><li> RPGs in general. There's no restriction on character gender in most of them, with <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> the most obvious.
<ul><li> Though we must point out that 1st edition D&amp;D had a "fighting man" class, and there is an apocryphal story about Gary Gygax killing a character without a save in the first round of combat because "girls can't fight".
</li><li> And there was a quickly excised rule that female characters automatically had a penalty for their strength (in turn getting a slight bonus to their Charisma). See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFavoredGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFavoredGender">Game-Favored Gender</a>.
<ul><li> What the game did have, all through 1st Edition, was an upper limit on female strength - it affected only those females who played fighters, rolled an 18 for strength, followed by 51% or higher on the "exceptional strength" bonus. Anyone of either sex who wasn't a fighter didn't roll the bonus percentage even if they had an 18 strength, nor (obviously) did anyone who didn't have an 18 strength in the first place; and the various belts and gloves that conferred fantastic strength worked just fine regardless of the gender of the wearer. Eventually, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TSR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TSR">TSR</a> caved and this rule went the way of all flesh.
</li><li> For female <em>humans</em>, that was the extent of the issue. Female demihumans' Strength-ceilings often kicked in a full point before their male counterparts', placing them at a serious disadvantage in combat classes. This, for races in which biological gender differences were otherwise less overt than humans'.
</li><li> Dragon Magazine's letter column had one particular GM explaining his "balanced" house rule for his games, where female characters received a -2 strength penalty in return for the advantage of being capable of bearing children. The replies were... agitated, to say the least.
</li></ul></li><li> An interesting in-universe case: although there are no technical restrictions for the player characters, Drow society is pretty much 50% <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMatriarch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMatriarch">Evil Matriarch</a>, 50% <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> everyone else. Many players of male Drow (who aren't just trying to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">Drizzt 2.0</a>) play themselves as having come out of the Underdark so they can have better goals in life than being the "lucky" consort of a powerful enough woman that gets to be a walking sperm bank for longer than a few mating sessions before she tires of him.
<ul><li> 1st Edition rules blatantly enforced drow gender differences, giving their sexes different ability ranges and class advancement limits.
</li><li> In 3E/3.5, drow <em>were</em> the only race in the core books to have mechanical gender differences... but it only mattered if they multiclassed (drow had different favored classes if they were female or male &mdash; cleric and wizard, respectively &mdash; but favored class didn't do <em>anything</em> if you kept to a single class).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame">Role Playing Games</a> that are semi-historical tend to skirt around the issue. Games like Deadlands: Reloaded and Spirit of the Century have brief side notes concerning problems with playing in the time periods with regards to gender and race, but for the most part, they brush it aside and assume it is largely irrelevant.
<ul><li> Somewhat justified in that in these, and most other, RPGs the player characters are exceptional people, so they can overcome the usual drawbacks of gender (and/or race) of their times, as exceptional people throughout history have.
<ul><li> Deadlands, in particular, have explicitly mentioned lax gender restrictions because the setting is too dangerous to fuss about those things. When you need cowboys brave enough to move cattle through werewolf territory, you probably won't find enough to be picky about gender.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LegendOfTheFiveRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LegendOfTheFiveRings">Legend of the Five Rings</a></em> in its first edition had a brief essay by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWick">John Wick</a> explaining that there was no possible way to justify female player characters in the setting ... but, as that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun">wasn't fun</a>, players and the GM should <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BellisariosMaxim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BellisariosMaxim">ignore it</a> and allow them anyway.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LegendsOfTheWulin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LegendsOfTheWulin">Legends of the Wulin</a></em> has rules for playing this either way. Essentially, a female PC only has to deal with sexism to the extent that her player makes sexism an element of her story; allowing them to play this trope straight or avert it as they please.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> As backward as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudalFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudalFuture">Feudal Future</a> may seem at times, gender equality is pretty much the universe-wide default. Even in the (explicitly matriarchal) Magistracy of Canopus. Though the Draconis Combine does seem to have fewer military women in general compared to the others (and there are certainly issues with the Coordinator being a woman, which only happened once in Combine history), it still has quite a few. Then again, the DC is probably the least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">pragmatic</a> of the 5 great houses when it comes to fighting.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Clans</a> play this even straighter, especially in the warrior caste. You will see men and women at every level of their military hierarchy and no one bats an eye at a female Galaxy Commander or Khan. Considering that a family unit and marriage do not exist among warriors and most reproduction is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UterineReplicator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UterineReplicator">handled</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies">artificially</a> (often after the parents are long dead) its safe to safe that the Clans have no social distinction between genders.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller">Traveller</a></em> This varies from culture to culture. The ruling class of the Third Imperium is like this, however.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>, it varies from service to service in the Imperium of Man, but most governmental, religious, and (in some cases) noble positions are gender-blind, as are the Inquisition, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Adepta Astra Telepathica</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RogueTrader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RogueTrader">Rogue Traders</a> and the Adeptus Mechanicus. Some are segregated, though - the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">Space Marines</a> are all men, evidently due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticEngineeringIsTheNewNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticEngineeringIsTheNewNuke">genetic engineering</a> required to make them, while the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">Sisters of Battle</a> are all women because the Ecclesiarchy is banned from maintaining "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">men under arms</a>". In the Imperial Guard, most regiments are single-gender, and men outnumber women roughly 9-to-1, but female officers and regiments are just as honored, and mixed-gender regiments are not unheard of. They are distinctly outnumbered in the higher ranks, though; one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MauveShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MauveShirt">Mauve Shirt</a> from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain">Ciaphas Cain</a> series eventually reaches the exalted rank of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass">Lady General</a> but is among the only ones in recent history to have done so.
<ul><li> The Imperium is also completely uncaring about who fights for them as long as they can hold a gun, its a commonly mentioned background element that when the Imperium is desperate enough or when they just need a few more warm bodies to pad out the ranks that they will mass conscript <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">children</a> to fight for them so not only is gender no object age isn't either.
</li><li> Ditto most of the above for the Tau and Kroot of the Tau Empire. It helps their sexual dimorphism is much subtler than humans' anyway.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves">Eldar and Dark Eldar</a> also have no gender restrictions in their societies. Males rarely become Howling Banshees or Wyches, but only for symbolism reasons, and some still choose to be.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> sort of uses this.
<ul><li> While the Bretonnian knights are extremely chivalrous (in the protect-the-women-at-all-costs sense), their army's spellcasters are women, priestesses chosen by the Lady of the Lake, and there was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JeanneDArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JeanneDArchetype">Jeanne d'Arch&eacute;type</a> with Repanse de Lyonesse. However, it's mentioned that the peasant women aren't particularly oppressed since Bretonnian peasants have such a crappy life they're pretty much equal in all aspects including rights. The RPG does establish that female adventures in Brettonia generally have to play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver">Sweet Polly Oliver</a> to be taken seriously (with a brief aside that the writers do not endorse this attitude).
</li><li> Played straight with the three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">Elven armies</a> which have healthy doses of both male and female units.
</li><li> The Empire doesn't really discriminate against women (who can become adventurers with no issue), likely due to the world being so horrible banning women from active duty is not even borderline suicidal.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia">Paranoia</a></em> makes a point that there is no practical difference between the genders. Between the fact that new clones are decanted, not born, and everyone is on pretty powerful hormone suppressants that keep sexual dimorphism and most especially sexual impulses way down (the latter being removed entirely), this is extremely accurate. The only reason the game even has sexes at all (rather than assuming Alpha Complex produced straight up sexless clones) is to ensure that there's an added bit of humor when someone works out how to suppress the hormone suppressants.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>, the corebook specifically states that Exaltations do not choose a host based on gender and that the setting's dominant culture- the Realm- does not treat men and women differently in any way. (This is probably because the Realm is ruled by the titular Exalted.) Various other places discriminate against either men or women, as their culture dictates, but for the most part, Creation is left egalitarian for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun">Rule of Fun</a>.
</li><li> In the rules of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TunnelsAndTrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TunnelsAndTrolls">Tunnels &amp; Trolls</a></em>, the full extent of gender segregation is an optional rule for gender differences in character height and weight, quote: "if you want to be chauvinistic about it." In the rules, and in at least a large proportion of the published adventures, female warriors are presented as a common occurrence. Not bad for the second oldest RPG rules set.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RocketAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RocketAge">Rocket Age</a></em> largely ignores gender as an issue, despite the game taking place in the late 1930s, since the kind of people willing to leave Earth tend to be progressive and more exposed to other cultures than those at home. Some of this change comes from exposure to Mars, where in most castes, gender is utterly irrelevant.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/KingdomDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/KingdomDeath">Kingdom Death</a></em> you play as a group of Survivors that build a settlement of hunters. There is no difference in how Survivors advance their stats and a good hunting group is typically comprised of male and female Survivors.

<ul><li> Computer role-playing games. This trope is true in many of them simply because female gamers play these games too. Usually, this trope is handwaved and never commented upon. In very old PC <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame">Role Playing Games</a>, however, it was common for there to be gender-based stat adjustments, usually with male characters getting a bonus to strength and female characters getting a compensating bonus to charisma, dexterity or intelligence.
</li><li> The futuristic militaries in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOpsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOpsIII">Call of Duty: Black Ops III</a></em> are this. The advent of cybernetic augmentations has rendered physical differences between men and women non-existent, and since the focus of warfare has shifted from aerial and technological supremacy back to foot soldiers, <em>anyone</em> capable of fighting is in high demand. Notably, not only are the titular black ops squads gender integrated - and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> can be male or female - but the enemies the protagonist is pitted against are male and female as well, averting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreTheExpendableGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreTheExpendableGender">Men Are the Expendable Gender</a> trope. Notably, though only enemy troops are egalitarian. Friendly generic soldiers are always male.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpiresIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpiresIII">Age of Empires III</a></em> had female characters who fully acted as combatants, which was never mentioned by anyone in-game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ranges from being downplayed to being played straight depending on the specific game, but it is always present. The early games in the series have purely male generic guards, soldiers, bandits, etc. but named characters in these roles can be of either gender. Later games in the series have introduced more women in these roles. It seems that in Tamriel, there's nothing <em>stopping</em> women from signing up, but they just don't join up as often. The deep backstory is also chock full of notable female monarchs, faction leaders, and great heroes.

Both genders have similar combat prowess, spellcasting abilities, and status.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>:
<ul><li> Reveals this to be the case for Skyrim's Jarls (Earls). Jarls can be either men or women, and their children inherit their title regardless of gender. When characters debate who the next High King of Skyrim should be, disagreements have more to do with philosophy and allegiance than the gender of the candidate, and no one questions Elisif's claim to the crown because she's a woman.
</li><li> Historically, Skyrim has also had many badass warriors of both genders and several legendary figures in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings">Nord</a> are women.
</li><li> Female soldiers are rare, but still present in the game though mostly on the Stormcloak side, while the Imperial Legion has Legate Rikke as its most prominent female member. There also plenty of female bandits and Forsworn.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> universe has a fairly equal amount of female and male bandits, raiders, quest-givers and such. Justified in post-apocalyptic settings, really, since it would be stupid for society to waste any able pair of hands.
<ul><li> Until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> introduced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoWomansLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoWomansLand">Caesar's Legion.</a> The Legion represents conservative values taken to their logical conclusion (i.e. emulating the past), and not only do characters comment on what a bad idea this is, but the Legion also alienates a large amount of the population as a result.
</li><li> As a counterpoint, the NCR is highly egalitarian when it comes to gender. Women can be found in every role within the NCR's society and military, which makes sense since probably the most influential figure in their history has been Tandi, who was female and eventually became President. And even with the more chauvinist policies under President Kimball's administration, women can still rise up the ranks with distinction; compared to the Legion, the sexism that's crept into the NCR is outright benign.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em>:

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em> has no gender disparity in their army units. Class, however...
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> mixes the genders readily, both in the army as a whole and within the different classes. Only a handful of classes are single-gender, including the all-women Pegasus Knight class. This got played straighter as of the <em>Fates</em> installments. All classes became available to all gender, with their names being changed, however, Pegasus Knight and Valkyrie, otherwise female only, became Sky Knight and Strategist, similarly, the otherwise male only Fighter class became accessible to female thanks to Charlotte and the Hoshidan equivalent to it (Oni Savage) had Rinkha as it's representative. However, there are some special DLC exclusive classes such as Witch, Starlode and Bride that are available only to a certain gender. The Dancer class is also only accessible by Azura.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar">Gears of War</a></em>: The first two games and the novelizations subvert this. Only men do the fighting. All fertile women are used for reproductive purposes, while non-fertile women serve in support roles. The third game, however, plays this straight. The women fight alongside the men. This is because humanity is down to its last throes and needs every available body to fight.
<ul><li> Before Emergence Day active female Gears were not unheard of and were at least as common as female soldiers are today, some examples introduced in the <em>Aspho Fields</em> novel being <a class="urllink" href="http://gearsofwar.wikia.com/wiki/Bernadette_Mataki">Bernadette Mataki<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://gearsofwar.wikia.com/wiki/Helena_Stroud">Helena Stroud<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, Stroud being the commander of her own company and the mother of Anya from the games. Gender equality and civil rights took a nosedive after most of humanity was killed after E-Day and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreTheExpendableGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreTheExpendableGender">men became more expendable than women</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> universe is a mixed example:
<ul><li> The franchise seems to be gender blind when it comes to humans, for the most part. Possibly quarians as well, considering the only quarian military groups we ever see are lead by Tali and the Admiralty board splits 60/40. Other alien races don't show their females at all (the asari, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace">One-Gender Race</a>, don't count), but Garrus' war stories show that the turians are integrated too. Restrooms are still segregated, though, as EDI will remind you if you stumble into the wrong room. Maybe a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified Trope</a> with genetic enhancements being standard for soldiers of humanity.
</li><li> Salarians do not follow this rule though since their species breeds too few females to throw them into combat. Instead, they're actually a matriarchy where the few salarian females are always given positions of leadership and authority.
</li><li> Tali and Ashley discuss this in the first game. Ashley mentions how long it took human women to prove they could handle shotguns, with Tali replying that the Flotilla can't afford the "luxury of sexism".
</li><li> In Lair of the Shadow Broker one of the files states that infertile krogan females at least have garrison roles on their homeworld. All krogan are taught <em>how</em> to fight from childhood, it's a question of who they can afford to risk. Indeed, stories of krogan history prior to the genophage suggest that krogan females had equal rights and were just as respected as the males (the female Warlord Shiagur is often mentioned as being one of the most legendary badasses the krogan have ever known). The only reason krogan females are kept cloistered away in modern times is because the genophage has forced the krogan to safeguard their females to ensure the survival of their species. Clan Nakmor in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a></em> (which has mostly overcome this problem) plays the trope straight: the clan itself is led by the female Nakmor Morda, while Nakmor Kesh is Superintendent of the Nexus.
</li><li> Interestingly enough, the first game plays with this trope a bit in terms of your options of NPC allies: classes that specialize in one form of warfare (Soldier, Adept, Engineer) are given to female characters (Ashley, Liara, and Tali, respectively). On the other hand, hybrid classes (Vanguard, Sentinel, and Infiltrator) are provided by males (Kaidan, Wrex and Garrus). However, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a>, Shepard, can choose to follow this trend or avert it, based on their gender and class selection.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em> mostly portrays <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardFantasySetting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardFantasySetting">Thedas</a> as being egalitarian when it comes to gender:
<ul><li> In the vast majority of nations and cultures women are allowed to serve alongside men in the military and become knights and other warriors such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">templars and Seekers</a>. The Grey Wardens are mentioned as having fewer female members than other martial orders, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">likely because women are made into broodmothers by the darkspawn</span>, but this seems to have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retconned</a> in later installments. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen">Heir Club for Men</a> is apparently nonexistent in the nobility and royalty, with the eldest offspring being the heir regardless of gender. Women can also be scholars, politicians, and leaders in the Circle of Magi without any protest. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus">the setting's equivalent of Jesus Christ</a> was a woman, and her status as a role model explains why a society that falls prey to many of the same social ills that plagued real-life medieval Europe is so gender-egalitarian.
</li><li> Krem mentions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em> that in Tevinter's military women are allowed to fight but are segregated from the men, but otherwise there is no indication that the Imperium is different than the rest of Thedas, aside from their Chantry (see below).
</li><li> The Qunari come the closest to having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">Stay in the Kitchen</a> attitude, albeit towards <em>both genders</em>, as they view men and women equally worthy and important but having innately different roles in their society. Those who transgress against these gender roles aren't punished for their nonconformity but are declared effectively transgender and treated as the gender that matches with their new role.
</li><li> The Chantry, the main human religion, actually <em>is</em> segregated. Although lower positions have a few men mixed in, all priests and higher administrative positions are required to be women.

The games do explain it, though: Gallia has a policy of Universal Conscription and everyone receives military training in high school, so when the militia is activated the women are called to arms as well. The Federation allows anyone to enlist, and everyone who wants to fight on the front lines goes through the same basic training; male or female, if you pass, you can serve. The Empire practices more traditional conscription, dragging any able-bodied young men to the frontlines as necessary but sparing the women to run their factories.

<ul><li> Several European monarchies (e.g., Sweden and Belgium) now allow the firstborn to inherit regardless of gender, and others are considering the change.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Japan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Japan">Japan</a> seriously considered the change when the Crown Prince's daughter appeared likely to be his only child. Then his brother fathered a son, and the discussion ended.
</li><li> England made a first tentative step to this when it came to their monarchy back with Queen Mary I (daughter of Henry VIII and older sister of Elizabeth I). It should be noted, however, that Mary only became Queen because her younger brother Edward (who had already reigned as King Edward VI) died with no issue and she was next in line for the throne. However, for the next 500 years (or so) England and its successor state, Great Britain, practiced male-preference primogeniture: i.e. a woman would inherit only if she had no brothers. That rule changed in March 2015, when the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_Agreement">Perth Agreement<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> came into effect, changing the law to absolute primogeniture (eldest child inherits regardless of gender) in all the Commonwealth Realms, the 17 countries that retain the British monarch as their own head of state (that is, as their own monarch). Ironically, at the time, it didn't much matter, as the Queen's eldest child was male, his eldest child was male, and <em>his</em> eldest child was male. However, Princess Charlotte was born less than two months later and was duly placed just below her older brother in the line of succession.
</li><li> Actually, this was attempted much earlier in England. Henry I's son died at sea and he made his daughter, Empress Matilda, his heir and made his baron's swear allegiance. However, upon his death, his nephew Stephen with support of some Barons usurped the throne. The lead to a long civil war known as The Anarchy. Matilda did manage to dethrone Stephen for a brief period, but ultimately he regained the throne. He was eventually, forced to name Matilda's son, Henry II, as his heir.
</li><li> The Dutch monarchs have been predominately female for the past century (the current is male, although he has had 3 daughters so far, so the one after him will be female) with straight primogeniture. The only distinction can be found in the monarch's spouse: a King's wife gets the title of Queen, but a Queen's husband is not called King, but Prince-companion. Possibly, people were worried that King sounded more important than Queen, and didn't want others to think that the guy that married into the royal family was the big shot.
<ul><li> Also directly related to why the Luxembourgian monarchy is not following this trope. When a woman inherited the Dutch throne, they basically dug up an old law that says only men can inherit theirs and thus won their independence. Two generations later, however, they abolished Salic law anyway because the man who became Grand Duke following the accession of Queen Wilhelmina had been a <em>17th</em> cousin of her father, and when that man's son had no surviving sons, he changed the law so his daughter inherited rather than subject anyone to having to dig up another distant relative.
</li><li> This is very similar to the role of the "Prince Consort" of the Commonwealth realms (Albert for Victoria, and Philip for Queen Elizabeth), which operates on the same principle: he married into royalty and has all the same perks, but he still must walk "one step behind" his Queen. The idea is basically the spear counterpart to the "Queen Consort" (a Queen who married into the family rather than a "Queen Regnant", which is a ruling Queen).
</li><li> Only Albert actually held the formal title Prince Consort in the UK (and is likely to always have this distinction); Philip is formally just HRH Prince Philip.
</li></ul></li><li> Modern-day monarchies tend to follow one of three patterns: gender is ignored (this trope, in other words), females can inherit, but males take preference (exactly how much preference is given varies, so this pattern incorporates a lot of variation), and females can't inherit.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TsaristRussia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TsaristRussia">The Russian monarchy</a> traditionally had little objection toward women on the throne, starting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KievanRus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KievanRus">way back with</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighQueen">princess Olga</a>, though men usually held priority. Another early example was princess Sophia, the elder sister of Peter I and Ivan V, though she was technically a Regent to the still-minor co-Tsars, and not a ruling monarch. But it really shone during the XVIII century, which was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">commonly dubbed</a> "&#1041;&#1072;&#1073;&#1100;&#1077; &#1094;&#1072;&#1088;&#1089;&#1090;&#1074;&#1086;" or "Women Reign": the succession law left over by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PeterTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PeterTheGreat">Peter the Great</a> was very vague, as if intentionally inviting the adventurous princess to take a shot at the throne, and he himself died of illness rather suddenly without designating a successor. This led to his widow Catherine I succeeding him, and a whole bunch of women after that-his niece Anna Ioannovna, his daughter Elisabeth, and, finally, his granddaughter-in-law <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat">Catherine the Great</a>. Most of these women were weak rulers, though, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn">being easily manipulated</a>, except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighQueen">the last one</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat">Catherine the Great</a>'s son Paul I, though, was sick of the palace atmosphere, and being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignCultureFetish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignCultureFetish">great admirer of all things Prussian</a> instituted a very strict male primogeniture in the Prussian fashion, which survived all the way to the end.
</li></ul></li><li> Most modern military forces around the world allow women to serve in <em>most</em> roles. Generally, however, women are restricted from serving in front-line infantry, armored units, and special forces (though these bans have gradually eroded over time in most Western countries, and many don't have any restrictions at all). Most will claim it's out of a sense of fairness, and it may well be, but in a lot of cases, it's initially motivated by a shortage of recruits.
<ul><li> The United States armed forces has no bans against women in any military role as of December 2015, following a transitory process that began in January 2013 when the Combat Exclusion Policy was lifted by then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, and already has female combat engineers, artillery operators, infantrywomen, and even special forces operatives in the Army Rangers. Of course, this was just when the policy was "officially" lifted. As many in favor of gender integration have pointed out, the blurred lines of modern warfare have made that <em>every</em> member of the armed forces is essentially a combat troop. Also, the US Navy has a long history of powerful female military personnel. <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_J._Howard">Admiral Michelle J.

</li><li> The Soviet Union made much to do about the number of women in their Air Force. The first two women in space and the only two female flying aces were Soviets. They also had tankers, snipers and a good many partisans.
<ul><li> This was only during the Great Patriotic War (a.k.a. The Eastern Front of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools">for those unfamiliar with the Russian term</a>), due to severe personnel shortages. After the war, as in Western countries, there was strong pressure for women to retire from the "dangerous" frontline roles.
</li><li> In the modern Russian military women are allowed to serve in a non-combat (but not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">non-frontline</a>) roles only, though there is some discussion of allowing them the greater participation, again mainly due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">manpower</a> shortages.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Israel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Israel">Israel</a> has one of the more gender-balanced armies in the world. It's also one of the few where women are subject to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Conscription" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Conscription">conscription</a> like the men, though they are more likely than men to get an exemption, and have to serve a minimum of two years instead of the men's three. They are placed in combat units only if they volunteer to do so, though it should be noted that most combat units are male-exclusive due to potential problems with a unit's social dynamic (for example, tests have shown that male combatants tend to lose their better judgment when a female comrade is injured much more readily then if a male comrade is wounded). Female pilots are still allowed and are relatively common.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Eritrea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Eritrea">Eritrea</a>, everyone has been subject to the draft since 1995, with <a class="urllink" href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/baobab/2014/03/national-service-eritrea">the only exception being pregnant women.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li></ul></li><li> There's a theory that ancient <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/05/science/05nean.html?_r=1">Neanderthal society might have been like this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, with women and children joining men out in the hunt.
</li><li> In the 2012 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ParalympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ParalympicGames">Paralympic Games</a> the wheelchair rugby tournament, often proudly self-identified as one of the most brutal contact sports to be legally played, included two mixed-gender teams.
</li><li> Archaeological research has recently uncovered evidence that women fought in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt">ancient Persian military</a>. The Scythians, a neighboring people, also apparently had women warriors who fought alongside men with the same armor, weapons, soldiers' tattoos, and burial rites.
