The chief difference between the Broken Ace and the usually female <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">Stepford Smiler</a> is that the Stepford Smiler wants to appear <em>normal</em> at all costs, often to the point of hurting herself emotionally (or because she's sociopathic). This guy has the same setup, but is more talented and wants to be the <em>best</em>, loved by all, and accepted. The debilitating personal issues which he's hiding are only getting worse because of being repressed and the stress of his efforts to excel, and these sorts of characters are prime <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie">Jerkass Woobie</a> material.

Wealthy enough to do whatever he wants to do, can have beautiful ladies by the score, highly educated, is as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">strong and smart</a> as a non-meta human can <em>get</em>, can outthink pretty much every other superhero (including Mr. Terrific and J'onn J'onzz), and can flatten Lex Luthor at his own games. Permanently scarred by the blood and death of his parents, driven to protect as many as possible to keep others from feeling that horror, finds it incredibly difficult to completely trust and give of his <em>self</em>, and has had terrible romantic relationships due to the second identity, which eventually became his first.
</li><li> The alternate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InjusticeGodsAmongUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InjusticeGodsAmongUs">Injustice: Gods Among Us</a></em>, as presented in the comic prequel. It's explained that despite being the world's greatest superhero, Supes harbored <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorGuilt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorGuilt">Survivor Guilt</a> over losing his original family and homeworld. Things got worse when he lost Lois, his unborn baby, and the city of Metropolis thanks to the Joker. This sent Supes off the deep end, leading him to gradually turn the world into a dictatorship under his "protection."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> is strong, smart, witty, and has a list of accomplishment that most other heroes with ten times his strength would be envious of. But <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity">a lot of people in his city are suspicious of him due to an unflattering press</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasqueradeWillKillYourDatingLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasqueradeWillKillYourDatingLife">his personal life is a wreck because he often has to abandon social events to respond to emergencies</a>, and underneath that all is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure">the crushing guilt over his failure to save his father figure when he first got his powers</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a></em>: Tony Stark is one of the smartest, richest, and most popular people on Earth, witty, a ladykiller who had everything anybody could ever want in their life. However, deep inside he suffers from self-hatred (which has even developed into suicidal tendencies), alcoholism, control issues, and the scars left by his abusive father. He has even stated he feels he doesn't deserve the friends and good things in life he has. This was taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> following the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar">Civil War</a></em>, where Tony's guilt over Captain America's death and the actions he took would make him occasionally break down.
</li><li> The Plutonian of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Irredeemable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Irredeemable">Irredeemable</a></em> is slowly revealed by flashbacks to have formerly been this. Underneath his standard smiling, selfless persona, he was actually resentful of his life as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCape">superhero</a>, stuck saving people he felt were ungrateful, being totally unable to cope with any critics, and needing to be compulsively loved and adored by everyone in the world. When he realized that wasn't going to happen he wound up even <em>more</em> broken.
</li><li> The new <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PhantomLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PhantomLady">Phantom Lady</a></em> is a Ph.D. multimillionaire who has been trained since birth to be a super spy superhero. Also canonically one of the most beautiful women in the DC universe. Yet she's constantly worried that people don't take her seriously and that being a superhero is eating her soul.
</li><li> Rick Flag from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SuicideSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SuicideSquad">Suicide Squad</a></em> initially seems like a roundly masterful military officer and one of the most competent members of the team, but as time goes on, it becomes increasingly clear that he is massively insecure, riddled with trauma, unable to handle the job, and eventually becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">Death Seeker</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersLastStandOfTheWreckers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersLastStandOfTheWreckers">The Transformers: Last Stand of the Wreckers</a></em>:
<ul><li> Rotorstorm. On the surface he's perpetually cheerful and snarky, constantly making jokes and in general having fun. However this is revealed to be a cover persona of sorts; he's actually still deeply traumatized from his experiences in the Simanzi Massacre, a massive battle where he witnessed (and possibly participated in) numerous war crimes and atrocities. As if that wasn't enough, he's filled with self-loathing and preps for missions by insulting himself, thanks to the horrifically abusive teaching he received from his drill sergeant and "mentor" Jetstream. Additionally, while he does pull off a near-impossible piloting feat and lands ready with a quick joke, he becomes the first of his team to die only seconds later.
</li><li> To a lesser degree Pyro as well. His Optimus Prime-esque demeanor is mostly a facade, covering up the fact that he's secretly terrified of dying in the sort of pointless, forgotten death soldiers usually get during wars. He spends his life constantly trying to set up a big and dramatic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingMomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingMomentOfAwesome">Dying Moment of Awesome</a>, believing that dying in such a manner is the only way he'll be truly remembered.
</li></ul></li><li> Ozymandias from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em> AKA Adrian Veidt, a seemingly-forever-young (he's 46 and looks about 25) blond supergenius who is insanely rich, pretty much has America in his hands, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">defeats <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Rorschach, Silk Spectre, and Nite Owl</a> at the end...he's also persuasive enough to talk <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Dr. Manhattan</a> around at least to the point of not turning him into a rapidly expanding cloud of superheated plasma. He is also the antagonist and portrayed as deludedly-idealistic to believe that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">his plan will work</a>. He even has a slight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBSOD">Villainous BSoD</a> after enacting his plan</span>, although the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Watchmen">film version</a> ramps his emotional broken-ness up several levels. He shows approximately three times the guilt, self-loathing and painful isolation of his comic book counterpart, even saying he "often [feels] stupid at being unable to relate to anybody". He spends his last few minutes of screentime in a Villainous BSOD, staring into space and looking about ready to fall over as the camera zooms out on him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cyclops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cyclops">Cyclops</a>. He's the leader of the X-Men and the leader of the mutant race, but oh boy, has Scott ever endured so much pain, chaos, and tragedy throughout the course of his life. Underneath that stoic facade is most definitely an emotionally broken and fragile man. Even before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome">Cerebus Syndrome</a> hit, Cyclops was this. A strong, versatile power came with a crippling inability to control it, and fear that someday he would hurt those he loved with it. Then there's the fact that he literally cannot make eye contact with anyone, a privilege everyone else takes for granted. Good strategizing skills coupled with terrible social skills isolated him from his teammates and made him a repressed, disliked, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarAndIcePersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarAndIcePersonality">Sugar-and-Ice Personality</a> who had barely any close relationships.
</li><li> Scott's fellow X-Man <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine">Wolverine</a> is also one of these. He's got over a century's worth of accumulated skills, accomplishments, bedmates, friends, and is the poster-boy of "mutant cool".

She's without question one of the best fighters and most experienced members of whatever team she's assigned to thanks to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb">raised</a> as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingWeapon">Living Weapon</a> by the ones who created her. She was also <em>horrifically</em> physically and emotionally abused by her creators, forced to kill her own mother via a chemically-induced berserker rage which will make her turn on <em>anyone</em> no matter how much she cares for them, had to give up the relatively normal and happy life she was creating with her only other family when the ones who made her came looking for her in order to protect them, and spent an unknown period of time as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetWalker">prostitute</a> under a violently possessive and abusive pimp. Laura has been left a mess of confused emotions and finds establishing true friendships incredibly difficult as a result, and it's been <em>very</em> strongly implied she's prone to bouts of severe, if not outright <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">suicidal</a></em>, depression. <em>And</em> her solo series reveals she was left with so little sense of self during her captivity and days as a prostitute <em>she never realized the horrible things done to her were even wrong</em>!
</li></ul></li><li> This is largely the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorDoom">Doctor Doom</a>. He's a scientific genius to rival <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Reed Richards</a>, a magical prodigy who approaches <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorStrange">Doctor Strange</a> in power, and physically fit enough that he can kill lions bare-handed; he rules a nation as semi-benevolent dictator, adheres to a code of always repaying his debts, has enough willpower to stare down the Purple Man without flinching, and wears a suit of armour on par with that sported by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a>. He could, in theory, be one of the Marvel Universe's greatest forces for good, because in power level you can pick almost any three superheroes and he's the equal of all of them. Unfortunately for the Marvel Universe, his egomania will never stop clouding his judgment. When Reed Richards pointed out a mistake in Doom's calculations, he spat in Reed's face, and when his experiment went wrong and scarred him, he blamed Reed rather than admit, even to himself, that he screwed up, and dedicated the rest of his life to a needless revenge for a nonexistent crime. His hideous scarring is his own fault because believing his good looks to already be ruined by the thin scar he had received, he donned the iron mask to his first suit of armour without waiting for it to cool first. His people fear him more than love him; he has no friends; most of his intellectual equals are superheroes who would be <em>suspicious</em> at an invitation to discuss something; he's a pariah on the international stage. All because of his swollen ego.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">The Mighty Thor</a> certainly becomes this post-<em>Original Sin</em>. He loses his worthiness to wield Mj&ouml;lnir and becomes way more cynical and melancholic. He admits that he's come to believe that Gorr was right about the gods, and that they don't deserve the praise and worship mortals heap on them. Far into the future, he has this even worse. He becomes the All-Father and lord of Asgard and inherits the Odin-Force (which he renames the "Thor-Force"), but his brother permanently turning to evil, the death of all life on Earth at Loki's hands, and Gorr's slaughter and enslavement of his people has reduced him to a near shell of himself who can barely muster the will to fight anymore. Thankfully, both the past and future versions of Thor eventually get better, though they still carry much baggage regarding their past failings and self-worth.

<ul><li> Anakin Skywalker is believed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a> who, according to an ancient Jedi Prophecy, will destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force. Since he was (implied to be) born to a virgin woman, has the highest midi-chlorian count on record, and can do things most humans can't (such as podracing) there was a lot of evidence to back this up. However, Anakin was born into slavery on a planet outside the realm of the Galactic Republic, which stopped him from being discovered by the Jedi until Anakin was nine, far beyond the age that Jedi normally begin training. Because of this, Anakin struggles to separate from his mother, with that attachment only growing as he gets older. Then his Jedi mentor Qui-Gon Jinn is slain and Anakin is apprenticed to Qui-Gon's Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi who, although a wise, kind and powerful Jedi, is inexperienced as a teacher and somewhat jealous of Anakin's potential, causing him to be a bit tougher on Anakin than he should have been. Anakin then forms another strong attachment with his childhood crush Padm&eacute; Amidala and secretly marries her even though it's a violation of the Jedi code. His mother's death combined with the distrust the Jedi Council has in him, The Clone Wars, visions of Padm&eacute; dying in childbirth and manipulation by Chancellor Palpatine/Darth Sidious leads him to turn to the Dark Side and become the Sith Lord Darth Vader. Destroying the Jedi Order, choking his wife to death in anger, then being horribly maimed in a duel with Obi-Wan, Vader has lost everything and has nothing left but to serve his Sith master.
</li><li> Obi-Wan probably qualifies as well. Helplessly watching Qui-Gon die at the hands of Darth Maul, Obi-Wan promises his dying master that he will train Anakin. As skilled as Obi-Wan was, he was rushed into becoming a Jedi Knight before he was ready and was thus unequipped to take on a Padawan, especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a>. Constant reminders that his student is destined to be more powerful than he was likely stirred up some insecurities inside Obi-Wan, and Anakin's arrogance only made it worse. Then Qui-Gon's old master Count Dooku becomes a Sith Lord and starts the conflict that leads to the Clone Wars. Then Anakin betrays and murders the remaining Jedi and Obi-Wan is forced to fight Anakin on Mustafar: severing Anakin's limbs and watching him burn alive next to a lava river. It's a miracle that Obi-Wan was able to keep it together and not embrace the Dark Side himself.

<div class="indent"><strong>Guinevere:</strong> Three years is a long time for a boy to spend in one room [the armory] if he only goes out of it to eat and sleep and to practice tilting in the field. It is even difficult to imagine a boy who would do it unless you realize from the start that Lancelot was not romantic and debonair. Tennyson and the Pre-Raphaelites would have found it difficult to recognize this rather sullen and unsatisfactory child with the ugly face, who did not disclose to anybody that he was living on dreams and prayers.

He's a great craftsman, charismatic enough to make most of the Noldor (one of the Elf tribes) follow him from Valinor to Middle-Earth and he has seven sons.

<ul><li> Some incarnations of the Doctor from fall under this trope, especially in the revived series, which <em>starts</em> with the premise of the Doctor being forced to kill his own species offscreen.
<ul><li> The First Doctor begins to develop into one of these once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamDad">Ian</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">Barbara</a> leave the crew and the Doctor begins to come to terms with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantGoHomeAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantGoHomeAgain">the massive predicament he's in</a>, while simultaneously suffering a string of adventures with major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Endings</a>. After Steven says <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOutOfHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOutOfHere">Screw This, I'm Out of Here!</a> at the end of "The Massacre", he has a full-blown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> and is far more delicate and fearful afterward.
</li><li> The revived series has gone on to show he was broken before he became an ace, growing up he spent his nights in a barn crying himself to sleep, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend">Only Friend</a> eventually went insane and became his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> and he eventually admitted the real reason he left Gallifrey was that he was scared.
</li><li> The Tenth Doctor is confident and cavalier on the outside, but he suffers from survivor's guilt and verges on self-loathing on the inside.
</li><li> The Eleventh Doctor is a charming, charismatic, moral, slightly eccentric, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero">Chaste Hero</a> on the outside. At first, his confidence seems genuine, but as time passes it quickly becomes apparent that Eleven is just as riddled with grief, rage and self-loathing as Ten.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnHurt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnHurt">The War Doctor</a> is the only doctor who is openly this.
</li><li> The ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> Fifth Doctor had become this by the end of his run resulting in him becoming the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> 6th and 7th Doctors. The same thing then happened when the Eighth Doctor transitioned to the War and 9th Doctors.
</li></ul></li><li> "The Daleks' Master Plan": Sara Kingdom is Mavic Chen's best agent, a hero in her organisation, said in awed tones to have "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrengthOfTenMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrengthOfTenMen">The Strength of Ten Men</a>". She shoots Bret Vyon (a "traitor" allied to the Doctor) and was sent to murder the Doctor and his companion too, and would have done it if they hadn't been accidentally teleported to the planet Mira. While on Mira, the Doctor confronts her, clearly in a disturbed psychological state, and she eventually admits Bret was her brother. She <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighHeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighHeelFaceTurn">joins the Doctor's side soon afterward</a>.

He also has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">Dark and Troubled Past</a>. He still feels guilt over getting his brother captured by a vicious alien race.

He has a chunk of memory the size of 2 years missing, although he completely forgets about it after meeting the Doctor.
</li></ul></li><li> The Crane brothers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em>. For all their success as psychiatrists, it doesn't spare them from the fact that both of them suffer from deep-seated parental issues and are both hapless with women, even though, oddly, they never seem for want of one.
</li><li> James Gordon of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gotham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gotham">Gotham</a></em>. Gordon might be a rookie detective, but he's a former soldier and a very good hand-to-hand combatant, effortlessly disarming and taking down a large heavily-armed man and then later delivering a beatdown to two mob enforcers among other badass moments. He's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice">good looking</a> with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim">laundry list of admirers</a> who will always strive to do what is right and clean up Gotham. However, most of his admirers are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> and he's constantly fighting with his own dark side which others take note of. Also, there are frequent hits on his life (by two of his admirers even) and the lives of those close to him. In addition, Galavan worming in his way out of justice, combined with Gordon netting a 40-year sentence for his vigilante execution, seems to have stripped Gordon of any notion that the law can work in Gotham which is what he firmly believed separated the villains from the heroes.
</li><li> This seemed to be a central theme in the NBC series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em>. Having superpowers didn't cure the characters of their painful pasts, past mental issues, or dark secrets.
</li><li> Dr. Gregory House from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em>. Not only is he the greatest diagnostician, but he has also mastered all the manipulative aspects of human sociology and psychology. In addition, he speaks several languages, plays a mean guitar, and has the expertise needed to turn his own apartment into an ICU. Despite all this, he still manages to have no social skills, has no friends, and is an unapologetic, drug-addicted criminal.

</li><li> Barney Stinson of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em> tries very hard <em>not</em> to be this trope, but he isn't nearly as good as hiding this fact as he thinks he is. His over-the-top, self-aggrandizing "awesomeness" is his way of overshadowing all his emotional issues.
</li><li> Jack Shephard of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em> &mdash; brilliant, handsome, athletic, charismatic doctor on the outside.

</li><li> Don Draper of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen">Mad Men</a></em>. Creative director/shaman of both the older Sterling Cooper and the new Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. Incredibly handsome and charismatic. Able to bed any woman pretty much just by looking at her. Has won multiple advertising awards and manages to accept them while cutting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharpDressedMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharpDressedMan">dapper figure</a>. He achieved this by stealing another man's identity to get away from his dirt poor abusive upbringing. His marriage to Betty showed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction">consequences</a> of a Broken Ace marrying a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">Stepford Smiler</a>. A major part of season 4 was about surveying the wreckage of that union.

</li><li> Hawkeye has signs of this through the mid and late seasons from the stress of saving the lives of soldiers that are just going to get killed later anyway. But the final episode is when he really is broken because he inadvertently caused a mother to kill her own child.

</li><li> Nathan Ingram from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest">Person of Interest</a></em> was a world-renowned software engineer and CEO, but he's actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeard">The Beard</a> for the real genius, his friend Harold Finch.

He was his mother's campaign manager for her presidential run, is her right-hand man while she is Secretary of State, and is about to marry his beautiful and accomplished fiancee. However, he also displays serious self-doubt and anxiety and seems compelled to take on responsibility for his dysfunctional family's well-being. An argument with his father revealed that he feels responsible for the failure of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his mother's presidential campaign</span> and he later reveals to Susan Berg that he's even having cold feet about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his engagement</span>.

It also turns out she was quite broken from the being with, thanks to her <em>very</em> dysfunctional family.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em>'s Arnold J. Rimmer is a literal example of the trope. Sucked dry of his negativity and neuroses (themselves powerful enough to destroy a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine">Lotus-Eater Machine</a>) by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionEater">Emotion Eater</a>, he <em>immediately</em> turns into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">Ace Rimmer</a> (what a guy!). Eventually, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">becomes the next Ace Rimmer&mdash;as each one dies, he recruits the next, and so on, until it finally reaches Arnie himself. It is mostly his neuroses that hold him back&mdash;but, luckily for him, the Red Dwarf universe has it set that pretty much every Rimmer gets redeemed</span>. Before then, he makes an awesome <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand">Last Stand</a> at the end of Series 6.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs">Scrubs</a></em>:
<ul><li> An early episode had J.D. competing (purely in his own mind) with another intern named Nick to see who was the best between them and who should be the unofficial leader of their group of interns. Eventually, J.D. has to concede defeat, as Nick can match JD's medical knowledge while also being more handsome, less socially awkward, more charismatic, less of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalButtKisser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalButtKisser">suck-up</a> and even has the girl J.D. likes interested in him. Hints are dropped throughout the episode, however, that Nick is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">Stepford Smiler</a> who is barely repressing all his insecurities and inner turmoil. At the end of the episode Nick realizes he's not going to be able to save the life a 7-year-old kid, (who likely <em>couldn't</em> have been saved because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">sometimes that's the reality of medicine and health care</a>) and Nick <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">completely breaks down</a> as a result and quits working at Sacred Heart.
<div class="indent"><strong>Nick:</strong> That kid is eventually gonna die. Whether it's today, tomorrow, or a month from now. There's nothing I can do. Nothing works. Now his parents want to talk to me and what am I supposed to tell them?! "Peter lived a good long seven years?" Seven years, man! ... <em>[whispers]</em> I hate this place, I hate this job.

</div></li><li> A little later in the series, they brought in Doctor Kevin Casey. He was played by Michael J. Fox, and they gave the character severe OCD to help explain the tics caused by Fox's Parkinson's Disease. His OCD made him an incredible doctor <em>and</em> surgeon, as his compulsive need to study meant that he had read every book he could get his hands on multiple times and perfected his physical dexterity, performing complex operations in a fraction of the time a normal surgeon would require. He's also incredibly nice and wise, giving helpful advice to everyone in the hospital, helping them fix their lives. So, having humiliated Turk in the OR, Cox in front of his interns, and JD by destroying his ego with an off-hand comment, all three seek him out to confront him. And they find him trapped in the scrub room outside the OR, unable to leave because he's been compulsively washing his hands for hours. He's on the verge of tears but he just can't leave.
</li><li> Dr. Cox himself could be seen as this. He's intelligent, witty, well respected, perhaps the best Doctor at Sacred Heart and keeps in fantastic shape for a man his age. However, he's also bitterly lonely, broken shell of a man who hasn't had a meaningful relationship in years. He gets somewhat better as the show goes on, after his ex-wife returns, and he becomes a father.

He's respected by those who don't know how evil he is, feared by those who do and has the entire world at his beck and call. He's also a damaged, empty man who has immense difficulty identifying with other people and is trapped in a mutually self-destructive relationship with his son, a relationship he is unable to salvage even after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a>.

His family is rich, he's a former star player himself, and he's able to lie and cheat at Lex's level.

And yet neither of these is the real Oliver Queen. Inside he's hollow, convinced that his life is a sham, and manifests numerous self-destructive tendencies including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic">alcoholism</a>, the inability to commit to anything, and a total disregard for his own safety that's both impressive and frightening.

<ul><li> Every hunter is this in spades, to the point of only being good at what they do by being so horribly broken. Capable of fighting monsters, demons, and undead nightmares, hiding from (or staying on the run from) the police and FBI for the crimes they commit doing their jobs, and all of them make the hardiest survivalist look like a pansy. The only reason any of them live the life they do is that either they were raised into it, which is a whole mess of issues right there, or they experienced firsthand losing someone close to them because of the things that go bump in the night and became obsessed with revenge. John Winchester was arguably the worst we've seen, often being remarked on as a hunter of unparalleled skill but uncaring of anything that wouldn't lead him to the Yellow-Eyed Demon, to the point of being abusive and neglectful towards his sons and raising them as soldiers to fight an unending daily war (which Sam and later Dean resent him for).

Before Seraphina met John, she was indisputably the top student in school in abilities, academics, and reputation. However, this came with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePerilsOfBeingTheBest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePerilsOfBeingTheBest">a greater deal of pressure and judgment from her peers</a>. In the present story, Seraphina's peers in Wellston see her like this since she started hanging around with John and no longer caring too much about her grades or reputation. However, Seraphina feels a lot better about herself than she did before.
<ul><li> As it turns out, John himself is also one of these. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">While a skilled hand to hand fighter and owner of one of the most powerful abilities seen so far in the series, he also has <em>serious</em> trust issues and a <em>vicious</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper">Hair-Trigger Temper</a> that is in no way whatsoever <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>.

</li><li> It's implied in one conversation that this is enforced among god-tiers. As described, Seraphina used to be obsessed with perfection, while Arlo's obsessive drive to maintain social hierarchy essentially kickstarts the plot. In both stances it is much for the worse of the both of them. Some characters briefly wonder if crippling god-tiers psychologically is not a way to keep them under control.

However, she deals with serious self-confidence and honesty issues brought on by her mother's less-than-stellar parenting, and her initial attempts at proving her self-worth and becoming independent really only succeed in pushing away and hurting the people around her (Ellen especially). After <em>Sister II</em>, she starts to rectify the "Broken" part, ironically as part and parcel of temporarily losing access to her magical powers.

He's also gay in a rural part of Ireland, and faces a lot of homophobia for it: He was nearly killed five years pre-story, can't find work, and has a tendency to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSelfDeprecation">call himself homophobic slurs</a>.

The character in the party with the best rolled stats, the first person in the world to invent a gun, an objective genius in several ways, lucky beyond belief, and lethal enough to keep up with the rest of his party despite lacking all but a few magic powers. But he's also obsessed with revenge, struggles to relate to even his best friends, shows a heavy disregard for his own life and soul, has panic attacks behind closed doors, and for much of the campaign believes redemption is impossible for both himself and his enemies.

<ul><li> American Founding Father <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderHamilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderHamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a>&mdash;whose face is on the ten-dollar bill&mdash;was the ultimate Broken Ace: he was one of the few famous Founders not to come from a land-wealthy family. Hamilton went from a poor orphan boy in the West Indies to Revolutionary War hero and father of American finance out of his sheer force of will. Meanwhile, his father left the family when Alexander was ten, his mother died of yellow fever two years later, his cousin who was supposed to take care of him and his brother committed suicide, one of his best friends died in battle, his eldest son died in a duel, causing his eldest daughter to become mentally unstable. Contemporaries routinely described him as cocky, strident, fiercely opinionated, and hot-tempered yet there is much evidence to suggest that for most of his adult life he was chronically insecure about his humble origins and being a bastard child and that he was constantly haunted by fears of not amounting to much as a statesman.
</li><li> General <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeSPatton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeSPatton">George S. Patton</a> was one of the most famous figures of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, both for his brash, domineering attitude and the fact that he was a brilliant General. However, he also struggled a great deal with his self-esteem and believed he would never live up to his father's reputation. Other portrayals, like the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Patton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Patton">Patton</a></em>, show him as, while a charismatic and competent leader who wanted to do right by his country and capable of inspiring those around him, also very violent and unflinching PR nightmare who despised cowardice and rarely cared about how his harsh words would be received by his superiors or the media until it blew up in his face.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a> was the King of Pop and had a star-studded life. Deep down, though, he didn't want to be a star; he wanted to have a real childhood.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ErnestHemingway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ErnestHemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a> was a renowned writer but had a miserable life. Traumatized by war, unable to stay in a romantic relationship, he eventually killed himself.
</li><li> Voice actress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaryKayBergman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaryKayBergman">Mary Kay Bergman</a> is a particularly tragic example of this trope. She was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanOfAThousandVoices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanOfAThousandVoices">Woman of a Thousand Voices</a> who most famously voiced every female character on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> and was the official VA for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs">Disney's Snow White</a>, and mentored the likes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TaraStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TaraStrong">Tara Strong</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GreyDeLisle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GreyDeLisle">Grey DeLisle</a>. Unfortunately, she has been suffering from bipolar disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, and according to her husband was convinced that she was losing her talent, culminating in her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">suicide in 1999</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FallOutBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FallOutBoy">Pete Wentz</a>. Member of one of the most popular bands of the 2000s, crush for thousands of teenage girls from 2005-2007 &mdash; Rolling Stone called him "the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertPattinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertPattinson">RPatz</a> of his time" &mdash; excellent lyricist, suffers from bipolar disorder and nearly took his own life in 2005 just before his band got huge.
</li><li> Professional golfer Tiger Woods: During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">Turn of the Millennium</a>, he experienced a meteoric rise to the top spot in golf, not just among his contemporaries but of all time. He won an unprecedented number of major and minor tournaments, coming one win away from achieving a Grand Slam (winning all four major golf tournaments in one year), which no one has completed under the current requirements. Then his infamous sex scandal broke in 2009, where he was revealed to have at least a double-digit number of mistresses, leading to a divorce from his wife, a shift in public perception from awe and admiration to ridicule and suspicion, and a career slump that he has yet to recover from.
</li><li> As far as baseball goes, Alex Rodriguez is probably the #1 example. While one of the greatest power hitters of all time by pure numbers, A-Rod is a confirmed PED (Performance Enhancing Drug) user, so all of his numbers are automatically suspect. Until Jenry Mejia of the Mets, A-Rod was the first and only person to get multiple PED suspensions in the MLB. Add into that his reaction to being caught using PEDs was to <em>sue Major League Baseball</em> instead of doing something reasonable like apologizing or even explaining it. And that is aside from his severely unsportsmanlike conduct, like shouting into a fielder's ear as he was running past him to make him miss a popup. To this day, Rodriguez remains one of the most divisive players in the sport, even though he has retired as of the 2017 season.
</li><li> In both the past and the present, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXIV">Louis XIV</a> was and is known as the glorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">Sun King</a> of France, who redefined the French monarchy and achieved much for his kingdom. But behind the glorious image he sought to project, things were not quite so wonderful. Louis struggled with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyAtTheTop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyAtTheTop">loneliness</a>, anxiety and depression, and was heavily burdened by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChainsOfCommanding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChainsOfCommanding">The Chains of Commanding</a>. <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran<!--C3-->A7oise_d%27Aubign<!--C3-->A9,_Marquise_de_Maintenon">His second wife<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> wrote of him often needing her comfort.
