Sometimes, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit">this is not the case</a>.
</p><p>Framing the Guilty Party usually takes one of four forms:
</p><p></p><ul><li> <strong>Framing a Known Guilty Party:</strong> You know who the bad guy is, but there's not quite enough evidence to prove it, so the cops/prosecutors either create the evidence or allow someone else to create it and/or perjure themselves in order to convict them. If the Good Guys get away with it because the Bad Guy deserves it, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil">Pay Evil unto Evil</a>.
<p></p></li><li> <strong>Framing an Unknown Guilty Party:</strong> Person A frames Person B for some reason (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge">revenge</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IrrationalHatred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IrrationalHatred">personal antipathy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe">lulz</a>, deflecting suspicion from Person A and/or his friends, etc)... and it turns out that Person B <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalTruth">actually was</a></em> the bad guy who really did commit the crime.
<p></p></li><li> <strong>Framing a Party known for being Guilty of something else:</strong> Person A commits a crime and frames Person B, but Person B is guilty of other, just as severe crimes that he or she got away with &#151; at times, it&#146;s exactly this guilt that makes them so easy to frame.
<p></p></li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> <strong>Framing Yourself:</strong> The guilty party plants enough evidence to make themselves a suspect, and either does the frame-up so incompetently that it's obviously a frame-up, or later somehow exposes the "frame-up". The goal of this maneuver is that the guilty party will be put beyond suspicion, on the basis that the real culprit tried to frame someone innocent. This may lead genuine evidence incriminating the guilty party to be disregarded, on the assumption that it was also planted, or else cannot be prosecuted without violating laws against <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_jeopardy">double jeopardy.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li></ul><p>Unsurprisingly, while the first form can be considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> (how true it is obviously depends on how corrupt your local police force and prosecuting counsel are), the second one is almost always pure fiction, often something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence">Contrived Coincidence</a>. If someone trying to frame themselves pulls it off, the character is typically on the way to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> status, although there's always the risk that if the investigators don't fall for the fake frame-up (either by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToFool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToFool">not realizing it's a frame in the first place</a>, or realizing the frame was faked), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">the perp has provided evidence proving their own guilt</a>, in which case it's more of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">What an Idiot!</a>.

See also: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameUp">Frame-Up</a>, for implicating the innocent with false evidence. Framing Yourself can also overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasticConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasticConfession">Sarcastic Confession</a>.

<ul><li> In one of the episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>, the killer is a woman named Tina.

<ul><li> The protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KindHeartsAndCoronets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KindHeartsAndCoronets">Kind Hearts and Coronets</a></em> spends most of the film coldly and methodically killing off the entire aristocratic D'Ascoyne family. In the end, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his jealous girlfriend tips off the police that he is the murderer... of <em>her husband</em>, who in fact committed suicide on a completely unrelated note. It evolves into a Category 3 in the end. Almost. Probably</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NoWayOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NoWayOut">No Way Out</a></em>:
<ul><li> Commander Farrell's girlfriend is killed accidentally by the Secretary of Defense, who blames a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerringMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerringMole">Soviet spy</a>, setting off a Pentagon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchHunt">Witch Hunt</a>. Farrell has to find proof who the real killer was before evidence turns up showing he had slept with her, and thus be accused...not only because he didn't commit the crime, but because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he <em>is</em> a Soviet spy.</span>
</li><li> The man who ends up being blamed for the killing (the politician's aide) was not actually guilty of that (or of being a mole), but had committed <em>multiple</em> illegal acts in the course of the coverup, including at least one actual murder, and is the primary villain of the movie.
</li></ul></li><li> A slight variant of Category 2 is in the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeyondAReasonableDoubt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeyondAReasonableDoubt">Beyond a Reasonable Doubt</a></em>. A crusading newspaper editor (John McIntire) wants to prove that the death penalty can cause an innocent man to be executed. He hatches a bizarre plot with his star reporter (Dana Andrews): the editor will plant false evidence indicating that the reporter is guilty of a recent unsolved sex murder. After the reporter is arrested, convicted, and sentenced to death, the editor will come forward with proof that the evidence was falsified, forcing the authorities to release the reporter. Amazingly enough, the reporter agrees to this. The first twist comes when the editor is killed in an accident, and the evidence destroyed before he can clear the reporter. The second twist comes when it develops that the reporter is the actual murderer.
</li><li> An example of this being done to a good guy happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDukesOfHazzard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDukesOfHazzard">The Dukes of Hazzard</a></em> film. To get the Dukes out of the way, the cops plant a still at their home. As the Dukes are known moonshine smugglers, it's questioned why the cops <em>had</em> to frame them in the first place. Daisy explains that the cops are just too stupid to find the real one.
</li><li> An interesting example of the criminal himself suggesting the framing. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hannibal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hannibal">Hannibal</a></em>, the titular character is escaping from Mason Verger's farm where he was going to be killed when Mason shows up with his personal physician. He orders his doctor to go into a pit filled with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FedToPigs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FedToPigs">man-eating pigs</a> to get a gun and shoot Hannibal. When the doctor refuses, Mason threatens to expose the doctor's role in his crimes. Hannibal says, "Hey Cordell! Why don't you push him in [the pit]? You can always say it was me." He then proceeds to do so.
</li><li> Done in the climax of the Mexican film <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TodoElPoder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TodoElPoder">Todo El Poder</a></em>, after the protagonists used a doctored video of the (supposedly kidnapped but in reality dead) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop">Dirty Cop</a> confessing his crimes to expose and blackmail his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptBureaucrat">Corrupt Bureaucrat</a> boss; however, the boss attempts to turn the tables when he's presented with the evidence, as he shoots his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheHostage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheHostage">underling's body</a> (not realizing that he was already dead) and then announces that tomorrow the newspapers will report the arrest of the "dangerous gang of kidnappers" led by the protagonist but "unfortunately the brave cop lost his life in line of duty". The protagonist then reveals that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveYourWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveYourWife">also kidnapped the boss' wife</a> as a backup plan after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop">Dirty Cop</a> died of a heart attack before getting an actual confession from him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrail">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a></em> has the infamous witch trial, where a group of peasants, by all appearances, just grabbed a random woman and dressed her up in a witch costume because they wanted to burn something. They seem to have no evidence aside from one guy who claims she turned him into a newt (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">"I got better."</a>), until Sir Bedivere administers a test that reveals she is indeed a witch. She shrugs it off with "That's a fair cop."

<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarthaWells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarthaWells">Martha Wells</a>'s <em>The Death of the Necromancer</em>, one of the villains framed an innocent man for murder and necromancy.

</li><li> Donald Westlake wrote a novella called <em>A Travesty</em> that has the murderer (also the narrator) being framed for the murder he committed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by the detective because the murderer has been having an affair with the detective's wife</span>.
</li><li> While the crime is not something <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">we would recognize as a crime</a> and the frame-up consists of simply an anonymous accusation (Nazi Germany <em>was</em> something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceState" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceState">Police State</a>), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryTurtledove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryTurtledove">Harry Turtledove</a>'s <em>In the Presence of Mine Enemies</em> has a woman in an unhappy marriage accuse her target of adultery of being a Jew after he says no. At that point in the novel, we have already found out the man is a member of the secret underground Judaic community of 21st century Nazi Germany, and that one of the things that made him say no was thinking such a relationship could have endangered the secret (the other is that he is happily married).

<ul><li> Baltar, desperate to get any hint of involvement in the Cylon attack off himself, randomly picks someone who was standing on the bridge as being a Cylon. Guess what?
</li><li> Later in the first season, a Cylon agent gives the fleet doctored photos of Baltar tampering with the Colonial defense mainframe, thereby facilitating the genocide of mankind. When the frame-up is discovered, Baltar's <em>actual</em> indirect role in providing the Cylons access to the defense network remained unknown until the late third season. And even then, no-one can prove it, so very few people know about it in the first place (they find other things he has done to go after him). No one actually has hard, non-drug-based vision evidence of his wrongdoing until he confesses to someone halfway through the final season.

<ul><li> May have happened in the real-life murder of Sunny von Bulow. The legal team, desperate to find out that the man they were representing (Sunny's husband Claus) was not a hopelessly amoral killer, were pleased to discover persuasive logic that a key piece of evidence against Claus had been fabricated &#151; most likely planted by Sunny's family, who hated Claus and were convinced of his guilt. The piece of evidence in question was a needle used for an insulin shot &#151; but the trouble was, the insulin was found on the outside of the needle. If the shot had been administered, there would not be insulin on the outside of it, meaning that the needle must have been dipped into insulin but not used. Testimony from one of the maids was also brought into question due to her interactions with the family's attorney. However, this didn't mean he didn't do it; the family may well have simply framed a guilty man. In the end, Claus was found not guilty, partially due to the rejection of hearsay evidence and the fact that the coma could not be proved to have been caused by insulin, and partially because Sunny herself had overdosed on aspirin not three weeks earlier, leading to questions about her state of mind.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie">Agatha Christie</a> did this several times:
<ul><li> It was pretty much the central premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles">The Mysterious Affair at Styles</a></em>, where the murderer goes to elaborate lengths to frame himself for the murder of his wife, acting shifty, having public tiffs with her, being seen purchasing the poison, openly enjoying his newfound wealth, etc... albeit keeping a rock-solid alibi up his sleeve. The plan was to get speedily tried on a wave of public outcry, whip out the alibi at the last second, be found innocent on that shocking revelation alone, then be forevermore protected by the Double Jeopardy rule (in Anglo-Saxon law, one can't be tried for the same crime twice). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HerculePoirot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HerculePoirot">Hercule Poirot</a> foils this plan by refusing to allow the man's arrest until he has true evidence of his guilt.
</li><li> Also, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TowardsZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TowardsZero">Towards Zero</a></em>, culminating in a complex <em>double</em> set of framing: first, the real killer framed himself, clumsily, and then put together a much more professional set of planted evidence pointing at someone else. The desired end result was that the second suspect would be hanged for murder; the actual murder victim was only a means to an end.
</li><li> A variation is used in the short story (and later film version) <em>Witness for the Prosecution</em>, where a witness frames herself so her testimony <em>against</em> the defendant is later exposed as false, to help free him instead.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMurderAtTheVicarage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMurderAtTheVicarage">The Murder at the Vicarage</a></em>, the killers plant several clues to make it look like the victim was shot at the exact time when one of them came to the crime scene to see the victim. The police are meant to see through these clues and assume the crime was committed later.
</li><li> It's attempted by one of a pair of murderers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathOnTheNile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathOnTheNile">Death on the Nile</a></em>, but in such a clumsy fashion that Poirot sees through it before it can be a serious red herring, and the other killer is actually afraid that the stupidity of it is going to end up working against them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OrdealByInnocence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OrdealByInnocence">Ordeal by Innocence</a></em>, the killer makes sure he would be the prime suspect, then creates an alibi to mislead the police into thinking that someone else is trying to frame him.

He had already formed an opinion on other grounds, and interpreted the evidence to support his conclusion and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BluffingTheMurderer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BluffingTheMurderer">pressure the perpetrator into confessing</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FeetOfClay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FeetOfClay">Feet of Clay</a></em>, Vimes is investigating an arsenic poisoning, when he finds a packet of powdered arsenic in his office just as authorities suddenly arrive in response to a tip-off. Vimes' response is to hide the arsenic and "plant" some coffee sweetener on himself, then eat it theatrically in front of the authorities to make the frame-up look like a <em>clumsy</em> frame-up. That's right, he <em>framed his framers for framing him</em>.

Unfortunately, the Count was watching the whole thing, and after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">giving Valentine a drug to fake her death</span>, replaces the poison in the glass. When Valentine's death is discovered the next morning, the doctor is called, the murderer comes in to see what all the fuss is about... and is unpleasantly shocked to see the doctor (who had his suspicions about the many deaths in Valentine's family lately) examining the glass for traces of poison, which he quickly finds.

<ul><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Justified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Justified">Justified</a></em>: Raylan finds a witness to one of Boyd's crimes (who had previously refused to give evidence) and intimidates him into testifying, but stops cold when the witness asks for a picture so he knows who he's supposed to implicate. Turns out he didn't give a vague description because he was scared; he genuinely didn't get a good look. When he offers to commit perjury to help Raylan put Boyd back in jail, Raylan immediately turns him down.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hustle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hustle">Hustle</a></em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop">crooked DI</a> tried to extort 10 grand off a friend of the team, so they gave her the perfect opportunity to extort <em>them</em> &#151; that she would get the proceeds of their con, or she'd call the cops on them. Except, of course, they rigged it so all the evidence would point to her pulling off the con by herself, and then called the cops on <em>her</em>. Her original wrongdoing is never brought up.
</li><li> This was used in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em> called "Repression." An 18-year-old girl recovered memories of her father molesting her when she was young and planted images of child pornography in her youngest sister's room, in the hopes that it would be enough to get him in prison. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Subverted when the investigation later learns that the memory that was recovered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories">wasn't a real memory</a>, that her father never molested her or her two sisters. The typical SVU sadness kicks in because this was learned after her younger sister killed their father.</span>
</li><li> In one episode of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em>, a police officer is killed, and initial evidence points to the priest who molested the officer when he was a boy. It turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the officer's death was actually a suicide that had been staged to look like murder by the responding officers, who had no idea about any of this and were just trying to preserve his reputation and his family's survivor benefits by hiding the fact that he killed himself; the fact that it pointed to someone who had a checkered past was a total coincidence.</span>
</li><li> An unusual case of this in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em> episode "Mr. Monk and the Critic": Thanks to work from Monk and Natalie, the police suspect theater critic John Hannigan of murdering his girlfriend, Callie Esterhaus. So Monk, Natalie, Stottlemeyer, and Disher confront Hannigan at his office to question him about drugging and raping an underaged girl &#151; specifically Natalie's daughter Julie. Hannigan denies the accusation and claims he has never seen Julie before. This gives him away because Julie was performing in the play Hannigan was using as his alibi for the murder, and at one point in the show, she has a solo, where she looks exactly like she does right now. The fact that Hannigan says he doesn't recognize Julie proves he wasn't at the theater at all and was committing the murder. Goodbye, alibi.
</li><li> Played with in <em>The Lawyer</em> to the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstruction</a>. Frank Nordling frames one party for heroin possession as part of his gambit against another. His plan is to represent the defendant and get the court to accept a plea that involves no jail time. Unfortunately, the police also find an unregistered gun, and what was supposed to be a quick means to an end spirals out of control. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Although Frank gets the gun charge tossed, Therese - who is bipolar - develops extreme anxiety during her time in custody and commits suicide. Additionally, Frank getting his sister Sara, a recovering addict, to plant the heroin backfires predictably when she keeps some of the heroin and relapses</span>.

Later in the game, Abstergo gets wise to this and imprisons you and your co-workers while they investigate to find out who did it. During this time, however, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">your IT contact, rather than being an Assassin mole in a Templar run business, reveals himself to be a lunatic reincarnation of Aita who's trying to get you possessed by a virtual ghost (that of the ISU Juno upon aka the goddess Juno in mythology and Aita's wife before his first death and reincarnations in humanity); when he fails at this, he tries to kill you and is shot dead by security while you are on the ground from a non-fatal drug dose right next to him making it look like he was trying to make it look like he killed the perpetrator to cover for himself</span>. The circumstances of the aforementioned scenario and the evidence found in his files (and the fact that he is the Head of IT giving him access to places the player shouldn't technically be able to go in) is more than enough to divert all suspicion from you. So, in the course of trying to eliminate you, he frames himself for the crimes you actually committed, albeit at his behest.

They would have gotten away with it, but someone else planted even more evidence, framing them for being in cahoots with the (actually innocent) CEO. They had a lot of trouble defending themselves against the false charges because if they gave their real alibi, they would have revealed their real crimes.

<ul><li> Sort of used on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a>!</em>, when a series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">improbable events</a> happened to make Stan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbuseMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbuseMistake">look like a wife-beating</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForPedophile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForPedophile">child molester</a>. Stan's solution was to find somebody who, while innocent, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">deserved</a></em> the punishment anyway. They wound up framing it on a co-worker of Roger's who had screwed him over. The fact that the police found (legal) neo-Nazi apparel &#151; and that the detective in charge of the case was a <em>Holocaust survivor</em> &#151; was a rather handy bonus. Another bonus: Stan specifically describes his plan in a way that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">seems to point to the U.S. overthrowing Saddam Hussein</a>, who likewise deserved to get overthrown even though he was innocent of the specific crime he was accused of.
