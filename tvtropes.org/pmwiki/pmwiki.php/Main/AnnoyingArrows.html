The densest showers of arrows cannot hope to penetrate even the flimsiest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">Plot Armor</a>. After all, most dramatic combat plays out in hand-to-hand combat, so arrows are just the preamble to the real fighting.
</p><p>A character who actually gets struck with an arrow need only grab the shaft and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstAid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstAid">yank it out</a> with little more than some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyAFleshWound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyAFleshWound">momentary discomfort</a>, then go back to doing whatever they were doing. If they're too busy in the middle of a melee, they can just leave them in place and deal with them when things settle down. In extreme cases, a character might become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPincushion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPincushion">Human Pincushion</a> before going down.
</p><p>Note that this trope applies only to main characters. The rest of the time bows are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmostLethalWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmostLethalWeapons">Almost Lethal Weapons</a>, capable of instantly killing mooks with a single shot.

Arrow wounds often aren't instantly fatal, but the fact that archery was used effectively in hunting and warfare for thousands of years should make it obvious that this trope is not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. Arrows hurt, and you can't fight much at all with one stuck in you. Getting arrows out of you is also a difficult, painful and dangerous process. Casually yanking them out is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstAid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstAid">not</a> recommended. Arrows were also often covered in poison, or even dipped in putrefaction or animal waste to cause infection, so that even if the arrow itself was not lethal the wound certainly could be.
</p><p>Dismissing arrow injuries is often used to establish an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">Implacable Man</a> or someone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a>. The trope is almost always averted when it comes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrowsOnFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrowsOnFire">Arrows on Fire</a>: unlike real fire arrows, which were for setting wooden structures on fire and weren't very good anti-personnel ammo<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0lmx8');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0lmx8" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0lmx8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">they were slower, penetrated less, and did not use modern incendiary agents</span>, fire arrows in fiction can immediately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOnFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOnFire">set the person they hit on fire</a>. For slings being treated as similarly weak, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufferTheSlings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufferTheSlings">Suffer the Slings</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAreWorthless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAreWorthless">Guns Are Worthless</a> is this trope applied to bullet-based weaponry.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>: This is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">Zig-Zagging Trope</a>. How much of a danger arrows represent to a character depends on whether they're a human or Apostle, how badass they are, and who's doing the shooting. Because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless">Armor Is Useless</a> in this story for human <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirts</a>, a volley of arrows from a mass of archers or Guts' repeating crossbow will penetrate their helmets and breastplates, killing them instantly. The Apostle Irvine is probably the deadliest archer in-universe, since he can <em>decapitate</em> multiple human targets with one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiShot">Multi Shot</a> of his longbow from at least a mile away. For Apostles on the other hand, who are usually enormous monsters and at least far tougher than humans, any amount of arrows from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirt</a> archers is merely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfBarrage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfBarrage">The Worf Barrage</a> since such small projectiles <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">cannot hope to reach their internal organs</a>. If it's Guts, on the other hand, he might be able to at least shoot them in the eyes for significant damage. As for how our heroes fare, Guts is usually able to dodge volleys of arrows or use a dead mook as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletProofHumanShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletProofHumanShield">Bullet Proof Human Shield</a>. In the anime version of the Hundred Man Fight he even deflects some incoming arrows by a mere swish of his cape: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/BerserkAbridged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/BerserkAbridged">And now, just in case you had any faith left in humanity</a>...<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCyujnxaMYs#t=4m30s">know that someone, somewhere, thought that THIS made sense<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>". The <em>Golden Age</em> movies also have some instances of heroes like Casca swatting away arrows with their swords, and in later manga chapters Guts is able to use the incredibly broad flat of his BFS to shield himself. When a main character actually gets hit, the trope will usually apply in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">downplayed</a> form. Guts gets hit in the hand during the Hundred Man Fight, and snaps it in two with the same hand in a show of bravado. That said, it prevents him from using it to grip his sword and he has to one-hand it for the rest of the fight. He was also significantly weakened by previous arrow wounds in his fight with the Holy Iron Chain Knights, contributing to his collapse and capture. Casca, who is not as much of a tank as Guts, gets hit with <em>five</em> crossbow bolts when the Hawks get ambushed by the Midland Army, which is treated as very serious since she was wearing no armor and they hit her mainly in the torso. She spends three days and nights in a comatose state near death, but miraculously she survives and makes a full recovery within a year.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AnatoliaStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AnatoliaStory">Anatolia Story</a></em>: Played straight during the same event, with Yuri's horse Aslan. Aslan gets shot with multiple arrows and two land in its flank. The horse is downed for a while, but then gets up, shuffles Yuri onto its back and begins walking to find help. The arrows are eventually removed by Ramses.
</li><li> Uryuu Ishida from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> hits both sides of this trope, with his arrows ranging in effect from instant-victory attacks that completely obliterate an enemy's torso to not even piercing the skin, depending on the enemy and how much spirit energy he puts into a given shot. However, unlike normal arrows, Ishida makes his arrows from spirit energy, the same way a Zanpakutou is made. If you have a higher spiritual pressure, his arrows won't be able to pierce you. Inverted with the Quincies from the Vandenreich whose arrows are deadly and caused <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">over thousand deaths</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> it's "Annoying Kunai / Shuriken", as they are rarely useful against anyone except Mooks. It really sucks since this is all what the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">Improbable Aiming Skills</a> markswoman Tenten can do. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler">Thankfully Akatsuki has a lot</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirtArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirtArmy">of mooks</a> for her to kill. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Taken to extremes against Kinkaku when he's in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide">Six-tailed form</a>, two entire armies of shinobi rain an entire storm of kunai and shuriken at him... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootingSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootingSuperman">and he just blocks with his tail</a>.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon">Delicious in Dungeon</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hobbits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hobbits">Chilchuck</a> is not a strong person, nor a fighter of any sort as he'll often remind people. Even when using his bow it does little more than slightly chip some ice, with the implication that its primary use from him has always been to just point out weaknesses he spots.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> uses this as an important clue for a case. Conan, confused at the apparent time of death, sees a statue of the legendary warrior monk Benkei who was killed by a hail of arrows and died standing up because of the chemicals his body produced from all the activity. Thus, Conan realized that the murderer <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">got the victim worked up with a game of ping-pong so the time of death would appear different than it actually was</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheHatingGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheHatingGirl">The Hating Girl</a></em> is about a girl who has lived since childhood with an arrow <em>through her head</em>. The Japanese title (<em>Subete ni Iya Gaaru</em>, or "The Girl Who Hates Everything") is in fact a pun: the characters used to write "iya"/"hate" can also be read as "archery." (Possibly averted in that it apparently has happening to real people &mdash; who survived &mdash; but the manga plays it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">completely straight</a>.) It factors into almost every chapter in some way, and it's caused her a lot of emotional and physical pain, although she eventually begins to see it as a symbol of strength after she and her friend Ryouji become a couple.
</li><li> Played straight to a ridiculous extreme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kazan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kazan">Kazan</a></em> when the title character (who has the body of a child) is hit in the back of his torso by a barbed arrow. After some conversation, Kazan takes out a dagger, cuts off the feathers in one swift move, <em>and jumps backwards, landing on the arrow, forcing it forward through his chest where he grabs it and yanks it out.</em>
</li><li> Done passingly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyBrideIsAMermaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyBrideIsAMermaid">My Bride is a Mermaid</a></em>. After Mawari challenges <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronButtMonkey">Nagasumi</a> to some kind of physical card game that calls for fast reflexes, Sun and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronButtMonkey">Saru</a> join in. The show portrays it as extremely brutal, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">exaggerating like crazy</a> something that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneMadeAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneMadeAwesome">relatively normal</a> (which is normal for the show), and after it's over, all of the characters are still pretty much fine, except for a very severely beaten-up Saru sitting in the background with an arrow sticking out of his back. Keep in mind, you're not missing something here, this <em>is</em> still a (relatively) normal middle school. Of course, he's completely fine afterward for the rest of the episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessMononoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessMononoke">Princess Mononoke</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ashitaka takes off limbs and heads when he fires his arrows at normal humans, but only as a result of the curse he's under. When the curse isn't active, his arrows bounced harmlessly off samurai armor, including once where he hit someone's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardHead">head</a></em> with a glancing blow and they hardly flinch when their helmet deflected it. There was also a notable difference between the stone-headed arrows he brought from his own village and iron-tipped ones he snatched out of the air or liberated from the bad guys.
</li><li> We see Nago receive a face-full of arrows from Iron Town's residents. They do as much damage as a gentle spring breeze, and he just shakes them off as though they were blades of grass.

The action flashes back to her and all six arrows are miraculously out of her body; she then throws a gigantic axe-like weapon on a chain through the air, with great force, despite having been shot in both arms. She dashes around rapidly, evading thrusts, followed by acrobatic leaps, despite having been shot in a leg. She, like most of her red-clad fellows, fights while under the influence of some kind of drug that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelNoPain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelNoPain">totally eliminates the sensation of pain</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">which somehow also cancels out the damage done to their bodies</a>.

The wounded <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cutter</span> fights on for a few minutes before collapsing and then nearly dies despite having a healer around to work on him magically.
</li><li> Much later in the series, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cutter</span> gets hit by an arrow, and, there being no magical healer around at the time, he resorts to medical care by the trolls.

Not only does he keep running, but he barely bleeds even after he yanks it out. He goes on to evade a group of trained warriors, dive off a waterfall, and fall into quicksand, all without treating a wound that went straight through him.

Later, however, we see what a painful process it is to heal the wound. Guess the old man was just that tough. A later scene averts the trope, when a few volleys of English arrows do manage to inflict casualties on the Scottish. The only reason the English stop shooting is because Longshanks wants to kill off his Irish conscripts.

After which he still manages to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlowWalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlowWalk">walk towards</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">his attackers</a>, though he ends up collapsing before reaching them. The Criterion Collection version does have at least one of the essays defending the plausibility of the scene, given his armor and the placement of the fatal arrow.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Troy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Troy">Troy</a></em> has a few variations.
<ul><li> First there's Ajax, who simply snaps the arrows and keeps on. The worst part of it is that there <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Demythification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Demythification">aren't even any mythological properties in the movie to justify it</a>, and he later does the same thing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">to a spear through the torso</a></em>.
</li><li> As for Achilles himself, the one through his heel slows him down considerably. He is then shot twice in the chest, and while he does pull them both out, he moves in slower afterward. The third arrow to the chest stops him, and the fourth brings him to his knees. He pulls them out too, but then dies. When he is found, only the arrow in his heel remains visible, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel">presumably providing the basis for the legend.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoMulesForSisterSara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoMulesForSisterSara">Two Mules for Sister Sara</a></em>, Clint is hit by an arrow in the shoulder and knocked from his horse. The wound causes him great pain and the removal is complicated, with Clint removing the fletching and the rear part of the arrow and the titular Sara using the "pushing an arrow through his body" technique, followed by a crude cauterizing.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred">300</a></em>, this trope is played straight at first when the Spartans scoff at the Persian's threat that their arrows will "blot out the sun," using their shields as cover. Later though, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they get killed to a man from the hail of arrows the Persians fire at them</span>.
</li><li> In the Chinese film <em>An Empress and the Warriors</em>, the king is hit by an arrow which goes right through his chest. This is treated as a serious wound, but what actually kills him is being left alone with a treacherous subordinate.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMummyTombOfTheDragonEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMummyTombOfTheDragonEmperor">The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor</a></em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RainOfArrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RainOfArrows">Rain of Arrows</a> is fired upon the undead army summoned to fight the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s terracotta army. As one would expect, arrows are less than effective on enemies who can't be killed.
</li><li> Zigzagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheScorpionKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheScorpionKing">The Scorpion King</a></em>. The pull on Mathayus's bow is so strong only he can use it. It's shown several times that his arrows can send people flying. However, one of fellow Akkadians is killed by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mook</a> arrow volley early on. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is notorious for being able to block arrows with his sword and is even able to do this to Mathayus's arrow the first time. When Mathayus is hit in the back by a mook, he pulls out the arrow (meaning he has very good reach despite all this muscle mass) and uses it to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kill the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> who is unable to block the arrow in time</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AceVentura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AceVentura">Ace Ventura</a></em> does a variation on this, with two spears he gets embedded in his legs. Instead of sensibly dropping down screaming, he just points at them and screams in bewilderment.
</li><li> In the opening scene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRoadWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRoadWarrior">The Road Warrior</a></em>, crazed outlaw biker Wez slowly pulls a quarrel out of his arm while screaming in rage and pain at Max, who's watching from a safe distance. He then tucks the quarrel into a leg holster of other quarrels and drives off. Later Wez pins a man to his vehicle with quarrels, and Max has to cut him loose with a handy bolt cutter.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWolverine">The Wolverine</a></em>, Logan is brought down by several arrows near the film's climax. He manages to shrug most of them off until he's hit with poisoned ones which eventually knocks him out.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HanselAndGretel2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HanselAndGretel2013">Hansel and Gretel (2013)</a></em>, a man gets shot in the back by an arrow and falls. The moment the archer looks away, the man scrambles to his feet and runs as if he'd never been hurt.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> (of course) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrail">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a></em>. Sir Lancelot is about to hop across a river, when an arrow comes whizzing through the air, embedding itself in his consort's chest.
<div class="indent"><strong>Consort:</strong>Message for you, sir!<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note18iv2');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note18iv2" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note18iv2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He survives.</span>

The first hits her in the shoulder and she pulls it out. The second hits her in the thigh, seeming to hurt a lot more. But she pulls that out too, and fights on unimpeded.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mandy2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mandy2018">Mandy (2018)</a></em>, two members of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">Black Skulls</a> gang got shot with crossbow bolts. The first guy was flipped off the bike he was riding after he was shot, the fall did more damage and he was killed by a car. The second Skull got a bolt right through the neck. The Black Skull simply pulled out the bolt and was amused.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Padmaavat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Padmaavat">Padmaavat</a></em>, Ratan Singh isn't seriously injured after Padmavati's arrow hits him.

<ul><li> Played straight in the short story "Gilgamesh in the Outback." Gilgamesh (as well as everyone else who dies) is in Hell. He is hit with an arrow in the arm, and bites the shaft in half and pulls the arrow out. Of course, since he is half-god, this may be justified.
</li><li> The death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a>'s Reg Shoe. He continues fighting with several arrows sticking out of his chest for a long while before finally collapsing. It's pretty heavily implied he's already a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent">zombie</a> at this point, and it's even phrased that he only fell over because he decided he must be dead from the sheer number of arrows sticking into him.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FarsalaTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FarsalaTrilogy">Farsala Trilogy</a>, Commander Merahb is shot by four arrows, falls down, and attempts to get up again without missing a beat. Then, at least, he's caught in another volley of arrows and killed.
</li><li> This trope appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a></em>, when the giant Grawp is hit by a volley of arrows from a raging herd of Centaurs. He is shown to be in considerable pain when he tried to brush off the embedded arrows and only succeeded in breaking the shafts, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">unknowingly pushing the heads deeper into his body.</a>
</li><li> The protagonist of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MargaretAtwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MargaretAtwood">Margaret Atwood</a>'s <em>Lady Oracle</em> is struck by an arrow at an archery range during her summer job. Somewhat plausible, in that she's well-padded and it hits her in the rear, these are blunt target arrows (which can still kill you if you get in their way, but you might at least get to the hospital) and while the wound doesn't kill her, the ensuing infection almost does.
</li><li> Both invoked and averted in Book 11 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIliad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIliad">The Iliad</a></em>. After Paris has wounded him with an arrow to the foot, Diomedes angrily dismisses the bow as a weapon for "a woman or an idiot boy," claiming the spear is both deadlier and better suited to a warrior. The truth is, however, that the wound puts Diomedes out of action until the end of the fighting in Book 22. Played straighter earlier on where both Diomedes and Menelaus shrug off arrow wounds to continue fighting, though it's worth noting that the archer Teukros has one of the highest kill counts of the Greek warriors with 30.
</li><li> A discussion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarlockInSpiteOfHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarlockInSpiteOfHimself">The Warlock in Spite of Himself</a></em> is about the titular character wearing plate armor. When his manservant says that it will protect him from swords and arrows, the very agile fighter says, "Swords I can block, arrows I can duck, and plate still won't do a bit of good against a crossbow bolt."
</li><li> In the Conrad Stargard books by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeoFrankowski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeoFrankowski">Leo Frankowski</a>, Conrad introduces the concept of plate armor to the Poles. The English longbows still readily put holes in the armor, but the Mongol horsebows largely just stick arrows in the armor's surface. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Conrad himself does get shot in the face after removing his helmet, resulting in him losing sight in the eye on that side</span>.
</li><li> Played with in Charles McCarry's <em>The Bride of the Wilderness</em>: A side character is shot, but the arrow gets stuck in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kevlard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kevlard">abnormally dense subcutaneous fat</a> and doesn't hit anything vital. And while he's able to keep walking, it's made clear that it's <em>painful</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHunchbackOfNotreDame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHunchbackOfNotreDame">The Hunchback of Notre Dame</a></em>: This happens to Quasimodo: when he's shot in the arm he just pulls the arrow out, snaps it in half, and keeps going.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EddieLaCrosse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EddieLaCrosse">The Sword-Edged Blonde</a></em>, the lethality of arrows or lack thereof is discussed a bit. First, Eddie meets "Spike" (real name Allison), who has an arrow permanently stuck in her neck &#151; she has been advised that removing it would probably kill her, so she tries to make the best of it. Later, when Eddie shoots <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Canino</a>, it appears that Canino might survive, but another character who wants Canino dead pulls the arrow out so that the wound will bleed, making it fatal after all.
</li></ul><ul><li> Discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames">The Hunger Games</a></em> trilogy: A person Katniss shot with her bow pulls the arrow shaft out of his body, and the book correctly notes that he roughly halved his remaining lifespan by doing this.
</li><li> The centaurs in Dante's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy">Inferno</a></em> fire arrows at those damned for violence not to kill them, but only to inflict enough pain to encourage them to stay submerged in boiling blood. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified Trope</a>, since no weapon could kill an immortal soul, whether damned or blessed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStormlightArchive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStormlightArchive">The Stormlight Archive</a></em>, this generally happens when shooting arrows at anyone in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Shardplate</a>, with the sole exception of the very thin visor. That being said, this is inverted for the Parshendi, who use deadly-powerful shortbows and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">warform bodies</a> are exceptionally strong, making them lethal archers. In addition, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Oathbringer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Oathbringer">Oathbringer</a></em>, there's a <em>literal</em> annoying arrow when Shallan gets shot in the head with a crossbow bolt. Because she is filled with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Stormlight</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">the wound doesn't actually kill her</a>, but it does render one side of her body numb and she needs help extracting the bolt.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidEddings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidEddings">David Eddings</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheElenium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheElenium">The Elenium</a></em>, crossbows are considered a threat because they can punch through plate armour. No-one ever seems to worry about regular arrows, even though not even all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">Church Knights</a> wear full plate, and most soldiers don't appear to have armour at all.

<ul><li> In Korean drama <em>Princess Agents</em>, one of the main characters is fired upon by arrows at one part. He looks a bit more than annoyed since they do cause a good amount of bleeding, but there are somewhere between 10 to 20 arrows that hit him. He awakens the next morning with all of them removed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/XenaWarriorPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/XenaWarriorPrincess">Xena: Warrior Princess</a></em>:
<ul><li> Lucky for Callisto, she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> was a god at the time</span>, so she wasn't killed. Xena herself takes an arrow to the abdomen in Episode 2, and both pulls out, and cauterizes the wound herself. It only takes her a few days to recover- which just so happens to be one of the <em>longest</em> recovery times on the show.
</li><li> Gabrielle takes an arrow to the chest in one particularly memorable episode. It takes her a while to recover as well, but this is mostly due to the arrow being tipped with poison.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Xena</span> takes almost as many arrows as Callisto did in the featured picture, (pulling only some out), in the finale.

Justified for Spike, since he's a vampire and wounds like that are non-fatal as long as they don't hit his heart. In the same episode there is an amusing crossbow error, as Buffy shoots a bolt at the Native American ghost outside the window, who just casually bends aside as the bolt sails <strong>veeery</strong> slowly out into the night.

Note that in statistics of kills in the simulated fights the bow also plays a big factor.
</li><li> On <em>Fire Engine 132</em>, the firefighters are relaxing in the bay when a man comes in. He was apparently jogging, judging from his clothes and the sweat on them, when he was hit by an arrow. He was able to walk, under his own power, to the fire station, where the somewhat bewildered firefighters lead him inside the station proper for treatment. It is never bought up again.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em>, after Kensei is shot, Hiro just yanks the arrows out of his chest.

</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KungFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KungFu">Kung Fu</a></em>, one of Caine's enemies (a rogue Shaolin monk) attempts to assassinate Caine (before a commercial break, of course), by shooting him in the back with an arrow while he is meditating. In a later scene after the commercial break, Caine confronts his assailant, reaches around, pulls the arrow out of his back, and then contemptuously throws it at his enemy's feet.

<ul><li> When the Lannisters come after Yoren's group of Night's Watch recruits, a crossbowman shoots him in the chest. All it does is knock him to his knees, and makes him bite out a comment that he hates crossbows because they take too long to reload, followed by cutting down the crossbowman and killing several more guards, before finally getting overwhelmed.
</li><li> In "The Rains of Castamere", Catelyn takes a crossbow bolt in the back of her shoulder, but continues to function <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> until her throat is cut</span>.
</li><li> Subverted in the case of Jon Snow. Ygritte hits him with three arrows, and he rides off in pain, but essentially unharmed. Tormund later states that, given her skill and the close range, she deliberately avoided killing him.
</li><li> Tormund is a walking pincushion by the end of "The Watcher on the Wall" but keeps on fighting.
</li><li> Justified in "Home", when Wun Wun is hit in the back with an arrow. Being a 15 foot tall giant, it seems to piss him off more than anything, and his reaction is to casually pick up the archer and smash him against a wall.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> with the wights since, unlike zombies, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemovingTheHeadOrDestroyingTheBrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemovingTheHeadOrDestroyingTheBrain">Removing the Head or Destroying the Brain</a> doesn't work.

Crossbow bolts? He won't even stop walking to pull them out.
</li><li> Both subverted and played straight in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinHood">Robin Hood</a></em> series, where a character's reaction to being shot by an arrow generally depends on whether or not they're a main character. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> who get shot tend to die or at the very least, go down and stay down for the rest of the battle. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">The heroes however, seem much more resilient</a>. In the fourth episode, Robin takes an arrow to the arm and while he does cry out in pain, he is still able to ride a horse while holding a baby. Marian does have to sew the wound up later though. But the worst case is in the finale of the first series in which Little John is shot in the arm...<em>and barely notices!</em> He then yanks it out with no trouble, still not reacting as if it were anything worse than a slightly irritating splinter. One might be able to argue that his thick, heavy coat may have protected him a little but still...
<ul><li> In one episode, Robin goes on a rampage and starts killing the Sheriff's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a>, whereas previously he refrained from killing (he thinks Marian is dead and goes ballistic). Each arrow is invariably a kill shot to the Mook, even if they're wearing chainmail.
</li></ul></li><li> Ronon does this in his first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>, minus the cauterizing. On a more realistic note, McKay gets shot in the ass the next season and can't sit down the rest of the episode, and claims sciatica from it a few episodes later. Ronon can be excused, however, by being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">Implacable Man</a>. It's hard to say how the writers were treating this, as Ronon shrugs off most injuries and McKay will whine about most injuries.
</li><li> Inverted to the other extreme in a season 8 episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>, where a villager kills a Jaffa with a single crossbow bolt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless">through his armor</a>.

<ul><li> In the first series episode "Love Hurts", Leo is shot in the opening scene with an arrow. The trope is averted by the sisters taking the arrow wound itself very seriously and not brushing it off, but played straight in that the sole thing stopping Phoebe and Piper from trying to pull the arrow out the way it went in was Leo telling them not to touch it because it was poisoned. Then subverted again in that Prue's reaction to hearing the news is to telekinetically force the arrow out by pushing it through Leo's body to get it out rather than pushing it out the way it came in. The rest of the episode is more about the impact of the poison than the arrow itself. Justified to an extent in that Leo is the show's equivalent of an angel and therefore the arrow itself wouldn't be able to kill him which is why it was poisoned with special toxin designed to kill his kind.
</li><li> In "The Courtship of Wyatt's Father", Leo and Piper are shot with arrows. While Leo's injuries are taken seriously, Piper pulls her arrows out and treats them as a mind annoyance after it is established that the toxin doesn't affect witches.

He isn't seriously hurt though. The Egyptian completely ignores a dozen arrows sticking out of his chest, arms, and legs; but he seems to just be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">that tough</a></em>.

Being an android, he calmly removes the arrow and reassures her that her aim is improving.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Vikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Vikings">Vikings</a></em> Ragnar is shot in the shoulder with an arrow that penetrates all the way through. He snaps the shaft and then pulls the arrow out. he was in the middle of a fight to protect his family and the arrow would have limited his movement. While the wound does nor affect him much during the fight, afterwards the blood loss causes him to lose consciousness and he almost dies before receiving treatment. It takes him a long time to recover from that injury.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLegendOfWilliamTell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLegendOfWilliamTell">The Legend Of William Tell</a></em>. William uses two different crossbows, but almost never actually kills or even hurts anyone; instead he does things like pin sleeves to walls or trees, or knock weapons out of people's hands. Since he only carries one bow at a time, he only ever gets one shot off before having to wade in hand to hand.
</li><li> In the pilot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Atlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Atlantis">Atlantis</a></em>, Jason gets shot in the shoulder with an arrow. He pulls it out and keeps running, and is subsequently able to pull himself up through a window with his arms, before it gets bandaged.
</li><li> Despite arrows being Oliver Queen's weapon of choice in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em>, they typically come in two flavors. They're either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathBullet">instantly lethal</a> or a minor (if painful) annoyance. If its the latter, it will typically incapacitate the person, but they'll be seen moving around later like they were never hurt at all. It's probably shown the most realistically with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Laurel</span>, who interestingly was <em>stabbed</em> not shot with an arrow, where its treated as a serious problem that requires being rushed to the hospital, but not immediately fatal. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The wound <em>does</em> kill her, but not right away.</span>

It doesn't hinder him much as he and Gunner then fight off a hit squad sent by Rawlins to kill them, though he eventually collapses from the accumulation of wounds he took in the firefight, and once Frank and Micro get back to New York, Micro has to summon Curtis to get the remnants of the arrowhead out of Frank's shoulder.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KingdomAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KingdomAdventure">Kingdom Adventure</a></em>: At one point, Dagger gets hit by a stray arrow from Napps. He pulls it out later, but is in pain from it. Possibly justified by virtue of the fact that he's a magical being capable of shapeshifting.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Camelot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Camelot">Camelot</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">Zig-Zagging Trope</a>. It's mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averted</a>, with people on both sides of a battle being killed or seriously injured by them. However, when Kay takes an arrow to the gut, he gets back on his feet and into battle much sooner than what would be realistic (assuming he'd recover at all, which isn't certain).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOutpost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOutpost">The Outpost</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggingTrope">Zigzagged</a>. Everyone who's hit by arrows is at least debilitated, if not killed quickly. Even so, Tobin shrugs off being shot <em>four times in a row</em> with only a day's recovery time.

The trope is averted in one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevisedEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevisedEnding">Alternate Endings</a> - the arrow hits him in the shoulder, he collapses, and the palace burns down around him and the princess in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BolivianArmyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BolivianArmyEnding">Bolivian Army Ending</a>.

Although considering the theme of the song, the arrows are probably meant to be symbolic of the pain of unrequited love.

They do a bang-up job on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> of course, since all you need to do is hit with an Outcome of 5 or more to down them, but you're going to need a lot of arrows to even give your average named character pause, let alone kill him, since the base damage of a bow in this game is only 7, which is equivalent to an average kung fu warrior's punches or kicks. Taking your bow as a Signature Weapon increases its damage to 10, which is equivalent to your average 9mm pistol (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmostLethalWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmostLethalWeapons">Almost Lethal Weapons</a>).

<ul><li> Due to the way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a> work, it's possible for a high-level character to be hit and damaged dozens of times by arrows and still be in good shape. This is true for all weapons, however. Ranged weapons are generally balanced with melee weapons in various ways.
</li><li> The arcane spell Protection From Arrows, which either grants total immunity to damage from arrows and other projectile weapons (2nd Edition and earlier) or Damage Reduction (3.0 and later). The third edition version can be bypassed by magical weapons, which will be fairly common after about level 6.
</li></ul></li><li> Bows are low on the damage-dice totem pole compared with most guns in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands">Deadlands</a></em>. This can be very irritating for any characters who opt for the Old Ways Oath.
</li><li> Played straight in the various Warhammer 40K rpgs, bows and crossbows are categorized as 'primitive' weapons and so armour gets x2 protection against it and bows do low damage as a base. Shooting an Imperial Guardsman in a flak jacket is barely going to scratch him let alone going after a Space Marine in terminator armour.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasyRoleplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasyRoleplay">Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</a></em>. An arrow is a Damage 3 hit, the same as an average man swinging a mace or sword at you, only much harder to avoid. However, once you start leaving regular human enemies and low-level goblins behind and start fighting orcs and Chaos marauders and the like, your Damage 3 arrows go from quite effective to damn-near useless. You aren't playing your born-to-be-heroes <em>D&amp;D</em> characters here, you're playing ordinary people in a world where the ordinary person is woefully outmatched by most things. In 4th Edition, bows do scale with strength while crossbows and firearms do not, but the strength an average adventurer would need to match the punch of even a basic arquebus is extreme (strength bonus 6 or higher).
</li><li> In 7thSea, the bow is a powerful weapon, dealing about as much damage as a sword. It takes two actions to fire, making it much faster than the devastating - but devastatingly slow - guns.
</li><li> In early <em>Mechwarrior</em>, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> RPG, bows do not grant a strength bonus to damage&mdash;arrows deal between 2 and 9 damage per arrow. By contrast, a basic pistol can deal up to 15 damage per bullet. The average unarmored player character could theoretically take a dozen arrows and not die (they will still be wounded, of course, just not fatally).

</li><li> Rosa in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedII">Assassin's Creed II</a></em>. During a cutscene she's shot in the leg while climbing a building and promptly falls about a story back to the ground. Not only is she uninjured from the fall, but she's able to limp <em>at sprinting speed</em> and continue fighting with the arrow in her leg, though eventually she gives in to the pain and Ezio has to carry her to safety.
</li><li> The trailer for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedRevelations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedRevelations">Assassin's Creed: Revelations</a></em> kicks off with Ezio getting shot in the shoulder with an arrow, calmly snapping off the shaft and leaving the head in, before proceeding to beat the hell out of dozens of Templars with no visible problems, being overwhelmed only after being distracted. Since he wears some pretty heavy duty armour in the later games it's possible that the arrow didn't reach his flesh at all, but instead embedded in the armour.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIII">Assassin's Creed III</a></em>. A close to mid-range arrow is a kill shot, but be too far away and your arrows won't even kill a man. If that happens, it really puts the Annoying in Annoying Arrows: If your shot wasn't noticed, your victim and any friends of his will do a search for, like, fifteen seconds before shrugging and acting as though nothing happened.
</li><li> Taken to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">absolutely ridiculous extreme</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AsurasWrath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AsurasWrath">Asura's Wrath</a></em>, where hundreds of massive SPEARS that are practically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">Macross Missile Massacre</a> are still seen as only annoying by the title character himself.

A squad of archers or crossbowmen cuts a swath through armored knights, footsolders and pikemen. Against lightly armored troops, like knives or fencers, you might as well be throwing spitballs.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BraveTheSearchForSpiritDancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BraveTheSearchForSpiritDancer">Brave: The Search for Spirit Dancer</a></em>, enemies shot with arrows will gleefully continue to run around, even with several sticking out of them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>. Naturally, a crossbow bolt to a vampire's stomach does little.
</li><li> Played completely, and infuriatingly, straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastleCrashers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastleCrashers">Castle Crashers</a></em>. God damn Thieves Arena!
</li><li> Played straight by the unit animations in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization 4</a></em> even while being averted by the combat mechanics themselves; archery units have fairly impressive stats (at least by ancient and mediaeval standards), but when they're actually shown fighting a melee unit, they do so by first losing a round of more-or-less useless arrows and then resorting to hand-to-hand combat.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ConanTheBarbarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ConanTheBarbarian">Conan</a></em>. When the titular barbarian is struck with an arrow, all the player has to do is hit a button to have him yank it out, with no ill effects. Of course, Conan <em>is</em> one of the biggest badasses in literary history.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em>. Compared to melee weapons, the standard bows and crossbows do little damage. Their typical use for the player is to get an enemy's attention and draw them away from a group. However, they do stagger you, which can leave you open for melee enemies to tear you apart. However, around a third of the way in, enemies start to wield the massive Dragonslayer Greatbows, which do damage comparable to heavy melee weapons, and can knock you around even if you block. Also, rather amusingly, arrows remain sticking visibly out of your character model for a little while, which is hilarious when it's a greatarrow the size of a small spear and you look like a pincushion.
</li><li> Towards the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace2">Dead Space 2</a></em>, Isaac confronts Tiedemann, resulting in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the latter shooting the former with <em>two</em> javelins. How does Isaac respond? By yanking the javelins out - one of which looks like it must have deflated his lungs. He can even heal after the final battle, meaning he literally shrugged it off, via the same first-aid magic that can heal him from within an inch of death after a Necromorph mauls him</span>.
</li><li> Played mostly straight in both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Drakengard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Drakengard">Drakengard</a></em> games. Archers and crossbowmen are easily some of the most annoying enemies out there, but they're unlikely to kill you unless you stand around and let them. However, if you happen to be riding a dragon, a shot or two from an archer will knock you to the ground faster than you can blink.
</li><li> From the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonSiege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonSiege">Dungeon Siege</a></em> series, it is normal for enemies to end up with 6, 8, even 10 arrows visibly pin-cushioning them, and they keep coming.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dungeons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dungeons">Dungeons</a></em>, Minos has several arrows jutting from his back.
</li><li> Wooden bolts in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress">Dwarf Fortress</a></em> are outright useless against metal armor, and even metal bolts can require an <a class="urllink" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2049839010">absurd number<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> to kill an enemy. You can, however, send an absurd number of crossbow users to counter that; in the link, the giant was facing around a hundred marksdwarves, and didn't last much longer.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors">Dynasty Warriors</a></em> loves to play with this trope.
<ul><li> Due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a>, characters shot in cutscenes with arrows react fairly realistically, though as in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</a></em>, Xiahou Dun once gets shot <em>in the eye</em>, but was such a badass that he plucks it out with eye attached and eats the eyeball to strike fear into the hearts of his enemies.
</li><li> Archers in low difficulties are little more than an annoyance. Only in higher difficulties do you even have to start worrying about them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a></em>: Even high-level archers' arrows are reduced to Annoying if you have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Deflect Arrows</a> perk in the Block skill tree and make use of it. Reduced even <em>further</em> to the point of being simply "Thanks for Free Ammo!" if you have the Slow Time shout, allowing you to simply walk up and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrowCatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrowCatch">grab those pesky arrows out of mid-air</a>, with enough time to equip them and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchAndReturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchAndReturn">fire them</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchAndReturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchAndReturn">back!</a></em>
</li><li> Though this holds true for many roguelikes, the graphical Japanese take on roguelikes (filled with many hilariously wrong tropes especially regarding marriage/breeding), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Elona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Elona">Elona</a>, plays it straight. Equal skill in bows and throwing will still usually result in shuriken and sometimes even special throwing stones doing lots more damage than normal bow+arrow combinations, due to having larger min/max damage (as high as 1d25 for normal shuriken, based on material) and higher dex resulting in landing higher rolls more often. However, the best random artifact bow+arrow combination will still always beat shuriken, simply due to having double the skill/statboost (as you equip bows and arrows separately), as well as other cumulative effects. Still, the game does not strive for total realism like other roguelikes, only halfhearted, and so shuriken remain better overall for dungeon crawling because anything can bleed and shuriken cause 'cut' damage. Yes, even golems and the undead. Shot weapons do minimal damage against them, but the cut damage can be coupled with poison/acid to drain them away. There are also anachronistically guns available, but only the shotguns seem worthwhile.
</li><li> Two characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalDarkness">Eternal Darkness</a></em> can find a crossbow, but it has a lengthy reload time, and most monsters except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">Trappers</a> are barely affected by the bolts they fire.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em> arrows deal much less damage than sword strikes. They're mostly used for inflicting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects">Standard Status Effects</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsA2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsA2">Final Fantasy Tactics A2</a></em>: Without considerable cross-job stat-optimization, Bows and Greatbows have considerably lower Attack than the corresponding melee weapons, Archer's have below average Attack, and Rangers and Hunters have average Attack (though the later has some good abilities for boosting damage). The exception to this is the Sniper, which has the highest Attack of any Viera class and is tied with a couple others for the best attack of <em>any</em> class.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em>, for all that Rosa's bio describes her as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">one of Baron's most skilled archers</a>, her arrows are fairly weak and frequently miss unless you constantly utilise her "Aim" ability - generally players will prefer to stick to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagic">White Magic</a>.
</li><li> Hercules from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarIII">God of War III</a></em> doesn't take any damage from The Bow Of Apollo.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic">Heroes of Might and Magic</a></em>: While ranged troops can inflict some pain, they suffer from limited range (anything beyond halfway across the battlefield takes half damage) and the inability to shoot if enemies are close to them (in which case they have to resort to melee weapons and again deal only half damage, in addition to losing any special effects). Even factions with strong shooters, like Ramparts, are generally deciding their battles with the melee units.
</li><li> Played half-straight in most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> games. You often encounter enemy archers and being hit by them is more an annoyance than a real threat. Although <em>your</em> arrows tend to deal as much damage as one of the swords you get in the game, and usually more than the starting sword. It may be less a difference in arrow power and more the fact that once you've picked up a few Heart Containers, you can take more punishment than some bosses can, whereas the average mook has less health than you have even at the beginning of the game.
<ul><li> In some Zelda games, arrows that don't kill enemies will stay attached.

</li><li> Actually played for laughs in The Wind Waker. There's a friendly fish in each sector of the ocean who has some ferocious body aches that only acupuncture can cure. You have to shoot the fish with your bow as he leaps out of the water, and if you shoot him enough times within the time limit, he'll pay you 200 rupees and tell you how good it feels to have all those arrows sticking out of him.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rimworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rimworld">Rimworld</a></em>, in general projectiles aren't that powerful so your colonists and enemies can potentially pelt each other with arrows, javelins and bullets for several minutes until combined pain and blood loss puts somebody out of the fight. Although sometimes a vital can be hit and the target will be crippled or killed instantly. Additionally, any bleeding wound carries an infection chance if left untreated or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstAid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstAid">treated improperly</a>, which is <em>far</em> more serious.

<ul><li> Snipers have the Huntsman (and its cosmetic alternative, the Fortified Compound) bow as an alternate to the usual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SniperRifle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SniperRifle">Sniper Rifles</a>. Compared to bullets, Huntsman's arrows do pack a lot of punch after a quick charge (enough to kill many classes outright), but a Heavy that is being healed can run around with several arrows sticking out of various body parts without any side effects. Even if an arrow goes through his head. This is an interesting example, though, because while it's played absolutely straight if you don't get a kill, you can put someone down hard and fast with a well-placed, charged arrow. Overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure">Critical Existence Failure</a> for that reason. There's even an achievement (see picture) for hitting an enemy with 3 arrows without killing them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrowsOnFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrowsOnFire">The arrows can also be lit</a> by a teammate with an incendiary weapon.
</li><li> Both the Huntsman and the Crusader's Crossbow can play this straight due to their projectile-based attacks. Since they are physical projectiles, they use the much larger projectile hit box. This results in hilarious incidents where you can get killed by a headshot from an arrow that <em>missed your face by half a foot</em>. The annoying part comes in when the opposing sniper realizes that the lower wait time means he can spam more arrows in your general direction, rather than actually trying to aim, which ended up earning the weapon the nicknames "Huntspam" and "Lucksman".
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar">Total War</a></em> series handily subverts this trope. Your army can easily lose a lot of soldiers from an attack by a group of determined archers. The same also goes for slingers.
<ul><li> Units with heavy armor and facing your archers suffer few loses from arrows. Place your archers behind them (where shields are useless) and they become highly effective.
</li><li> Played straight in a subtle manner: soldiers dropped by arrows have a much greater chance of recovering after the battle, especially if they have heavy armor. Troops trampled by horses or felled in close combat with melee weaponry are more likely to not recover.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Turok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Turok">Turok</a>: Evolution</em>: Shoot an enemy in the arm with an arrow, and the arrow will take his arm off. Shoot them in the head, and they'll be decapitated. However, the larger enemies (incidentally, the ones with miniguns and rocket launchers) can take 3 or 4 arrows in the gut and keep fighting.
<ul><li> In the most recent <em>Turok</em>, the bow is quite possibly a gamebreaker. Enemies won't react to shots you fire if you're in cover (they'll panic at what the shot does to their buddies though...), and you quite happily puncture through hi-tech body armour resulting in a one-hit kill. The only "penalty" is the need to hold down the fire button for a second or two before letting rip.
</li><li> <em>Turok 2</em> for the N64 had realistic arrows for use against the monsters. Fill their arms full, sure, but one good arrow through the brain and they fall down dead. And joy, you can pick up the arrows again! Wheee!

However, Ballister chides her for her attitude, and proceeds to treat it as a serious injury. Leads to the page quote. Later on, the trope is played relatively straight after all: Nimona turns out to have the ability to heal very quickly, which allows her to fully recover from the wound within days. She simply forgot to tell Ballister about it...
</li><li> The J&auml;gers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius">Girl Genius</a></em> seem to have no problems with continuing fighting with several arrows sticking out of them.

Nevertheless, she remained a pincushion for the remainder of the fight. It does seem to actually affect her for a moment, as she slumps against the car she slammed into from the force of getting hit by five arrows and has about a minute long memory sequence. Then she gets up and slams a metal pipe through a man's skull and out the other side. So. Back in full effect again.
<ul><li> She's also fortunate(!) enough to have just been badly beaten by an opponent who knocked out all of her Materia, which is sort of like removing the adamantium from Wolverine's bones: a trade-off. She can't blast the archers at range anymore, but her ability to take damage just went through the roof. Given how the fight turned out, the arrows had an impressive (if still unrealistic) effect on it.

Most notably with Jacob Starr, who took not one but <em>two</em> crossbow bolts to the shoulder with little to no ill effect (although the character was absurdly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a>).

<ul><li> If <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnimalPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnimalPlanet">Animal Planet</a> documentaries are to be believed, a cat survived being shot by an arrow <em>through the head</em> - with no major damage.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OdaNobunaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OdaNobunaga">Oda Nobunaga</a> is believed to have once taken an arrow to the neck without flinching, a reaction that gained him the nickname of 'Demon King'. Of course, the reason this was noteworthy - let alone worth a nickname - was that the Japanese warriors of that age knew exactly how painful, and often lethal, a shot like that was.
</li><li> In 1403, the sixteen-year-old future King Henry V of England fought in the battle of Shrewsbury and got shot in the face with a longbow arrow. He survived thanks to the skill of royal physician John Bradmore, who employed honey as an antiseptic, used a clever instrument to remove the arrowhead without causing more damage, and flushed the wound with alcohol. Henry had permanent scars after the operation, but went on to have a storied military career.
</li><li> In Homer's <em>Iliad</em>, the famed archer Pandaros complains to Aeneas that even though he managed to hit both Menelaos and Diomedes, neither of these heroes seemed to be bothered much by his arrows. However, this was entirely due to divine intervention. And Odysseus apparently never saw a point in taking his bow to the war in the first place.
</li><li> Mongols wore clothing for the sole purpose of removing arrows with minimal damage. It was "raw" silk; at range, at least, most arrows couldn't penetrate this material since the finely-woven silk-strands would wind around the arrowhead, covering the barbs of the arrowhead. This would then allow the warrior to remove the arrow by pulling the silk shirt out, arrowhead and all, and it would keep the arrowhead from doing much damage; barbed arrows do most of their damage when being pulled <em>out,</em> so the "silk-winding" process kept the barbs from doing this. Silk's a strong enough fiber that the strands would simply unravel, rather than be cut by the sharp arrow. "Raw" silk is uncut after being produced by the silkworm, and so the strands remained long enough to remain full-length intact after penetration. They'd still punch holes in the human flesh underneath, but by pulling on the edges of the cloth, the arrow would come out of the wound. But <a class="urllink" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/379338.stm">don't just take our word for it<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> May or may not be apocryphal, but Guan Yu, a general in 2-3rd Century China (who has been deified over the years-just pay attention at your local Chinese restaurant-was once hit by a stray arrow on his arm during a battle, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSoldier">was about 60 when this happened</a>. Though the surface wound had healed, the bone would still hurt badly, especially during a rainy day. The doctor told him that the arrow tip had poison on it, and the poison had entered the bone. The remedy would be to open the arm and scrape away the poison. Guan Yu promptly stretched out his arm and bid the doctor to get to work. During the surgery, Guan Yu was eating and drinking with his fellow officers whilst the blood flowed from his arm into a basin below. Throughout the process of treatment, Guan Yu drank wine and conversed and laughed as usual, also qualifying him for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass">Four-Star Badass</a>.
</li><li> Japanese samurai would ride into battle wearing a <em>horo</em> &#151; a huge, cape-like silk cloth with their standard on it which would expand as if it were a balloon while riding a horse. The <em>horo</em> would severely lessen the arrows' impact and interrupt their path&mdash;when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheHistoryChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheHistoryChannel">The History Channel</a> show <em>Ancient Discoveries</em> tested it, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8B_6BU7SYf8&amp;t=6m06s">it reduced the chances of being hit<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> with an arrow by <em>seventy-percent.</em> They would still need medical help if an archer got lucky, but three hits out of ten definitely sounds better than getting peppered by archers.
</li><li> Played relatively straight by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JoanOfArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JoanOfArc">Joan of Arc</a>: contemporary accounts describe her being hit variously with a crossbow bolt in the leg, an arrow in the shoulder, and a heavy stone on the head. What <em>is</em> consistent in each of the accounts is that she simply had the wound cleaned, said a quick prayer and was perfectly well within a ridiculously short amount of time. Particularly, during Joan's battle in Orleans, an English arrow deeply pierced her between the neck and shoulder. By the power of faith alone she ignored the pain, pulled the arrow out with her bare hands, made a silent prayer, climbed back on her horse, and continued to lead her army to victory. Pure badass. This might simply be a case of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a>, but at the time it was seen as evidence that she might really have had divine help.
</li><li> Jan &#142;i&#158;ka of the Hussite wars fame lost an eye in his youth for unknown reasons, most likely a childhood fight. Later he lost the <em>other</em> one to an arrow while besieging the castle of Rabi in 1421. He then proceeded to win every battle he entered &mdash; <em>while blind</em> &mdash; until dying of plague in 1424.
</li><li> Cassius Scaeva, a Roman centurion, is supposed to have pulled the arrow out mid-battle when it hit him in the eye. In the same fight he was also wounded twice by javelins and by the end had over 100 arrows in his shield.
</li><li> Xiahou Dun, a Chinese general during the Three Kingdoms era is said to have been hit in the eye with an arrow. Legend has it he ripped the arrow and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">damaged eye out with it</a>. The legend then says he stared at it, said, "Essence of my father, blood of my mother, I cannot throw this away" and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">ate it</a>. His master, Cao Cao, promoted him for his trouble.
</li><li> Sait&#333; Musashib&#333; Benkei takes this trope in a slightly different direction - the large <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorMonk">sohei</a> was standing guard over a bridge to guard his master Minamoto no Yoshitsune's encircled castle while he committed seppeku, and Benkei is said to have killed over 300 men brave/foolish enough to try to cross the bridge. After all that, the remaining enemies decided it would be far safer to fill him with arrows from afar instead. They do so...but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisCannotBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisCannotBe">he's still standing exactly where he is</a>. Eventually reasoning something's off with how long he's been just standing there, his enemies carefully get closer to look at Benkei after which he finally falls to ground, having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiedStandingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiedStandingUp">Died Standing Up</a> while riddled in arrows. The arrows weren't exactly just annoying, but the story claims Benkei almost made it look like it.
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrusades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrusades">The Crusades</a>, Turkish and Mameluke archers often saw their arrows appear to have no effect on European knights and men-at-arms. This was because they were unused to fighting men fully clad in mail. Frequently, however, arrows would get stuck in the surcoats worn by European knights over their armor, so it would sometimes look to the Turks as though knights could keep fighting even with several arrows sticking out of them.
</li><li> The repeating crossbow (an Eastern invention that allowed one to simultaneously draw and release a bowstring simply by moving a lever) was limited to firing much smaller bolts than its non-repeating cousins, and a single arrow itself rarely resulted in death. However, these things were used en masse to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">overwhelm the enemy with a rain of arrows</a> and often were tipped with poison. This is also thoroughly averted with the larger-scale versions used for sieges, which fired larger bolts than the handheld versions.
</li><li> Kamakura Gongor&#333; Kagemasa, a samurai from the Heian period of Japan, took an arrow to the eye while sixteen and finished the battle with the shaft still sticking out. Another soldier tried to remove it rather roughly, by using his foot for leverage on Kagemasa's head, causing Kagemasa to take offense. The man apologized and removed the arrow more delicately. Other versions of the story have Kagemasa removing the arrow right after he is struck, and killing the offending archer by shooting it right back at him!
</li><li> Plate armor grew in popularity at least partly to make this trope a reality. Arrows &mdash; and bolts from insufficiently "heavy" crossbows &mdash; just aren't <em>powerful</em> enough to punch straight through decent steel plate; they have to find an actual gap in the armor or bounce. (Part of the reason archers remained useful against knights is simply that it's kind of hard to provide comparable full-body protection to the knight's <em>horse</em>.)
</li><li> Proper <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletproofVest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletproofVest">hard body armor</a> with the trauma plates required to handle rifle rounds can render arrows merely annoying. Unless one hits an area not covered by the trauma plates, in which case an arrow may actually have a better chance of penetrating than a small calibre bullet. This is because kevlar and other high-tensile fibres are specifically designed to absorb and dissipate kinetic energy, but are susceptible to being cut or forced apart by a sharp point.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfeilstorch">Several storks<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> have flown back from Europe with an arrow through vital-looking parts of their anatomy.
