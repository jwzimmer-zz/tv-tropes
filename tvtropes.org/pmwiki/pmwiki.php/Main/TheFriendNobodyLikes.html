<p></p><div class="indent"><em>"It's like that friend who's an asshole, but he's <strong>our</strong> asshole."</em>
<div class="indent">&mdash; <strong>Nick Webber</strong>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotTubTimeMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotTubTimeMachine">Hot Tub Time Machine</a></em>
</div></div><p>In a group of otherwise good friends, there's one character who's an unrepentant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> to everyone else. Or, if they aren't downright mean or cruel, they may be so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">stupid</a>, annoying, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">just plain weird</a> that it's embarrassing to be seen with them. In any case, asking a member of the group "Why are you even friends with him?" is a perfectly legitimate question. It can usually be answered with one or more of the following explanations:
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p></p><ol><li><strong>Seniority</strong>&mdash;The group has known this person for a long time. They might have even genuinely liked him or her at one point, but things happened over the years (such as personal development on either side) that resulted in this member no longer fitting in. However, the group keeps them around anyway due to either obligation, loyalty or familiarity.
</li><li><strong>Proximity</strong>&mdash;They're neighbors, classmates, family members, coworkers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropInLandLord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropInLandLord">landlords</a> or spouses/partners and the group simply can't be rid of them. So they might as well tolerate the nuisance to the best of their abilities in order to keep peace.
</li><li><strong>Necessity</strong>&mdash;They're worth keeping around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">because they're useful</a>, can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeamBenefactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeamBenefactor">provide something no one else can</a>, or they are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudcuckoolandersMinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudcuckoolandersMinder">Cloudcuckoolander's Minder</a> or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">Team Mom</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamDad">Team Dad</a> that holds the clique together in times of crisis.
</li><li><strong>Control</strong>&mdash;Someone with power over the group (parents, teachers, bosses, or the (un)official leader.) is forcing them to include this person, who is likely a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonmastersGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonmastersGirlfriend">spouse/partner</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism">relative</a> to said higher power. Or the disliked friend could even be that authority figure themselves.
</li><li><strong>Fear</strong>&mdash;The last thing you want to do is piss this person off by telling them they can't join in. Similar to this is:
</li><li><strong>Goodwill</strong>&mdash;in which the others will allow the disliked "friend" to tag along not necessarily because they're afraid of his or her wrath, but because they are too nice to tell them to sod off.
</li><li><strong>Pity</strong>&mdash;They're such a pathetic loser that the group just can't bring themselves to kick them to the curb. Alternatively, the group might keep them around <em>because</em> they are pathetic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawLoser">since hanging out with the loser makes everyone else feel better about themselves</a>.
</li><li><strong>Audience Popularity</strong>&mdash;Sometimes a jerkish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a> will start hanging around the group just to feature them more prominently.
</li><li><strong>Supervision</strong>&mdash;The disliked character is too dangerous or irresponsible to be left to their own devices.
</li><li><strong>Deserving</strong>&mdash;Despite their faults, the character has some redeeming qualities that the others recognize, or else they've done something to earn a place in the group.
</li><li><strong>Caring</strong>&mdash;<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Deep down</a>, the group (or at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend">one member</a>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeReallyDoCare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeReallyDoCare">really does care</a> (or the disliked character cares about them), and the issues all boil down to difficult behaviour. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">Even the closest of friends fight with each other from time to time</a>, but at the end of the day, they are still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a>.
</li></ol><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>It's not even that their friends aren't aware of their behavior, either. They're perfectly aware that the person is a jerk, or a geek, or a ditz, and will frequently treat them as such based on their behavior. They still get included in the group nonetheless, with the group often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHeartwarming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHeartwarming">defending them if any outsiders insult or mistreat them</a>.
</p><p>In some cases, it's discovered that the group <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwLookTheyReallyDoLoveEachOther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwLookTheyReallyDoLoveEachOther">really does care about this friend and vice versa.</a> In other words, "They may be a pain in the butt, but they're <em>our</em> pain in the butt." Often uttered right before such lines as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOnOneIsAnAttackOnAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOnOneIsAnAttackOnAll">You mess with them, you mess with all of us</a>!" or "We're not leaving anyone behind!" The character may have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">a breakout episode</a> that explains the reason for their attitude or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">reveals a human side that never showed before</a> (such as a cute hobby or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenHeartOfGold">Hidden Heart of Gold</a>).
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>More tragic examples may lead to the disliked character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope">Jumping Off the Slippery Slope</a>, and their former "friends" bitterly regretting that they tolerated someone so obviously malicious for so long.
</p><p>This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. Chances are you have a "friend" like this (or multiple "friends"), or you may even be that "friend" yourself.
</p><p>Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">Vitriolic Best Buds</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithFriendsLikeThese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithFriendsLikeThese">With Friends Like These...</a>, where this kind of attitude is usually limited to one or two select members of the group as opposed to being the opinion of the group as a whole.
</p><p>This trope may overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoserFriendPuzzlesOutsiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoserFriendPuzzlesOutsiders">Loser Friend Puzzles Outsiders</a>. However, in this trope the whole social circle hates the "loser" rather than an outsider to the group, and the person may actually have some cause for being disliked. In the other, the person is usually presented as being an innocent victim of prejudice, whether it's related to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist">social Darwinism</a>, jocks vs geeks, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlobsVsSnobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlobsVsSnobs">Slobs vs. Snobs</a>, or racism, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fantasticracism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fantasticracism">fantastic</a> or otherwise.
</p><p>If The Friend Nobody Likes is a protagonist or otherwise portrayed sympathetically, he may instead become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">The Woobie</a>. The Friend may also be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly">The Gadfly</a> if they aren't an up-and-out jerk.

</li></ul></li><li> Tosahwi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DeadlyClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DeadlyClass">Deadly Class</a></em>. As Zenzele puts it, "He hangs out with us almost by default. He has no one else, so he buzzes in our periphery." He's extremely angry and unpleasant and it's not at all exaggerating to say that <em>nobody</em> likes him, but Helmut can't avoid him because they're roommates, and Zenzele and Quan are Helmut's friends.
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a></em>:
<ul><li> The extent of it varies from writer to writer, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> is typically this for the Justice League. His brooding, antisocial, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">rudely</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">stoic</a> personality clashes pretty badly with a lot of the League, as does his paranoid tendency to form &#147;contingencies&#148; against his own friends. But he's one of the greatest heroes ever and the other heroes would be screwed without him, if not just from a lack of funding from Wayne Enterprises. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> is the only person who really likes having him around on a consistent basis, but between Bruce's paranoia and the duo's totally opposing personalities, even Clark can find him tiresome.
<ul><li> This can also occasionally extend to the rest of the Batfamily, who have often had their reputations tarred <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltByAssociation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltByAssociation">because of their association with Batman</a>. Many heroes distrust them and think they&#146;re only really loyal to Batman; after the events of the &#147;Tower of Babel&#148; arc (where Batman got himself temporarily kicked out of the League with his behavior), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries">Robin</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Oracle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Oracle">Oracle</a> both had to put up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a> and the rest of the Justice League shunning them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing">Nightwing</a> generally avoids this, both because he&#146;s just that much of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> and probably because his relationship with Batman is well-known to be rocky.
</li></ul></li><li> When it's not Batman (and even Bruce often barely tolerates him), it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow">Green Arrow</a>. While few can debate that Ollie <em>generally</em> tries and usually manages to do the right thing, no one can overlook his arrogance, obnoxious moral grandstanding and virtue signaling, habitual all take and no give interactional dynamics with most of the people in his life, and general disingenuousness, and that's <em>without</em> getting into his incessant philandering and truly pathetic record as a parent. It's no accident that most of his allies just kind of tolerate him even on his good days, and there's also a reason why he never really goes for any length of time without someone calling him out on his bullshit.
</li><li> Rose Wilson/Ravager is this to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a> for a large variety of reasons, the least of which is the fact that she&#146;s the daughter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deathstroke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deathstroke">one of their archenemies</a>. Her relationship with her team mates is often strained and sometimes outright hostile, especially with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl">Wonder Girl</a>. The only Titans who consistently get along with Rose are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlueBeetle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlueBeetle">Blue Beetle</a> (who privately admits that she still kind of scares him) and Kid Devil / Red Devil. It eventually gets so bad that she quits the team. Later, when she considers coming back, the Titans actually have a debate on whether to let her back in. For comparison, Bombshell, a traitor who tried to kill the Titans and is pretty unpopular herself, was allowed back with little question after her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a>; Rose is so disliked that an actual traitor is more accepted then her. As a result, Rose ultimately decides to not rejoin and instead leaves to find her own way in life.
</li><li> For the villains, we have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheJoker">The Joker</a>. In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a> enough to usually bring him into whatever group he is starting, mainly because while he's psychotic, unpredictable, and irritating, it's much more preferable to have him on your side rather than having him pissed off at you for not inviting him. Interestingly enough, despite both of them backstabbing one another, Lex and Joker team up often and seem to enjoy another's company.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl2011">Post-Flashpoint</a></em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a></em> genuinely believes nobody likes her because she's short-tempered and ever-angry, and they only put up with her because they find her powers useful. In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedDaughterOfKrypton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedDaughterOfKrypton">Red Daughter of Krypton</a></em> storyline Kara thinks no one wants her around because she is too dangerous after being kicked out of the Red Lanterns.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JohnConstantine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JohnConstantine">John Constantine</a> is pretty hated among the heroes who know of him. He's a manipulative man who will rope other people into his efforts and has been known to come out unscathed when those who've worked with him get the short end of the stick. Underneath it all, he's a good man who feels responsible for those he's been powerless to protect.
</li><li> Ragdoll of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretSix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretSix">Secret Six</a></em> is viewed as a complete weirdo by his teammates, who openly state how much he freaks them out and they keep him around mostly for usefulness and, it's implied, partly out of pity. And even Ragdoll is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">squicked</a> when new team member Black Alice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFetishist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFetishist">develops a crush on him.</a> Ironically, he's probably one of the most popular characters among fans of the series.
</li><li> It's been revealed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BoosterGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BoosterGold">Booster Gold</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PowerGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PowerGirl">Power Girl</a></em> that even before his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Face&#150;Heel Turn</a>, Max Lord was only tolerated at best by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueInternational" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueInternational">Justice League International</a> because they believed that despite his deceitful and manipulative nature, he was a good person&mdash;a belief that ended with his action in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis">Infinite Crisis</a></em> with many now wanted him locked up or outright killed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em>
<ul><li> None of the major characters particularly like Rorschach. Even Dan Dreiberg, the only one willing to describe him as a friend, has a lengthy list of grievances with the sexist, homophobic, hypocritical asshole who keeps breaking open the locks on his house in order to come in. He's mostly tolerated because part of <em>Watchmen</em>'s point about costumed vigilantes is that you'd have to be pretty messed up to be one; they genuinely don't have anyone but each other.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BeforeWatchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BeforeWatchmen">Before Watchmen</a>: Minutemen</em>, none of the Minutemen particularly like the Comedian, even before he tries to rape Sally Jupiter, but there aren't enough other costumed heroes around for them to be picky.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Several characters from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a></em> are eligible for this on both sides:
<ul><li> For the heroes Namor the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SubMariner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SubMariner">Sub-Mariner</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a>, and Sunfire. Namor for being a considerable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> <em>at best</em>, the Punisher for being a murderer who doesn't arrest criminals (and he also makes it clear to almost any hero he encounters that he regards them as dangerously naive), Deadpool for being a psychopath and annoying, and Sunfire for being a self-righteous, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong">obnoxiously patriotic</a> asshole <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectHero">with a xenophobic streak</a>. Of them, only Deadpool and Sunfire have gained any true acceptance from the other heroes; the former because of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">tendency to help others</a>, the latter because of his skill in battle and courage.
</li><li> After Namor attacked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackPanther">Wakanda</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AvengersVsXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AvengersVsXMen">Avengers vs. X-Men</a></em>, his reputation among the hero community is now even worse. When Namor is kidnapped by the Kree in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheInvaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheInvaders">All-New Invaders</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> bluntly states that most people would likely say "Good riddance" upon hearing the news. Cap himself is usually one of the few people who can stand him (Namor being one of the few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> allies of Cap who's survived into the modern era), and even that was lost after the Illuminati mindwiped him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Wolverine">Wolverine</a> was this on the X-Men, early in his career. Basically he was a huge jerk-ass who argued with everyone except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JeanGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JeanGrey">Jean Grey</a>, and even with her made it very clear he'd like nothing better than to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Cyclops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Cyclops">Cyclops</a> out of the way. His popularity, character development, taking a paternal role with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/KittyPryde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/KittyPryde">Kitty Pryde</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Jubilee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Jubilee">Jubilee</a>, and mellowing of his personality due to self-discipline have made him the person <em>everyone</em> wants on their team, because he gets things done and always has your back. (The version of Wolverine in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate Marvel</a> universe was even less popular, because the Ultimate universe's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> approach meant that Ultimate Wolvie was <em>even more</em> of an asshole.)
</li><li> For the villains, nobody really likes Boomerang. Even with the usual pack of no-hopers who make up the lower echelons of Marvel's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery">Rogues Gallery</a>, Boomerang goes further than most by being a selfish, cowardly, backstabbing asshole with an ego visible from space but basically nothing in the way of achievements to back that up. It's so bad that he's forced to buddy up with Life Model Decoys of his old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorFoesOfSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorFoesOfSpiderMan">Sinister Several buddies</a> because they tossed him out and is currently (and unknowingly) living with Spider-Man!
</li><li> Red Skull's popularity among the other villains makes Boomerang look like Mister Rogers. Red Skull is a die-hard Nazi (being Hitler's right-hand man) and still maintains a fanatical belief in Nazism, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">which means virtually every villain despises him</a>. <em>Nobody</em> except Crossbones (another Nazi) likes him; even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a></em> turned on him in a crossover when he realised that the Nazi uniform was intended to be taken seriously. The Skull is particularly disliked by Magneto (a Jewish mutant whose backstory heavily features time in a concentration camp) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorDoom">Doctor Doom</a> (a man of Roma descent who takes nearly everything <em>very</em> personally), and because Magneto is particularly influential among villainous mutants and Doom is...well, Doom, this tends to drag his reputation down among everyone else. Not even Kingpin wants to do anything with him (American capitalism clashes against Nazism as both would tell you). He's rarely ever involved in villain team-ups because the partnerships almost always conclude with his newfound allies trying to kill him. One of the few times he did join a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfDoom">Legion of Doom</a>, in one of Loki's all too common off days, the day wasn't even over before Magneto <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/AwesomeMoments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/AwesomeMoments">buried him alive</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OriginalSin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OriginalSin">Original Sin</a></em> retcons that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuckyBarnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuckyBarnes">Bucky Barnes</a> was this to most of his friends, with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a LMD of</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NickFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NickFury">Nick Fury</a> claiming, "I never liked you, you son of a bitch", and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine">Wolverine</a> saying the same. This fact isn't much referenced if at all outside of Original Sin however.
</li><li> Most Marvel heroes don't like or trust the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thunderbolts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thunderbolts">Thunderbolts</a>, which is understandable given they're mostly made up of villains claiming to reform. That's not even getting into the fact that the first Thunderbolts team was actually the Masters Of Evil trying to trick everybody as part of their latest scheme. It doesn't help that even those whose attempts to reform were genuine often get stuck in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor">Heel&#150;Face Revolving Door</a>. The sole exception to this is Mach V, who's been reformed so long and is such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> that he's more or less proven himself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> gets this treatment from time to time. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/X23" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/X23">X23</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7666/1162823-marvel_team_up_06__2005__page_20.jpg">makes sure he's aware of it.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> In the original run, i.e. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LeeDitkoSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LeeDitkoSpiderMan">Lee-Ditko Spider-Man</a></em>, he was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Hot-Blooded</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWannabe">Heroic Wannabe</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TestosteronePoisoning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TestosteronePoisoning">Testosterone Poisoning</a> prone to harassing the Fantastic Four and fighting them so that he can audition to join them, after he mellows out and loses the major chip on his shoulder, his constant joking and battle banter, his tendency to make fun of everyone, not only villains but fellow heroes and say the wrong thing a the worst time, makes other supers less than happy to team up with them. Other superheroes also find his mask and his fixation on having a private life (i.e. maintaining a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Secret Identity</a> which most Avengers don't) selfish and a sign of his lack of commitment.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RainbowRowellsRunaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RainbowRowellsRunaways">Rainbow Rowell's Runaways</a></em>, Chase is obviously this to Gert despite saving her. Then in issue 6, even the narrator calls him the lamest Runaway (they keep him because he has a car.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateFF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateFF">Ultimate FF</a></em>: When they won, Reed wanted to hug everyone in celebration. Coulson stepped back in horror.

</li></ul></li><li> Julie from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScottPilgrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScottPilgrim">Scott Pilgrim</a></em>. The only reason the main characters spend any time with her is because she is Stephen Still's on-again off-again girlfriend. And she throws regular parties.
<ul><li> Scott himself to a minor extent. All of his friends regularly mention how much they dislike him, even if in a semi-joking manner. He doesn't seem to mind too much. Knives is the only person of the group who fully likes him (without ever badmouthing him) and she has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> tendencies.
<ul><li> The main reasons seems to be Seniority and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeart">because he holds them together</a>. From an individual standpoint of each character, they've known him the longest compared to the others. Beyond that, he seems to be the main thing they have in common, being friends with Scott.
</li><li> However, it's clear that they do care for Scott and he for them; one could say their snark and exasperation is a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughLove">Tough Love</a>.

At one point, Swerve threw a costume party with the theme "People You'd Like To Punch"; Rodimus describes himself as 'a lone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Megatron</a> in a sea of Whirls'. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Megatron is also not exactly popular when he joins, for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldBeRudeToSayGenocide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldBeRudeToSayGenocide">multiple obvious reasons</a>.</span>

He loses almost all of his social clout after Izuku manages to humiliate him twice by accident. Bakugou himself is shaken by this and falls back on old habits rather than trying to correct his behavior because he doesn't understand what he's doing wrong.

Walter and The Dude only seem to tolerate him because he's on their bowling team; the Dude almost never talks to him and the most common lines Walter says to him are "Shut the fuck up, Donny" and "You're out of your element, Donny". This is not due to a failing on Donny's part, but because Walter and The Dude are varying degrees of assholes.

He is at best tolerated by his fellow seniors for a combination of reason 1-3. They've known him forever (he's actually been in school <em>longer</em> than they have), they're all stuck in the same high school, and as Randall "Pink" Floyd admits, he's a really good offensive lineman in American football.
</li><li> Cameron in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeadPoetsSociety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeadPoetsSociety">Dead Poets Society</a></em> is a fairly unpleasant individual who kisses up to the school staff and mocks people behind their backs.

</li><li> Barry from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FourLions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FourLions">Four Lions</a></em> is kept around by the group because he's by far the most idealistic and enthusiastic about jihad. He's also a very charismatic preacher, and adds a fifth member to the team by radicalizing him at an outreach event. Unfortunately, he's also a stupid, cruel, violent psychopath whom Omar cannot control.

Introduced in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LethalWeapon2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LethalWeapon2">second film</a>, Leo was originally a federal witness that Riggs and Murtaugh are assigned to protect. The two cops not only hated the fact that they had to play babysitter but also that Leo was very obnoxious. Leo later returned in the following two sequels, now a friend of Riggs and Murtaugh but the two are still annoyed by him and sometimes even abuse him. In spite of this, Leo remains very loyal to them, and the two cops have shown to genuinely care for him at times.

He's deemed selfish and arrogant by most of his peers (and S.H.I.E.L.D.'s dossier on him as well) and particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheFirstAvenger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheFirstAvenger">Steve Rogers</a> finds him to be abrasive and an un-heroic glory hound. However he's a good member of the team and did ultimately come around and win the respect of his fellow members. Funnily enough, Tony's abrasive, casual attitude <em>does</em> get him the friendship of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIncredibleHulk">Bruce Banner</a>, since Tony is the only person who treats him like a human being instead of a ticking time bomb. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This comes back to help him at the end of the film, where Tony nearly dies falling to Earth and the Hulk, recognizing their friendship from his time as Bruce, saves his life</span>.

Of course, this is mostly because Bruce admits he was in the wrong and apologizes (and was a lot more cautious about the whole thing to begin with) while Tony thinks he was still in the right and keeps trying to justify his actions.

When M'Baku and his fellow tribesmen first appear, nobody is happy to see them and Zuri treats him as an unwanted guest as the Jabari have been pariahs in Wakanda for over a thousand years, and the Jabari are also unfriendly towards the rest of Wakanda. Part of why M'Baku initially refuses initially to send his army to help T'Challa in his fight against Killmonger is that up until T'Challa accidentally came, no Wakandan king had been bothered enough to visit Jabari-land in centuries. In the end of the movie, attitudes appear to have changed as M'Baku and by extension, the Jabari, are given a seat on the Ruling Council.

Ladj and Thai constantly insult him and, in the dream he has while unconscious, they both abandon him and tell him he's on his own.

</li><li> Even after Anakin becomes Darth Vader, he remains this trope among Imperial forces who tolerate him solely out of fear, necessity or in Tarkin's case, begrudging respect. Palpatine holds a small quantity of affection for the fallen Skywalker, but being pure evil, he doesn't truly care about Anakin and is more than willing to cast him aside if he can find a stronger apprentice.
</li><li> C-3PO in the original trilogy. Han, Leia and Chewy find him to be annoying and insufferable and R2-D2 belittles and bullies him most of the time (though to say they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> is an understatement).

It doesn't help Slytherin's case that most of its students, i.e. the majority of those we see, are arrogant, racist, elitist snobs that come from pureblood families that think that they're better than anyone else. Pretty much every well-known Slytherin character's parents were also Death Eaters that only got out of going to Azkaban by claiming they were "bewitched."
</li><li> Snape, among the Hogwarts Faculty and the Order of the Phoenix. Everyone finds him to be a very unpleasant person, and Snape doesn't particularly try to deny that image. Still, he has Dumbledore's trust, and therefore everyone else tolerates his presence and gives him their trust as well.

</li><li> In <em>The Strange Case of Origami Yoda</em>, Harvey hangs out with Tommy and co but does nothing but whine and argue with them. It's pretty obvious that none of them like him because of his behavior, yet they keep him around anyway.

John B claims that all his friends are dead. He is also something of an outsider, being a fiercely intelligent and educated man with an interest in some very obscure topics who lives in rural Alabama. He mostly hangs out with local ne'er-do-wells, but is significantly older than them, has a very different world view and has a tendency to go off on long-winded rambles on whatever catches his ire that day. The ne'er-do-wells, on the other hand, admire his skills with practical chemistry and metalwork and humor him in his intellectual musings, but think he is weird and kind of creepy.

Among the loyalists, Jaghatai Khan's insularity and remoteness, Russ's studied brutality, and Lion El'Jonson's politicking meant that they were not well-liked; in the early stages of the Heresy, the Khan and the Lion were the ones everyone considered to have a high risk of siding with Horus.

Additionally, nearly every time he appears, he manages to provide a clue that helps crack the case...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeAsUnhelpfulAsPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeAsUnhelpfulAsPossible">eventually</a>.

<ul><li> Kotoba Gaikoku, a notorious pervert who hits on both boys and girls. Even Taiko, his best friend, freely admits he's an idiot, and after it's revealed that Kotoba <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">not only got manipulated into helping out with the murder plot, but had been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">stalking Momoko</a> for some time</span>, Taiko is unable to say anything in Kotoba's defense. In Taiko's case, Kotoba is an example of Seniority, since they've known each other for a long time, and Caring, since Taiko has seen times when Kotoba has proven to be a decent individual.
</li><li> Hiro Shiratake is an arrogant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> who thinks most people are beneath him. The only people who seem to like him are Runa, whose crush on him blinds her to his faults, and Momoko, his girlfriend, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the latter of whom ends up killing him for cheating on him</span>. He's a Dating example, as well as a minor Control example, since the only reason Rie invited him and Momoko was because Runa asked her to.
</li><li> Mika Tamashii is a fairly obnoxious prankster who loves scaring people, having set out to scare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredAndEight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredAndEight">108</a> people so that her dad will buy her ice cream, and most characters are exasperated with her. She's the only character besides Hiro who doesn't have a best friend at the party; the other pairs are Raiko and Nobara, Runa and Rie, Momoko and Kamen, and Kotoba and Taiko. In the good ending, however, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she manages to befriend Kamen, who'd previously written her off as not worth her time, by virtue of being there for Kamen when she's grieving for Momoko's death</span>.

</li><li> An even bigger example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">Teala</a> from season three.

Even after he's back, the other characters still seem to dislike him, Rodan even says he scares the shit out of him. On the villain side, there's Gigan, who constantly tries his best to make friends, but is perceived by everyone else as annoying and stupid. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Titanosaurus</a> counts as well, due to his insane, psycho behavior.
