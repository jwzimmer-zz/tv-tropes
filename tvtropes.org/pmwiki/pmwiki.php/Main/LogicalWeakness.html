The only problem is that her abilities rely on her incredible knowledge of human body language, meaning that it's practically useless against aliens, robots, and even some metahumans. In other settings this wouldn't be much of an issue, but given that it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink">the DCU</a>, she tends to run into this problem fairly often, though thankfully she's still borderline superhuman in her strength and agility. Notably, Cassandra also ran into problems when facing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a>, of all people. While he would normally not be considered a good enough fighter to pose a threat to a martial artist of her caliber, she has a hard time reading him because, as Batman puts it, "his body language just comes out as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu">gibberish</a>."

However, this doesn't work if the target is A) soulless, B) void of any regrets, C) so sadistic that they don't even care (looking at you, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thanos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thanos">Thanos</a>), D) draw power from pain, or E) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">bli</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneSolution">nd</a>, though it should be noted how this ability works is portrayed inconsistently as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a> something such as lack of regret won't stave off the effects of the Penance Stare.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PlasticMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PlasticMan">Plastic Man</a>, because of his rubber based powers, has been known for having a vulnerability with extreme temperature changes and (in some incarnations) being in contact with acetone.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">Wolverine</a>:
<ul><li> He can't pass through metal detectors because of his skeleton. He is also vulnerable to magnets. (This doesn't stop him from attacking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto">Magneto</a> as if he doesn't remember what happened the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">last zillion times</a> - his skeleton also makes him vulnerable to magnetism) Of course, this doesn't stop him in any story that requires him to travel by plane. At least once this has been played for laughs, with Wolverine and another character walking out of an airport while she comments on how she's always wondered how he got through metal detectors and now she knows. The reader, of course, is not privy to this information. Once, he walked into the Pentagon, and showed a medical certificate stating he has metallic prosthetics due to war injuries. Not far from the truth. In the Ultimate Universe, he once got in by sticking a (fake) grenade into some guy's bag so airport security would freak out and he could sneak past the detectors in all the confusion... Ultimate Wolverine is a bit more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> than regular Wolverine.
</li><li> There's also the fact that having his entire skeleton coated in adamantium would kill him without his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a>: Not only is adamantium toxic, (there's a reason real-life prosthesis involves biologically inert metals like titanium) but it would prevent his marrow from functioning properly.
</li><li> Speaking of things toxic, while his healing factor makes him highly resistant to toxins in general, it also counteracts things like anaesthetics and sedatives, making the rare surgery he needs extremely difficult at best. It also means getting drunk involves a <em>titanic</em> effort on his part, and with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">his background</a>, he could use getting drunk a little more often.
</li><li> His metal bones weigh a lot, causing him to have difficulty swimming and to make it even worse drowning is one of the few ways to kill Wolverine, since drowning starves the brain of resources. His healing factor can't save him either, because there is nothing to heal - and even if brain cells were regrown, they wouldn't make the same connections.
</li></ul></li><li> His daughter/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppositeSexClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppositeSexClone">Opposite-Sex Clone</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/X23" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/X23">X23</a> suffers many of these same weaknesses, though her body is not severely impacted by adamantium itself since only her claws are bonded.
</li><li> X-23's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> Kimura's body is indestructible; not even adamantium blades can damage it. She has no protection from telepathic attacks, and she still needs to breathe. She once suffered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmmaFrost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmmaFrost">Emma Frost</a>, and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AllNewWolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AllNewWolverine">All-New Wolverine</a></em>, X-23 kills her by drowning her in the ocean.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KittyPryde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KittyPryde">Shadowcat</a>:
<ul><li> She can only stay phased inside an object as long as she can hold her breath. When the character debuted, it was pretty clear that she couldn't breathe <em>at all</em> while phased, which made sense because air, while not solid, would still be out-of-phase relative to Kitty. This was either a source of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a> because there's no air inside solid objects, and the air wouldn't move with her. It would just dissipate. This limitation was invoked for story reasons, to make the character sometimes vulnerable when in costume. It changed to its current interpretation around the time of the Mutant Massacre, when she got injured and her default state became "phased". If she couldn't breathe while phased, this would have killed her quickly.
</li><li> Also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers">averted</a> in that she is never shown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers">dropping through the center of the Earth</a> whenever she phases, so it is assumed she can apparently create phase boundaries on the soles of her feet allowing her to walk on solid ground even though she is out of phase with it. She examined the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> of this and learned that "down" was what she made of it. She can walk on <em>nothing,</em> a power that she's used to great effect on several occasions. Used as a weakness in one instance, when a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a> Wolverine attacks her by stabbing her not-phased foot. Ouch.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Colossus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Colossus">Colossus</a> can turn himself into organic steel completely, including all the internal workings of his body. Apparently he does not have blood in this form (and neither does it require it). One downside to this is that if something does manage to injure him through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh Invulnerable</a> status, turning back into the more frail and bleeding human form would be a Very Bad Idea. Fortunately he can still heal with time. In his metal form, the equivalent of setting broken bones requires heavy machinery. Also much like Wolvie, he is vulnerable to magnetism, leading to problems fighting Magneto.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JonathanHickmansXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JonathanHickmansXMen">House of X</a></em> #2 reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Moira MacTaggert</span> has the mutant power to return to the womb at the time of her death with all of the memories of her past lives intact. However, as Destiny points out, it's a <em>mutant</em> power, which means it won't activate until she reaches 13. If she dies before then, then she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Sandman:
<ul><li> Humorous example verging on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness">Weaksauce Weakness</a>: the Sandman was first defeated when Spider-Man <em>vacuumed him up.</em>
</li><li> He also once teamed up with Hydro-Man, until they realized that if they touched, they combined into a sort of composite sludge monster. They got stuck that way for a while. When they separated, Sandman was so traumatized he pulled a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a>, at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">for a while</a>.
</li><li> Similarly, intense heat or electric attacks can turn him to glass. Sometimes when fighting the Sinister Six, Spidey and other heroes use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDodging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDodging">Deadly Dodging</a> to get Electro to do this.
</li></ul></li><li> Spider-Man:
<ul><li> He has been shown to be susceptible to pesticides that affect spiders. He can't stick to surfaces that are sufficiently slick.
</li><li> His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderSense">Spider-Sense</a> can also be rendered useless or even a drawback if faced with overwhelming danger from multiple sources. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a> also proved that if Peter can build a tracer that emits a signal detectable by his spider sense, then others can build devices to trigger false positives in his spider sense, rendering one of his greatest advantages useless.
</li><li> Peter was the main host to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Venom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Venom">Venom</a> symbiote for a while before he got rid of it. The close connection meant that the Symbiote has an understanding of every part of his physiology, including the Spidey-Sense, and has adapted itself to not set it off. Venom is one of the few foes who Peter can't see coming.
</li><li> The sense isn't very specific, and can thus be fooled by misdirection. For instance, in one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhatIf">What If?</a></em> story, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a> set a trap with a Dr. Octopus dummy and a bomb. Spidey assumed that his danger sense was going off because he was about to tangle with Doc Ock and never realized the real threat until too late.
</li></ul></li><li> The aforementioned Hydro-Man was defeated in his second battle with Spider-Man when the wall crawler tricked him into spreading his liquid form too far and left him unable to reform his body before evaporating. As he is made of water, he can also be defeated by being turned into ice and kept at the right temperature, such as when Spider-Man used an Ice Pellet to take him out effortlessly. He is also vulnerable to electrocution.
</li></ul></li><li> Longtime <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica">Justice Society of America</a> villain Johnny Sorrow has the ability to kill anyone who sees the face beneath his mask. Naturally, this didn't go over well when he tried to use it on Dr. Mid Nite, who is blind.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Firestorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Firestorm">Firestorm</a>'s main power is transmuting matter. He can change practically anything into practically anything else, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Alchemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Alchemy">lead into gold</a>, or air into gold, or bullets into water, or water into plutonium. Not even considering his additional powers, this would make him nigh-godlike, except for one detail: he has a normal human mind and no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSenses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSenses">Super Senses</a>, so he needs to mentally keep track of the chemical composition of everything he transmutes. This means that he can transmute things freely into elements and very simple compounds (like water (H<sub>2</sub>O) or salt (NaCl), and maybe even TNT (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>) at most), but making things more complicated than that requires great concentration, if he can do it at all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a></em>:
<ul><li> While not their most prominent weakness, Kryptonians are at least hurt by high-powered sonics. Their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSenses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSenses">Super Senses</a> and invulnerability seem to roughly cancel each other out in this instance.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedDaughterOfKrypton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedDaughterOfKrypton">Red Daughter of Krypton</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SelfDemonstrating/Lobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SelfDemonstrating/Lobo">Lobo</a> uses a sonic grenade to neutralize <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a>. On the one hand, it works and Kara passes out because of the extreme pain. On the other hand, she's <strong>real</strong> mad when she comes to.
</li><li> Superman and Supergirl's weakness to red sunlight fits as their powers depend specifically on yellow sunlight. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ManOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ManOfSteel">Man of Steel</a></em> versions depend on multiple factors of Earth's atmosphere for their powers, thus exposure to a Krypton-like atmosphere can shut their powers down.
</li><li> Superman's super resistance to injury proves a problem when he is shot with a kryptonite bullet and needs surgery. Fortunately, the surgeon is clever enough to use a shard of the bullet he could access to weaken Superman just enough to make the incisions necessary to extract the rest.
</li></ul></li><li> Quite a few heroes with regeneration powers have logical weaknesses as a result. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SavageDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SavageDragon">Savage Dragon</a>'s bones will knit wrong if not set quickly (forcing him to re-break them), Claire from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em> avoids this by having her healing not kick in until foreign objects are removed and bones set but this obviously has its own drawbacks as Claire can be stuck unconscious until someone happens along to help her. Batman once faced a dilemma trying to remove a kryptonite bullet from Superman as the wound was closing around the bullet too quickly and he was still tough enough to resist surgical instruments. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">Hulk</a> required surgery, he sought out Doctor Doom to help, who built an <em>adamantium chainsaw</em> to use in the procedure.
<ul><li> One issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GhostRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GhostRider">Ghost Rider</a></em> made use of this in offense: A villain named Scarecrow (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">no, not that one</a>) had been imbued with a healing factor which seemed to make him practically immortal. Ghost Rider decided to solve the problem at least temporarily by breaking all of his limbs and holding them in place crooked while the bones mended.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a>'s regeneration is actually tailored to work <em>with</em> his cancer. It replaces cells killed off by the cancer at around the same rate that the cells are killed off, with room to spare for other wounds and injuries. A group of Skrulls, during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretInvasion">Secret Invasion</a> storyline, tried to make a group of Skrulls with his healing factor... but without the cancer to hold the healing in check, they overhealed and exploded. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> hits hard though when you remember that cancer <em>itself</em> is uncontrolled cell growth. Which his healing factor cuts down to normal-ish levels. His entire body is pretty much one big human-shaped mass of cancer cells, constantly dying and regenerating again. Is it any wonder why he's completely, utterly insane? (One theory actually posits that his insanity is at least in part due to his brain cells being constantly reconfigured by the regeneration.)
</li><li> Most Marvel magical heroes, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wiccan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wiccan">Wiccan</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScarletWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScarletWitch">Scarlet Witch</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorStrange">Doctor Strange</a>, use spoken spells and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGesture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGesture">Magical Gestures</a> to use their power. They can be incapacitated by anyone who can get them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoundAndGagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoundAndGagged">Bound and Gagged</a> &mdash; if not taken out first by a rush of tranquilizer darts they never see coming &mdash; which has led most of them to learn the basics of self defense so they can protect themselves physically.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Loki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Loki">Loki</a>'s frequent cohort <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheEnchantress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheEnchantress">The Enchantress</a> is one of the most powerful sorceresses in the Marvel Universe. Unfortunately, she needs her hands and voice to cast spells most of the time. Sturdy bonds and a gag are enough to do her in, as both the Frost Giants and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorStrange">Doctor Strange</a>'s partner Clea have demonstrated several times.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Zatanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Zatanna">Zatanna</a>, who activates her magic by speaking backwards, is one of the DC Universe's top magic users, but, because she needs to verbalize her spells, she can be rendered helpless if she's made unable to speak. This leads to Zatanna frequently being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoundAndGagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoundAndGagged">Bound and Gagged</a> by her enemies. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Catwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Catwoman">Catwoman</a>, who does not possess powers, <a class="urllink" href="https://i.imgur.com/Gnh04O9.jpg">easily defeats Zatanna by duct-taping her mouth shut and pushing her out of a window<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>.
</li><li> Likewise <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Shazam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Shazam">Shazam</a></em>'s Marvel Family gets their powers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByThePowerOfGreyskull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByThePowerOfGreyskull">By the Power of Grayskull!</a>&mdash;Billy and Mary say "Shazam!," while Freddy says "Captain Marvel!" Especially in the Golden Age, they got gagged a lot to create tension. (You'll also notice that Freddy's weakness goes an extra step&mdash;since his code name is Captain Marvel Jr., he can't say <em>his own name</em> without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HenshinHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HenshinHero">changing back to his mortal form</a>. Hence why he kept wanting to change it.)

</li><li> When Mr. X joined the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thunderbolts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thunderbolts">Thunderbolts</a>, he bragged at length about being able to predict every move his opponents made based on a combination of low-level telepathy and reading body language. This served him well until he came up against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Quicksilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Quicksilver">Quicksilver</a>. Suddenly, being able to predict his opponent's moves didn't help at all since he still wasn't fast enough to counter them. Trying to fight against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AmadeusCho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AmadeusCho">Amadeus Cho</a> also went badly, because telepathic contact with Cho's genius level intellect and seeing mathematical patterns <em>everywhere</em> was disorienting to Mr. X.
</li><li> Sebastian Shaw can absorb kinetic energy to make himself stronger, making attacking him directly useless. However, he still needs to breathe, and has no special resistance to temperature - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Storm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Storm">Storm</a> once made him run away by making the area so cold that he couldn't stand it.
</li><li> Shaw's Hellfire Club-mate Harry Leland can increase the mass of things near him, without changing their volume, making most people trying to attack him unable to move from the weight. Unfortunately, if you've already pouncing towards him in an attack from above, the increase in weight is only going to make for a heavier crash.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmmaFrost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmmaFrost">Emma Frost</a> eventually developed a "secondary" mutation with a new power (no, not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostCommonSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostCommonSuperpower">that one</a>, she ALWAYS had that): being able to become living diamond, much like Colossus' organic steel above. Also much like him, she became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh Invulnerable</a>, almost totally impervious to physical attacks, temperatures, etc. The downsides were that she lost her psychic powers (though she was also now fairly invulnerable to others'), and while she's yet to be actually "beaten down" the occasional writer remembers that diamonds are hard but they're <em>brittle</em>. When struck properly her form cracks, and she was once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiterallyShatteredLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiterallyShatteredLives">completely shattered</a>, needing the walking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> known as the Phoenix Force to be put back together.
</li><li> The level of available oxygen affects the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HumanTorch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HumanTorch">Human Torch</a>'s powers, as well as a good soaking. The Venom symbiote once blasted him with a huge amount of sand that smothered his flame. The Thing has proven that super strong lungs can blow out Johnny's flame. Plus his powers are unreliable in a vacuum.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SubMariner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SubMariner">Sub-Mariner</a> comics by Marvel, Atlanteans have this dependency on water given their aquatic adaptation, with the exception of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">the mixed breed Namor</a>. Same can be said of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Aquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Aquaman">Aquaman</a>, though his dependency on water <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowingOffTheDisability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowingOffTheDisability">eventually faded</a> going into the new millennium.
</li><li> For a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a>, anything that affects their concentration or undermines their resolve can weaken their effectiveness given that their power is directly dependent on their willpower. Indeed, each color of the Emotional Electromagnetic Spectrum represents a specific emotion, and lacking that emotion weakens the corresponding Lantern. From red to violet these emotions are Rage, Greed, Fear, Will, Hope, Compassion, and Love.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> finally figured out a weakness for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a>, who has no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness">Weaksauce Weakness</a>. Her upbringing was highly competitive and she won the right to represent her culture in man's world by winning a competition. Batman guessed correctly that her body would give out before she ever willingly gave up and came up with a way to force her into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingAShadow">Fighting a Shadow</a>, as seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueOfAmericaTowerOfBabel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueOfAmericaTowerOfBabel">Justice League of America: Tower of Babel</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LukeCageHeroForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LukeCageHeroForHire">Luke Cage</a> has skin that is tough enough to resist explosions, bullets, and any edged weapon except adamantium, but his internal organs are every bit as squishy as a normal human's, and his invulnerable skin makes it almost impossible to surgically treat any injuries. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JessicaJones2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JessicaJones2015">Jessica Jones (2015)</a></em>, the only way Jess could stop a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a> Luke was by shooting him in the head point blank, which didn't directly kill him, but it did give him a near-fatal concussion. When his brain began hemorrhaging, nurse Claire Temple had to <em>stick a needle around his eye</em> in order to reach his brain and drain the fluid to save his life. And even that only worked because the super-strong Jessica was there to hold him down when he started convulsing. If both ladies weren't present, he would have surely died. And like Wolverine, he can still drown if thrown in a body of water and prevented from swimming.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flash</a>:
<ul><li> The Flash's powers are all about kinetic energy; they move with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> and doing so requires super-charging themselves with kinetic energy, and most of their abilities generally involve some application of this. So what's the opposite of kinetic force? Coldness (the absence of heat/vibration in atoms). Captain Cold, Golden Glider, various ice-villains, and many others have weaponised this specifically for this reason, while it's also been shown that the Flash doesn't do <em>super</em> well in cold environments.
</li><li> Also, as powerful as The Flash and the Flash Family are, with the sole exception of Jesse Quick (who inherited both her dad's super speed and her mom's super-strength), they're generally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedsters</a>; they heal fast, but an enemy with significant super-strength and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh-Invulnerability</a> can tank most of their hits and easily overpower them. They also have nothing to protect them from mental attacks, and, as was demonstrated once, their speed has a very unfortunate effect on pathogens, meaning that if they become infected with viruses or diseases, it will hit them harder and faster than a normal person.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/TheFlashTheFlashes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/TheFlashTheFlashes">Bart Allen</a> had his kneecap blown off, and was rushed to a hospital. During the surgery his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> meant that his flesh kept trying to heal improperly before an artificial kneecap could be placed, forcing the doctors to cut him open repeatedly. His metabolism meant that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">no anesthesia could be used either</a>. The same series reveals that he can't get tattoos; they heal in no time.
</li><li> For a time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WallyWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WallyWest">Wally West</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">the Third Flash</a>) had his powers reduced to more "realistic" levels with some obvious drawbacks. His upper limit was about the speed of sound (any faster would tear him apart), he required massive amounts of calories to fuel his metabolism, and his uniform had to be made of special low friction materials (and required frequent repair and replacement). Eventually the "Speed Force" was discovered, which not only increased his powers to a level even greater than his predecessor Barry Allen, but also provided numerous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers">Required Secondary Powers</a> to remove these weakness<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0sy1e');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0sy1e" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0sy1e');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">as explained, all these previous weaknesses were down to Wally being smart enough to recognise the scientific impossibilities of his super-speed, so he unconsciously developed these weaknesses; the Speed Force causes it's users to self-actualise, so they're as weak or as powerful as they believe they are, which is also why some have powers the others don't</span>. He's still a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Big Eater</a>, though, but it's because he wants to be.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Taskmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Taskmaster">Taskmaster</a> has the power to copy the skills and movements of anyone. However this doesn't grant him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers">Required Secondary Powers</a>, which can potentially render a copied skill useless; he once copied someone's diving abilities only to nearly drown when it turned out he hadn't bothered to copy the ability to <em>swim</em>. His copying powers also overwrite his memories and own skills, as he still has the mental capacity of a normal person; not only has he forgotten how to perform some basic menial tasks but he's also forgotten most of his childhood, his ex-wife, and possibly even his daughter. And when up against Deadpool's random insanity, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu">he can't predict anything</a> and gets confused and beaten pretty quickly. He has a similar problem with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MoonKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MoonKnight">Moon Knight</a>. It's not that he can't predict or copy him, it's that Moon Knight's fighting style is too gluttonous for punishment for Taskmaster's tastes.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a>:
<ul><li> His radar senses are pretty useful most of the time. Too bad they can become blurred and disorienting if there are too many objects around at once. Plus his strong senses mean he's sensitive to extremely loud noises. The movie depicts him as having to rest in a sensory deprivation tank to be able to sleep.
</li><li> Daredevil's super-hearing often acts as a lie detector when he can hear irregularities in someone's heart rate, so as lawyer Matt Murdock, he took on a client who told Matt, with a steady voice and steady heartbeat, that he did not order the murder he was accused of. The man turned out to be a career criminal with a pacemaker, used to telling lies with a straight face, who had indeed ordered the hit. Although Matt got him acquitted in court, he still met justice by the end of the issue.
</li><li> It's long been established that Daredevil can read ordinary print thanks to his super-sensitive touch. In the 21st century, though, more and more vital information appears on screens. Because it's not (currently) common knowledge that DD is blind, this has occasionally left him screwed, such as when Elektra handed him a piece of plot-critical evidence on her smartphone.

For example, Spider-Man beats him by tricking him into absorbing one chemical, and then burying him in another chemical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">that reacts explosively with the first</a>. He can be shattered if he turns into a brittle substance, diluted if he turns into liquid (although he later figured out how to keep himself together), and if you trick him into touching toilet paper, then he's going to be as fragile and easily torn as toilet paper. He also once absorbed all the properties of Thor's hammer- including 'Thor can control this hammer'.

This means that he can be shut down by EMP attacks, and powerful magnets cause him certain significant issues. Plus, in his original body, his construction in the 1920s meant that, for example, his fingers were not designed to cope with modern touchscreens (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">though logically this one could be easily remedied by having a custom stylus fingertip installed</a>).

<ul><li> Furycrafters can manipulate various elements and their powers are generally disabled through simple application of the opposite element. Aircrafters are covered in dirt, earthcrafters are suspended off the ground, watercrafters are dehydrated (and often placed in hot areas near fire), firecrafters are placed in small spaces (so any fire cooks them alive) or placed in pools of water, and wood/metal crafters are canceled out by covering the person in question in the opposite material. Disabling someone with multiple elements is trickier, but doable, but powerful crafters with reasonable power in all 6 elements are virtually impossible to contain as anything that cancels one element will simply empower one of the others.
</li><li> The Vord Queen specializes in these, to the point where at any point where her enemies seem to be winning, she improvises (or already planned) a solution that nullifies her foes' advantage.

</li><li> One of the main limitations on magic in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> (at least magic preformed by humans, as magical creatures like faeries seem to instinctively understand their abilities) is that you really have to know what you're doing for something to work. You can't transform someone into a frog without knowing an awful lot about the anatomy of frogs... and if you don't want to destroy someone's mind in the process you have to really know neurosciences. So, essentially, it's impossible, as well as being against the Laws of Magic because it's so dangerous.
<ul><li> There do seem to be some exceptions, as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyNeighborhoodVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyNeighborhoodVampire">Werewolves</a> Harry hangs out with turn into beasts that look like wolves to the casual observer, but wouldn't fool, say, a zoologist. They don't seem to fully understand the details of everything they should need to know for this trick, but that's probably why they are limited to exclusively changing themselves into wolves and back and no other form of magic. They did also get help from an outside source which <em>does</em> instinctively know all of that.
</li><li> Another of magic's major rules is that effects called by magic, once out there, will follow the laws of physics unless you explicitly control them. So sure, you can call up fireballs... but you'd better be prepared for the fact that you just set the entire room on fire. Shielding spells can block whatever you want, but they have to be specifically made to block any one thing. Harry ends up with his hand badly burned when he goes up against a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Renfield</a> with a flamethrower, as his shield blocks the physical material, but does nothing to stop the heat it throws off, a mistake he later corrects by ensuring his shield will block heat as well. He also takes advantage of this against the Genoskwa <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note29fgm');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note29fgm" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note29fgm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">basically an evil bigfoot</span>, which has powerful magic resistance. Harry lands several hits on it by creating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson">slivers and balls of ice</a> and throwing them at the Genoskwa with magic. Once the magic to produce the ice and propel it have been applied, they're just mundane pieces of ice flying at high speed, meaning magic resistance is totally useless.
</li><li> Nicodemus Archleone is protected from pretty much all harm because he wears the noose Judas used to hang himself around his neck like a tie. However, the Noose doesn't protect him against one thing &mdash; itself. Harry tries to throttle him with it twice, and the second time comes damn near to actually killing him. When we see him again, his voice is rougher, showing that the choking did permanent damage to his throat.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Mistborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Mistborn">Mistborn</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Whatevermancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Whatevermancy">Allomancy</a> which follows a very strong <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">Magic A Is Magic A</a> system, so many powers come with obvious weaknesses as a result of their effects. Burning tin gives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSenses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSenses">Super Senses</a> which is great for lookouts and scouts, but leaves you vulnerable to loud noises or bright lights. Pewter gives you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> and durability, allowing you to shrug off potentially lethal wounds, but continuing to push your already injured body is incredibly dangerous, particularly if the pewter ever runs out. Bronze can be used to sense people using Allomacyy nearby, but Copper blocks it from detecting them. However many types of Allomancy will be incredibly obvious to anyone looking at the person, so if you can see someone using Allomancy it but not sense it, you know someone is using Copper nearby. Iron and Steel (telekinetic control of metals) require a <em>really</em> good understanding of elementary physics- relative weight of the object you're Pushing or Pulling will determine if you or it goes flying, and Pushing or Pulling at the wrong angle could very easily send you flying into buildings at high speeds.
</li><li> The fact that the Church of God Awaiting doesn't know <em>how</em> the Charisian protagonists of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Safehold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Safehold">Safehold</a></em> stay one step ahead of them so consistently does not stop them from developing countermeasures against it. The Empire of Charis has access to technology far beyond the planet's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis">Medieval Stasis</a>, letting them spy on just about anyplace they want. While simply assuming Charis just has damnably good spies, the Church works out their Temple is a blind spot and give their troops fake orders sending them one place before changing at the very last second to throw off Charisian response. Zhaspahr Clyntahn also organizes a network of agents who have no direct contact with one another to prevent spies from learning anything by an overheard conversation.
<ul><li> The Church is also unknowingly aided by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillfullyWeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillfullyWeak">self-imposed weakness</a> of the Charisian leaders: they can't reveal their technology, so even if they do get wind of something before it happens, in many cases they can't respond to it much faster than they could if they were really dependent on a spy network and mundane communication and transportation technology, nor reveal that they know things that would be utterly impossible for normal spies to ever discover.

For example, to actually be completely undetectable Griffin has to strip down until he's naked since his clothes don't turn invisible with him; this makes exploiting his invisibility more treacherous than ever when he ends up in a snowy mountain town as he could easily freeze to death. Griffin also notes that it's <em>incredibly</em> difficult to move around without making any noise, so the invisibility only works best when he remains completely still, and doing that carries the risk of someone bumping into you. Also, the food he eats is not invisible, so it can be seen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">digesting in his stomach</a>. This is taken advantage of near the end, when Griffon is chasing someone with murderous intentions. The person, who had heard Griffon's entire story and thus heard of all his weaknesses, takes care to run over the most broken, sharp, littered areas of ground he can find, since he has shoes to protect his feet and Griffon has nothing.

Of course, if there's a sudden change in sensory input (e.g., opening a storage locker to find a rotting corpse when you've got heightened smell up), you're probably going to be reeling.

Each one has pretty obvious counters. Possible actions and counters: speaking loudly and clearly (a <strong>verbal</strong> component) which can be blocked by gagging or silencing the caster, moving and gesturing (a <strong>somatic</strong> component) blocked by binding the caster, and using an item either as a <strong>material</strong> component consumed in the spell or as a <strong>focus</strong> to channel the spell both blocked by taking the item(s) away. Also, most spells require a specific target; if the mage can't pinpoint something (usually due to lack of visibility), it can't be targeted.

<ul><li> Adam's Semblance allows him to absorb energy through his sword and store it up for a deadly attack when he's ready. This allows him to dish out a lot of damage without having to having to take a physical pounding first, which is how Yang's very similar Semblance works. This means his Semblance can be countered by separating him from his sword.
</li><li> Grimm have no Aura and therefore cannot protect their bodies from injury the same way humans can. This is the primary advantage humans have over them. If humans can master their Aura and combat skills, they become killing machines against the Grimm. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When Cinder loses her left arm, she receives a replacement Grimm arm. However, she learns while in battle with Raven, that her Aura cannot protect her Grimm arm and she will feel the pain of injury as if it's her own limb.

</li><li> Marrow's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParalyzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParalyzer">Semblance</a> lets him immobilize others, even crowds, but only those he's focussed on and pointing at. If he loses his focus, the targets are released. When he freezes an angry crowd after they're attacked, he turns his attention to Robyn and the injured Fiona. This releases the crowd, allowing Joanna to fire an arrow at him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He is defeated by Weiss when she and her summoned White Knight attack from different directions; forced to split his focus, he's defeated by Weiss while concentrating on the Knight.</span>
</li><li> Elm's Semblance allows her to anchor herself to the ground, making her an immovable object, an ability that is extremely useful given her great strength and power. She also uses it to anchor herself against the recoil from her weapon, which functions as a rocket-launcher when it's not being used as a war-hammer. However, if she does not have a stable, solid surface to anchor to, her Semblance becomes ineffective. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yang is able to defeat her by using the power of her own Semblance to smash the floor into rubble, thereby rendering Elm's Semblance useless.</span>
</li><li> Umber's Semblance requires her to maintain eye contact with her target, meaning that she cannot use it on multiple targets at the same time. Forcing her to change targets will release her previous victim. This also means she cannot use her Semblance on blind people, making them automatically immune to her power.

</li><li> Dr. Beefton is brought into existence whenever Sylvie uses his power on himself. Naturally, the minute Sylvie wakes up, the doctor is out.
</li><li> Percy's epithet lets her build a variety of buildings with different effects. But they're still buildings, and are only as strong as the surface of their foundation, which puts her at a disadvantage in Redwood Run, since the dirt is not suitable for construction at all.
</li><li> Bugsy needs to swallow the food in his mouth in order to use his epithet, which Giovanni exploits by heating up the soup he tries to eat.
</li><li> Arnold's coupons need to be scannable in order to be used, which renders them useless when they're wet or turned into another substance. Also, while having several coupons on hand is a good idea, he still needs to sort through them all in order to find the exact one he needs, which leaves him open to attack.
</li><li> Zora's epithet <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> can only affect a linear process. She can't use them on things that fall into a grey area of linearity or processes that are completed instantly, such as Ramsey breaking her gun.

Oh, and mittens. Since Sydney needs to hold the orbs to use them, she can only use a maximum of two at any given time.
</li><li> Sydney's shield is later shown to have the weakness of being <em>so</em> impenetrable that air cannot flow through it, thus rendering her lightheaded and eventually unconscious if she keeps it up for too long (though she does point out that it seems to have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers">Required Secondary Powers</a> necessary to keep her from being affected from the pressure changes that would normally result from changing the size but not allowing more air to enter or exit, or from flying at altitude).

</li><li> Heavenly Sword can create energy "blades" around a weapon, usually a sword, but the weapon itself is still only as strong as the material it's made of, and if she doesn't have any weapon, she's just a normal woman.
</li><li> Achilles is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh Invulnerable</a> to a ridiculous degree, and thus is slightly stronger than a normal person, but due to his lack of other powers, not only does he suffer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage">Clothing Damage</a> a lot, he is unable to escape when trapped under a broken wall.
</li><li> Harem gets weaker with every copy she creates, and has a max weight limit to how much she can port with her, keeping her from transporting teammates (save Varia, who can "ride along" with her if she touches her).
</li><li> Varia can't use her gestalt power (which gives her a different power with each person she comes into contact with) without touching someone (though Halo wonders if it's possible that she could activate her powers with blood samples and the like), so she can't fight solo, especially since her attacks are useless on the people she gets them from (which thankfully means that the person she touches is immune to any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowDoIShotWeb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowDoIShotWeb">How Do I Shot Web?</a> mishaps). A later comic also implies that she has to maintain contact or the power will fade quickly.
</li><li> Vehemence's power feeds on violence, so nominally he would be weakened if nobody in the area was fighting. However, he works around this by inciting a riot, then gets enough power from that to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionBomb">Emotion Bomb</a> others into fighting more, until he can start a feedback loop with his <em>own</em> violence. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveBoobsYouMustObey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveBoobsYouMustObey">distracting him with Dabbler's sex appeal works</a>, pinning him underwater works, and apparently Sydney using her shield to suffocate him would work.

</li><li> When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Frans Rayner</span> comes back from the dead as a cyborg, his augmentations draw energy from his organic body (because he lacks an external power source), so firing his laser eye <em>once</em> leaves him too exhausted to do anything.

</li><li> "Simulcast" allows the user to create a mirror image of any physical objects he sees. This has two weaknesses: it doesn't work on attacks that the user doesn't see coming, and doesn't work with non-physical attacks like fire or energy.

<ul><li> Because benders channel their powers through martial arts, binding or paralyzing their limbs is an effective means of defeating or imprisoning them, though sufficiently skilled benders are able to get beyond this. For example, when King Bumi is locked into a coffin with only his face poking out, he is able to Earthbend fairly effectively using only his <em>chin</em>. Then again, he is <em>110 years old</em> (really, not the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle">Human Popsicle</a> 110-year-old that Aang technically is), so he's had a <em>lot</em> of time to master Earthbending with any part of his body.
</li><li> Both Earth- and Waterbenders have a wide variety of moves to choose from, but require quantities of the element to bend, giving them a disadvantage in ocean and desert environments respectively.
</li><li> Fire- and Airbenders always have their element at hand, but also have their own weaknesses. Fire requires stable breath control to use (making it easier to lose control or tire from using the element), is less effective in cold or at night, and lacks many defensive moves. Likewise, Air Bending has fewer offensive moves, and the culture surrounding it is quite pacifistic, making it especially difficult to finish a fight.
</li><li> Mainstream firebending has the problem that it is powered by the user's emotions to a much greater degree than the others. The result is that a change in the powering emotion can have massive effects; for instance Zuko was nearly powerless when he gained control of his anger issues. The original version, which very few people know about, is based on balance and doesn't have this problem.

Traveling on a metal boat is bearable, but she throws up within minutes of boarding a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> submarine.</span> And in a world without Braille, she's illiterate. But if she's on an earthen surface, she can see all around her, even behind things. And none of this stops her from intercepting catapult weapons fired from another ship on water, though that may just be her inherent skill.
<ul><li> One episode had her and Katara get locked up in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TailorMadePrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TailorMadePrison">a cell made of wood, something neither of them could bend</a>. They got out by working up enough of a sweat for Katara to weaponize.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> states that she can detect earth even when it isn't in contact with the ground (catapult weapons used by firebenders are nothing more than boulders covered with flaming oil), which also explains how she can even counter Earthbender attacks coming at her from the air.
</li></ul></li><li> With Metalbending having become a full-fledged bending discipline by the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>, the sequel series also shows the bending style's weaknesses: they are very susceptible to electric attacks due to using reels of metallic cord to attack with as well as the metal-covered suits they wear. Their metal suits also make them vulnerable to powerful magnets built into special <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">mecha-tanks</a> used against them. Metalbending works by bending the earthy impurities in most metals. As such, most villains in <em>Korra</em> got around this with weapons and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TailorMadePrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TailorMadePrison">Tailor Made Prisons</a> made of more purified elements (specifically platinum).
</li><li> Also in <em>Korra</em> there is Ming-Hua, a waterbender without arms who bends water into tentacle-like appendages to compensate. While her control makes her a very hard opponent for any waterbender, a firebender can evaporate her arms if she doesn't have a water source to replace them from and keeping the water attached to her body makes her extremely vulnerable to electrocution by a firebender who can bend lightning. And of course, without her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatTentacles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatTentacles">Combat Tentacles</a>, she doesn't have any arms, making her even less capable of defending herself without her bending.
</li><li> The combustion benders in both series use a special third-eye tattoo to channel their explosions. Attacking this point in any way can disrupt their powers.
</li><li> Chi-blocking in both series also goes both ways of this trope. Against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRangeFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRangeFighter">benders,</a> it exploits how they usually need space and momentum to quickly and efficiently take them down. However, they, specifically the Equalists, are consistently on the <em>receiving</em> end of this trope in either going against a bending style that's both rare and evasion-focused (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway">airbending</a>) or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">non-bender</a> that naturally fight up close to begin with (ex. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Asami</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar">Sato</a>).

<ul><li> Ben himself; in order to use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinket">Omnitrix</a>, he has to dial between aliens and push the plunger down. As such, if he can't do that, then he can't transform.
</li><li> Heatblast; aside from the usual weaknesses of fire-based powers (water, fire extinguishers, etc.), the fact he's <em>made</em> of fire means that he can't touch certain materials without burning them.
</li><li> While Diamondhead's crystalline body is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh Invulnerable</a> to most damage, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> confirms that the main exception is sonic attacks (shown in one episode where one such attack causes him to crack).
</li><li> Ripjaws, coming from a piscine species, can't stay out of the water for too long, lest he risk suffocation.
</li><li> Upgrade; magnetic forces disrupt his abilities since he's effectively a living pile of liquid metal.
</li><li> Shocksquatch's primary method of generating electricity involves building up a static charge in his fur and releasing it, which he can't do if he's covered in an insulating material.
</li><li> One of Whampire's powers is the ability to fire small bat-shaped projectiles that can control whoever they come in contact with. But in order to work, they need to make contact with the target's actual skin, as Ben finds out when he tried to use them on Exo-Skull, who is covered in armor.
</li><li> In one episode, during a fight with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero">Captain Nemesis</a>, the not-so-good captain fights in a high-tech suit of armor that puts out a lot of heat.

The rapid cooling embrittles the armor, causing it to crumble.

However, Seth was unable to summon him while on a boat, even one that had Dakocite stone as its cargo, because the summoning would likely sink the boat (Seth later weaponised this when he <em>wanted</em> to sink the boat). Also, in an earlier episode, when getting into a testosterone-fueled duel with Seth, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero">Adam</a> deliberately chooses a location where the ground is "Sigil-hardened" (ie: magically reinforced), forcing Kragus to be formed from nearby trees, instead - which isn't a good thing for Seth and Kragus, since Adam's Guardian is called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">Firefox</a> for a reason.

<ul><li> The show made a point of mentioning in one episode that you had to see and hear a magical spell being performed on you to be affected by it. When Demona casts her spell to turn every human in New York into statues at night (broadcast via TV), the only ones left unaffected are the blind (like Hudson's friend Robbins) and those who didn't see the broadcast (like Xanatos and one random woman who everyone thought was crazy the following morning after she said she didn't watch television).
</li><li> The Gargoyles themselves don't fly, they glide. This imposes some reasonable limitations on their ability to use their wings.
</li><li> The in-universe explanation for a gargoyle's stone form is that it allows them to absorb solar energy to fuel their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a>. As such, when a gargoyle turns to stone indoors, they're far weaker the following evening.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingStatue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingStatue">Living Statues</a> in "Headhunters" are made of wax, and therefore, can melt from heat.

</li><li> The baby pterodactyl from the episode "Land Before Swine" has its eyes on the sides of its head like a horse, and as Soos points out, this means it can't see anything standing directly in front of it.
</li><li> In "Sock Opera", Bill Cipher possesses Dipper's body. But while Bill is all-powerful in the mindscape, being in Dipper's body makes him only as dangerous as a noodle-armed twelve-year-old. The fact that Dipper had gone several days without sleep and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenseFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenseFreak">Bill had been purposely injuring the body to experience pain</a> only compounds the problem, as Mabel is quick to point out when she and "Bipper" fight.
</li><li> In "Weirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls", the shield prevents Bill and the Henchmaniacs from damaging the shack. However, Shacktron's limbs are outside the shield, allowing a giant Bill Cipher to rip off the mech's leg and beat it into submission with it.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfTheWeek">Gigantitan</a> is an akumatized baby named August; much to Hawk Moth's frustration, August still has the mentality of a baby, so he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitOohShiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitOohShiny">easily distracted</a> and doesn't follow Hawk Moth's orders because he's a <em>baby</em> and can't understand them.
</li><li> Troublemaker can turn intangible by clicking her pen. However, this means that her control over her power is limited to an on/off switch- so if she wants to interact with things, she has to make herself vulnerable to do so, and if she needs to turn intangible to dodge an attack, she'll have to drop anything she's holding, which prevents her from keeping the Ladybug earring she stole.
</li><li> Gorizilla has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNoseKnows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNoseKnows">a super sense of smell</a>, so getting deodorant in his nose debilitates him. He's also unable to get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinket">Miraculous</a> he was after because his hands were just too big, since the Miraculous are pieces of jewelry.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">Chameleon</a> can take the shape of anything she kisses. To beat her, Ladybug tricks her into kissing a clam, rendering her defenseless and unable to transform back because clams don't have lips and can't move on their own.
</li><li> Oni-chan can switch places with people who answer her phone messages. The catch is that the ability is passive; she can't make people answer their phones, or control who answers the messages and when or where they do so. Cat Noir prevents her from taking Ladybug's Miraculous by having a fireman answer the phone in a different location, teleporting her away, and Ladybug eventually defeats her by answering while being tied up, which puts Oni-chan into her bonds.
</li><li> In general, akumatized people become villainous because the transformation makes them obsessed over whatever slight they experienced. Problem is, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanityHasAdvantages" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanityHasAdvantages">Sanity Has Advantages</a>- Akumatized are easy to bait with the object of their obsession, and Hawk Moth has been attacked by one because he was too obsessed with his goal to take orders.

<ul><li> Unicorns are stated to have a small suite of spells related to their special talent that they can use well (outside of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter">telekinesis</a>). This means that if faced with a situation where those spells aren't any use, they aren't much help. In addition, even if a unicorn has an appropriate spell, they need to be able to concentrate to use it. Panic, sensory overload, being manhandled, etc. will render them unable to use spells. It has also been shown that even lightly hitting a unicorns horn will disrupt any spellcasting they are attempting.
