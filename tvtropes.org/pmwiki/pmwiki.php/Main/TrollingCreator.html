<ul><li> Akira Hiramoto of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PrisonSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PrisonSchool">Prison School</a></em> with respect to that manga's ending. The final serialized chapter was released on December 2017 with an abrupt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a>, with the author promising a "much improved" epilogue on the release of the final volume (April 2018). Fans eagerly waited four months only to find that this epilogue was nothing more than a few panels of the boys dreaming about the Wet T-Shirts Contest with neither background explanation nor conclusion. In retrospect, this may also double as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchTheFranchiseAndRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchTheFranchiseAndRun">Torch the Franchise and Run</a> for the author.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenAkamatsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenAkamatsu">Ken Akamatsu</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>. Just look at how he ended the manga after <em>years</em> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> galore. Followed by messages on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter">Twitter</a> saying a sequel is <em>probably</em> coming...<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0bvat');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0bvat" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0bvat');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Well, he <em>did</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UQHolder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UQHolder">deliver on the promise</a>, he just didn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthSequel">say that it was</a>...</span>
<ul><li> Not to mention the whole "Zazie's identity" thing he pulled. For most of the series, the character of Zazie was a total mystery, with no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">development</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">Backstory</a> whatsoever, although <em>something</em> was clearly up with her. Akamatsu claimed he'd reveal the secrets around her in the final arc. Then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she showed up in the Magical World out of nowhere as a demon lord on the side of the bad guys. Fans panicked, went nuts, and generally shat brix... oh wait, no, a few chapters later it's revealed that's actually her identical twin sister.</span> Well played, Akamatsu, well played.
</li><li> Also, he resolved the plot with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Lifemaker possessing Nagi.</span> (Hint: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot">He didn't.</a> Not in any satisfying way at least). Or the whereabouts of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Negi's mother Arika</span>. (That last one was actually him trolling the publishers. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchTheFranchiseAndRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchTheFranchiseAndRun">Torch the Franchise and Run</a> for details.)
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TiteKubo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TiteKubo">Tite Kubo</a>'s tendency for "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands">Plotkai</a>" as fans call it in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> has given him the title of trolling god via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a>. For some, Kubo may be on his way to graduating from Trolling Creator to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a>, considering how many people complain or bitch about <em>Bleach</em> and yet they <strong>keep reading it no matter what</strong>. He also admitted in interviews that the reason he gave Hisagi a "69" tattoo <em>on his face</em> is because he wanted a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendre">Double Entendre</a> that parents would too embarrassed to explain to their kids. He's also said that he responds to online character-bashing by increasing the page time for the characters being bashed.
</li><li> On the other side of the Pacific, Hideaki Sorachi of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em> fame is seen as an even greater troll than Kubo. There are even terms stating that "Gorilla is playing with the crotch of the readers again".
<ul><li> Ch 238 showed a bunch of dialogue that seems to imply Tae and Gin became a couple - but then at the last page it showed it was someone else who sounds like them.
</li><li> The Renho arc helped introduce Sorachi's trolling style to anime viewers. It started off with a tear-jerking scene of Elizabeth leaving his friends behind, with a longer credit song to mark it as a saga, making it greatly resemble the Four Devas arc.<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">.. Until the post credit scene, which shows that the Elizabeth that left is only a temp. Cue fans asking the Gorilla to return their tears.</span>
</li><li> The Anime does it too. For example, they advertised a movie trailer of the fan favorite Benizakura arc... only to afterwards state that no one would be stupid enough to give them a movie.
<ul><li> And then a <em>real</em> movie of the Benizakura arc came out!
</li><li> Followed by a trailer for the <em>second</em> movie that focused on Gintoki's past.
</li></ul></li><li> For months, the Gorilla kept saying the manga would be ending in <em>Jump</em> at chapter 698. He kept his word... only for the very last page to have Gintoki say it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">jumping</a> ship to <em>Jump Giga</em>, with a note on how it was impossible to end it at that point. Also at the end of episode 367, Gintoki explains how <em>Gintama</em> ending will end up as a scam. Well played, Sorachi. Well played.
</li><li> It got even better: even with the 3 bonus chapters it got in <em>Jump Giga</em>, it <em>still</em> won't stay dead: the last leg of its run would be played out in the manga's own app, but who knows how long that would take.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KyotoAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KyotoAnimation">Kyoto Animation</a> got a reputation for trolling fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em> in relation to season 2 of the series&#151;first they denied they were doing it, then they claimed they were just rerunning the first season&#151;but then suddenly, new episodes in the middle of the reruns! And then they did <em>Endless Eight</em>&mdash;eight consecutive episodes with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">the exact same plot</a>, adapted from a short story that only covered the final loop. And they were animated from scratch too, so it wasn't just laziness or budget issues.
<ul><li> This looped into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">self-trolling</a> when they damaged their own DVD sales and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseKiller">caused the lack of a third season.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideakiAnno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideakiAnno">Hideaki Anno</a>, though this may have been due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">Creator Breakdown</a>. In fact, the <em>entirety</em> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioGainax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioGainax">Studio Gainax</a> may count as this.
</li><li> Speaking of Anno...While it's unknown who came up with this, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-07-13/evangelion/3.0-you-can-not-redo-film-promo-streamed">this trailer<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for the third <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion">Rebuild of Evangelion</a></em> movie was definitely created to troll the viewers. It begins with clips from the first two movies, and when it finally shows images from the third movie it shows <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the internal workings of a CGI piano.</span> Yes, this series is known for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a>, but <em>come on</em>. In addition, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the piano</span> appears in official posters and theatre preview trailers.
</li><li> Speaking also of Gainax, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding">Gainax Ending</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel Hook</a> made the fanbase beg for more <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PantyAndStockingWithGarterbelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PantyAndStockingWithGarterbelt">Panty &amp; Stocking with Garterbelt</a></em>, only for no second season to occur, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeasingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeasingCreator">despite many teases</a>. Though, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBandMinusTheFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBandMinusTheFace">the staff of the show and leaving to make</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioTrigger">their own studio</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcclaimedFlop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcclaimedFlop">and that the show didn't sell well</a> may have played a part in this.
</li><li> Seo Kouji, author of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimiNoIruMachi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimiNoIruMachi">Kimi no Iru Machi</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Suzuka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Suzuka">Suzuka</a></em>, is quickly gaining this reputation.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GenUrobuchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GenUrobuchi">Gen Urobuchi</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">healing-type</a> writer of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em>. He even trolled the <em>other people working on the anime.</em> For example, he withheld the knowledge of the show's grim-dark setting from character designer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UmeAoki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UmeAoki">Ume Aoki</a> and neglected to inform <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmiriKatou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmiriKatou">Emiri Katou</a>, the voice actress for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorMascot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorMascot">Kyubey</a>, of the character's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil">true nature</a></span>. The reactions of both were, in other words, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">priceless</a>. Not to mention that he refused to bring <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sayaka</span> back even when the director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiyukiShinbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiyukiShinbo">Akiyuki Shinbo</a> requested that he do it.
<ul><li> And that was before the whole <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Akuma Homura</a></span> situation tore apart the Madoka fandom.

</li><li> He trolled the shipping fandom again (specifically the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sasuke/Karin shippers who suggested that Sarada was in reality Karin's daughter</span>) in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason">Post-Script Season</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NarutoGaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NarutoGaiden">Naruto Gaiden</a></em>, with the revelation that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sarada could actually be Sasuke and Karin's daughter and not Sakura's, he even added a scene of a DNA test to confirm this</span> causing the fandom to explode... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but then in the end it was revealed that Sakura was indeed Sarada's biological mother all along</span>.

Hinata is saved shortly before Naruto wins, then Kishimoto springs the trap: Pain gives his life to resurrect everyone he killed in the battle, making nearly all that drama pointless. Very few moments, mostly in story structure, hinted at what he was about to pull off.

<ul><li> When a preview for issue 12 showed fan-favorite characters Rewind and Swerve getting injured, he pulled a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromACertainPointOfView" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromACertainPointOfView">From a Certain Point of View</a>" on the fandom by claiming that issue 13 takes place entirely in flashback (it does, but said flashback is set after issue 12), just to trick the fandom into thinking the two would die.
</li><li> Before issue 13 was out, he deliberately used an out-of-context quote to make everyone think that a member of the Lost Light crew would betray or abandon the crew. No such thing happens.
</li><li> After the particularly intense issue 20 (which featured two major character deaths, several major reveals, and ended on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestHour">Darkest Hour</a> cliffhanger), his first post was this:

While some of his conceptions were interesting and clever, the series became notorious for deliberately pissing off what he considered comic fandom's "adult twelve-year-olds" or "juvenilists". He led off by killing all of the Shadow's original friends &mdash; in gruesome detail. He made the Shadow a sexual sociopath who defeated enemies with high-tech weaponry instead of intelligent deceptions. Today, these things are routine in comics, film and TV, but at the time even mature readers were shocked and angry. Chaykin stated in interviews that he didn't care about the Shadow or his traditional fans ("fuck'em") but was hired to do a job and did it.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianMichaelBendis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianMichaelBendis">Brian Michael Bendis</a> has become infamous for his use of Twitter and other social media outlets to screw with fans, often by posting out-of-context panels and rough artwork while noting how much it will upset the fanbase. That his remarks have veered into outright insulting elements of the fanbase has become part of what makes him so divisive.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batman">Batman</a> writer Tom King posted a half-serious Batfamily combat rankings list that enraged fans to no extent, prompting other writers to get in on the fun as well. Some of the controversial picks included ranking both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batgirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batgirl">Cassandra Cain</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Nightwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Nightwing">Dick Grayson</a> over Batman himself, and putting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Robin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Robin">Jason Todd and Tim Drake</a> below some notable female characters. To add insult to injury, he also jokingly ranked Jason below Ace the Bathound in terms of intelligence.

The title ended with July 2019's #193, to the shock of the fanbase, especially since he had covers for #194 and 195. For bonus points, the fake covers rather unsubtly teased the death of a major character.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonathanHickman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonathanHickman">Jonathan Hickman</a> was <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cbr.com/jonathan-hickman-house-of-x-powers-of-x-interview/">interviewed about<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> his then-upcoming <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JonathanHickmansXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JonathanHickmansXMen">run</a> (specifically <em>House of X</em> and <em>Powers of X</em>), when asked about the characters of Rasputin and Cardinal (specifically, "Are we interpreting things correctly by assuming those are familiar X-Men who have undergone some radical changes, or are they all-new characters?"), he answered, "I feel like you're using the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalWe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalWe">royal 'we'</a> there, and I'm not sure how down I am with your aristocratic bent.

Finally, when asked point-blank about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci">Krakoa</a> and its association with the X-Men, he admits, "Okay, so this is the third question in a row that I'm ducking because I'm just not going to spoil the story for everyone who's looking forward to reading it." Then he goes off on a tangent about how he used to talk about his stories until he realized how it might spoil people's personal interpretations of them, before finally adding, "Anyway, that's how you duck a question."

This said, the ending of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip">the rather long awaited</a> <em>Part 4/4</em> pushed her straight into troll territory. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note35dpe');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note35dpe" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note35dpe');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> does confirm that the main reason to do this way was practical; the conclusion would have been too long otherwise.</span>

The authors promptly released a segment on how Quint rescued them, and then it was mentioned in story that she was in the process of adopting them, alleviating those concerns. And then <em>Power Games</em> revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Subaru and Ginga were kidnapped while Quint was away.</span>

Fimfic users complained about the length and asked to split the story into smaller chapters. The result is that it was split into three chapter... by word count, so each chapter had exactly the same number of words, even though it resulted in chapter breaks happening in the middle of sentences.
</li><li> Nimbus Llewelyn, best known for being the creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildOfTheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildOfTheStorm">Child of the Storm</a>,</em> is a master of this. He has enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsArmory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsArmory">Chekovs Guns to rival JK Rowling,</a> but has explicitly stated that the difference between a hint and a red herring largely depends on his mood. He also teased Harry's Animagus form being revealed, and indeed put in a scene where Harry gains his Animagus form... and turns into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Captain Jack Harkness.</a> Readers were then informed that yes, it was a joke, and no, they shouldn't be surprised.

</li><li> In addition, another author's note mentioned that he considered calling Chapter 70 (in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Luna Lovegood and Arthur Weasley</span> get killed off) '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Yes, I Really Am A Bastard</a>.'
</li><li> As the author is a big fan of Spider-Man, readers were wondering when Peter Parker would get bitten, gain his powers, and join the story. In Chapter 29 of the sequel, <em>Ghosts of the Past,</em> Peter Parker does indeed get bit...by a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> vampire</span>.
</li><li> In Chapter 41 of <em>Ghosts</em>, Nimbus justified his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail">changing the nature of the First Task</a> by noting that "Harry would quite literally walk over any normal dragon with ease."

Apart from shots that weren't even in the film (such as Hulk fighting alongside the Avengers and the Wakandan Army), and fake scenes being shot to protect the secrecy of the real plot of the film, almost every trailer baited the audiences into thinking that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Avengers and Guardians were going to resolve the threat of Thanos' quest for the Infinity Stones by the end of the film, despite the apparent increased stakes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins">And we all know</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory">how that turned out.</a></span>

Some people claim it's because he's actually a decent director and just loves pissing off video game fans. The man himself says as much.
</li><li> One of the trailers for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIntoDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIntoDarkness">Star Trek Into Darkness</a></em> had a URL linking to a new poster for the film hidden in one of the frames.

<ul><li> Some fans were no doubt rolling their eyes when Abrams seems to setup a monster chase scene early in the film. The creature is instantly stunned and never seen again. Adding to the humor, it turned out that the monster was actually Kirk's <em>ride</em>, intended to help him escape from the horde of angry tribals pursuing him.

<div class="indent">Due to readers' frustration with the wait between books, Jim Butcher and his editor at Penguin Random House are taking inspiration from one of their favorite film trilogies and declaring a temporary hiatus on publication of the Dresden Files novels. <br>"I think Peter Jackson had the right idea with the Lord of the Rings movies," Butcher explained. "The trilogy took eight years to make. You can't expect an audience to wait that long between installments. It made more sense to film all three movies simultaneously, then release them back to back. That's what I'd like to do." <br>[...] <br>Jim will be writing case books 16 through 20ish all at once, then releasing them six months apart. Then, taking inspiration from Jackson's treatment of The Hobbit, Butcher will split the final Apocalyptic Trilogy into fifteen books, also written simultaneously and released on the same schedule. <br>Look for "Peace Talks" on April 1st, 2027.

<h3><strong>By Creator:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> Steven Moffat, head writer of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock">Sherlock</a></em>, has become known as a master troll within many online communities.
<ul><li> And to his actors. Notably, he kept <em>everybody</em> (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidTennant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidTennant">David Tennant</a>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop">Locked Out of the Loop</a> on the topic of River Song - except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexKingston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexKingston">Alex Kingston</a> herself. The Doctor's confusion when he meets her (and subsequently) is absolutely genuine: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattSmith">Matt Smith</a> was in fact the last person of the main crew to learn her identity. And in series 6, just as the audience is finally given enough hints to figure out who River is, Moffat throws in a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a> just to screw with everyone.
</li><li> And again with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herrings</a> involving Amy, the Doctor and Rory. Especially regarding <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who fathered Amy's baby throughout her is-it-real-or-isn't-it pregnancy and even after the birth of her daughter. This culminated in a long speech by Amy to said baby daughter about her father which seems to be describing the Doctor to a T, but is actually about Rory (incidentally highlighting the many similarities between the two)</span>.
</li><li> When River Song became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter">Base-Breaking Character</a>, especially as a love interest to the Doctor, Moffat announced that an upcoming episode would be titled "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS32E4TheDoctorsWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS32E4TheDoctorsWife">The Doctor's Wife</a>". River didn't even appear in the episode; the titular character was in fact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanionCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanionCube">the TARDIS</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then the Doctor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS32E13TheWeddingOfRiverSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS32E13TheWeddingOfRiverSong">actually does marry River by the end of the season</a>.</span>
<ul><li> Several years later, Moffat brought River back for a romantic storyline, "The Husbands of River Song" that aired three weeks after an epically romantic storyline involving the Doctor and companion Clara Oswald reached a bittersweet conclusion. Fans on both sides (River and Clara) were not happy at being trolled like this.
</li><li> Basically, Moffat seems to dislike the idea that sympathetic characters can have only One True Love Forever, and loves trolling monoshippers.
</li></ul></li><li> With how the Series 1 Cliffhanger was resolved in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SherlockS02E01AScandalInBelgravia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SherlockS02E01AScandalInBelgravia">A Scandal in Belgravia</a>", he and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkGatiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkGatiss">Mark Gatiss</a> are a Trolling Creator duo.
<ul><li> Another related to <em>Sherlock,</em> the BBC approved series 2 and 3 at the same time. Moffat, however, was very vague as to whether there would be a series 3 <em>at all.</em> After the horrifically gut-wrenching series 2 finale, the fans were whipped up into a "please let there be Series 3, <em>it can't end like this!!</em>" frenzy, when Moffat rather nonchalantly mentioned there had always been a series 3, and they'd planned for that since the beginning of series 2. His fans came dangerously close to a full-fledged mutiny after that.
</li><li> Three Words. That's literally all it takes for him to make the Sherlock fanbase flip the heck out. And I quote:
<div class="indent">"[the three words] may be misleading, are not titles, are only teases or possibly clues, but might be deliberately designed to get you into a lather."
</div></li><li> For series two, they were "Adler. Hound. Reichenbach." For series three, they are "Rat. Wedding. Bow."
</li><li> In some parts of the Internet, <em>"Moffat!!"</em> serves quite well as a <em>curse word</em>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Ryan Murphy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meme">memetically</a> so. Especially with regards to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em>. Everything he says is either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyingCreator">a lie</a>, designed to piss fans off, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs">a lie designed to piss fans off</a>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisColfer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisColfer">Chris Colfer</a> appears to be Murphy's apprentice in the art. He is a lying little tease who is not to be trusted when it comes to show information.

It gave rise to the alternate meaning of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed">Jossed</a>".
<div class="indent"><em> "People love a happy ending. So every episode, I will explain once again that I don't like people.

The fans were promised that each week, the creators would reveal who <em>wasn't</em> dead, and sure enough, each episode ended with a flash forward to the day of the fire showing at least one character whose status was unknown to be alive and well. Except one week's scene <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">failed to show any of the characters who had <em>previously</em> been shown to be alive, and furthermore, was set entirely indoors in a windowless room</span>.

</li><li> The trailers for Season 5 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lucifer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lucifer">Lucifer</a></em> indicated the whole season would be about Lucifer's twin brother Michael posing as him and completely fooling all the other heroes while Lucifer himself was still stuck running Hell, after the show's fans had <em>long</em> gotten sick of the human characters being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop">Locked Out of the Loop</a> and made to look increasingly idiotic for not noticing the clues in front of their faces.

<ul><li> This series has one of the most classic and well-known examples of this trope. After its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding">Gainax Ending</a> "<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/ThePrisoner1967E17FallOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/ThePrisoner1967E17FallOut">Fall Out</a>" aired, series creator Patrick McGoohan had people routinely coming <em>to his doorstep</em> demanding to know what it was all about. His comment:
<div class="indent">"I wanted to have controversy, arguments, fights, discussions, people in anger waving fists in my face saying, <em>how dare you?</em>"
</div></li><li> McGoohan had almost complete creative control, a budget 1.4 times as large as that of most other series, and <em>no idea</em> where the show was going from episode to episode. After what was broadcast as episode 11, the script editor, George Markstein, quit the series and was not replaced. Scripts and story ideas from that point on came from random people and places: a Western-themed episode was suggested by a video editor, and the infamous episode "The Girl Who Was Death" was an unused script from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DangerMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DangerMan">Danger Man</a></em> (featuring characters, props and locations from said series).
</li><li> The series is also believed by many to be a sequel of sorts to McGoohan's previous series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DangerMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DangerMan">Danger Man</a></em>, with "Number Six" actually being <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DangerMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DangerMan">Danger Man</a></em>'s John Drake. There is at least one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossOver">shared character</a> (or possibly just a character with the same name and actor), Number Six's "civilian" clothes are the distinctive outfit usually worn by Drake, and a publicity photo of McGoohan as Drake is X'ed out during the opening credits. Official <em>Prisoner</em> novels flat out name the Prisoner as Drake. For many years, McGoohan publicly maintained that the Prisoner was <em>not</em> Drake, but it is suspected that he was just being contrary.

In fact, the announcement was simply being held back until August 8th, the birthday of all the show's protagonists, with their actors releasing a video singing Happy Birthday and casually revealing the renewal at the end.
</li><li> An interesting example happened with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheShield">The Shield</a></em> around Season 5's finale. Some spoilers leaked that said Ronnie would die and Lem would leave and go to Mexico. These spoilers mentioned a lot of things that came through in the episode, but were totally wrong about the ending. That's because the creators themselves put those spoilers out.

As the episodes are taped in advance, he decided to have fun with this the day the episode aired &#151; presumably sitting at his home in Maryland, he proceeded to tweet "Vanna looks hot tonight" at the approximate time that the show's closing segment would've aired in each time zone before deleting it.

<ul><li> Faith No More have also picked up on the trolling of other artists. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.faithnomoreblog.com/2010/05/faith-no-more-from-archives.html">At one famous 1995 show<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, noise rock band Steel Pole Bath Tub played an opening set for Faith No More consisting of nothing but "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath">Paranoid</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CheapTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CheapTrick">Surrender</a>" over and over again, making the audience incredibly angry as a result.

</li><li> After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Liturgy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Liturgy">Liturgy</a> released <em>The Ark Work</em>, multiple reviewers accused the band of trolling their audience (and metal fans in general). This has been a popular interpretation of the band since Hunter Hunt-Hendrix released his "transcendental black metal" manifesto, in fact, but <em>The Ark Work</em> seems to have taken it to a new level.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SergeGainsbourg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SergeGainsbourg">Serge Gainsbourg</a> was said to have been a master at pushing the buttons of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> with his sex-riddled songs. Perhaps the most (in)famous example would probably be his song "Lemon Incest", which featured a shirtless Serge in bed with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">pantsless 12-year-old daughter Charlotte</a>.
</li><li> The Beatles' deliberately nonsensical "I am the Walrus" was inspired by a letter John Lennon received about how his former high school were analyzing the lyrics to Beatles' songs in the classroom. According to legend, after recording the song he quipped "Let's see the bastards figure that one out!"
<ul><li> The Beatles did this frequently. "Glass Onion" is Lennon trolling fans &mdash; particularly everyone who came up with elaborate conspiracy theories about <em>Sgt.

<ul><li> The amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SensoryAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SensoryAbuse">Sensory Abuse</a> to be found in some of his music and videos.
</li><li> His multiple unconfirmed pseudonyms.
</li><li> The time he titled a number of tracks after malware programs to troll anyone who tried to find them on filesharing services.
</li><li> His anecdote, whether true or not, about giving a band a random track he had lying around the studio as a commissioned remix.
</li><li> The time he persuaded a journalist that he lived in the windowless building in the centre of the Elephant and Castle roundabout in London (it's actually an electrical substation for the London Underground).
</li></ul></li><li> Just about everyone agrees that <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonMcLean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonMcLean">Don Mc Lean</a> wrote "American Pie" as a lament about what he saw as the music industry moving in the wrong direction after the deaths of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BuddyHolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BuddyHolly">Buddy Holly</a>, Big Bopper, and Ritchie Valens.

A second level of trolling involved the date they chose to release the "Rosanna" cover: While promoting <em>Pacific Daydream</em>, the band spoke of another album, <em>The Black Album</em>, that they had been working on beforehand, and gave it a tentative release date of May 25, 2018; the "Rosanna" cover was released on May 24 of that year.
<ul><li> Rivers Cuomo's twitter account can be confusing because of a habit he has of copy/pasting messages fans sent to him, sometimes changing pronouns so it still sounds like he's speaking for himself. Mostly it's purely humorous, but he's done things like quote a fan asking about when the next Weezer album would come out in a way that made it sound like <em>he</em> was teasing a release date.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomLehrer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomLehrer">Tom Lehrer</a> song "My Home Town" implies some horrible secret about a man named Parson Brown, with Lehrer pausing the song to note that the line is so shocking he can't say it on the recording, much to the audible disappointment of the crowd.

Right after this, he went on TV and cut a promo about how he wanted to be released from his contract. The whole angle, fully planned out by Sullivan and Pillman, had required them to work <em>everyone</em>, including the office, and it ended up working out <em>too</em> well, since, by the time Sullivan realized that the office wasn't in on the joke, Pillman had his release and had headed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW">ECW</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> Yoshinori Ono of Capcom (the man in charge of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em>) is slowly gaining this status. He did declare he wanted to see the gamers suffer with the constant inclusion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Seth</a> and he tops himself by fooling the audience of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterXTekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterXTekken">Street Fighter X Tekken</a></em> by bringing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Dan Hibiki</a> &mdash; who had already been killed off within the <em>SFxT</em> timeline because Ono and the dev team didn't want him in the game &mdash; to a wishlist poll, and when he saw Dan winning by a far margin, he declared the winner... by replacing Dan with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedCharacter">Sony's mascots Toro and Kuro</a>.
<ul><li> Ono has even admitted that trolling the fanbase is part of his job.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.eventhubs.com/news/2012/jan/27/ono-practices-how-troll-using-street-fighter-movie/">Let's face it, the man is clearly enjoying himself.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> In an inversion, Ono intended to use the original Mega Man for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterXTekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterXTekken">Street Fighter X Tekken</a></em>, but Keiji Inafune kiboshed that by saying it had already been done before and challenged him to try something unique. Off the top of his head, Ono suggested taking Mega Man from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan1">the original game</a>'s infamous American box art and making him obese and middle-aged as a joke at how 25 years had passed since Mega Man's creation. Inafune loved the idea, but Mega Man fans hated it and accused Capcom of rubbing the salt in following the cancellation of <em>Mega Man Universe</em> and <em>Mega Man Legends 3</em>.
</li><li> Ono and the whole <em>Street Fighter</em> team reached new heights during <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/dC-Hl33Xqpk">the reveal<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of the 5th brand new character of <em>Ultra <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV">Street Fighter IV</a></em>. As the hints said that this character was female and hasn't been in a fighting game before, people were actually expecting someone seriously brand new. Who did they reveal? Decapre, one of Bison's assassins based on Cammy, who looks like Cammy with a sinister mask, has a charged moveset variation of Cammy, and &mdash;<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">technically speaking</a>&mdash; <em>was</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha">Street Fighter Alpha</a> 3</em> prior. Rubbing the salt further, her intro video features M. Bison, drawn in his <em>Alpha 3</em> sprite, facing off against fan-favorites that people liked quite a bit, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha">Rainbow Mika</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterI">Retsu</a>... and brushing them away easily. Again, for the fans, the day they got trolled was the most outrageous thing in their life. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday">But for Ono and the SF Team... it was Monday.</a>
<ul><li> Unfortunately, given the non-reaction of the audience to <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/F2zQNdB_U0k">the trailer<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and Capcom already skating on thin ice in light of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan">later</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterXTekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterXTekken">events</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny">joke has pretty much fallen flat</a>. Though funnily enough, Mika <em>did</em> make it to the roster of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV">the next game.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> In a case of Ono trolling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">that could have been</a>, during the buildup to a new <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV">Street Fighter V</a></em> character, Ono had released a couple of screenshots of Brazil and Ryu getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">shocked by electricity</a>. Fans took it and immediately assumed it was Blanka (who is well known to be one of Ono's favorite <em>Street Fighter</em> characters), and Ono was going to keep the teasing going all the way to the Brazil Game Show, complete with dressing up as Blanka at the event to get people assuming things. It would all turn out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a> for an actual newcomer named Laura (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIII">Sean's</a> older sister) who was also from Brazil and had electricity powers. But then, well, Famitsu leaked pictures of Laura a couple weeks before the show, ruining the reveal altogether, and made worse by Sony releasing Laura's reveal trailer a couple days early too, so all potential trolling plans were flushed down the toilet.
<ul><li> However, when the Arcade Edition of the game was released, Blanka was one of the characters included.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SquareEnix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SquareEnix">Square Enix</a> when it comes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI">Absolute Virtue</a>. Every time the players <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LordBritishPostulate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LordBritishPostulate">find a way to beat him</a>, the dev team goes out of their way to squash the methods used to beat the monster. Square Enix seem to either <em>want</em> to make Absolute Virtue unbeatable or they enjoy watching players cry as Absolute Virtue's weaknesses gets changed every time people find a way to weaken him. This has since been subverted with expansions increasing the level cap to the point players can beat Absolute Virtue by sheer force, and they seem to be content with that.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7rkwt');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note7rkwt" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7rkwt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There <em>is</em> a specific way to beat Absolute Virtue (involving the use of two-hour abilities to mirror the boss's use of said two-hour abilities), and that was, according to the devs, the intended way to beat the boss. So it's not so much trolling (although there is quite a bit of that in the process), but rather removing exploits that allowed players to circumvent the intended method for winning. The fact that there's <em>zero</em> indication of the intended method, and that <em>no one</em> found out how to do it until Square Enix almost literally pointed it out, on the other hand...</span>
</li><li> With <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em> and its sequels, director Motomu Toriyama is seen this way by much of the fanbase. His statements in interviews paint him as either naively unaware of the fandom's opinions, or he knows and is purposefully invoking this trope. Such statements include that the sequel will answer the question of "is Lightning happy" (her presence turned out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity">Wolverine Publicity</a> and this question was never addressed), and he requested a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanservicePack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanservicePack">hotter and sexier</a> design for Lightning in the third game (which fans and critics reacted negatively to). Furthermore, in both games, fans have criticized the stories for not making sense, and he's an advocate for the interactive movie design model that fans hated in the first game. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a> "Toriyama'd" is now shorthand for this trope when it comes to <em>Final Fantasy</em>.
</li><li> Square Enix also shows infinite amounts of trolling regarding <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>, forever denying fans any remake of the game. The apex of this came in December 2014, during a gaming panel, the lights dimmed, the screens started showing letters and the announcement: "<em>Final Fantasy VII</em> is coming to the PS4." The whole room (and whoever was watching the live stream) burst into applause and cheers, only to fall silent a few seconds later, as it was revealed that it was just a port of the version available on PC, without any difference. Take a guess at the reaction of the fans on Twitter.
<ul><li> Less than a year later, Square Enix finally announced the remake at E3. And that it had already been in development for over eighteen months. That's an <em>epic</em> level of trolling right there.
</li><li> It turns out the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIIRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIIRemake">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a></em> is not just an HD remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> David Gaider, a BioWare employee and the chief writer of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em> series, is very fond of telling the story of how he came up with the idea <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to kill off Alistair in the end if he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceSidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceSidequest">romanced</a></span>. According to him, when he first told it to the other writers, the entire group shared an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh">Evil Laugh</a>, foreseeing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fangirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fangirl">fangirls</a>' reaction, and he still smiles fondly whenever a player is devastated by that event.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TakeshisChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TakeshisChallenge">Takeshi's Challenge</a></em> announces on its title screen that it was created by a man who hates video games.

</li><li> For April Fools Day 2012, Riot Games, makers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends">League of Legends</a></em>, hyped up to a new champion release, a manatee named Urf. On the day of his release, they released a story about how the day before, Urf had been murdered by Warwick, to whom they released a skin featuring Urf's carcass. However, rather than rage, the fandom just went with it and turned Urf into the unofficial mascot of League. Riot Games noticed, and eventually turned Urf into the official go-to for gags, such as <strong>U</strong>ltra <strong>R</strong>apid <strong>F</strong>ire mode which they insisted was "the future of League."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BlizzardEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BlizzardEntertainment">Blizzard Entertainment</a> had to put up with constant complaints about how "cartoony" and "colorful" <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII">Diablo III</a></em> is compared to its predecessors. As a pisstake to that section of the fanbase, they put <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/JeQzJC-vS40">this level<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> into the game. The developers of the game also took to wearing shirts to conventions featuring a colorful "Diablo III" logo complete with unicorns and rainbows.
<ul><li> Prior to that, testers for the <em>Cataclysm</em> expansion complained that their visit to the Maelstrom wasn't "epic" enough. Shortly after, Blizzard added <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/ehS9v1afvtA">Epicus Maximus.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> On a related note, Blizzard gave their two newest playable characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> trollbait dances: the male Pandaren has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LMFAO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LMFAO">Party Rock Shuffle</a>, and the female Pandaren has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/CaramelldansenVid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/CaramelldansenVid">Caramelldansen</a>.
<ul><li> These <em>are</em> the people who date their releases and patches as either "Soon," "Very Soon" or "Soonish," all of which they define as any time between now and <em>the end of time</em> with Very Soon being most likely to be closer to now and Soonish to be closer to said end of time.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em>, there is a starting item you can choose at the very beginning called "the Pendant". It has no obvious use, but many players assumed there had to be some significance behind it, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfConservationOfDetail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfConservationOfDetail">why would it be in the game otherwise?</a> It helps that <em>Dark Souls</em> is a game in which even the tiniest of details can be extremely important for understanding the story or the gameplay, making fans even more on the lookout for such things. The game's director, Hidetaka Miyazaki, would repeatedly hint that there was some great secret behind this item, but no matter how hard the fans looked, they couldn't find anything. After <em>years</em> of this, Miyazaki finally revealed what the Pendant does: absolutely nothing. It was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a> from the start. And just to rub it in, the key item for accessing the game's DLC is a Pendant... a <em>different</em> Pendant with no relation to the first.

Perhaps not surprising, considering the game itself trolls the player at every opportunity. Best exemplified when EG Floe premiered <em>I Wanna Be The Guy Gaiden</em> at EVO 2012; Kayin logged into the game session and proceeded to either help Floe with particularly hard sections or spawn random death traps and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew">Interface Screw</a>, whichever was funnier at the moment.

First, in <em>Double Spoiler</em>, he revealed that Momiji is more of a "lone wolf" type than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">Genki Girl</a> portrayed by fandom, and actually hates Aya, the person she was most shipped with. Then, in <em>Symposium of Post-Mysticism</em>, he did this to about half the cast of <em>Mountain of Faith</em> and <em>Subterranean Animism</em>: Nitori (the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">shy kappa</a>") is a shameless racist, possible murderer, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Insufferable Genius</a>, Kisume ("<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlInABox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlInABox">bucket loli</a>" who is also treated as really shy) is depicted as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">Creepy Child</a>... and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">Tenshi</a>, who spent much of her fighting game being a gigantic, destructive asshole (even by Touhou standards), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie">just needs a hug</a> after being bullied by the cast.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HidekiKamiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HidekiKamiya">Hideki Kamiya</a> uses Twitter to troll his English-speaking fans mercilessly. A reoccurring troll is when he's asked when we'll hear new info on his latest project, and he'll say "Next week... in game magazines/Nintendo Direct/other events" and news sites will report on it not realizing what Kamiya was doing. He will also drop some vague hints to a possible Switch port of or project related to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWonderful101" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWonderful101">The Wonderful 101</a></em>, but without directly confirming or denying anything.

The game frequently and harshly criticizes the player for fulfilling a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFantasy">Power Fantasy</a> by way of gruesome virtual war crimes. The devs have stated in interviews they wanted the players coming in with a certain set of expectations, kept the initial part of the game very familiar to players in order to foster that feeling, then set up their shots at the player. Even loading screens get in on the act, mocking the players with phrases such as "This is all your fault." "How many Americans have you killed today?" and "To kill for yourself is murder. To kill for your government is heroic. To kill for entertainment is harmless."
</li><li> Ed Boon, the creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a></em>, likes to troll his fans quite a bit &mdash; everything from misleading tweets about possible characters in <em>MK</em> games to teasing at a crossover with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em>.
</li><li> When announcing names for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory4">Rune Factory 4</a>,</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/XSEEDGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/XSEEDGames">XSEED Games</a> tweeted that they had changed Vishnal, one of the characters fans were more anxious about name changes in localization, to Vance. They tweeted again several minutes later announcing that they were only kidding, and his name had made the transition to the US intact.
</li><li> Tameem Antoniades became this when his team, Ninja Theory, rebooted the hit action game series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry">Devil May Cry</a></em>. The reboot made controversial changes to the series' hero, Dante, with Tameem commenting in the interviews he did not find the classic Dante appealing or cool. This angered fans a lot, of course. Even though he stated he did not care what fans thought, the reboot's Dante was modified during development to act like Dante and even look like him. Tameem's trolling status went even further when, in the reboot, Dante threw away a wig that made him look like the classic Dante.
</li><li> Every single <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArcSystemWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArcSystemWorks">Arc System Works</a> employee probably have a special wing waiting for them in hell solely because of the smug goddamn shit the company has pulled off. We can begin with pointing out that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAchievement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAchievement">That One Achievement</a> page was inspired by the way-past-the-hardest-difficulty-setting-the-game-can-offer difficulty of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueContinuumShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueContinuumShift">BlazBlue Continuum Shift</a></em>'s Score Attack Mode and the two achievements one got from clearing it with every single character. Which is still much better than Parace L'Sia, the Score Attack <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArcanaHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArcanaHeart">Arcana Heart</a> 3</em>, who might very well put all of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SNK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SNK">SNK</a> Playmore's entire boss library to shame. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Which is still</a> <em>much</em> better than the appropriately named "You Want Me To WHAT?!" achievement from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleFantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleFantasia">Battle Fantasia</a></em> which involves flawlessly blocking the final boss's 22 hit super move and then winning against him with <em>full health</em>.
<ul><li> It finally culminated with Zen United and Arc System Works Europe opening a site with a <em>Continuum Shift II</em> news countdown. In the source code of the site, there was a link which led to a page showing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> video with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">Hazama</a>-styled Trollface and a flashing "NICE TRY" caption set to Eduard Khil's "I Am Glad, 'Cause I'm Finally Returning Back Home", a.k.a. the Trolololo Song. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMakingThisUpDisclaimer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMakingThisUpDisclaimer">We shit</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/_XOdU40Zm08">you not.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Well, at least the bastards have openly admitted it.
</li><li> Furthermore, remember how fans always wanted Kokonoe to become playable? Well, they (especially Toshimichi Mori) kept refusing, which could be summed up with...

</div><ul><li> Then Mori does it again. In a tournament interview, he was asked about certain characters becoming playable, to which point he shut down the possibility of Celica being playable, mainly because she cannot fight. A while later, it is revealed that Celica is in fact playable, but the fighting is done by the artificial weapon Ex Machina: Minerva, which was issued to her by the aforementioned Kokonoe.
</li><li> With Kokonoe now playable, in spite of the problems above, it seemed that the fandom accusation to Mori was that he was doing the same ever since the earlier days, except this time to her father Jubei. Indeed, this badass cat had yet to see the light of playable even as Mori also <em>teased</em> on how he might be playable in the future through several omake segments. Jubei would eventually be announced as a DLC character for <em>Central Fiction</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasahiroSakurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasahiroSakurai">Masahiro Sakurai</a> has this reputation among fans of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em> series:
<ul><li> Due to being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveMultiplayerCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveMultiplayerCrossover">Massive Multiplayer Crossover</a>, Sakurai is frequently swamped by fans begging him to put this or that character in. To counter this, one of the first new characters revealed for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU">fourth installment</a> was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WiiFit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WiiFit">Wii Fit Trainer</a>, a character he happily noted <em>no one</em> had guessed or asked for.
</li><li> One of the Nintendo Directs promoting the fourth <em>Smash</em> game involved a <em>lot</em> of playful trolling:
<ul><li> After revealing that Samus' Zero Laser no longer causes her to change form, with transforming characters in general no longer being a mechanic, he followed it up by saying that Zero Suit Samus would not be returning as a result... right before showing her updated appearance, saying he was just kidding.
</li><li> The Direct had multiple "What character is this?" trophy segments, where a trophy is briefly displayed before its name and origin are given. One of these segments opens with the camera behind what appears to be a trophy of Palutena from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarusUprising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarusUprising">Kid Icarus: Uprising</a></em>, a reveal that would dash the character's chances at being a playable character. It cuts to the trophy's hideous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFace">Nightmare Face</a> with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareChord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareChord">Scare Chord</a> instead, revealing it as the boss Pseudo-Palutena. Palutena herself would be confirmed as a fighter at E3 that year.
</li></ul></li><li> One of Sakurai's pics of the day revealed Waluigi as an Assist Trophy &mdash; with his caption rubbing in the fact that "Assist Trophy" means "not playable". And then the above Direct added insult to injury, as he started its segment on Assist Trophies with a Waluigi plushie in the frame.
</li></ul><div class="indent">"Once again, Waluigi's Assist Trophy joins the collection! Which also means he&#146;s not a playable character. Just because you try hard, doesn't mean you'll make it into the battle."
</div><ul><li> The reveal of Takamaru seems to be in the same vein as Waluigi, building him up before dragging him back down again with the fact that he's not playable:
</li></ul><div class="indent">"I, Takamaru, have waited many years to appear in Super Smash Bros.! Link, Samus, Pit, and I debuted the same year! Multidirectional Pinwheel Knife Rook Attack! (FYI, I'm an Assist Trophy.)"
</div><ul><li> Sakurai had occasionally dropped hints about Ridley, but in a roundabout way that neither confirmed or denied that he was even going to be in <em>Smash 4</em> at all, to the frustration of fans who wanted him playable. Even after he all but directly confirmed his inclusion as an NPC boss on the Pyrosphere stage, he had a few jabs at the fans who still believed he was going to be playable.
</li></ul><div class="indent">"Out of the blue, here's a new stage &mdash; the Pyrosphere from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM">Metroid: Other M</a></em>! An enemy from Samus' past may appear at any second..."
</div><div class="indent">"Remember, no matter how big you may be, there is always someone bigger." <em>[accompanying a picture that has nothing to do with Ridley, but can be taken as a reference to the "Ridley's too big" meme.]</em>
</div><ul><li> It was announced that on July 14th, 2014 there would be a big character announcement. But hours before the big event, Sakurai <em>casually</em> (emphasis on 'casually') posted his usual Pic of the Day... that had <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rayman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rayman">Rayman</a></strong> on it. Considering that this was the first time a non-Nintendo universe character was introduced with a trophy, fans wouldn't be blamed for thinking that was the announcement... until later that day, when: both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">male and female Robin and Lucina</a> were announced as fighters. There's also a bit of a "take that" to the many, <em>many</em> people who wanted Chrom in the game, as he was shown lying unconscious on the ground in the trailer. He eventually says "I guess I'll get my chance another day", before promptly passing back out. Then the trailer cuts to some gameplay footage promising that no, he's getting his chance <em>now</em>... as Robin's Final Smash. His <em>actual</em> chance as a fighter came four years later in the fifth installment, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a></em>.
</li><li> The Smash Ballot was a way for fans to suggest characters for the series. However, it seems not even that was safe from trolling, as rather than pick a character whom fans wholly expected as the winner... Sakurai instead put in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta">Bayonetta</a>. He attempted to justify this by claiming she had been heavily voted for in Europe, but many fans were outright shocked.
</li><li> In the extended E3 2018 Nintendo Direct segment for <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>, after taking a minute to recap the game's premise (while showing footage from <em>for Wii U</em>) he then shows the message "THE END", only for the words "(just kidding)" to show up seconds later. During the time period between the March 8, 2018 teaser and the full E3 reveal that featured that joke, many people assumed that whatever <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> game was coming for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Nintendo Switch</a> would just be a port of the Wii U game with a smattering of extra content, as was the case with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart8">Mario Kart 8</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountryTropicalFreeze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountryTropicalFreeze">Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaptainToadTreasureTracker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaptainToadTreasureTracker">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</a></em>.
<ul><li> He also trolls Waluigi fans again, not only showing that he's still an Assist Trophy but using him to demonstrate that Assists can now be KOed.
</li><li> At the end of the reveal, Sakurai explains that their main focus was making sure every fighter from the previous games returned, "so [they]'re kind of hoping you aren't expecting too many new challengers" &mdash; immediately before unveiling a new challenger, revealing that Ridley had finally been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToPlayable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToPlayable">Promoted to Playable</a>. Plus <em>Ultimate</em> featured a total of eleven new characters (six brand-new and five <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovesetClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovesetClone">Moveset Clones</a>) and eleven more in DLC, so your mileage on how much of a cheeky statement that was depends on how many characters one expected.
</li></ul></li><li> King K. Rool's reveal trailer had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch">Bait-and-Switch</a> on both the Kongs and the audience by making it seem like K. Rool's appearance was just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby">King Dedede</a> was playing a prank... before the actual K. Rool shows up to knock the laughing penguin out of frame. Doubly an example of this, as Dedede is voiced by Sakurai himself. In the same Direct that revealed K. Rool, during the My Music segment, the announcement of the total number of music tracks included came with a tally counter that seems to slow down at around 481... only to regain speed and abruptly stop at the actual total: 800.
</li><li> And in the final Nintendo Direct before the game's release, Sakurai announced a free extra DLC character for early adopters... the <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/JGc6QZX68Zc">Piranha Plant<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> That's right, kids &mdash; forget the badass protagonists, musclebound fighters, or world-shattering beasts, the bonus for <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> is a <strong>potted plant.</strong>
</li><li> The Nintendo Direct at E3 2019 was a double whammy. Sakurai had told fans on Twitter to expect a (as in one) new character reveal, and the Direct started with the reveal of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest">Dragon Quest</a></em> Hero. People thought that was it, until halfway through the Direct, Sakurai posts another tweet, hinting at a second reveal. It ended up being a shot-for-shot remake of the K. Rool reveal, only now K. Rool is with the Kongs and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DuckHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DuckHunt">Duck Hunt</a> duo was the pranksters, posing as a different mammal/bird pair and the Kongs' old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Rare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Rare">Rareware</a> buddies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoKazooie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoKazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a>.

Starts out innocuous enough with Kyo, Ryo, Andy and Joe, but then it causes Geese Howard to fall to his death (again), mocks the everliving hell out of Nakoruru and Mamahaha, and leaves Iori <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughingMad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughingMad">laughing</a> yet again before it rests in a spotlight where Terry Bogard, the actual pick, snatches it up.

<ul><li> They even go so far as to make fun of their own bugs: when one update caused the location Deep Space K-7 to disappear, the next patch revealed that it had returned as it had been cloaked by a Klingon. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Go into the Admiral's office in DSK-7 and you'll find Starfleet Officers interrogating a Klingon on how he did it.</span>
</li><li> Another interesting incident happened during testing of Season 9 on the TRIBBLE Server: players had accidentally found out that you could shoot inside the newly redesigned Earth Spacedock (it's usually disabled) and people decided to have fun with doing so.

Except not really &mdash; the game in the link is merely one of Scott's earlier games (<em>There is No Pause Button!</em>) with Freddy's head pasted over the player's sprite and the "Trololol song" playing on loop through the whole game.
</li><li> As an example of him trolling fans, he was once asked if Mangle was a boy or a girl. His answer was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MathematiciansAnswer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MathematiciansAnswer">yes.</a>

Brightening the image, however, reveals an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> news story about the cancellation of Circus Baby's Pizza World's grand opening due to <em>gas</em> leaks.

Much like the "hacked" version of 3, it's actually his earlier game, <em>Sit and Survive</em>, with the protagonist wearing a Freddy mask.
</li><li> He striked once again as he claimed the next game in the series, "Freddy Fazbear's Pizza Simulator", was just a spin-off, similar to <em>FNAF World</em>. Everyone believed him, as <em>Sister Location</em> was considered by fans to be the final game. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It turned out it was essentially <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FNAF6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FNAF6">FNAF 6</a></em>, and he may have just pulled off one of the greatest trolls ever.</span>

</li><li> In Bioware's <em>Neverwinter Nights</em>, there existed a popular player-made server called Path of Ascension. In it, the server's creators added a script that would trigger whenever a magic-based character cast the spell Time Stop in the hub town. After an instance of Time Stop was cast, anyone attempting to rest in town would immediately die. High-level players would often invoke this script on purpose to troll other players on the server. Lowbie player responses would always be "WTF, why am I dead?" with more knowledgeable players retorting with "Lol, TS." On the upside, the script would reset resting back to normal after another Time Stop spell was cast.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uncharted4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uncharted4">Uncharted 4</a></em> (which came out in Spring 2016, roughly six months before <em>TLOU</em> was announced), there's a poster in Cassie's bedroom of a <em>TLOU</em> comic that features <a class="urllink" href="https://www.hypable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-Last-of-Us-2.jpg">a pregnant woman who looks like Ellie<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>. Speculation was that the woman was either Ellie or her mom, Anna. At that point in time, their public position was that they would make a sequel when they knew they had a good story, but that they were focused on wrapping up <em>Uncharted</em>. The thing is that they were actually in very early development on <em>TLOU</em> at the time. When the game went into full production in 2017, one of the writers said in an interview that she went home at night and talked to her husband about getting someone pregnant. There was also a picture posted to ND's social media from a motion capture session that had a baby doll in the background. When the first video made from the production (the initial 2016 announcement video was made when the game was in the writing phase) came out in October 2017, it featured <a class="urllink" href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-30-at-11.07.22-AM-720x559.png">a woman whose name they would not reveal<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>, but was four letters long, like "Anna". The woman was in the process of being hanged by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseCult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseCult">Apocalypse Cult</a>, and the cult leader put a knife up to her stomach and said she's "nested with sin". The internet went wild thinking it was Anna and that it was a flashback to when she was pregnant with Ellie, though she was not likely Anna, as she would have been pregnant with Ellie five years after the outbreak and the trailer takes place on a main drag place of an interstate in Seattle, WA, which is way too overgrown to be only five years later. The cult was also shown doing the same to men in a later trailer. In June 2018 at E3, they finally confirmed that someone was pregnant. When creative director Neil Druckmann was asked if the woman on the poster was Ellie's mom, he replied something to the effect of "she's someone's mom."
</li><li> In a 2017 interview with Denis Dyack regarding the game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodOmenLegacyOfKain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodOmenLegacyOfKain">Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain</a></em>, he was asked about the HMCS Bitter, a location that had been found by hackers who were looking through the game code regarding a conversion of the locations to 3D, and was considered to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> content. Dyack instead claimed that there was a legitimate way to reach the Bitter by flipping four invisible switches located around Nosgoth, but he refused to elaborate further on the matter, saying he would never talk about it beyond this confirmation that it existed.
</li><li> When players of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UntitledGooseGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UntitledGooseGame">Untitled Goose Game</a></em> started creating left-wing narratives in which the goose was not just being a jerk, but disrupting capitalism, the creators jokingly claimed that in their canon the game was set in a socialist utopia, and everyone the goose harrassed was a good Marxist.
</li><li> Toshihiro Kondo, president of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Falcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Falcom">Falcom</a> is gaining traction among the fanbase in general where half of his interviews for promoting the next game in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KisekiSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KisekiSeries">Kiseki Series</a></em> has him outright troll the fanbase or lie about one thing, only for the opposite to happen in-game. The most infamous example usually cited by fans is that the character named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsOfColdSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsOfColdSteel">George Nome</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">isn't part of the gnome faction before <em>Cold Steel III</em> came out.</span>
</li><li> Not the audience <em>per se</em>, but those independent coders who submitted their games to British Telecom's Telecomsoft division through their Firebird label when said games were included in a satirical compilation entitled <em>Don't Buy This</em>, whom Firebird released to mock the worst video game submissions they received. And it gets better: they outright <em>disowned all copyrights</em> to the game, encouraging people to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalPiracyIsOkay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalPiracyIsOkay">pirate them at will</a> to further humiliate the developers in question.
</li><li> During the development cycle of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarWarhammerII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWarWarhammerII">Total War: Warhammer II</a></em>, Creative Assembly spent almost the entire cycle proclaiming there would be only three main races released with the game and that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial">there was absolutely no chance there would be a fourth race of giant talking rats</a> because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatMen">Rat Men</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">obviously do not exist</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasy">Warhammer Fantasy</a></em> universe the game is based on<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9rf6p');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note9rf6p" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9rf6p');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">for those not in the know: They do, they're called "Skaven", they one of the signature factions of the setting, and there is a long-standing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> in the game that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> humanity <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveObliviousness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveObliviousness">refuse to acknowledge the Skaven exist</a></span>. This while sneaking rat motifs into practically all of the early teaser material. The cat-and-rat game between the fandom and creators basically boiled down to how close to release the game could get without an official Skaven reveal, with "Skaven confirmed!" becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> on the game's forum and subreddit. Eventually, the Skaven did get a proper reveal and addition into the game.

<ul><li> Andrew Hussie of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck">Homestuck</a></em> fame is a big fan of psyching out the readers, especially during Act 2. "Andrew is the best troll" has become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meme">meme</a> among the fandom. He prefers, however, to call it "doing jokes", which is an alternate name for this page, to emphasize that he isn't doing this out of malice, but just a sense of fun.
<ul><li> A great example is in Act 6 Act 1 when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jane was caught in an explosion and apparently died</span>. A few pages later, Hussie's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a> expressed surprise that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">there were still characters he hadn't killed off yet</a>, and then proceeded to <em>laugh manically.</em> And then, of course, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it turned out that Jane hadn't even died after all, anyway.</span> Many a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkywardScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkywardScream">Skyward Scream</a> in his name was yelled on those days.
</li><li> Also, from the book 2 commentary:
<div class="indent">The previous book ended on a cliffhanger. Was John killed really by a meteor??? You didn't know what to think, did you? Here we find out he not only survived, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyingCreator">his clown-riddled house became enshrouded in pure evil.</a> Try to bear in mind though that sometimes I say things which are not true.
</div></li><li> The man not only deliberately wrote a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter">Base-Breaking Character</a> whose status as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Creator's Pet</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar">heavily disputed</a>, he then went on to show his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a> proposing to her, apparently just because he could.
</li><li> And then there was that time he posted a big, dramatic-looking flash animation that took ages to load... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">only for it to turn out to be a gif which laughed at the reader and said 'You spend no less than 90 seconds staring at this fucking gif image before you realize that the actual Flash animation is on the next page.'</span>
</li><li> Hussie still has it in him as three years after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> and the official end of the story.

</li></ul></li><li> Brian Clevinger of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/EightBitTheater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/EightBitTheater">8-Bit Theater</a></em> fame, noted for his love of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimax">Anti-Climax</a>. He wrote <em>two</em> separate fake-out endings to his webcomic (one where <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nuklearpower.com/2002/04/01/episode-133-if-you-did-see-it-coming-you-might-be-psychic-joke-comic/">Garland sets a computer to blow up the universe<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, and one where <a class="urllink" href="https://www.nuklearpower.com/2008/12/11/episode-1070-what-were-you-expecting/">Fighter wakes up as a real-life woman and dismissing the apparent dream as "80% filler"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>), and admitted to doing the second one solely to see the readers' angry reactions. The fanbase was onto him by that point, though, and thought it was a hilarious and fitting ending. Clevinger was disappointed.
</li><li> RK Milholland of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SomethingPositive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SomethingPositive">Something*Positive</a></em> does this a lot. The more he abuses his fans, the more they love him (to his eternal bewilderment).
<ul><li> And in-universe, Davan, whom Milholland modeled on himself, starts his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Comic Within A Comic</a>, only to grow bored with it. However, rather than abandoning the project, he decides to use it to troll his fanbase. Hopefully, this will turn out better for him than for Davan (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catgirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catgirl">Catgirl</a> rampage!)

When asked if he had ever written a story arc deliberately to piss off the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping">'shippers</a>, he replied "see my entire comic".

When it turned out that the fans actually <em>liked</em> that, he immediately had her get rid of it. And then he wrote a short arc in which he flip-flopped on whether she did or not - both surgery and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a> were involved.

The reveal was promised to come on April 1, but after teasing the answer with "Now, finally, the shocking truth about Cartman's lineage&#133;" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TreyParkerAndMattStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TreyParkerAndMattStone">Trey Parker and Matt Stone</a> threw in an April Fools Joke at the public with "Not Without my Anus", an episode starring Terrence and Phillip, the boys' favorite Canadian TV stars. Cartman's father's identity <em>is</em> mentioned during "Not Without My Anus," but it's almost completely drowned out by Terrence and Phillip's laughter, so it's extremely easy to miss, and was not properly revealed until several weeks later. Many viewers were not pleased. Oh, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the identity of Cartman's father was subject to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">Retcon</a> years later anyhow.</span>

Except that only the first 15 minutes are an actual episode. The last half of the show is just Space Ghost silently following an ant <em>for ten minutes</em>. It's deliberately made to be as slow, tedious, and annoying as possible. There's one last joke at the end, if you're willing to sit through the damn thing. A shorter version was later made to fit within the regular timeslot that cuts down the scene.

He begins to explain only for the video to become corrupted and cut to a "please stand by" image.

<ul><li> He stated that at least one character would not survive Season 2. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Note that he didn't say</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">main</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">character</a>.

Technically, there were two other deaths in that season as well, but they were <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Big Henry and Time Baby, the former of whom died in the same episode he was introduced in and was a minor character with only a couple minutes of screen time, and the latter of whom was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">mentioned in a cryptogram</a> to eventually manage to regenerate himself and come back anyway</span>.
</li><li> These instances of misleading <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryingWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryingWolf">came back to bite him</a> when he was trying to warn fans that a then-upcoming character named Tad Strange was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyAverageGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyAverageGuy">just a short gag</a> and not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadDuumvirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadDuumvirate">surprise new villain</a> like the fans expected him to be.

</li><li> In the show's final episode, we finally learn the importance of the Zodiac Wheel that appears at the beginning and end of every episode. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Its purpose is suitably grand and epic... and also ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">completely pointless to the story</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> The writers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> occasionally tease the audience by making it look like they're finally going to reveal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield">which state Springfield is in.</a> Examples include Lisa about to point it out on a US map just before Bart walks in front of the camera and a celebrity cameo flying to Springfield by going to the airport and buying a plane ticket to "the state where Springfield is located."
<ul><li> It is said that some episodes, like the infamous "Saddlesore Galactica", were made bizarre and alienating on purpose to annoy the kind of fans who would complain about them online. "Saddlesore Galactica" even includes Comic Book Guy, a caricature of the show's negative online critics, complaining about the plot.

On a live stream. And that's not even starting on mocking fans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkDecay">on adding live-action shows to the channel starting in the late 00's</a>.
<ul><li> Similar to the <em>South Park</em> example above, the channel also pulled an April Fools joke at audiences by airing the season 3 premiere of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em> completely unannounced at the same time that the new episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em> was supposed to air, causing it to get delayed until the week after. Again, like the <em>South Park</em> example, many fans were not pleased.
<ul><li> Of course, Genndy Tartakovsky himself has been pulling this for all of Season 5, and nowhere is it more obvious than the series's penultimate episode. The preview of the episode showed nothing except Jack coming across a large group of ruined robotic warriors, many of them giant, and remarking on how he knew that place, which many fans also recognized as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the lair of The Guardian from Season 3, who protected the time portal that Jack was apparently <em>destined</em> to use</span>. Then we find out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that portal was destroyed as well, and the Guardian is nowhere to be seen; only his red sunglasses in front of the destroyed portal, which are cracked.</span> And that's not even mentioning the cruel cliffhanger at the end of the episode, which he complements by <em>not showing so much as a second from the next episode.</em> What makes this worse is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Guardian</span>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinMichaelRichardson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinMichaelRichardson">voice actor</a> was credited for the season, but he only provided voice work for the sixth episode, in which he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack">reprised some returning characters he voiced before</a> (none of which were <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Guardian</span>) and provided the voice for a member of a trio of dogs that ruin Scaramouche's attempt to contact Aku, meaning that Tartakovsky has been stringing fans along in the cruelest possible way.

<ul><li> Yang Soon is the owner and head chef of the restaurant Father's Office, and this is his way of running the business. He makes it intentionally difficult to get a seat by not having seating service; he makes it intentionally difficult to <em>keep</em> your seat once claimed by requiring you to place your order at the bar while telling the bartender your table number meaning you can't order, then get a table; the waitstaff is encouraged to be snarky and verbally abusive to the customers; and if you claim a dietary restriction, such as allergies, Celiac disease, religion, or vegetarianism, Soon will make sure to give you a free extra helping of whatever you're not allowed to eat. (He's also savvy enough to know when someone's doing this on purpose.)
