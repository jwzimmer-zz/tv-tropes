And of course, women disguising themselves as men in order to join the military has happened time and again throughout history, for any number of reasons&#151;a deeply held desire to do so, a living in times when there was no other way to support herself, even getting away from a terrible situation at home.

</p><p></p><div class="indent">in an age before unisex fashions, trousers meant 'man' and skirts meant 'woman'. Trousers plus high-pitched voice meant 'young man'. People didn't expect anything else, and saw what they expected to see.

</p><p>As a type of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor">Weirdness Censor</a>, the human mind will simply ignore small details that could give the ruse away, once it has classified a person as either male or female.

The main character is Sarasa, a girl whose twin brother, Tatara, is prophesied to be the "child of destiny" who will bring back the country's independence and stop the tyrannical rule of the Empire, namely the Red King.

</li><li> Casca from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> is an interesting example as she both archives this trope and subverts it at the same time. When she was first introduced she's armored enough that the protagonist Guts thought he was fighting a man, until he knocked her helmet off. Princess Charlotte also assumed Casca was a man when she first met her and was surprised to learn otherwise when meeting her again. On the other hand, most enemy soldiers and Apostles <em>aren't fooled for a second</em> and easily recognize Casca as a woman, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts">try their best to rip her armor off</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape">and violate her</a>.

(A gift from her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousProtector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousProtector">Mysterious Protector</a>, who had sent it <em>before</em> she was punished.) She uses them to sneak away and have fun without being caught by the school staff, alternating between the girly girl facade and the boyish one. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>.
</li><li> An early episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em> has a minor character named Yuuki dress up like a boy while she tries to remove a card's influence from her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">Disappeared Dad</a>'s painting. Sakura doesn't notice her gender until the girl's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat">Nice Hat</a> falls off and reveals her long hair.
</li><li> The heroine of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CastleInTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CastleInTheSky">Castle in the Sky</a></em> dresses as a boy to evade capture. The disguise doesn't fly for long.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Classi9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Classi9">Classi9</a></em>, Ren has to pass as a boy named Rentarou to keep studying music in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderSchool">Melite</a>. Except for Mozart, who led her there and ended up becoming her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretKeeper">Secret Keeper</a>, no one is allowed to know about her gender, or they will both be expelled.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore">Claymore</a></em>, Clare disguises herself as a man for a time in order to travel under the radar, even using her limited <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeShifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeShifting">Shapeshifting</a> abilities to elongate her vocal cords and deepen her voice.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CynthiaTheMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CynthiaTheMission">Cynthia the Mission</a></em> Shii, the male 'protection' personality of the busty and beautiful Kanae manages to pull this off with a specific jacket designed to minimize her bust. It doesn't help that Shii acts very much like a man.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GirlGotGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GirlGotGame">Girl Got Game</a></em>, Kyo is forced/convinced by her father to pretend to be a boy so she can fulfill his dreams of playing basketball. She also lives in the boy's dorm with a boy she hates <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who she of course ends up falling for.</span> This series is pretty much a parody of the genre. Similar to the example in <em>Mulan</em>, Kyo has many severe male stereotypes she tries to emulate with little success. She ends up adapting, however, and wonders if she can ever go back to being feminine. Her roommate also has an interesting way of coping once he discovers her true gender.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GirlsSaurus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GirlsSaurus">Girls Saurus</a></em>, where all the other students at the boys' school Tsubasa goes to are convinced he's actually a girl pretending to be a boy, even though he isn't... Except for tough guy Arahata, who refutes the idea as ridiculous. "What do you think this is, a shoujo manga?" Of course, then when he goes to confront Tsubasa on the matter, he's utterly convinced that he's a girl after one look at him, too. He also gets molested by men on the train to school.
</li><li> Michel Volban of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GlassFleet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GlassFleet">Glass Fleet</a></em> is a noblewoman who assumed her older brother's identity and his role as leader of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La R&eacute;sistance</a>.

To do this, she masquerades as a boy named Himeboytchi to get a role as a male lead character.

Her sex isn't discovered until the protagonist forces her to strip to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">remove the leeches that got all over her when she forded a river</a>.
</li><li> Mizuki Ashiya from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HanaKimi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HanaKimi">Hana-Kimi</a></em> who dresses up as a guy to get together with her favourite high jumper, Sano. They get close enough that people mistake them for Yaoi Guys and even Shuichi (the loud guy...) starts liking her thinking she's a guy, leading to some odd situations to say the least.
</li><li> Itsuki Myoudouin from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeartcatchPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeartcatchPrettyCure">HeartCatch Pretty Cure!</a></em>, taking her big brother Satsuki's role due to the aforementioned man having a weak heart.

Holmes passes. Watson has some problems, but an admirer takes the blame for her.

One of his new friends, who is also the top player on the local boys' football team, is actually a girl. Keeping up the charade becomes somewhat difficult when she hits puberty and things start to grow ...
</li><li> The Canadian Short <em>No Bikini</em> shows that bath and this trope <strong>do</strong> mix sometimes. Robin, a 7-yr girl, <em>hates</em> bikinis, but girls must wear a swimsuit for a swimming class. So she pretends to be a boy so she can attend just in swimming trunks.

The film is about a 12-year old girl who disguises herself as a boy in order to earn an income for her family, who are left destitute and with no way of earning an income after the death of her father and uncle. <em>Osama</em> is an unusually realistic example of the trope.

When the Sheriff of Nottingham attempts to lure Robin into a trap by having his lover impersonate Marian, Marian is forced to reveal herself to Robin to save him. She was more successful at impersonating a guy man examples, partly because Uma's fairly tall.

</li><li> The French film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tomboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tomboy">Tomboy</a></em>, has a 10-year-old girl move to a new neighborhood. Throughout the movie, she passes herself off as a boy, even playing soccer without a shirt, kissing another girl, and swimming without a top. Before doing the last, she even fashions a thing to put in her shorts that mimics a penis bulge. However, given these very intense measures there's some debate about whether Laure's transgender.
</li><li> In the 1984 Finnish comedy <em>Uuno <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TurhapuroInTheArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TurhapuroInTheArmy">Turhapuro In The Army</a></em>, the protagonist's wife takes her husband's place in the Finnish army for a short while against her will, with an extremely unconvincing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WigDressAccent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WigDressAccent">haircut and stubble</a>. What really gets her, though, is that no-one noticed a thing...not even while they were bathing.
</li><li> A similar idea is used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VictorVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VictorVictoria">Victor/Victoria</a></em>, merely as a way to break into show business. Victoria's singing is apparently far more appreciated by audiences who think she's a gay female impersonator named Victor. The film makes a point that this takes some doing: Victoria is naturally a coloratura soprano (being played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulieAndrews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulieAndrews">Julie Andrews</a>) but has to perform as a contralto so that her voice is deep enough to keep up the illusion.

</li><li> A thirteenth century French <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingArthur">Arthurian Romance</a> is arguably one of the earliest texts to use this trope. A woman, Eufeme ("Alas, woman!") gives birth to a daughter, Eufemie ("Alas, girl"; or, "euphemism", a way of speaking around the subject). Her parents decide to raise her as a son, named Silence ("Seriously, could the metaphor be more clear?"), so that she can inherit her father's land. She becomes famed as a minstrel and a knight, captures Merlin, and is unmasked. Unfortunately, it's not quite as feminist as it sounds; Silence is depicted as the "perfect woman" precisely because she was raised as a man, and thus is not as susceptible to evil as other women are.
<ul><li> Since Silence <em>prefers</em> being a man, albiet because of the social advantage it affords him/her, s/he could be considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">trans-man</a> by today's standards.

She can also fight much better than most women in the Barsoom-series.
</li><li> In <em>Becky</em> by Lenore Hart, Becky Thatcher (Tom Sawyer's childhood sweetheart) passes herself off as a man and fights in the Civil War.
</li><li> Joanna Sedley in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertLouisStevenson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertLouisStevenson">Robert Louis Stevenson</a>'s <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBlackArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBlackArrow">The Black Arrow</a></em> may be the least convincing example of this ever.

<ul><li> Stevenson didn't put too much effort into it for two reasons: 1) He was writing it as part of a serial, and having her listed as a boy for the first few installments (it originally appeared in a weekly kids' magazine) would have confused the readers, and 2) he was only writing it for a quick buck while he wrote <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrinceOtto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrinceOtto">Prince Otto</a></em>. Ironically, <em>The Black Arrow</em> ended up being much more popular.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BloodyJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BloodyJack">Bloody Jack</a></em> is a young adult novel about a London orphan girl who joins the Royal Navy as a ship's boy. Risky, but much more attractive than dying of starvation. This causes problems both comedic and poignant when she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">falls in love with a fellow ship's boy, thinks she's dying when she gets her period and has nobody to ask about it</span>, etc. It has several sequels, and the character sometimes reverts to this trope in a pinch, even though by then she's filled out a little more and presumably no longer looks like an androgynous eleven-year-old. People still buy it, though.
</li><li> In <em>The Breadwinner</em>, a girl named Parvana, who lives in Afghanistan, disguises herself as a boy in order to earn money for her family because her father was arrested and her brother was too young to provide for them.

Cadfael deduces who she is quite quickly in the book. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cadfael" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cadfael">the TV show of the book</a>, he sees through her disguise instantly. As does the audience.

Pratchett also plays this for drama as much as for laughs, with Polly becoming disgusted by the contrast between how men and women are treated in Borogravia.

</li><li> Nastily subverted in <em>Iron Dawn</em>, in the backstory of Barra the Pict: seeking her fortune in the male-dominated Mediterranean, she dresses up as a young man and joins a group of bandits. She need not have bothered, as the thugs were disappointed to discover that she <em>wasn't</em> a boy when they turned upon and gang-raped her.

<ul><li> In one of the short stories set in the same universe, a character is revealed to have disguised herself as a boy and ran away from home because her stepfather wanted her to be veiled like the other females in their country and was going to arrange a marriage for her.
</li></ul></li><li> In the children's picture book <em>Little Kay</em> a girl dresses up as a boy to become a knight. The king somehow finds out there's a girl among the men, and asks his advisers how he can figure out which one she is. In an inversion of the Achilles myth, the advisers suggest offering jewels and pretty fabrics and so on, on the assumption that the girl will be the one interested. Since this is a comedy, though, the men all turn out to be raging dandies who <em>love</em> the gaudy stuff while the girl spurns it. The only one who offers useful advice is the castle maid, who suggests the king have them all drink a toast, since when they all tilt their heads back to drink the men's Adam's apples will be apparent. This proves effective. <br>After the girl is discovered, the sultan is so impressed that he decides to make her a knight anyway, since she is the only one in the army who isn't a complete dandy. Dressed as a boy, she goes off on a quest which will win her the hand of a princess. She rescues the princess, and the princess discovers she is a girl, but they decide to get married anyway.
<ul><li> Possibly based on a Russian fairy tale - at the end of that story, the king asks the girl to bathe with him, she goes to change... and runs off, leaving a note behind saying "by the way, yes, I AM a girl."
<ul><li> There is an Italian tale which has the same scene (except the girl fakes an urgent message forcing her to return home). It seems to have inspired <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantaghir<!--C3-->B2_series">an entire film series<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li></ul></li><li> There was a similar fairy tale, only that the whole group was a bunch of girls. When they got wind of the 'tests' to expose them, they would try to confuse things even more. When offered jewels and fabrics, some of them ignored them, some of them appraised the valuables, and a couple of them 'stole' some of the gems. When ashes were strewn across the threshold (on the assumption that the girls would try to clean it up), most of them marched right across it, while a few of them tried to clean it up and made the mess worse in the process.

<ul><li> The Witch-King's belief that no man could kill him came from a prophecy by Glorfindel a thousand years before. The prophecy said "not by the hand of man shall he fall" and the Witch-King thought he was, therefore, invulnerable. But, he got shivved by a hobbit (not a Man) and his head struck off by a woman (not a man) working in tandem with each other (not singular), an old artefact made specifically to hurt him from back in the day (a weapon made by crafts<em>men</em>) <em>and</em> a whole army supporting them to set his death in motion (in short, a team effort by <em>loads</em> of men, women and horses). Which just goes to show: you should <em>always</em> read the fine print.

Both Kendar and Mysti took the "Til death do us part" deal pretty seriously. Hilarity ensues in <em>Majyk by Design</em> when they hook back up with Mysti still in costume and Kendar's brother and aunts in eavesdropping distance.</span>
</li><li> Miranda, the title character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Maledicte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Maledicte">Maledicte</a></em>, passes herself off as a young man to get revenge on her lover's father. The male name and pronoun are used even in scenes from "his" point of view, which definitely makes for some odd sex scenes. Actually, the entire book is an odd experience - Maledicte's deception is so complete that the reader forgets that it <em>is</em> a deception.
</li><li> In "The Misadventures of Maude March", the title character and her sister Sallie disguise themselves as men while Maude is on the run from several crimes, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> including murdering a man(which was actually her sister by accident)</span>. All the women, and the occasional man with a sister who did that, see through it, though most men are completely fooled.

Again, the trick only works on most men, because women apparently have a sixth sense for this thing.

Her disguise is effective enough that the hero, Simon, is fooled (granted that he's not all that observant when it comes to girls), even after they meet in the wilderness.

Not only is she deeply put off by her bridegroom, who is at least thirty years her senior, but on the night of their betrothal dinner she falls in love with the young minstrel who comes to play and sing for them. He leaves her an instrument and a note suggesting another way of life, which she accepts gladly; she cuts off her long hair, dresses in clothes belonging to her deceased brother, and runs away to minstrel school.

</li><li> Alice in Beth Hilgartner's <em>A Murder for Her Majesty</em> takes this up almost by accident. Having witnessed her father's murder, apparently at the Queen's command, she needs to find a place to hide; conveniently she has a run-in with some helpful boys in the cathedral choir, who think it would be great fun to disguise her as a choirboy.
</li><li> In <em>My Father Had a Daughter</em>, a fictionalized account of the life of Judith Shakespeare, the heroine dresses as a man in order to sneak off to the Globe Theater and act in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">her father</a>'s plays. Works well until he figures out who she really is, but even he has to admit some amusement at the trick. The narrative implies that her ruse was his inspiration for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TwelfthNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TwelfthNight">Twelfth Night</a></em> (see the Theater section below).

However, Myrzella is handed by her master as an gift to an Moroccan pasha who figures out her gender and she ends up being forced into his harem.
</li><li> Exactly the same thing happens in <em>No Bed for Bacon</em>, the novel upon which <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShakespeareInLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShakespeareInLove">Shakespeare in Love</a></em> was (very) loosely based.

</li><li> Another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinMcKinley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinMcKinley">Robin McKinley</a> example occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOutlawsOfSherwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOutlawsOfSherwood">The Outlaws of Sherwood</a></em>, when a young woman named Cecily joins Robin's band under the name Cecil. She remains undiscovered for quite a while, which is particularly impressive considering her brother Will is also in the band. And Marian disguises herself as a man for a shorter period in the same book.

She then creates a cover identity for herself that is as different as possible from Beka Rosselin-Metadi in several respects, including presenting as male.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/QueenOfTheTearling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/QueenOfTheTearling">Queen of the Tearling</a></em> has an unusual example; Kelsea swaps clothes with one of the male guards who accompany her. The loyal guards know that she is a woman, and the disguise is not meant to be very convincing, it is only to distract the enemies, who are looking for the Queen and are unlikely to get very close.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ratburger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ratburger">Ratburger</a></em>: Discussed when Zoe wonders if Tina's secret is that she's really a boy named Bob.

The narration does mention that her disguise is kinda given away by some unmasculine bulges underneath her jerkin, though other strangers mind their own business.

This somewhat confuses their new neighbors, who are <em>quite sure</em> that when the family moved in there were three daughters rather than two daughters and a son, but they shrug it off and go about their lives.
</li><li> In <em>Sarum</em>, Aelfgifu dons Saxon armor to fight a skirmish against the Vikings and is initially mistaken for a young man, as she'd intended. Subverted in that her deception never fools anyone for long, but she fights well enough that her brothers insist she be allowed to participate in the Battle of Edington <em>without</em> having to invoke this trope.
</li><li> In <em>The Secret of 1798</em> Catriona dresses up as a boy so she can go fishing with her father. She simply borrows a neighbour's clothes and hides her hair under a large hat. The ruse is up immediately when the boat capsizes and they are rescued by a French ship.
</li><li> Buran in Barbara Cohen and Bahija Lovejoy's <em>Seven Daughters and Seven Sons</em> disguises herself as a boy in order to make her family rich, since her father has no business sense. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetOnPollyOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetOnPollyOliver">Sweet on Polly Oliver</a> ensues.

The reader is in on her identity from the first chapter, but not anyone else; frequent mention is made of the fact that she would be dishonorably discharged if her true sex became known. (She initially gets away with it by pretending to religious sentiments in order to avoid the other soldiers' brothel and tavern visits. Her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankUp">Rank Up</a> in the beginning of the first book also helps, as NCOs get private quarters; previously she had purchased her own tent out of pocket to avoid sharing quarters.) Lucky for her, when her CO eventually does find out, he decides to keep up the masquerade, as she's far too competent to let go.
<ul><li> Winter isn't the only female soldier in the Colonials, either. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bobby</span> is revealed to be female about three-quarters of the way through <em>The Thousand Names,</em> when she suffers a grievous wound in combat. Her fellow noncoms also decide to keep the secret, although this has more to do with the nature of her survival than her sex. (Hint: she undergoes an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyTransformation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyTransformation">Emergency Transformation</a> that would see her executed for witchcraft back in Vordan.)

She ends up going off to the Crusades and falling in with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardTheLionheart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardTheLionheart">King Richard</a>. Among other things, he falls in love with her as a boy and there is much confusion and danger (since he's the king) when he realizes she's a girl.
</li><li> In Robin Hobb's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LiveshipTraders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LiveshipTraders">Ship of Magic</a></em>, after Althea runs away from her family, she asks a friend for advice on how to find work as a sailor on her own merits; the friend snarkily responds that she would have to find a way to be reborn as a boy, preferably one with a different last name. Which is exactly what she does - she disguises herself as a boy, and joins a crew under an assumed name.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SignalAirship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SignalAirship">Signal Airship</a></em> series' protagonist, Josette Dupre, used to be one of these before the Garnian military allowed women to serve in a (limited) military role.
</li><li> Another Swedish example is Caroline in Maria Gripe's <em>Skugg-/Shadow</em> books, who spends large parts of the books pretending to be a young man called Carl. She does it for several reasons: increased freedom, to gain a certain job, and for the sheer heck of it. She will also quite happily flirt with both men and women. (Which backfires when two of them fall deeply in love with her and decide to marry each other, bonding over their mutual love for Carl. Yeah.)
</li><li> Ruth Mallory in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SomeoneElsesWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SomeoneElsesWar">Someone Else's War</a></em>. She doesn't get the idea until someone else mentions it, however, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">wishes she had thought of it</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">much sooner.</a>

<ul><li> In the first book, her unkempt, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tomboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tomboy">tomboyish</a> appearance leads to lots of people mistakenly calling her "boy", and she has to correct them so often that "I'm not a boy" practically becomes her catchphrase. In the second book, once she's in disguise and actually trying to pass off as a common boy, when someone sees her ruse she has to repeat her catchphrase with a twist: "I'm not a girl!"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggingTrope">Brienne is an interesting case</a> in that she does look like a tall, powerfully built man; she would have a <em>harder</em> time trying to look feminine than passing as a man. As she's one of the strongest knights in the Seven Kingdoms, she was able to secure a place in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard">Renly's guard</a> without actually needing to hide. The only way you could tell her actual gender is by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamusIsAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamusIsAGirl">seeing her bareheaded</a>, which logically leads her to keep her helmet on when she'd rather not be recognized.
</li><li> While it hasn't been explicitly revealed as of yet, the half-Summer Islander, slim, smooth-faced Dornish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SdrawkcabAlias" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SdrawkcabAlias">Alleras</a> with the widow's peak who's not interested in women bears a striking resemblance to the half-Summer Islander, slim, Dornish female Sarella whose father had a widow's peak.
</li><li> Deconstructed with Brave Danny Flint, also the subject of a romantic song, who posed as a boy to join the Nights Watch. Apparently the real 'Danny' Flint was raped and murdered, presumably by her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmyOfThievesAndWhores" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmyOfThievesAndWhores">fellow soldiers</a> when her identity was discovered.

She takes a good, long look in her mirror, and decides her figure is far too emphatically female. (Probably intended as an ironic reference to her Sweet Polly Oliver turn in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em>)

Considering how strongly enforced Vorin gender roles are it's even more scandalous there than it usually would be.

</li><li> Crossdressing is a classic folk music trope. One song, "The Soldier Maid," also known as "Female Drummer" (not sure whether it's true folk or modern) is about a girl who joins the British army as a drummer boy, and is only betrayed when a woman comes on to her, learns she's female, and goes off to tell her officers. The officers are actually disappointed they have to send her home, and give her a bounty and pension for her service. The song "Cruel War," covered by Peter, Paul and Mary, focuses on a woman who follows her love to war and is killed while in disguise.
<ul><li> "Jackaroe" is another song about a girl who goes off to war to follow her love, this time in the Navy.
</li><li> As is "Billy Taylor", but it has a twist ending. It turns out that the titular character, whom the song's main character has joined the Navy to follow has found a new girl, and the main character tracks them both down and kills them, and is promoted for it.
</li><li> "The Handsome Sailor Boy" &mdash; In which a young woman signs on a ship as a cabin boy and the captain falls in love with her.

In others, she's just doing it for the adventure, both the captain and the captain's wife fall in love with her &mdash; but it's only the captain who realizes she's a woman ... Until one night, on board ship, when she gives birth. Then everyone knows.
</li><li> In "The Female Rambling Sailor", a woman goes to sea after her lover is pressed into naval service and drowns. She proves an exemplary sailor, and none of her crewmates suspect her identity until she dies in a fall from the rigging and they discover her 'female form'.
</li></ul></li><li> There's a Spanish ballad about a girl who dresses like a man, calls herself Don Mart&iacute;n and goes to war because her father is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass">too old</a>. Then, the prince falls for her (getting extremely confused because he somehow suspects "he" is a girl, but isn't quite sure). Then the prince comes out to the queen and she suggest several tests to expose Don Mart&iacute;n, all of which fail, except the last one: a bath. Don Mart&iacute;n runs away and the prince after her, and they marry.
</li><li> <em>Gra&#380;yna</em>, a 1823 narrative poem written by Adam Mickiewicz features an eponymous heroine living in the 15th century, who, as a protest against her husband coming to an agreement with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTeutonicKnights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTeutonicKnights">Teutonic Knights</a>, secretly puts on his armour and leads the army into battle with the enemy.
<ul><li> This poem is said to have inspired the Emilia Plater, a real-life military heoine of the November 1830 uprising against the Imperial Russia. Plater cut off her hair, put on a men's uniform and equipped a unit of more than six hundred volunteers - half trained soldiers and half peasants with war scythes. It's a significant fact that Plater had been also immortalized by Mickiewicz in his poem <em>&#346;mier&#263; pu&#322;kownika</em> (<em>The Death of the Colonel</em>)
</li></ul></li><li> Spoofed in W.S. Gilbert's <em><a class="urllink" href="http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/bab_ballads/html/bumboat_woman.html">The Bumboat Woman's Story<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>. The heroine disguises herself as a man to sign on as a sailor on the gunboat of handsome Lieutenant Belaye, whom she loves. When Belaye returns from leave with a wife, it is revealed that <em>every one</em> of the sailors on the boat is a woman who disguised herself for the same reason.
</li><li> Played with in <em>Martinmas Time,</em> in which a girl is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyWord">forced to swear</a> she will visit a camp of nearby soldiers. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">She arrives dressed as a soldier</a> and demands entrance. Impatient for the girl to show up, the soldiers tell her to hurry up and leave, even paying her to do so. At which point she reveals her disguise, ties her garter to their gatepost, and escapes.
</li><li> Deconstructed in Elizabeth Barrett Browning's <em>The Romaunt of the Page</em>, where a lady accompanies her husband on a crusade, disguised as a page, only for the husband to declare that such an act "unwomans" a woman and that he'll only think of her as a page and never as a wife. The woman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">breaks down and sacrifices herself when they are ambushed by the Saracens</a>.
</li><li> Also in the different versions of Norwegian ballad <em>Liti Kjersti Stalldreng</em> (Little Kirsti Stableboy), where the heroine disguises herself for nine years as a stable boy in the royal stable. The prince goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetOnPollyOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetOnPollyOliver">Sweet on Polly Oliver</a>, and the result reveals itself when the king finds the clever stable boy in the stable, giving birth.

<ul><li> However, whether Shiek is actually male (or meant to be perceived as male) is hotly debated amongst fans. The non-canon manga adaptation of <em>OoT</em> says that Zelda magically transformed herself into a boy, while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors">Hyrule Warriors</a></em> present the Sheik disguise as more overtly female-looking and use feminine pronouns. Ruto briefly refers to Sheik as a "young man" in the only time Sheik and their gender are mentioned by another character in-game, but the two never directly interacted with one another, so it could be that Ruto was mistaken. Ultimately, <em>Ocarina</em> itself is ambiguous about whether Sheik is merely a female disguised as a male as per this trope, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">a male who was transformed from a female</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OccamsRazor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OccamsRazor">or a female whose disguise is also meant to be female</a>, though most spinoff material leans towards the latter.

Particularly in <em>MG2</em> and <em>MGS</em>, the only way to determine who is Snake's contact is to follow said contact to the Ladies' room.

Also, many 18th and 19th century women were relatively small-breasted due to inadequate nutrition, and many figured out the trick of padding out their waists instead of trying to completely eliminate their breasts, which was often helped by ill-fitting uniforms and the sartorial customs of the time, which required several layers of relatively thick and unyielding fabrics and often resulted in people resembling unmade beds.

She was caught by a doctor after getting shot in the shoulder, and was honorably discharged due to her heroism on the battlefield. Deborah allowed her story to become public and gave lectures about her experiences in war until she died in 1827.
</li><li> There are at least 22 documented cases of women serving in the Prussian army during the Napoleonic Wars. They include:
<ul><li> Eleonore Prohaska (1785-1813), who served as private August Renz in the L&uuml;tzow Free Corps and only revealed her real identity when she was mortally wounded in the battle of the Goehrde (1813).
</li><li> Louise Grafemus (1786-1852, born Esther Manuel), a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JewishMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JewishMother">converted Jewish mother of two</a>, who served with some financial backing from Princess Marianne of Prussia as an uhlan during the Wars of Liberation (1813-1815), searching for her husband who, as it turned out, was serving in a Russian unit and was killed before the war ended. Grafemus lost her right hand, was promoted to <em>Wachtmeister</em> (sergeant-major) and was decorated with an Iron Cross. After the war she moved to St. Petersburg, married a second time, and as the widow Louise Kessenich ran an inn called "The Red Zucchini".
</li><li> Friederike Kr&uuml;ger (1789-1848) alias August L&uuml;beck served in the Kolberg Infantry Regiment from 1813 to 1815, rose to <em>Unteroffizier</em> (sergeant), and was awarded an Iron Cross and a (Russian) Cross of St. George after being wounded and discovered to be a woman at the battle of Dennewitz in 1813. After the 1815 campaign she retired from the military, married another <em>Unteroffizier</em>, and had four children.
</li><li> Maria Werder, the wife of a landed gentleman, served as a hussar to be with her husband in the campaigns of 1806/7 and 1813. She was promoted to <em>Wachtmeister</em> in the 2nd Silesian Hussars and and revealed her real identity only when she left the army after her husband was killed in the battle of Leipzig.
</li></ul></li><li> British military surgeon James Miranda Barry (1789[?]-1865), who rose to the position of Inspector General in charge of all military hospitals, was discovered after death to have female sexual organs. Considerable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgement">historical controversy</a> continues as to whether Barry was a trans man, or simply cross-dressed to pursue a career that a woman then could not have, and barring breakthroughs in spiritualism we're unlikely to ever get an answer that will be convincing to all.
</li><li> Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Figueur, the original <em>Madame Sans-G&ecirc;ne</em> before Victorien Sardou reused this nickname for Catherine Lefebvre, served from 1792 to 1815 as a cavalry trooper and was wounded and captured a few times.

Her distinguished career continued after her true gender was discovered, and as a lieutenant in the Mariupol Hussars became the first Russian female officer. She later wrote memoirs of a quality that impressed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexanderPushkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexanderPushkin">Aleksandr Pushkin</a>.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%97%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B9,_%D0%95%D0%B2%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%9D%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0">Evdokiya Zavaliy<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (1924-2010), the marine corps officer of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. She joined Red Army as a girl in 1941 after her village was taken by German landing force and worked as a nurse. Later, she was commissioned because of injury and put in reserve regiment. When some officers came to get volunteers for the front-lines they took her for a man (helped by the documents saying "Evdok.", which can be the beginning of both Evdokia <em>and</em> Evdokim). She decided to play along and soon became a platoon commander. After her real gender was uncovered 8 months later (as usual, in a hospital) she was sent to the officer courses and became the one and only female Marine corps officer in Soviet history. She retired in 1947 in the rank of a guards colonel. She and her marine platoon was so feared by Nazis that they called her Frau Schwarzer Tod (Miss Black death).
</li><li> During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrenchRevolution">French Revolution</a> farmer's daughter <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren<!--C3-->A9e_Bordereau">Ren&eacute;e Bordereau<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (1770-1824) lost several relatives to the Terror and and saw <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather">her father killed before her eyes</a>. Dressed as a man (not that hard, apparently, as she was described as very ugly) she fought in the wars in the Vend&eacute;e on the royalist side under the <em>nom-de-guerre</em> Langevin (i. e. "the Angevin" or "man from Anjou") and was wounded several times. Since the forces of the Republic and Empire kept looking for a man, she managed to evade capture after the Vend&eacute;ans' defeat until 1809. At one point she was accused of raping a girl, but was able to prove her innocence by revealing her gender, but not her real name. Imprisoned on the Mont-Saint-Michel, she was liberated after Napoleon's abdication, following which she dictaded her memoirs before taking to the field once more in the war of 1815.
</li><li> As per the <em>Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</em> example, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Read">Mary Read<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Bonny">Anne Bonny<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, two Sweet Polly Olivers on the same ship, no less! Apparently the practice of women joining pirate crews disguised as men was common enough for Black Bart to specifically forbid it in his formulation of the pirates' code. Ironically, both escaped hanging because they claimed to be pregnant, since it was a pretty standard way of forestalling a death sentence, as there wasn't any immediate method to definitively confirm the allegation. Read later died of a fever while in prison, while Bonny disappeared from the record.
<ul><li> Not to mention that Bonny was hitting on Read, and ended up being the victim of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsettlingGenderReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsettlingGenderReveal">Unsettling Gender Reveal</a>, after which she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">revealed</a> her own disguise to Read.
</li><li> Read went on to fight a duel to save another (presumably) male pirate she was interested in. She allegedly won the duel by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WardrobeMalfunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WardrobeMalfunction">tearing open her shirt</a> and then skewering her opponent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedByTheSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedByTheSexy">while he was distracted</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Mollie Bean, who is known only from an 1865 article in the Richmond Newspaper, after she was discovered. She served in the 47th North Carolina Regiment disguised as a boy for over two years. Was included as a character in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryTurtledove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryTurtledove">Harry Turtledove</a>'s <em>The Guns of the South.</em>
</li><li> Also <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalina_de_Erauso">Catalina de Erauso<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, "The Lieutenant Nun".
</li><li> Mexican female writer Sor Juana In&eacute;s de la Cruz, back in the 17th century, crossdressed in order to sneak into an university back when women were not allowed to receive education. She later decided to become a nun and spare herself from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a>.
</li><li> The book <em>Female Tars: Women Aboard Ship in the Age of Sail</em> by Suzanne J. Stark gives several examples of women who joined the British Royal Navy in disguise (as well as exposing a few frauds). Includes a detailed autobiography of Mary Lacy, who served as a seaman and shipwright for twelve years.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norah_Vincent">Norah Vincent<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> posed as a guy for one and a half years, exploring the male-only parts of the society (including a Catholic cloister) out of pure scientific interest. Nobody guessed that "he" was a she the whole time.
</li><li> Charlotte "One-Eyed Charley" Parkhurst, a stagecoach driver during the Gold Rush, who wasn't publicly outed until after her death.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milunka_Savic">Milunka Savic<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, a Serbian war heroine from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarOne">World War One</a>, was a rather awesome subversion of this trope. She joined the Serbian Army during the Second Balkan War in the place of her brother after he was drafted, and served with distinction until she was wounded in combat and her gender was revealed to the attending doctors. Her commanding officer wanted to transfer her to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">nursing division</a>, but she responded that she only wanted serve as a combatant. The officer said he'd think it over; one hour he granted her request. Yes, she was such a bonafide badass that the military <em>literally couldn't waste her as nurse</em>. According to some sources, her subsequent career in WWI may have made her the most decorated female combatant <em>of all time</em>.
</li><li> It's common in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/21/world/asia/21gender.html?_r=1&amp;ref=world">Afghanistan<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for mothers with no sons to dress young girls as boys to escort women of the family and support the family. Mothers with no sons are often pitied, and having what looks like a boy in public improves their image. Then the "boys" suddenly have to become wives, without knowing <em>any</em> domestic skills or even how to wear a burqa...
</li><li> There have been wild rumors that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JidaiGeki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JidaiGeki">Sengoku Period</a> warlord <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UesugiKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UesugiKenshin">Uesugi Kenshin</a> was a woman masquerading as a man. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SengokuBasara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SengokuBasara">Sengoku Basara</a></em> and the live-action drama <em>F&#363;rin Kazan</em> reflect this by depicting Kenshin as apparently male but beautiful and androgynous.
</li><li> Let us not forget Hatshepsut, Egypt's female King. (And Cleopatra, for that matter, who often wore a false beard and dressed in male clothing.)
</li><li> This used to be common in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritsWithBattleships" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritsWithBattleships">Royal Navy</a>. So common that chiefs would regularly shout <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowSomeLeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowSomeLeg">Show Some Leg</a> to make sure a given sailor was male before sending him to work.
</li><li> After the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars">Battle of Trafalgar</a> a naked woman was found floating in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">wreckage</a> by sailors of HMS Pickle. They chivalrously gave her some clothes and listened to her story. She was sailing with her husband in disguise aboard the French ship Achille. When her ship caught on fire she removed her clothes and jumped overboard. She swam toward some shipwrecked clinging to a spar. When they kicked her off she floated in the water until she was picked up by the British.
</li><li> Jeanne Baret, the botanical assistant, housekeeper, and possible lover of the French naturalist Philibert Commer&ccedil;on, accompanied her master when he joined the Bougainville expedition; since women were not allowed to serve on French ships, she traveled in disguise under the name of "Jean Baret". Commer&ccedil;on pled ignorance when the deception was revealed.
</li><li> There was also half-legendary Polish student, Nawojka, who attended Jagellonian University disguised as a boy. She was discovered and removed from the university (though not charged with anything specific), but eventually went to a convent and became a teacher there. Her story was supposed to happen in early 15th century.
</li><li> Some French officers during the Napoleonic Wars, most notably Marshal Mass&eacute;na, had their mistresses dress as staff officers so that they could accompany them on their campaigns, although the disguises were often rather thin.
</li><li> In the earliest days of the Boy Scouts organization, girls who wanted to participate occasionally dressed in their brothers' clothing and came to meetings under male aliases. This largely ended when the Girl Scouts were founded, although some Sweet Polly Oliver scouts maintained the ruse long enough to finish scoutcraft projects in progress.
</li><li> Japanese has a surprisingly simple word for this, <em>dansou</em> (&#30007;&#35013;). It's also common for all-female acting troupes to have women who play boys' roles, often <em>only</em> boys' roles. In these cases, the actress may even appear as a man in public, despite being a woman, because it's "easier" for her fans to see her as a him (even if her gender is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenSecret">Open Secret</a>).
