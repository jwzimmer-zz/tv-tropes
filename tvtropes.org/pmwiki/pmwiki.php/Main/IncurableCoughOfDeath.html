</p><p>This is usually accompanied by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighPressureBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighPressureBlood">nasty amounts</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodFromTheMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodFromTheMouth">Blood from the Mouth</a> which is always a bad sign, even when there's no plausible reason for it. May also involve collapsing. The character will probably try to hide it and will usually succeed until they actually pass out. This trope is almost always carried out by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl">Ill Girl</a> or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittlestCancerPatient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittlestCancerPatient">Littlest Cancer Patient</a>. A more proactive sufferer may be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">Death Seeker</a> looking for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGoodWayToDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGoodWayToDie">A Good Way to Die</a> or an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster">Old Master</a> desperate to train <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a> before the illness takes them.
</p><p>In Western literature the trope was heavily influenced by the prevalence of tuberculosis, an infectious disease considered by many historians to be the greatest killer in human history - yes, even greater than malaria or plague. The symptoms of tuberculosis (also known as consumption, phthisis, TB, or the White Death) are identical to those of the Incurable Cough Of Death, but death would usually come far more slowly for the TB patient, at least in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Thematically, the unnamed disease tends to act <em>like</em> pneumonia or tuberculosis, even in futuristic settings where those real diseases might be cured. Other times it's a hyped up version of unfortunately very real symptoms of chronically overworked people. In general, wider knowledge of medical conditions doesn't let writers be specific without slipping up. In modern or advanced settings, the presence of a fictional tuberculosis expy is done because the real tuberculosis, while still a nasty disease, is relatively easy to detect and treat using modern medicine.
</p><p>Of course, in real life, people cough all the time from non-life-threatening causes, but those generally don't make for interesting stories. Think of this trope as the medical variant of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhov's Gun</a>: if someone coughs in the first act, they better be dead by the third. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ynst');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0ynst" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ynst');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Coincidentally, Chekhov himself died of tuberculosis, which he contracted sometime in 1884, finally succumbing to it in 1904, after a good twenty years that are widely considered his most productive period as a writer. Note that Chekhov being a doctor had little to do with his unusually long lifespan after diagnosis: before streptomycin, there was no known effective treatment or cure for TB.</span> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfConservationOfDetail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfConservationOfDetail">Law of Conservation of Detail</a> also applies.

Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOperaDisease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOperaDisease">Soap Opera Disease</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictorianNovelDisease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictorianNovelDisease">Victorian Novel Disease</a>. If the character insists that it's nothing, then it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefinitelyJustACold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefinitelyJustACold">Definitely Just a Cold</a>. The trope may also lead to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealthcareMotivation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealthcareMotivation">Healthcare Motivation</a>.
</p><p>This trope is also used for people dying of a chest wound (where it can indeed occur, either because the person's lungs are trying to cough up whatever foreign body has been pushed into them, or because blood is leaking into the respiratory tract.)
</p><p><strong>As this is a Death Trope, unmarked spoilers follow,</strong> though, really, the entire point of the trope is that the death isn't a spoiler to the viewer, so as far as <em>spoiler by definition</em> tropes go, this is one of the safer ones. In any case, you have been warned.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HayaoMiyazaki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HayaoMiyazaki">Hayao Miyazaki</a>'s mother had TB while he and his brothers were kids. She spent eight years of his childhood in and out of sanatoriums until she was cured in 1955. Since it was such a big part of his formative years, it left an impact on him and it's shown up in a couple of his works:
<ul><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MyNeighborTotoro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MyNeighborTotoro">My Neighbor Totoro</a></em>. It's never outright stated but Satsuki and Mei's mother clearly <em>is</em> in a clinic for tuberculosis but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">gets cured and sent home (after a few scares) in the end. It&#146;s based on his own childhood, after all</span>.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheWindRises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheWindRises">The Wind Rises</a></em>. Jiro&#146;s <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> wife Naoki</span> is already in advanced stages of the disease when they meet again as adults. He <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> marries her</span> despite knowing how sick she is and she dies at the end from it.
</li></ul></li><li> Souji Okita makes quite a few appearances in fiction, complete with his famous sickness. In <em>Bakumatsu Kikansetsu Irohanihoheto</em> he is a frail looking spectre of a man, who sees a ghostly cat and wastes away while reminiscing with the hero and lamenting his sad fate. Then he dies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/XxxHolic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/XxxHolic">Xxx Holic</a></em> main character Watanuki &mdash; who is also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">The Woobie</a> of the show &mdash; suffers from the dreaded blood-coughing after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> befriending a lonely ghost whose presence sadly sucks out his life energy even if she doesn't want him harm</span> in a episode arc. He does survive because another character <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kills the ghost with a spiritual arrow in order to save him</span>, but it is made clear that it would have killed him if the situation would have continued any longer.
</li><li> Hatsune Otonashi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelBeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelBeats">Angel Beats!</a></em> suffers from this.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that a pre-teen Holy Roman Empire suffered from this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodFromTheMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodFromTheMouth">Blood from the Mouth</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">Team Mom</a> Hungary is seen picking him up and carrying him around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BridalCarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BridalCarry">in her arms</a> at least once. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He died later, but is strongly implied to have sort-of being brought <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>... as Germany.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BtX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BtX">B't X</a></em>, Hokuto suffers from radiation poisoning, and is stated to have few months of life left <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He isn't planning to last that long.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>, one character seen during the "Conviction" arc is a prostitute who appears to be dying of a severe venereal disease. She claims the inside of her mouth is swelling up and her legs are covered in sores. <em>Berserk</em> being <em>Berserk</em>, we see <em>plenty</em> of her body, and none of the symptoms she describes are visible. The only symptom we do see? A nasty cough.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em> manga during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircusOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircusOfFear">circus</a> arc Ciel is dragged off to the makeshift outdoor baths by his roommate. During this time it's winter and the water the circus performers are washing up with isn't heated (it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictorianLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictorianLondon">Victorian London</a>, after all). After being soaked with the freezing water we later see Ciel coughing, eventually falling into an aggressive coughing fit that causes him to vomit. We find out that he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> suffers from asthma, a disease he inherited from his mother. The cold had aggravated it.</span> He gets better, though.
<ul><li> Well, we do see her suffering from severe vaginal bleeding as well, so it isn't <em>just</em> a cough.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> Jushiro Ukitake subverts the death aspect.. sorta, with a particularly terrible, bloody cough from an unnamed illness he's had from childhood. As a noble-ranked shinigami, he was born in the Soul Society (the afterlife), but spirits are still capable of dying and even breathe. Usually, he's either laid up in bed or his activities will be interrupted by a violent coughing fit that will lead to him coughing up blood. Fans popularly conclude he has tuberculosis but the story itself has never confirmed the nature of the disease, only that he obtained it in childhood and the shock of being diagnosed with it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedIntoStrangeness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedIntoStrangeness">turned his hair</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiseaseBleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiseaseBleach">white.</a>
<ul><li> In the Sternritter arc this is actually explained: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ukitake was going to die from a real Cough of Death, but his parents sent him to a shrine and prayed for the entity to heal him, and he did by possessing Ukitake. Of course, no one knows about that until the moment the plot needs that convenient entity. </span>
</li><li> We don't have any idea what killed Hisana Kuchiki aside from the fact it was some kind of sickness. She was unable to survive to the end of winter with it, and the anime gave her an Incurable Cough of Death to emphasise her weakening condition.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BusoRenkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BusoRenkin">Buso Renkin</a></em>: The reason that Papillon wanted to become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurHomunculiAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurHomunculiAreDifferent">humanoid homunculus</a> was due to his terminal illness, shown by him having coughing fits that would bring up quite a bit of blood. Due to the interference of his brother, however, his transformation was incomplete so that although he gained an immortal, super-human body, his illness wasn't cured like it should have been and his bloody coughing fits continued.
</li><li> Ayumi starts to do this in Episode 5 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Charlotte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Charlotte">Charlotte</a></em>, first over the phone while talking to Yu during their stakeout camping trip. Later when he's back home a few days later, she starts coughing again, and also mentions that she ran out of her pizza sauce. Double subverted, however, as while it turns out that her cough was merely a one-day cold, it does, in a very roundabout way, lead to her death. Yuu thinks she's still safe at home, but Ayumi, feeling all better, has decided to sneak out to school, where her yandere classmate's threatening her with a knife causes her to panic and accidentally trigger her special ability, Collapse. <em>This</em> kills her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade">Chrono Crusade</a></em>, Joshua Christopher suffers from this trope, until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he accepts Chrono's horn from Aion and becomes part of the antagonist organization, the Sinners.</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Clannad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Clannad">CLANNAD</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl">Ill Girl</a> Nagisa has an evidently non-lethal version of this. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Until she gives birth, which complicates things a bit.</span>
<ul><li> In <em>After Story</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> One of the first signs that her and Tomoya's daughter Ushio inherited the already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByChildbirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByChildbirth">deceased Nagisa</a>'s illness is that she beings coughing profusely. It gets nastier for both father and daughter. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">And then better.</a></span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a> R2</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a> Li Xingke has a chronic Incurable Cough Of Death that also causes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodFromTheMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodFromTheMouth">Blood from the Mouth</a> every so often when he pushes himself or his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Knightmare Frame</a> too far. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Despite having the disease, he survives to see the end of the series.

The Kim family spends most of the first act scheming their way into getting jobs for the rich Park family. Along the way they have to get rid of the rest of the household staff. By the end of the first act, the only one who&#146;s left standing is the housekeeper. Mr. Kim tells Mrs. Park that he ran into her when he went to get his annual check-up and she was telling someone on the phone that she had active TB. Mrs. Park says she didn&#146;t know people still got that in rich countries like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthKorea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthKorea">South Korea</a> but he retorts that Korea is the OECD country with the highest infection rate. He also says that he personally wouldn&#146;t want someone with such a horrible, contagious disease around his own kids. When they get home, he has his daughter float some peach fuzz in the air as the housekeeper is deathly allergic. He then follows behind her coughing fit and squirts hot sauce onto the tissue to make it look like she&#146;d coughed up blood and it gets her fired.

Needless to say, she's on her death bed within 20 minutes of screen time. In an essay about seeing this movie with his boyfriend, David Sedaris pokes fun at how this trope was used; "It might have been different had Julianne Moore suddenly started bleeding from the eyes, but coughing, in and of itself, is fairly pedestrian".

There were consumption treatments and sanitariums (though no cure, some people DID recover) in Edwardian England, especially for a woman with money. But instead she says "I need to go on pretending...until the end...". That's about as useful as "think happy thoughts and you can FLY!"

Mr. Warne's sister has to tell his fiancee Beatrix that Norman died suddenly, possibly caused by getting rained on at the train station to say goodbye to Beatrix.

<dl><dd><div class="indent">She sighed a great deal, she used to sink down on to the divans, and sometimes even faint. She would interrupt her wearisome embroidery, raising her eyes to the heavens (she was subject to strange mystical states), or let the heavy anglo-saxon novels, which she never finished, drop on to her knees. She often held a delicate batiste handkerchief to her lips, and coughed faintly. In those moments she paraded an ostentatious discretion, and a truly unbearable resignation. I kept a pitiless watch on her, and I can positively state that she never coughed the slightest drop of blood. But she had cultivated the art of languishing gracefully, and no doubt her head had been turned by romantic examples of phthisis, of homecomings from balls where you catch cold in the snow.

</li><li> In <em>The Tartar Steppe</em> by Dino Buzzati, in the first scene where Lieutenant Pietro Angustina appears, this is how readers are clued in that he's elegant, self-possessed, and ill: "Angustina had a slight fit of coughing. It seemed strange that a sound so disagreeable should proceed from such a refined young man. But he coughed with due restraint, lowering his head each time as if to indicate that he could not help it &mdash; that it was really something he had nothing to do with but which he must endure. So he transformed the cough into a kind of willful habit for others to imitate." Seventy pages later, Angustina dies an elegant and self-possessed death.

Plenty of "it's nothing!"s and "it's just a cold!" abound, and NO ONE forces him to get help until it's too late.

<ul><li> A bad nosebleed can cause blood to drip into the throat. Naturally, this causes coughing, and while obviously not fatal, it's unsettling and by no means fun. It can be even worse in the winter, when it's easier to be dehydrated <em>and</em> when it's easier to catch an illness, thanks to everyone staying indoors in close environments.
</li><li> Legendary gunfighter Doc Holliday eventually died of tuberculosis. It's said that knowing he was terminal was what made him such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">Death Seeker</a> in the first place. (Reportedly his last words were "This is funny." He'd always thought he'd die with his boots on but found himself dying in bed looking at his socks.) Accounts of his Incurable Cough Of Death can be found in the historically inaccurate (but still pretty cool) movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tombstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tombstone">Tombstone</a></em> or <a class="urllink" href="http://www.badassoftheweek.com/doc.html">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> Averted, Post-nasal drip can cause continuous coughing but by itself wouldn't likely cause death. Have fun scaring people though.
<ul><li> A rather common symptom of bronchitis, which is not normally fatal, is rusty colored or blood streaked sputum. Which unfortunately is a common sign of pretty much every ER worthy lung disease.
</li><li> It's also not entirely difficult to tear a blood vessel in your throat by coughing or vomiting and seeing blood, which doesn't have any serious consequences.
</li><li> Prolonged periods of heartburn or other ailments that cause stomach acids to go into the throat (GERD), which can result in the vocal cords making large amounts of mucus to defend itself. This results in a nasty cough that most likely will not harm you.
</li><li> A common allergy can be met with advice to "go home before you infect anyone".
</li></ul></li><li> A non-human example: If your computer's hard drive does <a class="urllink" href="http://datacent.com/hard_drive_sounds.php">strange clicking sounds<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, you can almost certainly tell that it's doomed.
</li><li> Pertussis aka Whooping Cough. It's usually only fatal to infants (which just makes it worse), but even in older kids it can cause fainting, hernias, and rib fracture. It's also very unpleasant to endure, being that the endless deep coughs can make a person <em>feel</em> like they're dying, even in mild to moderate cases.
</li><li> French playwright and actor Moli&egrave;re, who suffered from tuberculosis, is famous for having collapsed into a coughing fit while performing in the last play he wrote, ironically titled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheImaginaryInvalid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheImaginaryInvalid">The Hypochondriac</a></em> (<em>Le Malade imaginaire</em>). Despite coughing up blood, he insisted on finishing the performance. Afterward he had another fit of coughing and hemorrhaging before being taken home, where he died a few hours later.

</li><li> Composer and Pianist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FryderykChopin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FryderykChopin">Fryderyk Chopin</a> was almost as famous for his consumption as he was for his music <em>(he finally died of it at age 39)</em>.
</li><li> As mentioned in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheRoseOfVersailles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheRoseOfVersailles">The Rose of Versailles</a></em> entry above, both queen Marie Antoinette and her second son Louis Joseph had tubercolosis, with Louis Joseph dying of it (and his illness having a deep impact in the relationship between the royals and the Estates-General due the latter refusal to allow the king and queen to visit their dying son), while Marie Antoinette was executed before it reached that point.
</li><li> Cases of cystic fibrosis can cause this, due to the mucus the body produces becoming thicker and clogging the lungs and other parts of the respiratory system. Subverted by the fact that treatment for the disease is improving and life expectancy for the affected is much higher than a few decades ago.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">General Lazare Hoche</a> died of tuberculosis at 28 just a few days after he started coughing violently (and bloodily, according to some accounts). Since his death was very sudden and he was one of the most prominent French generals at that time, there was rumors that he had been, in fact, poisoned, but his autopsy did not support this.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> says the following about the voice actor <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Varney">Jim Varney<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>: During the filming of <em>Treehouse Hostage</em> in August 1998, Varney started developing a bad cough. As the cough became worse, Varney began noticing blood on his handkerchief and, after filming was complete, he went to the doctor. A chain smoker, Varney had developed lung cancer.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenrikWergeland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenrikWergeland">Henrik Wergeland</a> famously died from two-sided pneunomia that chained him to bed for 14 months. It began with a day in April 1844 when he decided to take his jacket off because the weather was bright, but his office accordingly cold (located in the old castle in Oslo). He had a fit of pneunomia, but after two weeks, he decided he was well enough to celebrate the National holiday of May 17, but his sister noticed he was "pale as death" when she saw him strolling downhill to town. After that, the illness returned, and this time, no power in the world could save him. His lungs deteriorated to a point where he passed out and died the following summer. Of course there was a lot of coughing and blood involved. Also possibly lung cancer, not very well known at the time.
</li><li> Norwegian painter Nicolai Astrup died of a similar illness in the autumn of 1928, having caught pneunomia after - believe it or not - taking off his jacket in April that year (April in Norway <em>can</em> be treacherous). Astrup got his because of a car ride, combining hot sunshine with cold airs.
</li><li> Unfortunately, it <a class="urllink" href="http://www.rawstory.com/2016/09/911-related-cancer-is-surging/">seems to be happening 9/11 first responders<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>: Their symptoms include all sorts of lung diseases, many types of cancer, and a persistent cough called the "World Trade Center Cough".
</li><li> A shorthand that some medical professionals use when assessing patients over 40 is "A persistent cough is cancer until proven otherwise." An unexplained cough that lasts longer than ~2 months can be cancer that has spread to the lungs, so the patient is usually sent for a chest X-ray to rule out that possibility.
</li><li> After the development of the antibiotic streptomycin, it was believed for a while that TB would be completely eradicated, and that this would become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedTrope">Discredited Trope</a>. However, the bacterium which causes tuberculosis quickly developed resistance to this and other antibiotics developed to treat it, mainly due to people not completing their antibiotic courses. This isn't helped by how even unresistant strains of the bacterium have some adaptations which limit the antibiotics which are effective against them, such as having a complex cell wall which many antibiotics can't penetrate. Mishandling of cases has lead to even more resistant strains developing and even some strains which seem to be completely incurable, which play this frighteningly straight.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019">COVID-19<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Starts with a cough and fever, in serious cases can lead to difficulty breathing and even death. And there is currently no cure.
<ul><li> CBS News Rome correspondent Seth Doane, who tested positive and was quarantined in his home for two weeks with a mild case, used <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/zVHvXEJwC-Q?t=34">a coughing fit of his own during an earlier report from Italy<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in keeping with this trope.
