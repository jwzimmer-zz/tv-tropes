When Kittan and his sisters show up to help the heroes, Kamina reacts with "Wait, who the hell are you?", which seems an appropriate reaction considering that the movie edited the scene where Kamina and Simon first encounter them into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TravelMontage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TravelMontage">Travel Montage</a>, making this their first real appearance in the movie. "Unintentional" because this same line is present in the original series (which devoted an entire episode to meeting Kittan), but in the Movie it's made funnier.

<ul><li> The cover page of Chapter 1 features Nami alongside Luffy and the Red Hair pirates, despite not even debuting in the manga until Chapter 8. This is because the original first chapter was supposed to feature her joining Luffy as his first crewmate, before it was rewritten to instead be exclusively Luffy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginStory">Origin Story</a>.
</li><li> During Loguetown, Usopp acquires a fresh set of goggles that become part of his standard outfit from then on, but are strangely never mentioned in dialogue. This is because originally there would've been a storyline where he had an encounter with an old rival of his father that lead to him acquiring the goggles, which was cut as Oda wanted the Straw Hats to set off for the Grand Line in Chapter 100. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">This storyline was added in for the anime.</a>
</li><li> Jimbei's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">epitaph</a> is "First Son of the Sea", a reference to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">Yakuza</a> term that can be translated as literally "Yakuza of the Sea". The title makes very little sense to be associated with Jimbei, as he has no ties to crime organisations and is one of the kindest and most heroic characters in the series, but is likely a reference to the original plan of him being a villain, with him being the Yakuza boss to Arlong's literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoanShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoanShark">Loan Shark</a>.

To make things more egregious, later issues contradicted the line by showing Scourge as part of the non-Decepticon aligned Dead Universe faction.

Pessimal</a> speculates on the nature of the lost book of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a></em>, the <em>Book of Enoch</em> (see "Mythology and Religion" below), which only exists by inference - St Paul makes approving references to a great book of a prophet of old which the believer must read. But which did not make the final cut of Biblical canon. All you get are two or three enigmatic orphaned references to a prophet called Enoch who is held to be one of the greatest and mightiest ever. Pessimal speculated that the <em>contents</em> of the Book of Enoch were such dynamite that the angel Aziraphale was charged with hiding it and ensuring humans never got to find it again. Ever. Aziraphale, who is temperamentally opposed to burning books, hides it in his library of manuscript scrolls, but ensures enough plausible forgeries <em>claiming</em> to be the Book of Enoch are released into the world to divert the wrong sorts of human minds and stop them doing anything dangerous. There is also an inference in a later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> fic that Aziraphale has thought <em>creatively</em> about this problem and has handed the Book of Enoch into the safekeeping of the Librarian of Unseen University - also opposed to book-burning and who can be relied upon to keep it both safe and "lost" - on a different world completely, thus ensuring that it remains lost on Earth and an orphaned reference <em>forever</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/QueenOfShadows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/QueenOfShadows">Queen of Shadows</a></em> has an example brought about by the original author, Nocturne no Kitsune, disappearing offline and leaving his partner Eduard Kassel to pick up the slack in writing. Early in the story, Jade finds a severed kitsune tail in a cabinet in the Queen's antechamber to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoDragons">the Generals'</a> meeting room. Apparently, Nocturne had plans for it later in the story, but failed to share them with Eduard before falling out of communication. As such, the latter has had no idea what to do with it, beyond a passing reference of Jade <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">pondering why it's there.</a>

At one point everybody sounds off after falling down a hole. For the longest time he was still there shouting "Zoltan is okay!" even after his character had been written out of the script.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Brave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Brave">Brave</a></em>, Merida was originally supposed to end up with Young MacGuffin, hence his name being a reference to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">the plot device</a>. In the final film, his name no longer has any meaning.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FinalFantasyTheSpiritsWithin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FinalFantasyTheSpiritsWithin">Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within</a></em> gives a lot of attention to Aki telling a story about extracting the fifth spirit from a little girl with a terminal illness. This girl was a supporting character called Meg, who had a much larger role, but was dropped from the script.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RankinBass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RankinBass">Rankin/Bass</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em>, the Elf King and the Dwarves argue about how the dwarves scared off a party of elves and stole their food. This happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">the book</a></em>, but they didn't add that scene to the animated film. This also leads to their very first mention being the narrated line "the Wood Elves had returned..."
</li><li> The full-length version of "Great Big World" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Hoodwinked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Hoodwinked">Hoodwinked!</a></em> contained the line "They say that goodies make the woods go 'round" and a shot of Red being carried across the river by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings">flock of birds</a>. While the general theme of pastries being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a> was kept, the exact line doesn't come up again until the climax as part of the Goodie Bandit's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSong">Villain Song</a>. In between, Red explains the importance of her delivery job by saying "woods don't go 'round by themselves", which makes little sense without the setup. The scene with the flock of birds also comes up twice later &mdash; it's the part of the song the Wolf sees from another angle in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RashomonPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RashomonPlot">his retelling of the story</a>, and the detective Nicky Flippers mentions that she was "flying a flock of birds without a permit".
</li><li> Many fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKingIISimbasPride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKingIISimbasPride">The Lion King II: Simba's Pride</a></em> noticed that Zira seems to be smiling as she falls to her death. That's because it was originally supposed to be <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoctlRyGdf8">a suicide<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>; however, that was deemed too dark. They added in Zira struggling, removed the most obvious parts of the suicide, and added screaming to make it seem like she accidentally fell. Unfortunately, they failed to change her <em>expression</em> as she fell. Though to be fair, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">it still isn't out of character for her.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LittleNemoAdventuresInSlumberland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LittleNemoAdventuresInSlumberland">Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland</a></em>, Nemo has a dream where he goes down to the pantry and sees a note on the ice box saying "You promised", before water bursts out and floods the house. Viewers watching the old VHS cut would make the connection that Nemo had just broken his promise to King Morpheus, but miss out on the double meaning because of a deleted scene while Nemo was awake where he promised his mother he'd stay out of the ice box and not eat the pie she'd baked. This was fixed in subsequent ports.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pocahontas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pocahontas">Pocahontas</a></em>:
<ul><li> The titular heroine's love of the water and hobby of canoeing originally came from a plot point where she received advice from a river spirit called Old Man River. The actor they planned to voice this character - Gregory Peck - said Pocahontas needed a motherly figure instead. Thus they created Grandmother Willow. In the film the canoeing is justified by having Grandmother Willow's tree be near the water, and Pocahontas has to row there to visit her.
</li><li> The end credits have a pop song called "If I Never Knew You" playing over them. This is in fact a cover of a song that was originally a romantic duet between Pocahontas and John Smith right after he has been captured, and a reprise would be sung in their final scene together. The tune of the song can be heard elsewhere throughout the movie's score.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRoadToElDorado" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRoadToElDorado">The Road to El Dorado</a></em>, when Tulio asks why Chel would help him and Miguel steal from her own people, she says, "You've got your reasons, and I have mine." Originally, there was going to be a scene of her almost getting sacrificed to the gods, and then escaping. This is why she is seen being chased by the guards when Tulio and Miguel first meet her. This was cut out of the film for being too dark, but was left in some promotional media, like the tie-in book on tape.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SleepingBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SleepingBeauty">Sleeping Beauty</a></em> was originally going to give the three fairies powers based off their names &#151; Flora had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenThumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenThumb">powers over plant life</a>, Fauna had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeastmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeastmaster">powers over wildlife</a> and Merryweather powers around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherManipulation">the weather</a>. These were eliminated from the final film, but are still referenced a couple of times - Flora's plan to turn Aurora into a flower, her transforming arrows into plants and the fairies' gifts to Aurora (Flora's sequence shows flower motifs, Fauna's birds and Merryweather the sun coming out from behind a cloud).
</li><li> The closing credits sequence of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tangled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tangled">Tangled</a></em> includes references to scenes that were cut from the movie, including Flynn encountering a bear and Rapunzel consulting a psychic monkey.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Up" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Up">Up</a></em>:
<ul><li> At one point, Carl unknowingly scares away Charles Muntz's dogs with the feedback from his hearing aid, which was supposed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">set up</a> Carl doing it deliberately later in the movie, but the filmmakers couldn't find a place to fit it in.
</li><li> Muntz talks about how easy it is to get lost inside the labyrinth where Kevin lives, and that you can't get out once you're inside. This was the setup for a dropped ending where Muntz follows some balloons he thinks are Kevin into the labyrinth and ends up getting trapped inside.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Zootopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Zootopia">Zootopia</a></em> features a meta example. One scene depicts various bootleg DVDs parodying Disney films. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BigHero6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BigHero6">Pig Hero 6</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WreckItRalph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WreckItRalph">Wreck-it Rhino</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Moana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Moana">Meowna</a></em>, etc. One of them is called <em>Giraffic</em>. This was a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductionForeshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductionForeshadowing">Production Foreshadowing</a>, however, one year later <em>Gigantic</em> was officially cancelled. This means the reference doesn't make any sense to people who aren't knowledgeable about Disney history, because the film it parodies never came out.
<ul><li> One of Judy's childhood friends is a cougar named Bobby Catmull. Kind of an odd name for a cougar right? That's because he was originally going to be a bobcat, but the animators didn't have enough time to build a bobcat model, so he was changed to a cougar.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheHunchbackOfNotreDame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheHunchbackOfNotreDame">The Hunchback of Notre Dame</a></em>, similar to <em>Pocahontas</em> and <em>The Muppet Christmas Carol</em>, used a pop version of "Someday", one of the three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutSong">cut songs</a> replaced by "God Help The Outcasts", for its end credits. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheHunchbackOfNotreDame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheHunchbackOfNotreDame">stage musical</a> reinstated "Someday", albeit in a grimmer context, being sung by Esmeralda just before her execution.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanBeauty">American Beauty</a></em> opens with a home movie of Ricky asking Jane if she wants him to kill her father, to which she replies yes. We see the full scene later in the film and it turns out they're just being sarcastic. But this is a remnant of a large subplot that was filmed and cut. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The video would incriminate Jane and Ricky for Lester's murder</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScottPilgrimVsTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScottPilgrimVsTheWorld">Scott Pilgrim vs. The World</a></em> has some milder ones:
<ul><li> "Is that seriously the end of the story?" &mdash; Originally, this was Kim's response to Scott's flashback about how he met Knives on the bus (she dropped her books, he picked them up), later echoed by Ramona when she hears it from Knives. The flashback scene was cut in the final version.
</li><li> In an early, discarded version of Scott and Ramona's first date, Ramona was seen lighting a cigarette, saying she smokes only on special occasions. Scott was supposed to be echoing her after his battle with Roxy, when he says he only drinks on special occasions.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSixthSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSixthSense">The Sixth Sense</a></em>, when the protagonist realizes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's a ghost</span>, there is an echo of the boy saying "I see people". The line "I see people" was not used in the final cut (he only says "I see dead people").
</li><li> Several in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Monkeybone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Monkeybone">Monkeybone</a></em>.
<ul><li> Harry Knowles of Ain't It Cool News has two cameos as a next-door neighbor, wearing shirts that said "Lucky" and "Stiff"; one of the cameos was cut.
</li><li> The stain on Stu's Grim Reaper costume is explained from a deleted scene, that showed him stealing it.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoonies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoonies">The Goonies</a></em>, there is a <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/9qWt0S85S1I?t=10s">deleted scene<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> with an octopus. At the end of the film Data says "The octopus was scary!" while he's being interviewed, despite the fact it was cut. The octopus scene is included in the TV version of the movie, however.
</li><li> An example of this trope is actually in the title of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanForever">Batman Forever</a></em>. The title seems odd to many audience members until they realize it is in reference to a line of dialogue that was in a deleted scene. Though the word "forever" was used in two different dialogues:
<div class="indent"><strong>Two-Face:</strong> <em>(believed Batman was killed)</em> Farewell forever to that pointy-eared night rat! <br><br><strong>Bruce:</strong> <em>(to Chase about his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">Dark and Troubled Past</a>)</em> I fell. I fell forever.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonsLifeOfBrian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonsLifeOfBrian">Monty Python's Life of Brian</a></em> originally had a whole subplot about King Otto, who was to have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">A Nazi by Any Other Name</a>. The only mention of Otto in the finished film is when his crack suicide squad show up in the final scene.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">The Wizard of Oz</a></em>, there's a scene where the Wicked Witch is giving instructions for her flying monkeys to intercept Dorothy's party, and she says, "They'll give you no trouble, I promise you that. I've sent a little insect on ahead to take the fight out of them." This was in reference to a scene where a bug called the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jazz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jazz">Jitterbug</a> stings the main characters, and they break into a dance number, which was cut to avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionalPeriodPiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionalPeriodPiece">dating</a> the film (the jitterbug having been a popular dance in the late '30s to early '40s, but has long since been forgotten now).
<ul><li> Dorothy telling the Scarecrow "I think I'll miss you most of all" makes a bit more sense if you know about a cut subplot where Scarecrow's "real world" counterpart, Hunk, was Dorothy's close friend and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedLoveInterest">Implied Love Interest</a>. Both subplots are described <a class="urllink" href="http://www.thewizardofozmovie.com/production.html">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> One of the Kansas scenes also has Aunt Em making reference to Hickory "tinkering on that contraption", referencing a wind machine he was working on in another scene that got cut.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Suspiria1977" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Suspiria1977">Suspiria (1977)</a></em> was originally planned to have twelve-year-old girls as the protagonists, but changed them to twenty-somethings to avoid being banned. The script was not changed, leading to...
<ul><li> When Olga is introduced, she childishly says that Suzie and Sara have the "names of snakes" and sticks her tongue out. Sara follows suit.
</li><li> Suzie prefers to rent a room at Olga's rather than stay at the school, because she doesn't want to feel "like a kid" at boarding school. You'd be hard pressed to find a twenty-something student who'd <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">pass up a free room in the name of maturity</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhoFramedRogerRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhoFramedRogerRabbit">Who Framed Roger Rabbit</a></em>:
<ul><li> Eddie scolds Roger for dancing for the bar patrons and potentially blowing his cover while "I'm out there risking my neck out for you." It's a fairly generic line, except that the immediate events don't warrant it; Eddie went from leaving Roger in the hidden room at the bar straight to his office, where he meets Jessica, and then back out to find Roger dancing. The line makes more sense when one considers the deleted scene (included in the comic version) that would have followed Roger's drop-off, where Eddie is caught snooping in Jessica's dressing room by Judge Doom and is sent to Toontown, where he is given a "tooneroo", a toon pig painted on top of his head. He goes back to his office to wash it off, which then segues to his encounter with Jessica.
</li><li> An early draft of the scripted included an extra scene where Eddie visits Marvin Acme's funeral, which would feature more animated cameos. Then, Eddie would be spying on a private conversation between R.K. Maroon and Judge Doom, which further raised Eddie's suspicions of the former's involvement and led to him snooping into Jessica's dressing room.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekGenerations">Star Trek: Generations</a></em> had baddie Soran make a hammier than usual remark about Geordi's heart just not being in a conversation. Which made no sense on its own, but referred to a cut scene that involved him torturing Geordi by repeatedly stopping his heart. You can see the cut scene <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/kI3U18GnwT8">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. It also has Dr. Crusher saying "I removed the nanoprobe" (that Soran used to stop Geordi's heart), leaving the audience to wonder "<em>what</em> nanoprobe?"
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NationalTreasure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NationalTreasure">National Treasure</a></em>, there's a quick moment where one character is seen grabbing a knife. It was never <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">put to use later</a>; the production team was planning on it, but cut that element out (partly for ratings reasons).
</li><li> For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NationalTreasure2BookOfSecrets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NationalTreasure2BookOfSecrets">National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets</a></em>, they filmed a scene in which the bad guy stabs the protagonist's father; however, they took this out because they felt it crossed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> and undermined his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathEqualsRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathEqualsRedemption">Death Equals Redemption</a> moment later. However, there is still a shot in the film in which the actor is acting like he's injured because they didn't re-shoot that scene.
</li><li> The song 'When Love Is Gone' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutSong">was cut from the theatrical version</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMuppetChristmasCarol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMuppetChristmasCarol">The Muppet Christmas Carol</a></em>, but several references to it still appear. Most obvious are the reprise 'When Love Is Found' and the pop song version during the closing credits. It is also prominently featured in the soundtrack's overture. This applies to the Blu-ray release too, which ported over a behind the scenes extra from the extended cut DVD showing the recording of 'When Love Is Gone', even though the song is completely absent from the Blu-ray.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheTwoTowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheTwoTowers">The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</a></em>, Faramir's lines "A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to prove his quality," and "Tell him I send a <em>mighty</em> gift" were supposed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulEcho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulEcho">Meaningful Echos</a> of what his father Denethor says to him earlier, in Osgiliath. The scene in Osgiliath was deleted, though it can be found in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Recut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Recut">Extended Version</a> of the film. Granted, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">Book</a>!Faramir <em>did</em> say the first line at about the same point in the story and Book!Denethor <em>did</em> refer to the Ring as "a mighty gift" that Boromir would not have let slip by in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheReturnOfTheKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheReturnOfTheKing">The Return of the King</a></em>, so the references are merely demoted to "shout-outs to the source".
</li><li> In the Richard Lester cut of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanII">Superman II</a></em> when Clark sees General Zod taking over the White House, Lois tells Clark "You didn't know", only for Clark to reply "He knew". Clark is referring to Jor-El telling him about the Kryptonian villains, but those scenes were removed from the Lester cut.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeMenAndABaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeMenAndABaby">Three Men and a Baby</a></em> has a deleted plot thread about Jack Holden (Ted Danson's character) appearing in a dog food commercial. This explains the cardboard standees of him that pop up in a couple spots in the final cut that <a class="urllink" href="http://www.snopes.com/movies/films/3menbaby.asp">inspired<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> a famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend">Urban Legend</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WingCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WingCommander">Wing Commander</a></em>, the Pilgrim is asked at one point about his pilgrim pendant, to which he replies that he doesn't have it anymore. The reason why he lost it is never explained in the movie. The reason for that is because a scene where he stabs a traitor with the pendant was filmed but cut from the final version of the movie.
</li><li> There's a deleted scene from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KungPowEnterTheFist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KungPowEnterTheFist">Kung Pow! Enter the Fist</a></em> where an old man writes "MOUTH" on the Chosen One's face. There's a scene or two in the final cut where this writing is still visible.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViralMarketing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViralMarketing">Viral Marketing</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan2">Iron Man 2</a></em> included a fake commercial for the Stark-Fujikawa subsidiary, which made little sense in the overall context of the film. This is because the character Rumiko Fujikawa (a Japanese businesswoman and one of Tony's love interests from the comics) was supposed to appear in the film, but was cut when the script was rewritten.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers</a></em>, Banner's line that "you could smell the crazy on [<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Loki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Loki">Loki</a>]" was supposed to set up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">Brick Joke</a> of the Hulk doing just that &mdash; Loki would use duplicates but Hulk would find the real one by his scent.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FourRooms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FourRooms">Four Rooms</a></em>, Tim Roth's character is given five warnings: "Stay clear of night clerks, kids, hookers, and married arguments" and "Keep your cock in your pants." Over the course of the film he violates each of these... except the one about the hookers. They just never show up.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note09eo7');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note09eo7" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note09eo7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There's one (alleged) hooker in the movie, but she's dead and stuffed in a mattress.</span> Other evidence (some of the animations during the opening credits, and a group of naked ladies fleeing the room at the beginning of the last segment) suggests a fifth story was cut out late in the game.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator2JudgmentDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator2JudgmentDay">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</a></em> they cut all the scenes of the T-1000's shapeshifting malfunctions before release. Only one was left in, after he neutralizes the Terminator and a single ripple of silver runs up his body, which confused audiences until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectorsCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectorsCut">Director's Cut</a> was released and explained what was going on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMen1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMen1">X-Men</a></em>:
<ul><li> At one point, Senator Kelly mentions that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JeanGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JeanGrey">Jean Grey</a> is a mutant, despite no prior indication that he knew her secret. The original script had a scene where Jean would've accidentally outed herself as a mutant in front of Kelly, which was cut just before filming was to begin. This is also why there's a deleted scene on the DVD release where Xavier scolds Jean for losing control of her powers in public, something that <em>doesn't actually happen</em> at any point in the movie.
</li><li> The official prequel comic book shows a photo of Logan with a mysterious woman that he knew before his memories were erased, and the woman in question even appears in some of his dreams. This was going to be a minor subplot in the actual movie (and was even referenced in one of the script excerpts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HughJackman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HughJackman">Hugh Jackman</a> read for his audition), but was ultimately removed from the script.
</li><li> Storm's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreMortemOneLiner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreMortemOneLiner">Pre-Mortem One-Liner</a> against Toad was meant to be the anticlimactic punchline to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> of Toad arrogantly boasting about "what happens to a toad when [x]". All of Toad's dialogue setting it up was taken out of the script, leaving us with Storm making a really weird quip out of nowhere before she blasts him with lightning.
</li></ul></li><li> X-rays of wings can be seen in Stryker's lab in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/X2XMenUnited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/X2XMenUnited">X2: X-Men United</a></em>. This is because the movie was originally going to have a subplot where Stryker would've kidnapped Angel from the Xavier Institute and forcibly transformed him into Archangel through experimentation. Though Angel was removed from the script, the X-rays were retained.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dogma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dogma">Dogma</a></em> has Cardinal Glick place an odd emphasis on God being male, considering the final cut has nobody telling him otherwise.
<ul><li> And before that, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mallrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mallrats">Mallrats</a></em> had a metric crapton of them-like when Mr. Svenning meets with some network executives about his game show, they mention "trouble (he had) at the Governor's Ball", referring back to a whole opening scene that was replaced due to running too long in focus testing (and in turn, a whole subplot that got removed); some dialogue elsewhere in the movie had to be ADR'd in post and new scenes were filmed to remove further references- but some were still left in (as were references to other, unrelated scenes that got cut).
</li><li> One deleted scene had Brodie tell a group of reporters that he's Svenning's next door neighbor, and that Svenning is a satanist. Later, in the scene where Brodie gives Svenning the tainted pretzels, Svenning sarcastically refers to Brodie as his "neighbor" in reference to this.
</li></ul></li><li> The 1995 film of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Casper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Casper">Casper</a></em> had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutSong">Cut Song</a> called "Lucky Enough to Be a Ghost", which would have ended with the Ghostly Trio hoisting Dr. Harvey up to the ceiling just as Kat walks in to ask him about having the Halloween party at Whipstaff. This explains Kat's line in the finished film about her father having "hit the ceiling" when he found out about the party. Christina Ricci does deliver the line in a dry enough way to make it non-obvious that this it's supposed to be a pun, but it's still hard to imagine the mild-mannered Dr. Harvey hitting the ceiling in a figurative sense either.
</li><li> Upon its initial release, the 1932 film <em>Rasputin and the Empress</em> featured a scene which implied that Rasputin had raped Princess Natasha, who was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed">No Celebrities Were Harmed</a> version of Princess Irina Yusupov. In 1932, the real Princess Irina Yusupov was still alive and feeling litigious. Along with her husband Felix, she sued and won, which led to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsAWorkOfFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsAWorkOfFiction">This Is a Work of Fiction</a> disclaimer. The offending scene was removed from the movie, creating a plot hole in which it's not explained why Princess Natasha changes from supporting Rasputin to being afraid of him.
</li><li> The matador scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCatInTheHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCatInTheHat">The Cat in the Hat</a></em> was the setup for a deleted verse which can be heard on the soundtrack CD and accessed on the "Deleted Scenes" feature on the DVD. It was removed and thus it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment">Big-Lipped Alligator Moment</a>.

Originally, after meeting with Biff, Marty tries to urge George to stand up for himself when a child selling peanut brittle shows up. Instead, he caves, buying all of it, with the child's father saying "See, I told you we'd only have to stop at one house."
</li><li> Also, in the first film: When Marty asks why George was not at School, the day following his encounter with "Darth Vader", George explains that he overslept. An extended version of the "Darth Vader" Scene shows that Marty chloroformed George after their conversation. This is likely the reason why George overslept.

This explains why Strickland's deputy, now wearing a Marshall's badge, arrests Buford and his gang, with the line "You're under arrest for the murder of Marshall Strickland" redubbed to "You're under arrest for robbing the Pine City stage!"

<ul><li> When Jack makes Rose "fly" at the bow, he starts singing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus">popular 1910 song</a> <em>Come Josephine In My Flying Machine</em> and she laughs. This is a throwback to a deleted scene that came after Jack brought Rose to a party in steerage. As he accompanied her back to First Class, the two were singing <em>Come Josephine</em>.
</li><li> When Cal finds Rose at the lifeboats, he is disgusted to see her in a poor chequered blanket. In a deleted scene, she got that blanket from a generous couple, after they entered the main hall in steerage. You see the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus">same steerage couple</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferredHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferredHolocaust">swimming in the freezing water</a> after the ship goes down.

</li><li> As the ship is going down, Rose can be seen sharing a look with a blonde girl also holding onto the rails. This girl Helga appears in the deleted scenes as a love interest to Fabrizio and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">Foil</a> to Rose - she would choose her family over Fabrizio to their downfall.

<ul><li> Jakoby and Darryl's first ride together has the former say that Darryl doesn't know anything about love. This is a leftover from an early draft, where Darryl was separated from his wife. In the final film, he is still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> - so the line makes no sense.
</li><li> Tikka's childlike behavior makes more sense when she was written to be a child - but aged up because a scene required her to go into a bar.
</li></ul></li><li> The first death in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FinalDestination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FinalDestination">Final Destination</a></em> featured Tod getting startled by a shadow in the mirror, and the water he slipped on in the bathroom retreating back into the toilet to make his death look like a suicide. This is left over from when all the deaths were planned this way, but the filmmakers changed their minds to have the others as accidents.
</li><li> In the climax of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Carrie1976" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Carrie1976">Carrie (1976)</a></em> boulders can be seen crashing through the ceiling of the house. This ties in with a planned opening <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMinorKidroduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMinorKidroduction">showing Carrie as a child</a> making stones rain down on the roof that was cut. Additionally the scene would have had the house getting buried by falling boulders. But the machine malfunctioned and they had to just burn the house instead. This is also why <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Carrie's grave</span> is under a pile of stones.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hook">Hook</a></em> has a scene where Peter's daughter Maggie sings a song for the pirates. This is a leftover from when the film was planned as a musical. The school play also has a song called "We Don't Wanna Grow Up".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLovelyBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLovelyBones">The Lovely Bones</a></em> originally adapted the subplot from the book where Abigail has an affair with the detective. There's a lot of chemistry between the two characters in a scene at the police station - which was clearly meant to start the subplot off. And later in the scene where Jack hugs the detective, he can be seen looking a little guilty.
</li><li> Similar to <em>Hook</em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ImitationOfLife1959" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ImitationOfLife1959">Technicolor remake of</a> <em>Imitation of Life</em> was planned as a musical - hence the plot point of Lora becoming a Broadway star instead of a businesswoman, the cameo of Mahalia Jackson singing at <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Annie's funeral</span> and Sarah Jane becoming a dancer and chorus girl instead of a waitress.

This act makes much more sense with Ridley Scott's planned ending where the character would become a nun - who traditionally cut their hair off as a symbol of giving up their old life to serve God now. But <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> wanted Balian and Sibylla to end up together at the end.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FiveHundredDaysOfSummer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FiveHundredDaysOfSummer">(500) Days of Summer</a></em> has a flashback to the teenage Summer cutting her hair.

</li><li> The film also has a couple of holdovers from when it was going to be set in the 1982.
<ul><li> The first is the family going to see <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ET" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ET">E.T.</a></em> in cinemas - and the film having a recurring significance for them (Johnny nearly bankrupts everyone getting an ET doll from a carnival, another character dying pretends he's going to his home planet like ET). The filmmakers lucked out when <em>ET</em> was re-released in 2002 to celebrate its 20th anniversary.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mateo's death from AIDS</span> given that 1982 was during the crisis, especially the film's New York setting. Given that Jim Sheridan based the film on his own experiences in New York in the 80s, it's likely a fictionalisation of someone he knew with the disease.
</li><li> A minor one is the Sullivans not knowing what trick-or-treating is when they move to New York. Halloween was never a particularly big deal in Ireland (ironically it was Irish immigrants who introduced it to America in the first place), and there wasn't much of an industry for costumes (especially in the poor economy of the 60s and 70s when the parents would have grown up) - explaining why they make their own. So in 2002 (when the movie takes place) the family not knowing about trick-or-treating is especially odd. Making their own costumes however is justified by their poverty at the start.

We never learn what this surprise was in the film. According to the notes on the Laurel &amp; Hardy Essential Collection DVD set, the script states the surprise as being a 16mm home movies projector. Back in 1933, such a device would have cost a lot of money!

<ul><li> Right before she's kidnapped by the villains, Daphne is seen running out of a building and slamming the door shut. This is because of a cut scene that took place inside the girls' locker room - where Daphne encountered a possessed Velma and several other girls. They're who she was running from.
</li><li> Shaggy knows to look for Daphne's soul in the pit after he's found Fred and Velma's. The reason is that he would originally stumble into a scene Daphne's soul being extracted from her body and a monster inhabiting it. This scene too was deleted.
</li><li> Old Man Smithers/The Luna Ghost was originally meant to be the main villain of the movie. In the finished product, he only appears in the film's prologue, but the Luna Ghost was still featured prominently on the movie poster.

</li><li> In the same film, Percy Weasley is shown restraining Harry in Dumbledore's office. The movie cut down his subplot that he got a job at the Ministry and disowned his family.

<ul><li> Season 1 gives focus to Kate's father being killed by vampires, which drives a huge wedge in between her and Angel. This was meant to be the start of a dark character arc for her in Season 3, where she would become Holtz's disciple dedicated to destroying Angel for revenge. Elisabeth Rohm however was too exhausted filming both <em>Angel</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em>, so she opted to leave in Season 2.

</li><li> In Season 5 Lindsey shows up pretending to be Doyle from the first season to act as a fake mentor to Spike. This is because Doyle was originally going to return, now as a villain, but his actor had passed away beforehand.
</li><li> In "A Hole in the World" Angel is having a phone conversation with Giles, trying to get a hold of Willow to help solve the Fred/Illyria problem. Before the show was cancelled, Willow was planned to show up in Season 6 to help separate Fred and Illyria's souls.

This is because the episode was going to start an arc with Cole falling in love with Paige instead. When both actors protested the storyline, it was dropped.

Example: in the "Superdogs/Superjocks" episode, there was a warning in "What 2 Look 4" for an obscene number of dog-puns. The subsequent edits chopped out the majority of them. (there were still some groaners, but not enough to justify a warning.)

The only problem being that this speech was never audible in the final episode, and ended up in the fast-forwarded bit. This is a bit of an edge case, though, since "Human Nature" aired years before "Twice Upon a Time" was written, and so the reference was already "orphaned" even before it was written.

In some instances, host Pat Sajak has made reference to such turns &#151; most often in the form of telling a player that a letter was already called, when the first such instance was edited out; saying that a player hit Bankrupt X amount of times; or making some comment conducive to finally uncovering a letter after several wrong ones were called, even though the home viewer only saw one or two at best.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a></em>, St. Paul refers approvingly to a work called the Book of Enoch, which he recommends to true believers as an edifying work of faith and religion which can only deepen the reader's understanding of the ways of God and His working in the world. In context, Enoch was a prophet of old Israel - there are several stray references to him in the Old Testament as one of the mighty prophets of old who was righteous in the sight of G-d and who is seen as in the next tier down from Abraham and Moses. But go to the Old Testament to look for the book which St. Paul all but says is indispensable to an understanding of faith... not a trace. Not there. Just these orphaned references to a lost prophet and a lost book of the Bible. Luckily the Ethiopian church kept some copies around (originally dismissed as fakes but confirmed as genuine when fragments were found in the Dead Sea Scrolls) so it's widely available now, although most churches don't consider it canon.
<ul><li> There is also the lost "Book of Jasher", which is mentioned in Joshua 10:13, which talks about a time when the sun stayed up longer than usual and ends with "Is it not written in the Book Of Jasher"? as a rhetorical question, implying said book would be well-known to the original audience (the ancient Israelites). Alas, nothing of the book has been found, other than what is almost certainly a forgery.

Unlike all the other 'Mechs that appeared in the source books, no reference sheet for the machine ever existed, nor could anyone actually place where the thing came from. Some argued that it was meant to be an early version of the <em>Sentinel,</em> but the <em>Sentinel</em> did not appear in any form until nearly 3 years later. Someone on the design team caught on to this mystery 'Mech and finally gave it an identity after twenty-seven years: the <em>Liberator</em> ended up being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype">Flawed Prototype</a> that suffered from such devastating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Overheating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Overheating">Overheating</a> problems that it violently exploded from an ammunition rack detonation within a minute of firing its weapons in earnest.

For example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HenryIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HenryIV">Henry IV</a></em> there's a reference to Oldcastle in the stage directions, which is the name Falstaff first had until some descendants of the real Oldcastle complained. There's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">punny</a> line that only works with the name Oldcastle.

These German characters are never seen in the play, but oddly enough, they eventually steal the Host's horses, thus providing poetic justice for the Host's earlier pranks on Caius and Evans. This detail is so odd that it is only reasonable to assume that some material was cut. Either these Germans befriended Caius and Evans, or, as many scholars theorize, they were simply Caius, Evans, and perhaps Bardolph in disguise.

In fact, it derives from one of the show's many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutSong">Cut Songs</a>, File's "Why Can't They Leave Me Alone?"
</li><li> Usually, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AnneOfGreenGables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AnneOfGreenGables">Anne of Green Gables</a></em> has Matthew sing a song called "The Words," which is reprised by his sister Marilla near the end. However, an alternate song is provided with the book for amateur productions to use as needed if they want to buy more time for a wig swap for Anne in the next scene. Productions that use "When I Say My Say" instead of "The Words" often keep the latter's reprise intact without any context to what it's supposed to be alluding to.
</li><li> Trekkie Monster from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AvenueQ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AvenueQ">Avenue Q</a></em> was originally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Trekkie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Trekkie">Trekkie</a> but this was changed to avoid copyright problems.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a></em> had a scene deleted <em>after</em> the show had been up and running for a while that resulted in this. Willy Wonka's introductory song "It Must Be Believed to Be Seen" has the lyrics "Beyond this door's a factory/Begat from just a bean". Originally, the phrase "just a bean" &mdash; referring to the humble cacao bean that serves as the first ingredient in chocolate &mdash; turned up in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpeningNarration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpeningNarration">Opening Narration</a> of the animated prologue "Creation Overture", so the lyric was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulEcho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulEcho">Meaningful Echo</a> further strengthened by the audience realizing that the offscreen narrator was actually Mr. Wonka.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Gypsy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Gypsy">Gypsy</a></em>, while most of the music and lyrics of "Rose's Turn" are based on or allude to earlier numbers, the "Momma's talking loud" section is a reference to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutSong">Cut Song</a> "Momma's Talkin' Soft".

The third <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamSequence">Dream Sequence</a> soon ensues, and Liza was originally to have defended her indecisions in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternZodiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternZodiac">Western Zodiac</a>-themed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutSong">Cut Song</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/OnTheTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/OnTheTown">On the Town</a></em>, the verse to "Lonely Town" begins with Gabey singing, "Gabey's comin', Gabey's comin' to town." Both the words and the tune of this were an ironic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a> to a song cut from the original Broadway production, though later productions have frequently reinstated it.

Wagner ultimately decided not to include a Nibelung ensemble in <em>Siegfried</em>, but this helps explain Hagen's otherwise mysterious explanation in <em>G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung</em> that the Nibelungs have become slaves to Siegfried.

In the Japanese version, forging weapons required "forging points" in addition to gold, these were obtained by selling weapons. The English version decided to remove the forging points mechanic entirely, but didn't alter this conversation.

Most players had assumed that the monster in question was weak to the Recorder, but when they used it, the monster wasn't affected. This is a case of a literal translation from the Japanese version of the game where Japanese players had to shout into the microphone on one of the Famicom's controllers in order to defeat Pols Voice, a feature that American NES controllers did not have.

The event would give players an item called the Lock Capsule, which could be transferred to BW via the Relocator, where Mr. Lock would open it, giving the player TM95 Snarl.

</li><li> Several Pok&eacute;dex entries in the first two generations reference cut elements that were removed during development. For example Ledyba is the "Five Star Pok&eacute;mon" because it originally had a star pattern on its back, Umbreon's entries mention poison because it originally was a Poison-type rather than a Dark-type, and mentions of Vulpix being born with one tail, apart from being a reference to the mythology which inspired the Pok&eacute;mon in question, were also there because Vulpix originally had a pre-evolution with three tails.
</li><li> The finalized designs for Remoraid and Octillary don't look particularly like they have anything in common besides being water creatures, and although their English names are derived from "raid" and "artillery" and Octillery's Japanese name is often romanized as Okutank (and it learns the move Octazooka), they <em>barely</em> look like they have any connection to military stuff even if you squint. The connection was far clearer at an earlier point in the design process, when they more obviously resembled a gun and a tank, respectively. The Hoppip line, meanwhile, was heavily based not only on dandelions as per their final designs, but also <em>cats</em>, explaining why Hoppip itself has some vaguely catlike traits (which its evolutions now lack) and why its Japanese name includes the word "neko".

In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64">Nintendo 64</a> port, Free Europe was replaced in this mission with the Phoenix Group, but the building still sports a "Free Europe" banner on its front colonnade.

<ul><li> When you meet Angela on Grelbin, she mentions Yeedil having "nasty orbital defenses". This was meant to tie in to a final ship level that occurred there, but in the final game the orbital defenses are nil and you can just land without hazard.

This is referenced in a room in the final level, Yeedil, that has a floor made of ice that you can melt into water with the Thermanator, killing several Protopets on it.

<ul><li> The original had an entire subplot dedicated to the architect behind the Spencer Mansion, George Trevor, which was completely scrapped from the game, though the developers left his (now nameless) tombstone to be found after defeating Yawn the Snake. His entire subplot was restored in the 2002 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube">Nintendo GameCube</a> remake.
</li><li> Similarly, numerous additional areas were all planned that weren't able to be included due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">limited disk space</a> and never actually saw the light of day. The only remnant of these was during a pre-rendered cutscene where you can catch a glimpse of the door on the entryway stairs that would have led to the graveyard which is missing in the actual game. Again, like Trevor's subplot, these areas (and then some) were restored in the remake.
</li><li> The description of the Colt Python informs you it is loaded with "magnum" rounds, implying there to be different kinds of ammunition like the Bazooka. While there <em>are</em> fully functional "Dum Dum" rounds in the game, they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> and are only accessible by hacking them into the inventory, and were meant to be slightly more powerful against zombies but weaker against other enemies. The beta and demo versions show that the Magnum originally worked like a somewhat stronger Beretta, able to kill most enemies in 2-3 shots but occasionally scoring a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> against zombies; in the final release, they simply gave the Magnum a huge buff to let it one-shot zombies from the get-go, as well anything else that isn't a boss, and dropped the dumdums for being redundant. Oddly, the 2002 remake contains the same description on the weapon, and the same fully functional but dummied-out rounds.
</li><li> There is a bed in the 2002 Remake that, when examined, informs you there are footprints that appear to pass right through it. Rumor is there was originally an escape route that came out from under the bed that was ultimately scrapped. A common <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank">Fan Wank</a> is that the mansion is riddled with secret passages only accessible by Wesker and this is one of them.

The remake expands on this by having his roars very vaguely sound like he's screaming for her, and adding gestures and body language like clutching his head that make it clear he's still somewhat conscious and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingFromTheInside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingFromTheInside">trying to resist the influence of the G-Virus</a> (you also hear roars that sound somewhat like "help me" as well).

</li><li> After the "Undertale: The Musical" sequence, calling Papyrus and Undyne will have them mention that you danced with Mettaton even though you could only walk around the stage.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a></em> episode "Tak the Hideous New Girl", we get a commercial break after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl">Tak</a> is an Irken trying to conquer the planet. Upon returning, we get <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX3kW1PI5BM">a few seconds of Zim defeating a ham demon<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. It's the kind of non-sequitur you'd expect from the show normally, but that particular gag was a reference to a scrapped B-plot from when the episode was intended to be an hour-long special.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem">Jem</a></em>:
<ul><li> In one episode, Stormer has a line that love has been hard for her. This was originally supposed to lead into a song, however the song was scrapped.
</li><li> In "Culture Clash", Pizzazz records "Surprise Surprise" in a studio and sings "Wait'll see, what's in store for you". This line isn't in the actual song. It was <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffOhFRNVqC8">originally in the song<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and exists on the mastertape, but the song was shortened in development and the line was cut.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeagueUnlimited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeagueUnlimited">Justice League Unlimited</a></em> has "To Another Shore", which was written as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Aquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Aquaman">Aquaman</a> episode initially, but had to change things up due to WB planning a TV series based on him at the time (WB had a policy of not featuring the same characters on multiple shows). They changed it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a>, due to the two having relatively close powersets and the plot hinging on them being a representative of a fantastical nation. Despite this, it's still pretty darn obvious that it was an Aquaman episode: most of the action takes place by the water, Wonder Woman is unusually aggressive and isolationist, and most importantly, there's a clear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">Captain Ersatz</a> of Aquaman's main archnemesis Black Manta, going by Devil Ray, who spends most of the episode fighting with her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo">Scooby-Doo</a></em>: Velma and Shaggy were originally intended to be brother and sister. It's why Velma has Shaggy's cough medicine with her in "What a Night for a Knight" and why Shaggy is the one carrying Velma's spare glasses in "A Decoy for a Dognapper".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS8E7LisasDateWithDensity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS8E7LisasDateWithDensity">Lisa's Date with Density</a>", when Marge is driving Lisa home, she occasionally squints out the window, the remnant of a deleted scene where she turns out to have night blindness, bad enough she can't tell whether she's on the road or not.
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsWhoShotMrBurns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsWhoShotMrBurns">Who Shot Mr. Burns? Part 1</a>", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaleModelDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaleModelDestruction">Mr. Burns stomps on scale models of Springfield landmarks</a>, saying "Take that, Bowl-A-Rama [Barney's Bowl-A-Rama]!

Take that, nuclear power plan- <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, fiddlesticks</a>.". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">The producers originally intended to have Barney Gumble be the one who shot Mr. Burns</a>, so Burns stomping on Barney's Bowl-A-Rama was meant to foreshadow this.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>: The episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS1E5AnElephantMakesLoveToAPig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS1E5AnElephantMakesLoveToAPig">An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig</a>" has a scene where Stan is lying down in a puddle of water. This is a reference to a deleted scene where his sister Shelley set him on fire and threw a bucket of water to douse the flames, only for her to repeat the process over and over again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>: Despite the Crystal Gems generally distancing themselves from humanity and getting around by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalNetwork">Warp Pad</a>, Pearl knows how to drive a car without explanation. This is a remnant from an abandoned idea where the Crystal Gems <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienAmongUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienAmongUs">would hang out among humans incognito</a>, and Pearl drove them around.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em>:
<ul><li> "It's a miracle we survived that blast," says Optimus Prime in the episode <em>The Key to Vector Sigma, Part 1</em>, in reference to an explosion that was cut from the finished episode.
</li><li> When Rodimus Prime appears to be dying in "Five Faces of Darkness, Part 2," he says to his comrades that his "time in the light is short," which Arcee remarks is what Optimus Prime said on his own deathbed... except he didn't say that. This is meant to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a> to a line from an early version of Prime's death scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformersTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformersTheMovie">The Transformers: The Movie</a></em>&mdash;it was cut from the film, but not the show.
</li><li> The episode "Starscream's Ghost" contains a number of odd lines and sequences that seem to indicate the episode was originally written to star Blitzwing, but which was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">hastily rewritten to feature the newer character Octane instead</a>. Most notably, when the eponymous specter first appears, a frightened Octane becomes stuck in a malformed state halfway between his truck and robot modes, which is consistent with Blitzwing's official bio but has no basis in Octane's. Starscream also disparagingly refers to Octane as an "older model", which works as a bit of meta humor in regards to Blitzwing (his action figure was over a year old at the time) but seems a bit inexplicable for Octane. <br>This isn't mentioning the fact that the episode is meant to follow on from the end of "Five Faces of Darkness, Part 5", which concluded with Galvatron banishing Blitzwing from his ranks (Octane even quotes this dialogue word-for-word when discussing his own banishment); the final episode references the events of the episode "Thief in the Night" instead, which had yet to air and didn't actually end with Octane leaving the Decepticons in bad faith. It all makes for some pretty significant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">Continuity Snarl</a> in a series that tended to be very light on continuity anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first season finale was meant to have a scene where the rebuilt Megatron fights the Dinobots, but it was cut for being poorly animated. The final episode still has a scene reintroducing the Dinobots in the first part and the Autobots fighting the Decepticons on their island, leaving their absence rather conspicuous.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> has a rather strange scene where Slipstream appears, mentions she's looking for Starscream, shoots Optimus Prime out of the air when she realizes he isn't him, and is never seen again. This was meant to set up a scene where she would find Starscream's body and revive it with a piece of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatingArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatingArtifact">AllSpark fragment</a>, which was cut when the crew knew for certain the third season would be the last.
