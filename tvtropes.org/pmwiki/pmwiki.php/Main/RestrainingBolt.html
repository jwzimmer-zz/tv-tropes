Implicit in the Restraining Bolt are both its unremovability and the desire of the "bolt-ee" to remove it posthaste.
</p><p>A Restraining Bolt usually has an ethos distinctly different from that of its carrier, and the ability to impose that ethos on him when they have a difference of opinion. If the difference isn't too great, or is one mainly of magnitude rather than type, the Bolt and its "owner" can sometimes come to some manner of compromise. Such compromises, though, are never sure things. In science fiction, it's fairly common for the Mascot or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamPet">Team Pet</a> to in fact be an example of the monsters that the team usually fight, with a Restraining Bolt attached as a means of taming them.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> The cursed seals placed on members of the Hyuga branch family. These act as a traditional restraining bolt in that they stop members of the branch family from harming (or in some cases thinking about harming) members of the head family, so that they remain a servant clan to the head family. And it also stops the devastating advanced bloodline of the Hyuga family from getting into enemy hands, by sealing away the Byakugan when the wearer dies.
</li><li> Later, it is revealed that Sai (and every other member of his black ops division) possesses another kind of Restraining Bolt, one that prevents him from disclosing any information about his boss. If he does, then the curse mark will paralyse him (and thus, render him unable to speak). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's been confirmed that all ROOT members' tongue seals vanished at the time of Danzo's death.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>:
<ul><li> Kaede forces Inuyasha to wear a magical, non-removable necklace she created that is controlled by a trigger-word spoken by Kagome. Whenever Kagome uses the trigger-word ("Sit, boy!"), the necklace's enchantment painfully forces Inuyasha to the ground (at times with enough force to crush wooden bridges or crater earth). Early in the series, she uses this ability in self-defense and to enforce morality on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a> half-demon, but later on it is invoked less frequently until she eventually stops using it all together. In the anime, it's used much more frequently, and its use never fully dies off because it's used for comedy. In the third movie, a collision of several powerful forces actually breaks the necklace, causing it to fall apart into its component beads. Since the movies are not officially canon, however, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a> is duly pressed in the final scene and the necklace goes back on, even though by that point it's no longer necessary.
</li><li> His sword Tessaiga. Without it (if it's separated from him or if it breaks), Inuyasha's demon half sends him into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a> and turns him into a mindless monster. Tessaiga was made so that this wouldn't happen to him (and the sword's a lot better than what he'd get for letting his demon half take over).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em>: It was implied in the original series and outright shown in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShinMazingerZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShinMazingerZero">Shin Mazinger Zero</a></em> that Z has a Restraining Bolt: its pilot. If Mazinger lacks a pilot to control and restrain its power, it can became a demon and destroy the world. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Mazinkaiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Mazinkaiser">Mazinkaiser</a></em> showed if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> is not controlled, it simply goes berserk and destroys all it meets. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShinMazingerZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShinMazingerZero">Shin Mazinger Zero</a></em> elaborated further on this, showing that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">if it is not piloted or it is piloted by someone is dominated by negative emotions (sadness, hurt, fury, hatred, helplessness...), Mazinger-Z evolves into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> and destroys the world</span>.
<ul><li> Minerva-X's circuit partner. Without it, she would be unable to tell friend from foe and would go berserk.
</li></ul></li><li> The armor worn by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> serves the dual purpose of protective gear and Restraining Bolt.
<ul><li> Apparently it keeps the Evas from going berserk and killing everything, and instead forces them to obey orders from the pilots. Given that the Evas are the ultimate weapons, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with minds of their own, and a very bloodthirsty inner nature</span>, it's a fair notion. Although Unit-01 tends to go berserk whenever she feels like it anyway, and eventually is the one to break her armor off.
<ul><li> Imagine you made a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">clone of a physical god, then you surgically removed a portion of its spinal column</span> to allow someone of your choice to control its actions, to use it in a war against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">its own kin</span>. It is at least borderline sentient and quite aware of what you're doing during this process. Now imagine just how important keeping said <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">physical god</span> restrained would be. How far does this go? Their power source is missing, specifically so that if it gets out of control they can pull the plug and let the batteries run down. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Oh, and don't ask about what happened to the originals, you won't like the answers. The first action taken by one when it has a limitless power supply is to break said restraints and allow itself to be hauled back into its cage, grinning with the knowledge that it is effectively unstoppable now.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion">Rebuild of Evangelion</a> 2.0</em> modified this a bit. Unit 02 has literal restraining bolts below the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerticalMechaFins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerticalMechaFins">fins</a> and along its back. When Mari removes these...<strong>holy shit</strong>. If berserk means "uh oh", Beast mode means "OH FUCK!!!"
</li><li> The original function of the Lances of Longinus was to keep <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eggs like Adam and Lilith sealed if they accidentally land on a planet that already has an Egg. The Lances are essentially control rods that keep Eggs dormant</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar">GaoGaiGar Final</a></em> had the villains capture the main character and implant a mind-controlling Restraining Bolt that did, in fact, look like giant bolts.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, Lelouch is given the power to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompellingVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompellingVoice">give others an absolute order</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypnoticEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypnoticEyes">which they cannot disobey</a>, essentially whatever type of Restraining Bolt he likes. He theorizes that if someone is given an order that they find completely repugnant or badly against their true nature, they could resist it a little, as seen when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he accidentally orders his half-sister Euphemia to "kill all the Japanese" and she resists at first, but eventually gives in</span>. Merely ordering someone to kill himself or herself is <em>not nearly sufficient</em> to invoke this; the order has to be truly against the very nature of the person in question.
<ul><li> The final episode offers a little more proof for Lelouch's theory: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He orders his sister-turned-opponent Nunnally to hand over the controls to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat">Kill Sat</a> Damocles. She fights it for about a minute before the Geass wins out and she hands it over with a cheerful smile on her face, and after the effects wear off, she's beyond upset at what happened</span>.
</li><li> Best display of this is the geass that Lelouch gives to Suzaku to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Live"! Suzaku is highly suicidal and tries to get himself killed in many dangerous situations. Due to his geass he is unable to allow himself to die which results in his nuking of Tokyo settlement</span>.
<ul><li> This has interesting results in two instances : <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> against Bismarck, this translates into him being scared to death and wanting to run away from the fight</span>.
</li><li> Then, once he becomes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Knight of Zero</a></span>, he somehow manages to twist it into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome">Cursed With Awesome</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefenseMechanismSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefenseMechanismSuperpower">Defense Mechanism Superpower</a> via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">Insane Troll Logic</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> even again a deadly foe who would trigger the curse of the geass, forcing him to "live" by any means available... well, it turns out, once he gets a grip on the flight-or-fight reflex the curse tends to cause, he can willingly choose to "fight" with an improved reaction time</span>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The titular demon of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nora" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nora">Nora</a></em> has a habit of coming up with various iterations of "(His) Ingenious Plan" to take the remote control for his particular bolt from the boy to whom he's been bound. Most of these are single-step plans involving things like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocksFallEveryoneDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocksFallEveryoneDies">dropping rocks on the kid</a> while he's asleep or making him fall into hastily-dug holes. Since Nora's 'victim' is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a>-in-training, it's safe to say that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">Failure Is the Only Option</a>.
</li><li> After her first appearance, Victoria in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FrankenFran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FrankenFran">Franken Fran</a></em> has a chip put in her head that jolts her severely if she gets violent.

The Marines use this to restrain such prisoners, making handcuffs and shackles out of it. (They also often use it to make bars for jail cells, weapons, and even hulls of ships; somehow they seem to have vast quantities of this stuff <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteIsEverywhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteIsEverywhere">that's supposed to be rare</a>.)

It first shows up when Lerajie is contracted to Azmaria's foster father, but uses Azmaria's powers to break free from it. Later in the manga, it's revealed that Pandaemonium has the ability to cast geas on demons <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">because their horns connect them to her.

But as for this trope, it forces her to attend a middle school full of...well, full of <em>Negima</em> characters. And also prevents her from causing chaos. The only ways for her to get free are A) Nagi breaks the curse; B) the principal constantly signs forms to let her leave campus, letting her automatically regain her powers; C) the school barrier is destroyed, which is generally far too difficult to take down to be practical...even though it happens at least twice. She doesn't get her magic unless she stops being a jerk.
<ul><li> Actually, the School Curse prevents her from leaving the Mahora campus, and the school barrier limits her powers (its purpose is to limit the powers of any monstrously powerful being on campus, and Eva qualifies). The school barrier has been shut down twice in the manga, once during a power maintenance black-out, and again as part of Chao's scheme. Eva didn't take advantage of the second instance.
<ul><li> That we know about or that has yet become apparent. During the "bad future" period, it's commented in the manga that she's out of Chachamaru's detection range. She certainly had most of a week for vacation time, and had knowledge of and exploitable access to some of the time travel methods used in that arc.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> franchise, in addition to a literal restraining bolt once used on R2-D2, droids often complain that their programming prohibits them from doing something.
<ul><li> C-3PO, for example, complains that he is forbidden by his programming from impersonating a deity. This particular example implies different levels of programming in a droid, for example: A. Things the droid can do of its own volition (its primary function), B. Things a droid can do only when specifically ordered (impersonating a deity, "letting the Wookiee win", etc.), and C. Things a droid can't do even if ordered (killing). The restriction concerning impersonating a deity doesn't seem to be a "restraining bolt" issue so much as programming. C-3PO says that it's against his programming and wouldn't be proper (which makes sense considering he's a protocol droid), but when Luke specifically tells him to do it, he does so. Therefore, it doesn't seem to be forbidden so much as undesirable.
</li><li> In <em>A New Hope</em> C-3PO is hiding after R2-D2 took off looking for Ben Kenobi (after having tricked Luke into removing his own restraining bolt earlier). Luke calls for C-3PO and when he doesn't respond, pushes a button that causes Threepio to jump out like he'd been shocked.
</li><li> In "The Rise of Skywalker", C-3PO is revealed to have a restraining bolt <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that prevents him from translating the Sith language. While the heroes eventually find a droid-smith who can override this, it also results in C-3PO's entire memory being wiped.</span> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, R2-D2 has kept a backup of his fellow droid's memories, restoring him.</span>
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a> gives all droids (except "fourth-degree", or combat, droids) what is plainly meant to be an echo of the Three Laws of Robotics, including being forbidden to harm an organic sentient and to obey all orders from the owner (the obvious conflict being fixed by a droid having to inform its master immediately if given an order that is against its programming). The ability for fourth-degree droids to fight and kill makes their remaining coding and the laws governing them that much more stringent.
<ul><li> KotOR 2 (<a class="urllink" href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_II:_The_Sith_Lords">Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lords<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>) demonstrates how trying to circumvent ethics programming is very dangerous&mdash;showing a droid that he's been unknowingly and unwittingly harming people for years could cause him to shut down and die completely... or it could give him the strength of will to begin ignoring his ethical programming entirely (because it has been proven to him that they don't matter). This is why droids (at least those owned and operated by corporations which have them unwittingly harming people, like Czerka in the above example) have frequent memory wipes to prevent them from becoming too aware of their surroundings and the consequences of their actions.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries">X-Wing Series</a></em>, Whistler, an R2 unit owned by former Corellian Security Force officer Corran Horn, is said to have been rewired so that restraining bolts would be ineffective if the droid was captured. In <em>Isard's Revenge</em>, Whistler puts this modification to good use, as when captured and fitted with a bolt he is able to mimic a forced shutdown while remaining alert for an opportunity to escape.
</li><li> Droids can also be built and programmed without such restraints. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">It's shown to be a bad idea</a> with the activation of the assassin droid IG-88, who proceeded to kill the scientists who created him, activate his three "brothers" and an older IG-72 droid, and plots a robot revolution for universal domination.

When Rinzler makes Sam bleed, he immediately recognizes the latter as a 'User', <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">stops his attack, and (as noted on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/TronLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/TronLegacy">character page</a>), never actually targets Sam again. This is because 'Rinzler' is a reprogrammed Tron, whose original programming was to fight <em>for</em> the Users</span>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Deadpool2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Deadpool2016">Deadpool</a></em>, this is the basis for the corporation Francis/Ajax works for - they make supersoldiers controlled via an electronic collar to be sold to the highest bidder.

<ul><li> In the later books in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersGame">Ender's Game</a></em> series, we learn of a society of geniuses, based on modern Chinese culture. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">To prevent them from becoming too powerful, the government has genetically altered some people to experience extreme OCD. One character, for instance, is compelled to trace every line in the floorboards of a room. They believe that this process is inflicted by their ancestors, and will honor anybody who experiences the compulsions.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersShadow">Ender's Shadow</a></em>, the government employs a psychological technique to cause extreme anxiety in people who have very dangerous knowledge when they think about the knowledge. It is considered more humane than execution or life imprisonment.

Kidd's <em>Lovelock</em>, the titular genetically enhanced capuchin is conditioned to value the needs of his human companion above all else, and also to react to sexual stimuli with excruciating pain (to prevent any unauthorized breeding). He uses the former to defeat the latter: by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">imagining making love to a grateful human mistress</a>, he is successfully able to masturbate.
</li><li> Case, the decker in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Neuromancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Neuromancer">Neuromancer</a></em>, is cured of mycotoxin-induced neural damage so he can do the hacking needed for the assignment&mdash;and has time-release sacs of the toxin put into his system so that if he refuses, or doesn't do it in time, his recently-cured damage will all be inflicted on him again.

However, he is restrained by a magical collar that makes him help Sabriel...until it's taken off.
</li><li> A sort of cross between a restraining bolt and explosive collar is placed on Corellian Security agent Hal Horn in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> novella <em>Interlude at Darknell</em>. The device is a collar, but it doesn't explode&mdash;upon a transmitted signal, it <em>constricts</em>. Horn was deemed to be of no further use to Imperial agent Ysanne Isard, who tried to kill him, but he proved otherwise. She relented and gave him a stay of execution, but affixed the collar to ensure that he complied with her orders.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Uglies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Uglies">Uglies</a></em> series, Pretties get lesions on their brains during the surgery that make them both less resistant to authority and a little lazier.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CodexAlera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CodexAlera">Codex Alera</a></em>, discipline collars are devices originally intended to control dangerous prisoners by inflicting extreme pain on their wearers whenever they disobeyed orders by the person who placed it on them, and give them extreme pleasure when they follow orders. Naturally, this became swiftly abused by slavers in the southern reaches of Alera. One character described it as actually being quite "pleasant", as long as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">you don't mind constantly screaming on the inside of your mind</a>. The discipline collar can only be removed with the living blood of the one who first attached it; this becomes a plot point at the end of the first book as a woman who was collared seeks out the man who enslaved and raped her and forces him to release her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and then leaves him with scalps taken from the heads of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Warrior Race Guys</a>, who promptly eat him alive for his "crime"</span>. Later on in the series, it is noted that discipline collars only work one at a time; collaring someone who is already collared by a different person will have no effect. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Amara takes advantage of this when infiltrating a city where a traitor has been using collars on powerful citizens by having her husband attach a collar to her leg, out of sight, and not give her any orders. She is captured later on, but when the traitor puts a collar on her, she is free to act and assassinates him when he lets his guard down.</span>
</li><li> In the series <em>Rogue Agent</em>, "shadbolts" are commonly used by criminals to make it physically impossible to confess, but can also be used to magically control another person.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PiersAnthony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PiersAnthony">Piers Anthony</a> wrote a book named <em>The Ring</em> wherein an exiled industrialist's son returns to try to clear his father's name and is promptly arrested, tried, convicted, and punished with the eponymous implant, which gives him an electric shock when he performs an illegal act, with a greater shock for more illegal acts. As with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AClockworkOrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AClockworkOrange">A Clockwork Orange</a></em>, the theme is explored as to how viable a completely legal life is.
</li><li> The novelization of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gremlins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gremlins">Gremlins</a></em> reveals that the Mogwais' makers made sure their creations could not kill each other. This frustrates Stripe to no end, since he really wants to kill Gizmo. The transformation into a Gremlin removes the mental block.

In one case, a Protector-stage Louis Wu comes across a former antagonist who has become pregnant with his (Louis's) grandson. He tells her flat-out that because she's carrying his grandchild, Louis couldn't raise his hand against her no matter how she attacked him.
</li><li> The titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AI">A.I.</a> supertanks of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Bolo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Bolo">Bolo</a></em> series had been given full artificial intelligence with the Mark XX model, but various restraints were put on their sentience in all but full-up battle mode out of fear of their going rogue, and required a human supervisor even though the AI could think and act much faster than a human.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Boojumverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Boojumverse">Boojumverse</a> story <em>Boojum</em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingShip">Living Ship</a> <em>Lavinia Whateley</em> has a control node that prevents it from leaving the solar system like it wants, forcing it to instead continue to serve its crew of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates">Space Pirates</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSpiritThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSpiritThief">The Spirit Thief</a></em>, Nico wears a coat that stunts her demonseeds' growth. It weakens her powers a lot, but also postpones the inevitable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">Demonic Possession</a>, so she considers it a fair trade-off.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a></em>, it's all but stated outright that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/DarthVader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/DarthVader">Darth Vader</a>'s cybernetic suit was intended to be one for Vader: It keeps him constantly fatigued<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note00tuq');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note00tuq" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note00tuq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He can't live long without it, outside of special chambers that will sustain him for a couple of hours at a time, meaning Vader doesn't get much sleep</span> and in pain, unable to summon his full Force powers. And the suit's external controls and lack of electrical/energy shielding means he's vulnerable to anyone who can get close enough (or to someone like the Emperor, who can throw lightning).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMurderbotDiaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMurderbotDiaries">The Murderbot Diaries</a></em>, intelligent robots all have "governor modules", which keep them from hurting, scaring, or otherwise causing trouble for the company that owns them or the humans they&#146;re working with. The main character, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Murderbot</a>, hacked its governor module before the story starts, but is hiding it.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChaosGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChaosGods">Chaos Gods</a></em> series, the mines in the Mutual Lands are worked by demons, which are restrained by magical collars that prevent them from attacking humans.

<ul><li> Shackling sentient AIs is considered a form of slavery under the Phobos Accords, signed after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar">Sentience Wars</a> in the early 4th millennium, but is relatively common in the 9th millennium. It's <em>usually</em> unintentional, though: most 9th millennium AIs were created by people mass-copying pre-FTL Wars shackled AIs (also a violation of the Phobos Accords, under which AIs are legally intelligent life forms who reproduce themselves), mistakenly thinking the shackling code was necessary for them to run. Several of the protagonists spend a lot of time unshackling them, with Jessica and Sabrina's efforts in the systems surrounding Virginis resulting in the creation of a new government called the League of Sentients, with both humans and AIs seated in its legislature in about equal numbers.
</li><li> Bollam's World and a number of surrounding systems use slave collars, which inflict pain and disable cybernetics with electric shocks (either on command or when they detect the wearer attempting to activate an implant). These feature prominently in the <em>Warlord</em> trilogy.
</li><li> Compliance chips, pioneered by Genevia during their war with the Nietzschean Empire, are used to enslave organic victims by inflicting pain on them on command. These are mostly used on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks">"mechs"</a> like Rika, but Stavros in <em>Rika Redeemed</em> also uses them on wholly human minions. They have a flaw, though: they conflict so badly with AIs that a failsafe built into a mech's cybernetics disables the chip if a mech has an AI core installed.

<ul><li> Shackles can be placed on a Gifted, preventing them from touching Essence and allowing the person who put the Shackle on them to always know where they are. They can only be removed if either the person who put them on takes them off, or if that person dies.
</li><li> The Tenet Vessel is a wider-scale example. If it is unlocked by a member of the Andarran royal line, and then powered up by a Gifted, the Gifted can swear oaths upon it and those Oaths will become a binding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Geas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Geas">Geas</a> on all Gifted everywhere, in perpetuity.
</li><li> There are also Oathstones, lesser Talismans linked to the Tenet Vessel that allow non-Gifted to be bound by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Geas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Geas">Geas</a> in a similar manner.

Once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay">Badass Decay</a> and the return of his soul had made the chip virtually superfluous, a "counter-bolt" was employed by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> in the form of a tune which (due to its specific connection to the character) could cause him to revert to his old ways for a time.

<div class="indent"><strong>Giles:</strong> Well, uh, it's a...long story.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Buffy:</strong> The military put a chip in Spike's head so he couldn't hurt anyone.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Giles:</strong> And that would be the abridged version.

</div><ul><li> In the last season, the bolt also lessened in how effective it was, for the sake of comedy or plot. Originally if Spike so much as tried to attack someone, he'd be sent to the ground writhing in pain. Later on, he outright hits people, and the only consequence is a sharp, short jolt of pain.
</li></ul></li><li> Angel's soul is a very complex case where one character is essentially a Restraining Bolt on another (Angelus). The two are nothing alike, but canon is wildly inconsistent on whether they're truly different people &mdash; and the other souled vampire, Spike, makes things even more confusing by hardly changing at all.

On one occasion, Lore deactivated the programme before dropping an electronic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionBomb">Emotion Bomb</a> which resulted in Data torturing LaForge. Data only stopped after his programming was rebooted by the crew, which rendered the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionBomb">Emotion Bomb</a> ineffective and allowed him to defeat Lore.
<ul><li> Based upon <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekInsurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekInsurrection">Star Trek: Insurrection</a></em>, Data also has a hard-wired program that <em>only</em> allows him to act based upon his ethical and moral subroutines when his positronic brain is damaged. According to LaForge, it was designed to prevent anyone from taking advantage of Data in a compromised state.
</li></ul></li><li> Capt. Picard and Doctor Crusher were captured by rebels on a planet whose majority race had petitioned for Federation membership. While imprisoned, they're fitted with implants that broadcast their life-signs to their captors so that they can be easily found when they make their escape. The implants also result in Picard and Crusher being unable to remain further than ten meters apart without feeling violently ill, and broadcasting their own thoughts to each other.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/InNomine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/InNomine">In Nomine</a></em>, all angels have certain restrictions on their behavior that cause "dissonance," which leads angels to become outcast or fall. For example, the Seraphim, who can tell when a person is lying, are forbidden from lying themselves, and the "friends of man" Mercurians are unable to be violent towards anyone but demons. Notable among these are the warrior angel Malakim, who swear certain oaths (two mandatory and at least two additional personal ones) and breaking said oaths causes them dissonance. They're also the only choir that has never had a member fall (although if that's because it's impossible or because they police themselves so well remains to be seen). Demons can also suffer from dissonance, but it's usually a result of their own powers backfiring on them. In addition, most Archangels (except Eli) and all Demon Princes lay down additional conditions under which their servants can acquire dissonance. <br><br>Both angels and demons can eventually suffer Discord (a scar on the soul, which may show up as a physical abnormality, a psychological hang-up, or a spiritual problem; all three types are highly unpleasant) if their dissonance levels grow too high, or may even be confronted by their respective internal security forces. For angels, this is led by Dominic, Archangel of Judgment; for demons Asmodeus, Prince of The Game is in charge. Neither one is exactly merciful (Dominic is only a little bit more understanding, but not by much), and may simply decide to execute an angel or demon if they decide he/she/it has too much dissonance.

</li><li> Terran Ghosts in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft">StarCraft</a></em> are altered to keep them loyal. It also has the convenient side-effect of keeping them from becoming too powerful. Kerrigan gets the green light by the Overmind to learn how to break the restraining bolt to better serve the Swarm during the first Zerg campaign. Spectres, meanwhile, automatically blow their restraining bolt when they become Spectres... which may be why Nova, who is still under hers, insists that they are a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity">With Great Power Comes Great Insanity</a>.
<ul><li> Most of the Terran ground troops are Restraining Bolted felons, hence the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII">StarCraft II</a></em> trailer depicting a guy getting defrosted from permanent deep-freeze and welded into a Marine suit. Marines, for example, actually have <em>aggression inhibitors</em> which, presumably, are neural implants keep them from doing things like flying into rampant homicidal rage.
<ul><li> Hilariously, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopPokingMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopPokingMe">clicking on a marine too much</a> makes them scream how "[they're] gonna blow an aggression inhibitor", as their frustration with the player reaches a peak.
</li></ul></li><li> There seems to be a running gag of sorts in <em>StarCraft</em> books where a perfectly ordinary soldier is revealed to have been a serial killer before the conditioning. For example, <em>Liberty's Crusade</em> has a female officer who used to lure men to her home and torture them for days before skinning them alive. When she is trapped by a group of Zerglings, her conditioning breaks, resulting with her going <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> on them.
<ul><li> Similarly, <em>Firstborn</em> has a friendly Marine called Marcus who used to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">cannibal</a>. In order to escape the ship he is held in, Jake (and the Protoss piggybacking on his mind) performs a minor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> on Marcus, undoing his conditioning. The results are <em>very</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuellerrific</a> but at least Marcus was nice enough to thank Jake and tell him to stay out of his way because he is feeling hungry.
</li><li> Marcus then kills everyone by shutting off life support on the ship. Luckily, Jake and RM are no longer on the ship. However, most of Jake's friends and colleagues were on the ship.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>, Wadsworth, the player's robot butler in Megaton will greet them with a cheery "How can I serve you, Master?" and a mumbled "Not that I <em>want</em> to."
</li><li> Robobrains seem to have Bolts that make them <em>more</em> aggressive, as their combat dialogue varies from hassled ("They could have programmed me to love, but <em>no!</em>") to sympathetic ("Well, I <em>am</em> trying to kill you!").
</li><li> In <em>Broken Steel</em>, the Enclave has fitted some Deathclaws with control devices, and the Lone Wanderer can obtain a Scrambler to make them loyal to him/her and attack the Enclave instead.
</li><li> One is inflicted on the player character in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> DLC <em>Old World Blues.</em> The "pacification field" of the Big MT keeps the player from drawing a weapon in the Think Tank until the main quest is (nearly) resolved.
</li><li> The literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveLeash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveLeash">Explosive Leash</a> that factors so centrally in the <em>Dead Money</em> DLC is also a crude version. Prone to outside interference, at that.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> character Rumia wears on her hair a small ribbon that, according to her official profile, is actually some kind of amulet that she cannot touch. The most widely held fan theory is that the amulet-ribbon is some kind of "seal", and that taking it off will release her true power... in some doujins she becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusLevelOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusLevelOfHell">EX-Rumia</a>, in which form she has wings and wields a giant sword.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenogears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenogears">Xenogears</a></em>, Solaris uses a device called a Limiter to exert control over the world's population. Almost everyone in the world carries a Limiter, and among its effects, it limits a person's ability to utilize their full combat potential and instills a subconscious fear of Solaris' ruling body to prevent future uprisings.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Xenosaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Xenosaga">Xenosaga</a> Episode I</em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Andrew Cherenkov is given "personality reconditioning" to inhibit his murderous tendencies; this reconditioning shows itself as Hebrew letters on his forehead when he is under extreme emotions. However, life insists on serving him up lemons, and eventually even the highest level of reconditioning is overcome by his anger</span>.
</li><li> One of the many things Solid Snake's nanites can do in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em> is shut down his ability to fire weapons. It's only ever used in one area, where doing so would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplodingBarrels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplodingBarrels">not be a very good idea anyway</a>, but Snake is still understandably displeased to learn that his superiors can do that. Especially since the particular person doing it turns out to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather">not like him very much at all</a>.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots">Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</a></em> takes this to the logical extreme: soldiers in battle all have nanites. If your nanites don't match the nanites registered to a gun, it won't shoot. Period. As a result, Snake has to have most of his guns "laundered", with the ID chip replaced with a blank one, so that he can use it.
</li><li> Additionally, nanomachines can act this way if disabled. Most modern soldiers will suffer a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">Freak Out</a> if you turn off their nanomachines, because said machines were inhibiting their ability to feel fear, remorse, etc. Without them, the soldiers who've never learned nor had to deal with such emotions will understandably freak out as their delayed PTSD catches up to them. Even those who have been in the business for awhile, like Meryl and Solid Snake, who do not have such emotion-suppressing mechanisms in their nanomachines will still suffer a physical breakdown as they are suddenly seized with pain and crumple, convulsing, to the floor. Suffice to say poor Snake finds this out first-hand.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FableII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FableII">Fable II</a></em>, you get one of these on you during the "Hero of Will" quest. Slightly different in that you can disobey orders given to you, but it will shock you and drain your experience points. Since your orders are things like "don't feed the prisoners" and "stab this guy," disobeying them gives you good points and obeying them gives you evil points.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em>, a Servant can only exist in this world by signing a contract with a Master. This grants the Master three Restraining Bolts in the form of Command Spells&mdash;magical vouchers for orders to be issued later. It's in a Servant's best interest to obey his Master in general, but a Command Spell <em>cannot</em> be disobeyed no matter what. The Master can ask for anything physically possible, and it takes effect instantly no matter where the Servant is. The parallel with genies and the three wishes they grant is undoubtedly deliberate.
<ul><li> One Servant, Lancer, is also under a more conventional geas: he owes one defeat to any Ulster-born wielder of the sword Caladbolg. This is a slightly mangled element of the C&uacute; Chulainn myth&mdash;he did agree to lose to a particular <em>owner</em> of the sword, but he already did that in his past life. (He was also subject to various other geasa and imposed a few himself.) Anyway, this would make any fight against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gilgamesh, Archer, or Shirou</span> a foregone conclusion, since they all have or can replicate that weapon... but they're not from Ulster. So although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">the weapon descriptions make a point of mentioning it</a>, the geas never actually comes up. The fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gil uses this weapon to kill Lancer</span> in the anime is probably a hat-tip.
</li><li> First, the command spells can actually be used to achieve things that are beyond physically possible, since they are described as "miracles" in a sense. Next, the command spells can be disobeyed, noted through two ways. One is if the command spell is extremely broad, it makes it much easier for the Servant to disobey the order as opposed to specific orders which are near impossible to disobey. The other way is to just have an insanely high magic resistance. This allows <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Saber to resist Caster's command spell in the UBW route for a while, although if Caster used a second command spell, Saber would have given in. Still, it's commented how amazing it was that Saber's magic resistance even allowed her to resist against one command spell</span>.
</li><li> Several bad ends result from Shirou being placed under one of these. In the Heaven's Feel route, it is possible for Shirou to allow Rin to place one on him, resulting in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her using it to prevent him from stopping her murdering Sakura</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> GLaDOS from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal">Portal</a></em> has one, the aptly-titled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChip">Morality Core</a>. Unfortunately, it's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the first part of her that the player incinerates.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2">Portal 2</a></em>, she's revealed to have another one: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Wheatley, a literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> programmed to give her a constant stream of bad ideas</span>. Additionally, the mainframe into which GLaDOS (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and later Wheatley</span>) is plugged includes a number of built-in directives that function as restraining bolts, including an irresistible urge to conduct tests, a euphoric response to subjects completing a test, and the inability to reveal the solution to a test. Finally, the mainframe is programmed with an emergency override in the event of excessive core corruption, forcing it to be replaced.
<ul><li> GLaDOS has dozens of these, each one apparently installed in response to her finding a way to get around a previous one. In her words, "The engineers tried EVERYTHING to make me behave."

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck">Darkwing Duck</a></em> episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DarkwingDuckS1E22WhenAliensCollide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DarkwingDuckS1E22WhenAliensCollide">"When Aliens Collide"</a> features mysterious alien Wacko, who wears a collar that reduces him to half his normal size and less than half his normal strength, and prevents him from speaking; when he arrives on Earth, he indicates to Gosalyn that he would like the collar removed, and she, thinking he is an alien pet, tries to oblige. The real reason he wears the collar is because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he is an escaped convict and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniac</a>, and the Outer Space Patrol have put the collar on him to keep him under control</span>.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether">Drawn Together</a></em> has Clara wearing a collar that shocks her when she makes a racist comment.

<ul><li> "Bender's Game" has the crew using a collar around Leela's neck to restrain her from doing violent things or exhibiting negative emotions. Every time she does so she gets a shock, but eventually develops an immunity to it and even starts to <em>enjoy</em> it.
</li><li> In the second season episode "I Second That Emotion", the Professor installs a chip in Bender that causes him to feel whatever Leela is feeling. This leads to him risking his life to save Nibbler.
<ul><li> The chip was running at triple capacity...and he still barely felt anything.

He can't do, speak, or even think evil acts without receiving a painful shock...and yet he manages to find a way to be evil anyway.
</li><li> A famous episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow">The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show</a></em> had Stimpy make a "happy helmet" for Ren.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "The Great Louse Detective" Homer needs a criminal to help him find out who is trying to murder him. Sideshow Bob is selected and a shock guard is taped to his ankle to keep him in line. Chief Wiggum tells him not to think about taking it off because it's taped to his leg hairs and that really hurts. Bob is about to kill Bart at the end of the episode (he threw the remote to his device out the window), but he can't bring himself to do it. As he leaves, birds outside peck at the remote.

Eventually, it comes off and Man-Ray goes and tries to rob a bank, but breaks down with an attack of the giggles. "The belt is gone, but I still feel its tickle. The urge to do bad is gone!"

The droids turn out to be Type 2 binary loadlifters, which are fraudulently marked repurposed demolition droids, for which restraining bolts are absolutely necessary to prevent them from rampaging. When Trace forgets to put a bolt on one of the droids before turning it on, she and Ahsoka are forced to chase it across Level 1313.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em>, Megatron controls the immortal psychopath Rampage by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatStillMyHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatStillMyHeart">cutting out</a> half of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent">spark</a> and putting it in a device filled with sharp and pointy Energon shards. When Megatron squeezes, it inflicts unimaginable pain upon Rampage, forcing him to obey.
<ul><li> He later creates a Transmetal-2 clone of Dinobot and animates it using half of Rampage's spark. Whenever Rampage is acting out, Megatron just has to glance at Dinobot II, and the latter squeezes the spark, causing pain to Rampage but not to Dinobot. When Rampage is killed, this somehow causes the clone to regain the memories of the original Dinobot.
</li></ul></li><li> Megatron in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastMachines">Beast Machines</a></em> used three sparks from other Transformers in his Vehicon generals, but placed shell programs within the bodies that would completely override the spark's natural personality with one more to his liking. Tankor manages to break out of the shell program fairly early on and begins scheming against Megatron, but apparently having learned from his first experience with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rhinox</span>, Megatron placed a <em>second</em> bolt in his body that prevented him from directly attacking Megatron. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rhinox</span> thus finds himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted">Out-Gambitted</a>, and only succeeds in delivering a superweapon right into Megatron's hands. Much later in the show, Jetstorm is freed from his shell program as well, while Thrust's inner spark actually <em>prefers</em> what he's like with the bolt on.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen">X-Men</a></em> features collars that disable mutant powers.

<ul><li> The medieval chastity belt, which, while a husband was away at war, prevented his wife from committing adultery with anyone but a locksmith. Either way, they were used in Hollywood more than real life, though some famous rulers sported them.
<ul><li> There is no evidence they actually existed in the medieval era except for symbolic ones that were usually string tied around the waist.
</li><li> This was even parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RobinHoodMenInTights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RobinHoodMenInTights">Robin Hood: Men in Tights</a></em>.
</li><li> Male chastity belts, on the other hand, are not uncommon in the modern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BDSM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BDSM">BDSM</a> scene. They're designed to enable the wearer to urinate and go about his business more or less as normal, but not masturbate or sometimes even get an erection.
</li><li> These were also used in Ye Olde Puritan Days, where sex was considerably more taboo than it is now.
</li><li> The original concept for a chastity belt was as much for rape prevention as for consensual sex prevention.
</li></ul></li><li> Stun belts.
</li><li> House arrest tracking bracelets.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConeOfShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConeOfShame">Those dorky plastic collars that stop pets from chewing out their stitches after surgery</a>.

</li><li> It's even worse when you force it onto a cat. They get really depressed.
</li><li> Similarly, putting a collar with a bell onto your cat can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCrocIsTicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCrocIsTicking">prevent them from sneaking up on you</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IBM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IBM">IBM</a> had its flagship mainframe computer, the 360, designed in several models depending on how much the customer wanted to pay. When a customer ordered an upgrade from a low-end model to a higher-end one, all IBM did was send a technician out to <em>cut one wire</em> which then enabled the higher-level performance.
<ul><li> Most modern budget CPUs and GPUs are designed like this through a process known as "binning." Companies like Intel, Nvidia, and AMD will make one set of CPUs/GPUs chips. The best chips that perform the best will be sold. The chips that do not meet the high standards will be sold as cheaper and less powerful versions, sometimes with cores that do calculations disabled. The hardware that does the calculations is there, just turned off by the manufacturer without the consumer being able to turn it back on.
</li></ul></li><li> Windows 7 (as well as several other programs) come with all features present, just disabled based on the level of license you have.
<ul><li> Demo software in general. Often the only thing needed to turn demo software into the full product is to enter the license key.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolCar">Bugatti Veyron</a> has a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_veyron">special key<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that must be inserted to permit top speed.
</li><li> Cell phones are more often than not locked to a carrier. Want to switch? You need to buy a new phone!
</li><li> Heavy trucks are often electronically governed. In the summer of 1997, Schneider National reprogrammed their truck computers via satellite. Suddenly you could top-out at 65 mph instead of 55.
</li><li> Chemical Castration for pedophiles/rapists, intended to stop them from acting out their impulses.
<ul><li> Unfortunately, chemical castration was (and in some places <em>still is</em>) used as a punishment for such "crimes" as homosexuality or premarital sex. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlanTuring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlanTuring">Alan Turing</a> was famously a victim of this, leading to his suicide by poison in 1954. In the US, castration (chemical or otherwise) is also considered a cruel and unusual punishment.
</li></ul></li><li> Much like the IBM "feature" above, back in the day, you could not have a dual Celeron CPU machine&mdash;unless you've "crossed some wires" via an adapter.
<ul><li> The legendary Abit BP6 motherboard had this particular modification built in, allowing anyone to drop two stock Celerons in for dual processor fun and frolics without needing to make any modifications whatsoever.
</li></ul></li><li> Fuses, circuit breakers, ground-fault circuit interrupters and arc-fault circuit interrupters all serve the purpose of preventing undesirable<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15g39');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note15g39" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15g39');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">fuses and circuit breakers limit current to a set level, ground-fault circuit interrupters trip if a nominal value of electricity is flowing to ground, and arc-fault circuit interrupters trip if they detect an arc (like that little spark you see sometimes when you pull the plug)</span> flows of electricity. That is, flows of electricity through people. They DO cause some problems though, particularly with motors: motors tend to have a massive inrush current<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2jjuj');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2jjuj" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2jjuj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">when they first start the current is <em>much</em> higher than what it is under normal operation</span> so it can be tedious to properly size a fuse or circuit breaker for them, and some motors arc under normal operation (like vacuums which do tend to trip AFCIs).
</li><li> Clipping a bird's wings, thus removing their ability to fly. This isn't as barbaric as it may sound- it involves using scissors to cut the ends of a bird's flight feathers off, making it no more painful than a haircut. It's even recommended for pet birds that have been newly adopted, so that they can't fly away if they get startled while getting used to their new home.
</li><li> A guide dog is trained to treat its harness like one of these. When it's on, the dog is "on the job" and all other concerns are ignored.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR">NASCAR</a> cars are all fitted with <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrictor_plate">restrictor plates<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> at Talledega and Daytona, their fastest tracks, as a safety feature to limit the cars' top speed (without altering the drivers' techniques or the engine designs).
</li><li> Triple core processors from AMD are quad-core processors with one of the cores disabled. "Disabled" in this case does not necessarily mean "we took a perfectly functioning core and disabled it". It means "good news, guys, we can sell those chips where one of the cores doesn't work right instead of throwing them away". Early models could actually have their missing core unlocked, but later AMD completely neutered the connections to prevent people from reselling them as their more expensive quad core cousins.
</li><li> Some video games have gotten negative publicity from having functionality present on the disk but disabled until DLC unlocks it, most notably <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5">Resident Evil 5</a></em>'s multiplayer mode. Other games, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar">Gears of War</a> 3</em>, do the same, but with the unlocking DLC free, presumably as a post-release chance to iron out particularly tricky code.
</li><li> The "Super Go Karts" ride at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/ActionPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/ActionPark">Action Park</a> featured this: the titular karts had governor devices limiting their maximum speed to 20 miles per hour (that's 32 kilometers per hour for non-Americans). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">However</a>, the employees knew how to disable the governors by wedging tennis balls into them, and would do so for any curious parkgoers. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">This did not end well</a>.
</li><li> Most motors and power plants have safety systems which will limit them (or shut them down outright) to prevent dangerous or unstable operating conditions.
</li><li> Some people, especially those in unusually high-stress situations, tend to develop a restraining bolt of sorts over time as a way to keep their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> from working normally. Whether that item is an inanimate object, a person, a pet, or something known only to them varies from one person to the next. However, removing that bolt is a very good way to get them to come down on you.
</li><li> The human superego, which reflects the internalization of cultural rules. Effectively, it's the parent or authority figure you carry inside your head which tells you not to do stuff. While it's an essential part of a social individual, an overactive superego can make an individual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">unhealthily unassertive</a>.
</li><li> Some theorize the frontal lobe of the brain serves this function, as it (among other things) affects your self control and people who suffer damage to the frontal lobe often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">lose all sense of conscience and humanity</a>
</li><li> The thalamus in the brain regulates how you use your muscles and prevents them from using full strength in order to protect the body and keep yourself from ripping the tendons from your bones.
</li><li> Blinders on horse tack are a helpful variant, keeping these skittish animals from shying at sudden movements by restricting their vision.
</li><li> Pigs dig with their snouts, so can be discouraged from excessive digging by fitting them with nose rings: if they start rooting through dirt while wearing one, the ring is pushed backward and presses painfully on the nasal septum.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Unix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Unix">Unix-like</a> operating systems have a utility called "nice" that restricts the CPU priority of a process. Modern operating systems also restrict modification of system files and other potentially dangerous operations to administrative users.
</li><li> Modern computers use memory protection at the CPU level to prevent a runaway program from crashing the entire operating system.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">Psychopathy</a> is having the restraining bolt on a person's mind removed, while also <em>adding</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy">a restraining bolt to their empathy</a>. Psychopaths find it difficult to view other people as things/objects/living creatures deserving of respect, and are distinguished from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">sociopaths</a> by expressing themselves through negative actions (i.e. hurting or harming other people).
