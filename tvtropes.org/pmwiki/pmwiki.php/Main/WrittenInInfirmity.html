<ul><li> Legendary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameShow">Game Show</a> host <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCullen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCullen">Bill Cullen</a> was rarely seen walking on camera. This is because of a very noticeable limp, which he got after coming down with polio as a child, and he had it for the rest of his life. To avoid the obvious, Cullen was almost always seen sitting or standing at a podium after being introduced, in lieu of him walking on stage to greet the audience and home viewers; whenever he had to walk (such as offstage), the camera usually cut quickly so viewers would not notice Cullen's limp. It has been speculated that Cullen's physical ailment was the reason why he wasn't asked to host the 1972 revival of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight">The Price Is Right</a></em>, given plans to upgrade the show and the constant walking that would have been required. And when he was a celebrity partner on various versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Pyramid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Pyramid">Pyramid</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Password" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Password">Password</a></em>, he and his celebrity opponent were shown seated at their desks with their respective contestants, instead of doing the walk-on traditional of both shows.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune">Wheel of Fortune</a></em>:
<ul><li> Host <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatSajak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatSajak">Pat Sajak</a> came down with laryngitis during a week of taping in 1996. On an episode that week, he and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovelyAssistant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovelyAssistant">Vanna White</a> traded places during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusRound">Bonus Round</a>; on another, he used hand signals throughout a round.
</li><li> Contestants who are unable to spin the wheel due to a disability are allowed to bring on a friend or family member to spin for them. Obviously, unless it's a themed week with two-player teams, the "designated spinner" is not allowed to do anything else but spin.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy">Jeopardy!</a></em>:
<ul><li> The 28th season began with host <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexTrebek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexTrebek">Alex Trebek</a> staying at his podium for the whole game, as opposed to walking out to the podiums to do the contestant interviews. This is because he tore an Achilles tendon during the summer while chasing a would-be burglar out of a hotel room. Similar accommodations happened again for the games following December 21st, 2015, due to Alex undergoing knee replacement surgery.
</li><li> Trebek has also done a few episodes with his wrist in a cast after receiving surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome.
</li><li> Season 25 had an unusual variant: contestant Priscilla Ball (who was champion on January 16, 2009) was unable to make the taping for her next episode. As a result, she was brought back as co-champion on an episode that aired in April.
</li><li> Originally, the contestants walked up to their podiums as they were introduced. However, in October 1999; there was a week where one of the contestants, Eddie Timanus, was blind since he was a toddler; requiring a number of accommodations for him, such as ditching video clues, having category cards in Braille as well as a Braille keyboard to input his name and the question and wager for Final Jeopardy and finally having the contests already at their podiums for the introductions; the last of which would be made a permanent change starting in the 2000-01 season.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHollywoodSquares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHollywoodSquares">The Hollywood Squares</a></em>: Guest celebrities who had physical ailments were invariably placed in one of the three lowest squares. This worked out for Cliff Arquette (aka Charley Weaver), the lower-lefthand celebrity during the original NBC daytime show after he suffered a stroke in 1973 and had to use a wheelchair the rest of his life.
</li><li> Drew Carey taped several episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight">The Price Is Right</a></em> in Season 37 right after receiving foot surgery. He spent these episodes walking with a cane, also coming up with various methods to keep himself off that foot whenever possible (such as the models carrying him out on the first Item Up for Bids, and/or handling props on the pricing games so he doesn't have to walk over to them). In Season 40, shoulder surgery led to him spending several episodes in a sling.
</li><li> For a few episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyFeud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyFeud">Family Feud</a></em> in 1978, host Richard Dawson wore tinted glasses after scratching his eye. (He wore the same glasses while serving as a panelist on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MatchGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MatchGame">Match Game</a></em>.) Later on, he wore a brace due to injuring his ribs in a car accident, and on one episode, asked contestant coordinator Caryn Lucas to host a question while he went to adjust the brace.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Film&nbsp;</div><div id="folder1" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The famous scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaidersOfTheLostArk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RaidersOfTheLostArk">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a></em> where Indy summarily shoots a sword-waving assailant was originally supposed to be a show-offy sword vs. whip duel &mdash; but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarrisonFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarrisonFord">Harrison Ford</a> and most of the crew were weakened from food poisoning so he suggested that he "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">just shoot the sucker</a>" and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn">Throw It In!</a>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Ford</strong>: ... the poor guy was a wonderful British stuntman who had practiced his sword skills for months in order to do this job, and was quite surprised by the idea that we would dispatch him in 5 minutes."
</div><ul><li> Interesting as it became an in-joke in the films; in the prequel, he goes to do the same thing... only to find his gun's not there. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Cue hilarity.</a> In the third one he pulls it out to try to shoot a plane... but it's out of bullets. So his father comes up with a creative solution involving an umbrella and a flock of seagulls.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarrisonFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarrisonFord">Harrison Ford</a> has a scar on his chin from a car accident, which is occasionally referenced in films:
<ul><li> For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheLastCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheLastCrusade">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a></em>, they added a scene in which young Indy uses a whip for the first time and accidentally slashes himself across the chin with it to explain Indy's scar.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WorkingGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WorkingGirl">Working Girl</a></em> has a scene explaining the origin of Harrison Ford's chin scar. He says he'd cut himself shaving.
</li><li> Richard Kimble's limp in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFugitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFugitive">The Fugitive</a></em> is due to Harrison Ford injuring his knee during filming. He postponed having it treated until filming was complete, correctly surmising that the limp would add tension to the chase scenes and heighten Kimble' s vulnerability, as well as seem perfectly logical, given all the running and jumping he was doing.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope was parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StuckOnYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StuckOnYou">Stuck on You</a></em>, where a conjoined twin wants to be an actor but his brother has stage fright. The film then shows executives trying to work around this, first by incorporating him into the environment, then by putting him in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueScreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueScreen">Blue Screen</a> suit.
</li><li> While filming a chase scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Se7en" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Se7en">Se7en</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradPitt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradPitt">Brad Pitt</a> severed a tendon in his hand and had to wear a cast. A scene was added to the film showing Mills broke his arm while pursuing John Doe.
</li><li> In the film version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/YouCantTakeItWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/YouCantTakeItWithYou">You Can't Take It with You</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LionelBarrymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LionelBarrymore">Lionel Barrymore</a>'s arthritis had worsened to the point that he performed his role on crutches, the character is said to have injured his foot. In later film roles, Barrymore performed from a wheelchair.
</li><li> Featured prominently in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Freaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Freaks">Freaks</a></em>, which would have had no point at all if it attempted to make the cast appear "normal."
</li><li> In a videotaped performance of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Cats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Cats">Cats</a></em> made in 1998, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnMills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnMills">John Mills</a> plays Gus the Theatre Cat. Mills had been nearly completely blind since 1992. This was gotten around very effectively with a younger cat guiding Gus around the stage, the actors making it look quite natural that the younger cat was hovering over and guiding the much older cat, with Mills even moving his eyes and head to fit the action.
</li><li> Happened when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HalleBerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HalleBerry">Halle Berry</a> broke her arm while filming <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gothika" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gothika">Gothika</a></em>; an injury was duly written in to explain away her plaster cast.
</li><li> Tim Meadows broke his wrist shortly before filming <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeanGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeanGirls">Mean Girls</a></em>. His cast is explained as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, treatment for which often involves wearing a wrist brace for support when doing repetitive actions such as typing. Many people just forget to take them off sometimes.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkHamill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkHamill">Mark Hamill</a> was in a car accident shortly after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em> was released, and this supposedly explains the nearly morticians-grade makeup job he received on the set of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheStarWarsHolidaySpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheStarWarsHolidaySpecial">The Star Wars Holiday Special</a></em> to try and disguise the damage to his face. He spends the first five minutes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em> with snow gear covering his face, and then a wampa smacks him, thus giving a reason why Luke has the same scars as Mark. It ended up working out quite well for the character: the injuries had completely healed by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em>, and the changes to Hamill's facial structure made him appear much more mature, just like Luke was supposed to be.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ALeagueOfTheirOwn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ALeagueOfTheirOwn">A League of Their Own</a></em>, the actresses insisted on performing their own stunts and several were injured filming the baseball scenes, with no attempt made to cover them up as it made them more realistic as having been playing for some time. In a montage, we see one player sporting a ginormous bloody bruise on her thigh that was very much real. Actress Renee Coleman said it took <em>a year</em> for it to fully go away.

This was added because Lancaster had injured his knee playing golf, but it serves to make the final scenes of the film even more tense and exciting.
</li><li> This was done in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersRevengeOfTheFallen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersRevengeOfTheFallen">Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</a></em>; since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShiaLaBeouf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShiaLaBeouf">Shia LaBeouf</a> injured his arm in a car accident during production, Sam Witwicky injured his arm after Jetfire teleported them into the desert.

One scene, shot shortly after, has Harpo, trying to kidnap two football players and getting beat up, while Chico sits in a chair and directs him.
</li><li> An in-universe one in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StateAndMain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StateAndMain">State and Main</a></em>, where the star of the film-within-a-film slices up his forehead in a car crash. It's worked in quite naturally as his character starts the film having returned from putting out a large fire.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges">The Three Stooges</a></em> faced such a situation when they were about to film <em>You Nazty Spy!</em> when Larry Fine injured his foot just before shooting and had to walk with a noticeable limp. Fortunately, this was perfect for his role as a parody of Josef Goebbels, who himself walked with a limp due to a clubfoot.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Doyle Lonnegan's</a> characteristic limp in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSting">The Sting</a></em> was the result of actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertShaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertShaw">Robert Shaw</a> spraining his ankle during rehearsal.

However, the later addition of a robot Santa meant he had to be in costume even longer than the first movie. The third film does this as well, with a good chunk of it taking place in an alternate timeline where Scott never became Santa, thus allowing Allen to stay out of costume during the duration.
</li><li> Anne Ramsey was suffering from throat cancer when she played Momma in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThrowMommaFromTheTrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThrowMommaFromTheTrain">Throw Momma from the Train</a></em>.

Parminder Nagra accidentally set the right leg of her pants (which were made of polyester) on fire as a child while helping her mother prepare dinner. Her uncle put out the flames and placed her in the bathtub to begin dousing the injury with cold water (which was good), but then made the mistake of taking her pants off (which was bad). Most of the skin of her thigh came with them, resulting in a substantial scar. The film's director Gurinder Chadha decided not to even try and mask it, instead making it part of Jess's backstory as well.

Dick (who never stands in the episode immediately after the accident) rides a wheelchair down the stairs breaking his leg. This is complicated because Dick had already sprained his ankle in season two. (Most plots revolve around the characters learning about some aspect of life on Earth, like say getting injured.)
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em>, Carlos Bernard injured his ankle playing basketball, and hence, his character Tony Almeida hurt his own ankle and started using crutches. Because a season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em> takes place over the course of a day, Tony was still using crutches long after Carlos Bernard's ankle had healed.

During the series' third season, Howard McNear, the actor who played him, suffered a major stroke, which left him unable to walk. Special accommodations were made to allow McNear to continue his role, usually by having him sit in a chair at the shop or by having him lean against an unseen stand (to make it appear he was working); although there were times his speech was slurred, McNear remained on the show as long as his health continued. Floyd the Barber makes appearances through the end of the 1966-1967 season when failing health no longer allowed McNear to continue; he died in 1969, less than a year after the final show aired.

Even still, they framed several episodes to have Angel constantly sitting in his chair or otherwise leaning against his desk just to give David a break. (Unable to stand or walk much, Boreanaz contributed by directing "Soul Purpose," his first TV director's credit.)

Most shots with Wesley showed only the non-paralyzed right half of his face.
</li><li> Although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a> maintains he wanted to kill off an "opening credits" character early in the first season from the beginning the decision for it to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Doyle</span> was made due to the actor's ongoing problems with drugs making him impossible to work with. He was going to be written into the last season (according to fifth season DVD commentaries), but due to the actor's death, the role was rewritten to bring back another fan favorite <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lindsey</span> instead, who uses the original character's name as a disguise.

The following episode, "A Distant Star", managed to work her injury into a minor plot point.
</li><li> Very naturally used in the third season. While filming a fight scene for "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BabylonFiveS03E10SeveredDreams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BabylonFiveS03E10SeveredDreams">Severed Dreams</a>" actor Jerry Doyle broke his wrist. His character, Michael Garibaldi, was originally supposed to end up with an injured <em>leg</em> from that fight. This was quickly changed to match the actor's real-life injury (and in fact, due to the shooting schedule, he does briefly appear with a "leg injury"). To give him more time to heal, he was written completely out of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BabylonFiveS03E12SicTransitVir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BabylonFiveS03E12SicTransitVir">Sic Transit Vir</a>", which wouldn't have given him a lot of screen time anyway. This, in turn, allowed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Zack Allan</a>, Garibaldi's lieutenant, to be fleshed out some.
</li><li> They also came up with an in-universe explanation for Garibaldi's hair thinning out (Jerry Doyle had been balding throughout filming) until he was bald from season four onwards: accidental exposure to exotic substances brought in by a smuggler.
</li></ul></li><li> Ander's coma/hybridization in the last half-season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica</a></em> was written in after the actor was involved in a car accident so serious that it was initially unclear whether he'd walk again.
</li><li> RJ Mitte who plays Walt Jr on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad">Breaking Bad</a></em> has Cerebral Palsy as does his character. However, Mitte's palsy is far less severe so he had to alter his speech and learn to walk with crutches.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesMarsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesMarsters">James Marsters</a> has a scar on his left eyebrow from a mugging. This was written into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> canon when his character Spike gets cut in the same spot while fighting a Chinese Slayer during the Boxer Rebellion.

After the accident, Estrada literally shot scenes from his hospital bed.

In-universe, Don Ram&oacute;n mentions that El Chavo broke his fingers last week from playing with his hammer.
</li><li> The first chief medical examiner on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCloser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCloser">The Closer</a></em>, Dr. Crippen, made several appearances in a wheelchair when actor James Avery injured his foot.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenColbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenColbert">Stephen Colbert</a> broke his wrist before an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheColbertReport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheColbertReport">The Colbert Report</a></em>, the next few weeks were full of wrist jokes like Colbert starting WristStrong, which raises awareness for wrist injuries. Colbert's character also became addicted to painkillers and started doing things like filling the empty bottle with water to make "pill juice", and crushing pills and putting the dust in his eyeballs. He even had his cast removed on air and sold it for charity. It raised $17,200. The WristStrong campaign included selling red rubber bracelets, parodying Lance Armstrong's LiveStrong bracelets. As of January 2008, WristStrong raised <a class="urllink" href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2008-01-24-colbert_N.htm">$171,525 for the Yellow Ribbon Fund.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> An unusual reversal of this trope happened in British soap opera <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet">Coronation Street</a></em>. The character Sally Webster had a storyline where she battles breast cancer. Turns out that the actress who plays her, Sally Whittaker, <em>discovered she had breast cancer as a result of researching the storyline for the role</em>. She says that she would never have noticed if the storyline hadn't been given to her, so the show effectively saved her life.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds">Criminal Minds</a></em>: Episodes in the 5th season had to be modified because two of the main actors &mdash; Shemar Moore (who plays Derek Morgan) and Matthew Gray Gubler (who plays Spencer Reid) &mdash; both suffered significant leg injuries. There was a temporary but noticeable absence of the usual Derek-in-action shots (e.g., kicking down doors, tackling suspects), while the 5th season premiere had Reid get shot in order to explain away his crutches or noticeable limp for most of the season's episodes.
</li><li> The season 8 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY">CSI: NY</a></em> episode "Crossroads" had Mac Taylor sitting down for most of his scenes. This is because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GarySinise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GarySinise">Gary Sinise</a> tore a muscle during filming shortly before.
</li><li> Horse-riding fan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KaleyCuoco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KaleyCuoco">Kaley Cuoco</a> managed to break one of her legs in a riding accident during production on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EightSimpleRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EightSimpleRules">8 Simple Rules</a></em> AND <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">The Big Bang Theory</a></em>; this is why she spends a few episodes of the former wearing a cast and why she... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsenteeActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsenteeActor">doesn't appear at all</a> in a few episodes of the latter. When she returned, she spent several episodes working at the restaurant as a bartender rather than a waitress so she wouldn't have to walk around.
</li><li> During the filming of the Polish series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CzterejPancerniIPies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CzterejPancerniIPies">Czterej pancerni i pies</a></em> (Four tank-men and a dog), one of the actors took a nap on the ground and was hit by a truck. Of course, this was a series about war, so a plot where the tank is hit was plausible enough.

The producers were quick to proclaim that they wouldn't let it interfere with their plans for the couple, and he will be back working on the show as soon as possible. Which apparently meant his character moving from the neighborhood and Susan breaking up with him over the phone.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KathrynJoosten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KathrynJoosten">Kathryn Joosten</a>'s character was given lung cancer after the actress's long-dormant cancer returned.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDeuce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDeuce">The Deuce</a></em>: Inverted with Harvey Wasserman, who is fat in the first season because actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidKrumholtz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidKrumholtz">David Krumholtz</a> had gained a large amount of weight due to the side effects of getting his thyroid removed. By the time the second season had begun filming, Krumholtz had dropped the extra weight, leaving his character suddenly rail-thin. The show wrote in that Harvey got a new girlfriend, who forced him to diet between seasons. Harvey is still whining that he wants "real food," but is also heard bragging about losing 94 lbs to colleagues at a party.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> is enough of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">Long Runner</a> that there have been multiple instances of this:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamHartnell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamHartnell">William Hartnell</a> was injured in an accident on-set during the recording of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS2E2TheDalekInvasionOfEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS2E2TheDalekInvasionOfEarth">"The Dalek Invasion of Earth"</a>, and was unable to perform in the next episode. The episode was rewritten so that the Doctor was unconscious throughout (with a filmed-from-behind extra doubling for Hartnell) and his role in the episode was divided between other characters.
</li><li> Frazer Hines' character Jamie had to be recast with actor Hamish Wilson for episode 2 of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS6E2TheMindRobber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS6E2TheMindRobber">"The Mind Robber"</a> due to Frazer Hines having contracted chickenpox. Luckily, the surreal nature of the story allowed an easy script addition (while trapped in the Land of Fiction, the Doctor has to reconstruct Jamie's face from memory but gets it wrong) and the temporary recast.
</li><li> You know how the Doctor holds the companion's hand when they have to run away from something? It all started with Jo Grant, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KatyManning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KatyManning">Katy Manning</a> needed to be guided because she's nearly blind. (At the time the kind of glasses she needed to let her walk into people and things less were extremely thick, and not what most showrunners envisioned for their characters, and her eyes can't tolerate contacts.)
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS10E1TheThreeDoctors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS10E1TheThreeDoctors">"The Three Doctors"</a>, the First Doctor only appears on a video screen, recorded at Ealing Studios (not his home as legend has it), as William Hartnell was seriously ill and at times didn't remember he'd played the Doctor. He died two years later.
</li><li> Louise Jameson hated the contact lenses she had to wear as part of playing Leela and begged the producers to spare her from them. This was accomplished in a nicely symbolic scene in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS15E1HorrorOfFangRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS15E1HorrorOfFangRock">"Horror of Fang Rock"</a> in which light from an explosion temporarily blinds her and permanently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeColorChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeColorChange">fries her eyes blue</a>.
</li><li> During the filming of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS16E2ThePiratePlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS16E2ThePiratePlanet">"The Pirate Planet"</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker">Tom Baker</a>'s lip was bitten by a dog, so in-story the Doctor hit his face on the TARDIS console. While not in the show itself, publicity shots for the serial show him making the most of the injury by wearing a sticking plaster for dark skin that stands out on his face, giving the impression of him having a funny skew-whiff mustache.
</li><li> Tom Baker became seriously unwell towards the end of his tenure, and it was physically apparent on-screen &mdash; he was visibly thinner, his skin is pale and blotchy, and his hair lost its shininess and healthy texture (and even its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyCurls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyCurls">natural curl</a> &mdash; his hair had to be permed before filming on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS18E4StateOfDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS18E4StateOfDecay">"State of Decay"</a> started and by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS18E7Logopolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS18E7Logopolis">"Logopolis"</a> it is clearly sagging). His sickly appearance and somewhat disconnected acting forced the production team to rewrite the character in a more brooding and ethereal direction, reducing his funny and more action-hero aspects in favour of making him an eerie, wizardly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">Chessmaster</a> type. In-universe, it also helped sell the concept of the Fourth Doctor - by this point the longest-surviving of the incarnations - approaching the end of his life, with the final episodes even touching on the topic of entropy.

As such, Esterhaus only appeared in the opening scenes (at "roll call") and very sporadically otherwise. After Conrad completed his last episode, shows that were filmed prior to his death depicted Sgt. Esterhaus as "away" (or sometimes, tending to other business). Only after Conrad's death was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCharacterDiedWithHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCharacterDiedWithHim">Esterhaus' death written in</a>.

</li><li> During the filming of the tenth episode of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a></em>, actor Hiroshi Fujioka (who also portrayed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/SegataSanshiro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/SegataSanshiro">Segata Sanshiro</a> in the Japanese marketing campaign for the Sega Saturn) was thrown from his motorcycle after crashing into a telephone pole, breaking both of his legs. How do you fix up the plot when your main character has just crippled himself? Easy; Create another Kamen Rider, Kamen Rider-2! This was because Fujioka did his own stunts, up to and including wearing the Kamen Rider suit. After this, however, it was required for all tokusatsu program leads to have a separate suit actor for fight scenes to prevent a problem like this from occurring again.

The scene had been rewritten to accommodate Orbach's sudden loss of voice during shooting. The voice loss came as a result of chemotherapy for cancer that eventually killed him. This was handled as Orbach's character saying he was retiring (which, considering he was sixty-nine at the time, is entirely believable).
</li><li> Due to Christian Kane's insistence on doing his own stunts whenever possible (and not always getting them right), his character on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage">Leverage</a></em> occasionally has to explain away the actor's injuries. In some cases, they don't even bother explaining, such as in "The Inside Job" where he simply shows up with a band-aid on the bridge of his nose.
<ul><li> During the opening scene of "The Stork Job" he's sporting a bruised and scraped cheek from a fall while playing football on pavement. Asked about it by one of the other characters, Eliot replies irritably, "How was I supposed to know it was a lesbian bar?"
</li><li> In another instance, Kane hit his head on the edge of a magician's trick box while filming a fight scene in an elevator for "The Top Hat Job." The gash required seventeen stitches and was worked into the later scenes of "The Two Live Crew Job" as the result of Eliot having his face bashed into some metal piping (up to that point in the episode they hid it with hats).

At the same time, Michael Landon had commissioned a five-week-long story arc where &mdash; building on the 1977-1978 finale &mdash; Walnut Grove greatly suffers the ill effects of an economic depression, prompting the Ingalls, Olesons, and Garveys to move to Winoka for a better opportunity. It was decided that, given Swenson's failing health, the character of Mr. Hanson would play a key role in the final part of the episode's story, where he suffers a massive stroke and, bedridden, bitterly concedes the death of his town and wishes for his death. All of Hanson's scenes show him either in bed or &mdash; in the final scene &mdash; walking and talking with great difficulty. His death &mdash; told as happening shortly after the events of the episode &mdash; was written in with the expectation he was not coming back. He didn't; at age 70, Swenson died of a heart condition.

The producers decided to make the second "season" a prequel miniseries featuring the characters other than Spartacus, framed with earlier footage from the final moments of the first season to give themselves time to try to figure out what to do. When Whitfield's cancer recurred, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">recast</a> the role with Liam McIntyre, with Whitfield's blessing (he died before the third season was broadcast).

It turns out that Jaffe was hospitalized after he had suffered a stroke at the airport on the way to said meeting. When Guillaume returned to filming, Jaffe's storyline dealt with how having the stroke had affected his life.

</li><li> Garak suffered from acute claustrophobia. This is because his actor Andrew J. Robinson suffered from the condition to such a degree that even wearing the Cardassian make-up could be a trial for him. In one two-part episode, Garak spends much of the plot inside a cramped space: unsurprisingly, it's also the episode that reveals he suffers from claustrophobia (although the condition had been hinted at earlier points in the show).

There was even a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> on the subject &mdash; in a later episode, an irate Kira tells Bashir that her situation is his fault.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GillianAnderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GillianAnderson">Gillian Anderson</a>'s maternity leave took the form of Scully being abducted by shadowy government forces (or aliens, or some combination of both, depending on which back story is more convenient for the episode you're currently watching), an event that completely reshaped the future of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NorthernExposure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NorthernExposure">Northern Exposure</a></em>, Shelly's pregnancy and the birth of her daughter were written in because of Cynthia Geary's real-world pregnancy. (Hard to hide since, as in many examples on the page, Geary was conventionally small and skinny as a Hollywood actress and hence her pregnancy was extremely noticeable.)
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em>, Jane Leeves' first pregnancy (in 2000) could not be worked into the plot, as it happened at the very beginning of her long-awaited relationship with Niles. Instead, the writers created a plot about her gaining weight uncontrollably and taking a sabbatical at a health retreat to combat the problem.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note25w2v');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note25w2v" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note25w2v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Much like the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>, this was given a major lampshade hanging &mdash; the day Leeves gave birth, the cast was filming at the NBC lot. The writers wrote into the script a call from Daphne to Niles, with him announcing that her stay at the fat camp was paying off &mdash; she'd already lost 9 pounds 3 ounces (or something, whatever it was, it was a code to the audience about the baby having been born)</span> Her second pregnancy (in 2003) was however written into the plot, as her character Daphne gave birth in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>.
</li><li> Meredith Baxter Birney's pregnancy was written into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyTies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyTies">Family Ties</a></em> but she still had to take several episodes off. The excuse provided for Elyse's mysterious absence was her doctor had ordered to stay off her feet. The producers tried several approaches for distracting viewers from her absence, including bringing on <a class="urllink" href="http://www.agonybooth.com/agonizer/Family_Ties/Help_Wanted.aspx">Geena Davis<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for a two-episode run.
</li><li> Due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharismaCarpenter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharismaCarpenter">Charisma Carpenter</a>'s pregnancy, her character Cordelia was mystically impregnated (for the second time!) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em>'s fourth season. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And was turned evil, put on a bus, and killed off for real. Ouch</span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a> really went above and beyond on this.

</li><li> <em>Earth 2</em>'s final episode saw Devon Adair (Debrah Farentino) collapsing from an unknown illness and being put into cold-sleep until a cure could be developed. Meanwhile, Farentino was pregnant.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferGarner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferGarner">Jennifer Garner</a> got pregnant, her character on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alias" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alias">Alias</a></em> did the same, with the result that Sydney's action scenes had to be cut considerably.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>:
<ul><li> Amanda Tapping (Lt. Col. Samantha Carter), was either pregnant or had recently given birth at the beginning of the show's ninth season, and so the character was reassigned to work at Area 51 and not the SGC. It's hard to think of a good reason for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CartwrightCurse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CartwrightCurse">"Black Widow" Carter</a> getting pregnant.
</li><li> Vaitiare Bandera, who played Sha're, Daniel's wife, in the first few seasons of the show, was heavily pregnant with Michael Shanks' child when it came time to bring the character back. The writers managed to turn the child into a huge plot point for the next couple of seasons.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClaudiaBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClaudiaBlack">Claudia Black</a> (Vala Mal Doran) also got pregnant around the time of the end of the same season, but it was an unintentional subversion of the trope: they were already planning on a story that involved her getting pregnant so they were happy they wouldn't have to use special effects for it. The character's daughter is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfanteTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfanteTerrible">very, very evil</a>. However, she got pregnant with her second child just before filming began for the last SG-1 movie <em>Continuum</em>, which the writers had <em>not</em> anticipated. They had to resort to things like having her wear an outsized camouflage jacket and carry a big sci-fi gun in her first scene, to having her sitting and with things obstructing the camera's view of her stomach in most of her other scenes. Since she was actually near the end of her second trimester, neither approach really worked and it's still very noticeable.
</li><li> And in Season 10, Michael Shanks was the cause of this happening a <em>second</em> time, when his new wife Lexa Doig (who played Dr. Lam) got pregnant with their first child. In this case, Doig was pretty much written out of the show with no explanation.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>, Rachel Luttrell (Teyla Emmagan) became pregnant too. This also got written into the plot and involved her character getting pregnant via her unseen boyfriend and then her later kidnapping by Michael, a Wraith that the Atlantis team made somewhat human against his will. After he was born, Michael kept trying to kidnap them, turning her into a woman in distress instead of her previous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Until she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyVillainDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyVillainDeath">kicked his sorry ass off of the central tower of Atlantis</a> and earned her label back.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren">Married... with Children</a></em>, Katey Sagal, the actress who played Peg, became pregnant, and the show's writers worked it into the storyline by making Peg pregnant, much to Al's chagrin. Most of the plot lines of the sixth season centered around the pregnancy, until Sagal's tragic miscarriage forced the producers to backtrack. The pregnancy was explained as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">a dream Al had</a>. The second time Sagal became pregnant, the writers had Peg return to Wanker County to try and reunite her divorced parents, and then set out to find her missing father. When Peg did appear, she was shown sitting in the backseat of a limousine or talking to her family on the phone, or other situations that filmed only the top half of Sagal's body. When Sagal was ready to return to work (thankfully, her pregnancy was successful this time), an entire episode was dedicated to Peg's return.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarciaCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarciaCross">Marcia Cross</a> had to leave <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DesperateHousewives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DesperateHousewives">Desperate Housewives</a></em> during the third season after becoming pregnant with twins and being put on bed rest. This was explained as her character Bree and her new husband finally taking their honeymoon, which had been delayed by the husband's being suspected in a murder case, the major story arc of the season. This meant the writers had to wrap up that mystery earlier than planned, basically leaving them to stumble through the rest of the season without any kind of ongoing story. Rather amusingly, Cross was able to return, with Bree revealed to be pregnant and Cross wearing a prosthetic. At the end of the episode, it was revealed that Bree was wearing one too, as she was covering for her knocked up teenage daughter. Cross had said in interviews that she would love for her pregnancy to be worked into the show, as the storyline with Bree's daughter had already been planned so they would just need to change the person, but the writers decided against it.
</li><li> Anna Belknap was pregnant during Season 3 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY">CSI: NY</a></em>, so the writers gave her emotional problems so that she could put her relationship with Danny on hold and leave every crime scene &mdash; Lindsey couldn't deal with distraught mothers because 3 of her friends had been shot 10 years ago and she survived. (She mostly stayed in the lab where all shots could be head and shoulders or behind a table.) She then left for 4 episodes to testify in the trial of a guy they caught for it. When she became pregnant for a second time, it was written into the show as Lindsey being pregnant with lover Danny Messer's baby, eventually leading to their marriage and the birth of their daughter Lucy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em>: When Mariska Hargitay got pregnant, Olivia was sent undercover with a green protest group while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporarySubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporarySubstitute">Temporary Substitute</a> Dani Beck (played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConnieNielsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConnieNielsen">Connie Nielsen</a>) showed up to cover for her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderCriminalIntent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderCriminalIntent">Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent</a></em> had Alexandra Eames get pregnant at the same time Kathryn Erbe was. The storyline was that Eames was having a surrogate child for her sister. Another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporarySubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporarySubstitute">Temporary Substitute</a>, G. Lynn Bishop, was brought in, but unlike Beck, no attempt was made to give her any meaning. It almost seemed like they were writing her to intentionally be disliked, in part because Eames is Goren's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingEmotionalCrutch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingEmotionalCrutch">Living Emotional Crutch</a>; it was a plot point that he was missing her terribly.
</li><li> Hilariously lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNanny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNanny">The Nanny</a></em> when co-star Lauren Lane became pregnant. As there was no realistic way to work in a pregnancy with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessSuitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessSuitor">CC</a>, the actors and directors simply ignored it completely and utilized increasingly overt and bizarre ways to "cover" her pregnancy as it advanced (insanely huge bunches of flowers, co-stars standing in front of her with vases, etc). Lampshaded and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in one scene where CC is talking about this trope, mocking how TV shows, like the aforementioned <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em>, try to cover it up by hiding the actress behind huge props, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">while holding a huge purse in front of her, then picking up a large plant--"This needs some water."</a> They then explained CC's absence during Lauren Lane's maternity leave by showing CC going insane and being institutionalized.
</li><li> Similarly, during Dianne Farr's first pregnancy on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NUMB3RS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NUMB3RS">NUMB3RS</a>,</em> they simply hid it for as long as possible. This was referred to by one recapper as using "pregnancy folders" and later "pregnancy furniture."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlysonHannigan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlysonHannigan">Alyson Hannigan</a>'s pregnancy was handled quite efficiently. Barney tells her a (supposedly) mind-bogglingly dirty joke... "And we didn't see Lily for four weeks." She did film a scene late in her pregnancy... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalloonBelly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalloonBelly">of Lily winning an eating contest</a>. When she became pregnant again, Lily had also become pregnant shortly before, so there was no need to hide it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CobieSmulders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CobieSmulders">Cobie Smulders</a> alias Robin Sherbatsky was pregnant at that time too, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">putting the only two lead actresses on the bus would be a little suspicious.</a> Also, Smulders, unlike Hannigan, is very tall, so keeping Robin in the booth as much as possible and dressing her in suit jackets proved sufficient to keep her bump from being obvious. They went through the same hoop-jumping with Lily (having her holding large objects or playing the guitar for her students on many occasions) but teeny-tiny Alyson Hannigan blew up to the size of a house (which is quite hard to miss in "The Front Porch") and evidently, they gave up.
</li></ul></li><li> Poppy Montgomery of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WithoutATrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WithoutATrace">Without a Trace</a></em> was a trickier example than most since her character Sam not only was not in a relationship but was implied to be more or less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarriedToTheJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarriedToTheJob">Married to the Job</a>. Utterly fearless, the writers had Sam conceive from a one-night stand with a bartender, and for the last two seasons of the show, the plot was wrung for drama and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a>.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne">Roseanne</a></em> actress Laurie Metcalf became pregnant, it was originally going to be covered up. Jackie's clothes got looser and looser (which was a huge tip-off as she usually wore form-fitting outfits) and she always seemed to show up carrying something in front of her. However, as Metcalf progressed she got so big it couldn't be hidden any longer. Her pregnancy was written into the show about halfway through her real one.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFreshPrinceOfBelAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFreshPrinceOfBelAir">The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</a></em>, this resulted in Janet Hubert-Whitten being fired as Aunt Vivian, as her real-life pregnancy was a violation of her contract. She stayed until the end of Season 3 though, and her pregnancy was incorporated into the storyline. Afterward, the character was recast with Daphne Maxwell Reid.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jekyll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jekyll">Jekyll</a></em> Fenella Woolgar was cast as one half of a lesbian couple; however, by the time filming started she had a rather noticeable bump. She thought that she'd lose the role but it was no matter to the writers; they just worked it into the plot and it actually spawned quite a few endearing and funny bits. It was joked about on the commentary: 'You just can't cast lesbians these days!'
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage">Leverage</a></em> actress Gina Bellman was pregnant during filming of the second season. For this reason, her character left to "find herself" and was temporarily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">replaced</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy">another grifter</a>.

Considering that her character had raped the hero in the previous season, this led to much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">Wild Mass Guessing</a> about the in-canon paternity of the offspring...
</li><li> Emily Deschanel of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em> became pregnant during the production of the sixth season. The pregnancy was written into the end of the season as the result of a one-night stand between Booth and Brennan, answering the on-going <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a>. Deschanel was visibly pregnant for the early part of the seventh season and it played a significant role in the personal storylines for the season.
<ul><li> And when she became pregnant again during production of season ten, <a class="urllink" href="http://tvline.com/2014/12/10/bones-brennan-pregnant-again-season-10-emily-deschanel-pregnancy/">it was written into the show again<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

An entire episode was dedicated to the gang trying to find out who got her pregnant; by the end, they stop caring. It was later revealed that she was a surrogate for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">Transgender</a> woman and her husband.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoodLuckCharlie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoodLuckCharlie">Good Luck Charlie</a></em>, Leigh-Allyn Baker's pregnancy was written into the storyline by having her character Amy have her fifth child, which causes problems in the family because they are only just getting back to normal after having a fourth unplanned child.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy">Jeopardy!</a>!</em> makes frequent use of the Clue Crew to deliver video clues in pertinent categories. One use that fit this trope was when Clue Crew member Sarah Whitcomb Foss had her real-life pregnancy worked into a video category on pregnancy that aired on September 18, 2013.
</li><li> Baby Jamie on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MalcolmInTheMiddle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MalcolmInTheMiddle">Malcolm in the Middle</a></em> came to be as a result of Jane Kaczmarek's real-life pregnancy in Season 4.
</li><li> Zoe Hart (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HartOfDixie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HartOfDixie">Hart of Dixie</a></em>) became with child in the 2014-2015 season as a result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RachelBilson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RachelBilson">Rachel Bilson</a> being pregnant for reals.
</li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HaydenPanettiere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HaydenPanettiere">Hayden Panettiere</a> played a pregnant Juliette Barnes on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Nashville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Nashville">Nashville</a></em> at the same time as her real-life pregnancy, this could count as a subversion as <a class="urllink" href="http://www.celebuzz.com/2014-08-26/nashville-creator-callie-khouri-talks-season-3-premiere-hayden-panettiere-s-pregnancy/">the writers had already intended for Juliette to become pregnant.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Because the producers had filmed scenes with her before she went to have her child, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsenteeActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsenteeActor">Absentee Actor</a> trope was averted for the episodes filmed while Hayden wasn't on set (except for "That's The Way Love Goes").
<ul><li> The writers had also intended for Juliette to have postpartum depression &mdash; and depressingly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeImitatesArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeImitatesArt">in season four Hayden took leave from production to get treatment for that same ailment</a>.

The writers got around this with a rather mild retcon, revealing that her doctor previously told her it would be <em>almost</em> impossible for her to get pregnant.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds">Criminal Minds</a></em> A.J Cook got pregnant and it was written into the show, with her real-life son playing her on-screen son Henry. When she became pregnant again and Jennifer Love Hewitt was also pregnant, both were written in, though Jennifer left the show because of it.
</li><li> Although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KristenBell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KristenBell">Kristen Bell</a>'s first pregnancy wasn't written into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfLies">Hou$e of Lie$</a></em>, her second one was.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SarahShahi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SarahShahi">Sarah Shahi</a> was pregnant with twins during Season 4 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest">Person of Interest</a></em> &mdash; she planned to take two years off to recover, but this has since been reduced due to the cutting of Season 5 to 13 episodes and the possibility of the show being canceled after that.
</li><li> The third season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBlacklist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBlacklist">The Blacklist</a></em> saw star Megan Boone become pregnant; and her character of Elizabeth Keen became pregnant as well. A lot of early drama was whether or not she would give the baby up for adoption.
</li><li> During the fourth season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Grimm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Grimm">Grimm</a></em>, actress Claire Coffee (Adelind Schade) became pregnant with her first child. This was particularly amusing because her character, Adelind, had just finished a pregnancy arc. The writers decided to write the pregnancy in, leading the characters to exclaim an exasperated "Again?!" when Adelind reveals her pregnancy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DCIBanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DCIBanks">DCI Banks</a></em>: In the second season, DS Annie Cabot becomes pregnant following a one-night stand and goes on maternity leave as a result of actress Andrea Lowe becoming pregnant.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneSeymourActress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneSeymourActress">Jane Seymour</a>'s pregnancy resulted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DrQuinnMedicineWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DrQuinnMedicineWoman">Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman</a> becoming pregnant as well (though with only one baby rather than the twins she had in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>). Perfect timing, as she and beau Sully had just married.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> pregnancies of several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER">ER</a> actresses &mdash; Ming-Na Wen, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexKingston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexKingston">Alex Kingston</a>, Sherry Stringfield &mdash; resulted in their characters being pregnant too.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime">Once Upon a Time</a></em>:
<ul><li> Season 3 sees Snow and Charming deciding to have a second child that they could actually experience raising was written into the series to explain Ginnifer Goodwin's real-world pregnancy (by the actor who played Charming, cutely enough).
</li><li> Emilie de Ravin's pregnancy becomes a plot point in Season 5 when Belle and Rumple fear for the safety of their child. Belle gets put under a Sleeping Curse to allow them to make the passage of time vague so she could start appearing with the bump.
</li></ul></li><li> Melissa Rauch became pregnant just before production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">The Big Bang Theory</a>'s</em> eleventh season began, with the result being her character becoming pregnant as well. Like Claire Coffee on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Grimm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Grimm">Grimm</a></em>, her character had just had a baby the previous season, and the season premiere has her and her husband worrying about having to care for two children.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em>: When Sonia Manzano (Maria) became pregnant in 1987, it was not only written into the show but resulted in one of the show's landmark changes, Maria and Luis's marriage. Since an illegitimate pregnancy would hardly have been well received by the target audience's parents, the show-runners gave the two Fix-It Shop owners, who were previously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFriends">Just Friends</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade">Relationship Upgrade</a> to have Maria safely married before Manzano's pregnancy would start showing. Her pregnancy was then used to teach young viewers about birth, and eventually, her real daughter Gabriela became Maria and Luis's daughter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDanza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDanza">Gabi</a>, playing the role throughout the first years of her life until a professional child actress replaced her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Mom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Mom">Mom</a></em> took a similar approach to <em>Frasier</em> when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaimePressly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaimePressly">Jaime Pressly</a> became pregnant with twins in 2017. Her character became involved in a custody battle for her foster child and the stress caused her to experience a massive weight gain. She later went to a spa to get her life back on track.
</li><li> While on the subject of Jaime Pressly, Season 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyNameIsEarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyNameIsEarl">My Name Is Earl</a></em> had a storyline where Joy became a surrogate for her estranged half-sister (as well as to get sympathy from the jury in her upcoming trial). This was written in to accommodate Pressly's real-life pregnancy.
</li><li> Angelique Cabral became pregnant just before the third season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LifeInPieces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LifeInPieces">Life in Pieces</a></em>. Fortunately, it was easy to write her out during her maternity leave since her character had been injured in a fall in the previous season's finale, so she spent the premiere in traction. Also, the very nature of the show <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3yzo2');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3yzo2" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3yzo2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The episodes are divided into vignettes in which not all characters appear. </span> made it easy to just not feature her during her maternity leave. On top of this, there was also a dream sequence in which her character was pregnant.
</li><li> Susan St. James became pregnant during the syndication of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KateAndAllie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KateAndAllie">Kate And Allie</a></em>. As the show was about two divorced mothers raising their kids together to reduce expenses, it would have been difficult to write a pregnancy arc for Kate. When the cast later filmed a reunion special in which they reminisced about the show, they revealed the different ways they hid the pregnancy - Kate moved furniture, painted walls, and spent several episodes in the hospital with her leg in traction. But the trope was front and center in one episode, a flashback in which costar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneCurtin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneCurtin">Jane Curtin</a> (who was very much <em>not</em> pregnant) was stuffed to match, showing Kate and Allie being pregnant with their daughters at the same time.
</li><li> In season 5 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/The100" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/The100">The 100</a></em>, actress Ivana Milenkovic (Diyoza) learned she was pregnant shortly after being cast as one of the season's antagonists, and rather than recast, they wrote it into her character.
</li><li> Occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GeneralHospital" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GeneralHospital">General Hospital</a></em> when actress Lynn Herring got pregnant. Like her character, Lucy Coe was single, it was written that she would be the surrogate mother for ex-lover Scott and his dying (of cancer) wife Dominique.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed (1998)</a></em> - Holly Marie Combs was pregnant during Season 6, which was quite amusing as Piper had been pregnant the previous season. There was a long-standing rumor that Chris was going to be revealed as Phoebe's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidFromTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidFromTheFuture">Kid from the Future</a> when real life made him Piper's - however <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> said that it was already the plan and Holly's pregnancy was "convenient timing".
</li><li> In the second half of season 6 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014">The Flash</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaniellePanabaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaniellePanabaker">Danielle Panabaker</a> revealed she was pregnant, thus Caitlin/Frost missed her first episodes in the series since the show's premiere, and would often find herself spending entire episodes on couches covered in blankets while recovering from hypothermia.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder12');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music Video&nbsp;</div><div id="folder12" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In "Tight to Death", rapper Mack-10's duet with then-wife T-Boz from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TLC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TLC">TLC</a>, her pregnancy is proudly emphasized in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutlawCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutlawCouple">Outlaw Couple</a>-themed music video.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WhitneyHouston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WhitneyHouston">Whitney Houston</a> proudly showed off her pregnancy in "I'm Every Woman", since the song and video are a celebration of womanhood. Her previous video, "I Will Always Love You", hid her stomach by only filming her from the chest up, but with "I'm Every Woman" she was much further along, so they couldn't hide it even if they wanted to.
</li><li> "Someday" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BritneySpears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BritneySpears">Britney Spears</a> is basically a music video to celebrate her pregnancy.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DixieChicks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DixieChicks">Dixie Chicks</a>' video for "Landslide", Emily Robison was clearly pregnant and not hiding it during the video shoot.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AtomicKitten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AtomicKitten">Atomic Kitten</a>'s video "The Tide Is High (Get The Feeling)", Natasha Hamilton was eight months pregnant and no attempt was made to hide it. In fact, the dance moves the girls used were choreographed to accommodate the baby bump.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Beyonce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Beyonce">Beyonc&eacute;</a>:
<ul><li> Zig-zagged when she attended the 2011 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV">MTV</a> Awards wearing a loose-fitting gown. During her performance, she was wearing a boxy pantsuit and cryptically told the audience to "Feel the love growing inside me". At the end of her number, she took off her jacket to officially announce her pregnancy and received a standing ovation.
</li><li> Her video for "Countdown" appeared at first to be hiding her pregnancy with an abundance of shots from her front. And then she turned to the side and started rubbing her belly proudly.
