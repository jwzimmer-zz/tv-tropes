The storyline requires the defeat of the main characters in order to make a point or explain a key event, regardless of whether or not the <em>player</em> would allow their party to fall in battle. There are two ways to accomplish this: One is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutsceneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutsceneBoss">Cutscene Boss</a>, where the player has no control over the battle's outcome at all &#151; and the other is the Hopeless Boss Fight.
</p><p>This is a boss with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh-Invulnerability</a>, if not sheer invulnerability outright. Odds are good you won't be able to damage or hit him at all &#151; he'll quickly reduce it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> or just ignore it outright as he launches <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> (if not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">Total Party Kill</a>!) attacks on your team, and if you aren't able to run from this battle on turn one, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a> on turn two. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FissionMailed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FissionMailed">Or is it?</a>
</p><p>These bosses tend to make their appearance near the beginning of the game, before the characters have had a chance to earn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints">Experience Points</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelUp">Level Up</a>, or otherwise become more powerful than their predefined starting levels &#151; this makes narrative sense as well, because this is when the characters would be least likely to survive an encounter with them anyway. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">Done well</a>, this defeat will strike fear into the heart of the player, having learned firsthand just how powerful this boss really is; done poorly, it feels like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeLongevity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeLongevity">a cheap trick designed to advance the plot</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspensionOfDisbelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspensionOfDisbelief">Suspension of Disbelief</a> be damned.

They have the odd tendency to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClimaxBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClimaxBoss">Climax Bosses</a>: If they were the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a>, players will get to fight them after this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBossPreview" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBossPreview">Final Boss Preview</a> by the end of the game as a straight up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> (or Penultimate Boss).
</p><p>Ideally, the game should make it somewhat obvious to the casual gamer the fight is probably intended to be hopeless, lest you waste your serious healing items and abilities. This is another reason why these tend to appear at the beginning of the game, as you haven't even <em>acquired</em> any serious healing items or abilities yet.
</p><p>Often, players may confuse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">a hopelessly difficult boss</a> with this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheatheYourSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheatheYourSword">give up fighting</a> on the assumption that the battle is intended to be hopeless... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy">only to discover it isn't</a>. More fiendishly, some games can silently observe the player's efforts to determine whether they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControllableHelplessness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControllableHelplessness">put up a decent struggle before going down</a>, with a <em>genuine</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a> issued if they died too quickly, or make the objective to survive for a fixed amount of time, with any deaths resulting in game over.

If the monster will become defeatable as you gain power, it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate">Beef Gate</a>.
</p><p>Sometimes, the apparently invincible boss <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LordBritishPostulate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LordBritishPostulate">can</a></em> technically be defeated, if you have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">a precisely tuned tactical setup</a>, access to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">Disc-One Nuke</a>, the advantage of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, endless hours of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a> behind you, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">exploit a glitch</a>. If the developers severely underestimated players, it might not even require anything but sufficient skill or strategy. Since a Hopeless Boss Fight is one the game expects you to lose, the game will react to its defeat in one of several ways:
</p><ul><li> The boss will simply reveal that he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotLeftHanded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotLeftHanded">Not Left Handed</a> and summon his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax">Cutscene Power to the Max</a> to knock your party senseless, if your party members didn't already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutsceneIncompetence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutsceneIncompetence">collapse from their own exhaustion</a>.
</li><li> Someone or something else pulls a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina">Diabolus ex Machina</a> and finishes you off.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBattleDidntCount" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBattleDidntCount">The Battle Didn't Count</a>, and events unfold exactly the same as if you had lost the battle. Lazy scripting might simply assume that the battle ended with the boss wiping the floor with the party. In extremely <em>rare</em> cases, the game may remember this outcome anyway, possibly as a factor for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Best</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">Ending</a>.
</li><li> You win this fight, but the boss will be back for a rematch and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Railroading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Railroading">the plot won't advance until you lose to it</a>.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">nonstandard ending</a> because defeating this boss drives the plot completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails">Off the Rails</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">game crashes, freezes, or otherwise breaks</a> because the developers assumed it couldn't happen.

If the boss <em>must</em> be defeated in battle to avoid a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a>, but invokes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryOverwrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryOverwrite">Story Overwrite</a> <em>after</em> the battle to defeat you, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadsIWinTailsYouLose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadsIWinTailsYouLose">Heads I Win, Tails You Lose</a>.

<ul><li> Though it is possible to kill him, albeit being VERY difficult and breaking one quest which was tied to him, if you manage to kill him, you basically won the campaign, because the rest of your poor enemies no longer stand a chance against your highest level character.
</li><li> A lower level example of this can also be found in the Synteth campaign, where you have to summon a monster to aid you n invading a fort, because the enemies there are of too high of a level, but the thing is you can kill them yourself if you are a good player and have some luck, but it will reset to before the fight happened as if you lost.

A variation occurs in that it occurs <em>after</em> a normal boss fight with him.
</li><li> Somewhat unusually for a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YuGiOhForbiddenMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YuGiOhForbiddenMemories">Yu-Gi-Oh!

Given that he uses 2700+ ATK monsters at a point where you have access to maybe one or two 1800s, you would need some serious luck or lots of grinding to beat him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterMonpiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterMonpiece">Monster Monpiece</a></em>, you get to fight the Masked Diva after her identity is revealed. She has 9 starting health (the max anyone else has, including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>, is four), <em>90</em> starting mana, on top of using a high upkeep Fusion deck (which 90 mana will let her easily spam from turn 1). If you can somehow survive the initial ten or so cards, her regen is the standard 3; but there is an immensely small chance you'll break even one of her cards before you're overrun the first time through.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic</a> Duels</em>, you get this in one of Nissa's campaign duels. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The opponent starts off at 100 health instead of the usual 20.

True to the trope, Raizo is very powerful and extremely resistant to damage at this point, but with enough skill, you can manage to chip off enough damage from him and fend him off until time runs out.

</li></ul></li><li> In several wrestling-based games, there are matches where, even though they are hard, you can easily win. However, due to the storyline calling you to not have "come out on top" or not possess a certain title, a cutscene will play that takes the title/glory away from you. Several examples in <em>Smackdown vs Raw 06</em> include: HHH losing in a steel cage, but Eric Bischoff taking away your title, defeating Eddie Guerro but the Undertaker interrupting the match, winning the tag team title, but having to give it to the injured wrestler you previously replaced.
<ul><li> The original <em>SmackDown vs. Raw</em> has a big example itself. At one point, you are given the option to join Vince McMahon, who will referee a WWE Championship match you're in. If you take his offer, it is impossible to lose, as he will not recognize submissions or count past two when you're pinned. The inverse, however, is that if you turn him down, the same goes for your opponent, meaning it's only a matter of when you lose.
</li><li> The final game under the <em>SmackDown vs. Raw</em> banner has one in nearly every Road to Wrestlemania (you can beat the one on John Cena&#146;s RTW, but only if you&#146;re really, really good since you face two opponents and have a four minute time limit). Perhaps the biggest one of these is the match at the Royal Rumble in Christian&#146;s RTW. No matter how hard the player tries, they will lose due to Dolph Ziggler&#146;s interference, and can&#146;t even get a three count before he shows up, either.

<ul><li> You <em>can</em> win the fights, if you're extremely good at dodging, and very patient. But the cut scenes take place like it never happened, since the cut scenes are right out of the anime.

Certain fights are normally impossible to win, and losing them advances the plot. However, level up your characters enough and you'll be able to alter the story's progression by winning. This opens up alternate story paths that shift around events and characters, the results of which are often hilarious.

If you do manage to win, it will be revealed that the now exhausted character did little to no damage to System U-D, with the story continuing as normal after U-D retaliates. Having said that, beating her during these Hopeless Boss Fights is one of the prerequisites for accessing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue">Playable Epilogue</a> and unlocking System U-D as a playable character.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DuelSaviorDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DuelSaviorDestiny">Duel Savior Destiny</a></em>, these get pulled on you more frequently as you get into the later story routes. For example, having to go up against four boss units at once all by yourself. During the last route, the game even dumps characters you've never had a chance to use or even have as your ally before, apparently expecting you to lose. If you don't, the game just undoes your victory anyway so you can win the way it wants you to.

In fact, the entire level is one big boss fight, starting with a hopeless one. Every attack you preform against the boss is worthless and futile, up to and including finishing attacks.

<ul><li> For the <em>Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep</em> expansion for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2">Borderlands 2</a></em>, Tina is the dungeon master for a roleplaying game called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAmpersand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAmpersand">Bunkers &amp; Badasses</a></em>. Just as the Vault Hunters approach the gate to a hub world called Flamerock Refuge, Tina narrates that a dragon appeared out of nowhere to fight. It is impervious to weapons and its attack instantly sends every vault hunter into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastChanceHitPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastChanceHitPoint">Fight For Your Life</a> mode. When called out for this by Lilith, Tina revives everyone and substitutes the dragon for a different, easier boss.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx">Deus Ex</a></em> has a well-executed instance of this, where you are confronted by a small army who demand your surrender, led by Gunther Hermann (a main character). You <em>have</em> the option of resisting (even if this is obviously foolish), but Gunther is invincible in this fight, so there's no way to avoid getting captured even if you manage to outfight everyone else (which is pretty hard to do, so you will likely not even notice Gunther's invincibility). You get to fight Gunther later, when he's quite mortal.
<ul><li> It is quite possible to be starkly confronted with Gunther's invincible nature by taking advantage of his ridiculously stupid AI; lure Gunther into the train station and make an escape through the tunnels. Destroy the small army of UNATCO troops and bots awaiting you, and then find out (to many tropers' eternal frustration) that even though you can hear the evac chopper waiting for you, you can't get to it; you're forced to battle Hermann.
<ul><li> It is actually possible to get to da choppa by putting LAMs or gas grenades on one of the shack walls, and then climbing them. If done properly, this will get you past the invisible walls and invisible ceiling and you can get to Jock's copter. Even if you do this, he will still completely ignore you, forcing you to either kill yourself to continue or load from an earlier point.
</li><li> If you trap Gunther in the train station as mentioned above, and manage to survive the other troops and bots outside for an extended amount of time, the game will move to the next plot point anyways just as if you had surrendered or been knocked out.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The climactic battle in the expansion pack to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediKnightDarkForcesII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediKnightDarkForcesII">Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II</a></em>, <em>Mysteries of the Sith</em>, presents a unique Hopeless Boss Fight when Mara Jade fights Kyle Katarn (now seduced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide">The Dark Side</a>). Kyle's attacks are normal, but he is entirely invulnerable and hence impossible to defeat. This situation almost counts as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">Puzzle Boss</a>, except that the solution is not a test of wit.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediKnightIIJediOutcast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediKnightIIJediOutcast">Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast</a></em> gives another example. After Jan Ors is captured <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and seemingly killed</span> by Tavion, an enraged Kyle Katarn tries to fight the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Desann in a scripted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> in favor of the latter. Justified in that, alas, he has Force powers and you do not. The justification is even better than it sounds, because theoretically he has an unbeatable counter to any kind of attack you use. Blasters and energy weapons? Deflected by lightsaber. Thrown explosives? Force Pushed back. So it's not likely the player will even get the chance to verify he's invulnerable as well. Of course, if you happened to be less than skilled and used a cheat code to make yourself invincible, the game becomes unwinnable, since neither side can die.
</li><li> In the last fight in <em>Jedi Outcast</em> you can reverse this trope on Desann (though it is hard). This is possible by trapping his lightsaber under <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the weak pillar in the room</span> by making it fall on top of it when Desann uses a saber throw. He will then be unable to defend, and only use his force powers to force pull his saber, which is stuck.
</li><li> Kinda like this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediKnightJediAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediKnightJediAcademy">Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy</a></em>. You have to defeat a mutated rancor. And when you do, the game respawns it immediately. If you do follow the (not so) logical level layout, you can get to the scripted ending where it dies for real.
</li><li> The same goes for the level where you have to distract a rancor so the prisoners can escape, and you escape as well in the end. You can actually kill the rancor, but the game respawns it immediately.
</li></ul></li><li> When you first encounter the Makron in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeIV">Quake IV</a></em>, you can't beat it. You can die trying, however, unless you let the Makron catch you with its gravity beam, and thus capture you alive.
<ul><li> Sometimes the gravity beam glitches and kills you anyway (perhaps by wanting to drag you through scenery):
<div class="indent"><strong>Makron</strong>: *<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh">Evil Laugh</a>* You cannot win! Die human!

Perplexingly, however, the enemies aren't unlimited, and it is possible on the lower difficulty levels to beat them all, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Cortana</a> keeps telling you that the only safe way out is to jump...
</li><li> Played straight with the post-credits <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand">Last Stand</a> mission in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach">Halo: Reach</a></em>, where you fight increasingly tough waves of enemies until Six is killed.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1">Half Life 1</a></em>, if you refuse the G-Man's offer at the end of the game, you materialize in the middle of a Vortigaunt building with an endless number of enemies...and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FisticuffsBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FisticuffsBoss">no weapons</a>. Additionally, both of the first two gargantuas encountered were apparently intended to only be beaten by luring them into a power reactor and an airstrike, respectively, but through an oversight (likely to make it vulnerable to the airstrike), if you hit it with enough ordinary explosives, you can kill one early &#151; though this required a degree of ammo conservation discipline that most players wouldn't have observed.
<ul><li> While not technically a boss fight, a scripted event early in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em> forces you to be overwhelmed by Combine forces before Alyx saves your sorry hide. It's impossible to skip this or defeat the Combine soldiers because you don't have access to weapons that early in the game. If you use a cheat to give yourself weapons early and kill the soldiers before they wail on you, the event doesn't trigger and you're stuck in a small corridor with nothing to do.
</li><li> Midway through <em>Half-Life 2: Episode 2</em>, you encounter the acidic antlion queen in the antlion lair, who cannot be hurt until you're back outside later in the game.
<ul><li> According to the commentary, not only were you not supposed to fight the Guardian in this section, as a general rule you didn't have enough ammo to actually kill it. That didn't stop playtesters from trying, though, so they had to add a line from the Vortigaunt expressly forbidding you to kill it so that you wouldn't try.

<ul><li> It actually <em>is</em> possible, with the aid of cheats. Doing so triggers a comedic hidden ending.

Firing at him will cause him to mirror your attack with a magical variant of his own. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Just wait it out, avoid his attacks, and eventually he'll run away and trigger the next level.</span>
</li><li> The first level of the time-traveling FPS <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkestOfDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkestOfDays">Darkest of Days</a></em> has you as a member of General Custer's cavalry during the Battle of Little Bighorn. That goes about as well as you would expect.
</li><li> Episode 1 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em> ends this way (as does one level of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">The Plutonia Experiment</a></em> if you choose the wrong one of its two exits); you get teleported to a dark room full of monsters, with a floor that not only drains your health but also turns off the god-mode cheat if in use, and you can't move; apart from shooting the monsters, all you can do is wait for your health to drop to below 11%, which ends the game.
<ul><li> This can be overcome with cheating somewhat if you use IDBEHOLDV (granting you an invulnerability sphere), which isn't affected by the god-mode disabler. Of course, even if you kill the monsters, you're stuck there unless you noclip and there's no other way to beat the level in the Episode 1 example.
</li></ul></li><li> If a player pirated a copy of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SeriousSam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SeriousSam">Serious Sam</a> 3</em>, then they would soon start getting hunted by an <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e91q5BtlxK0">immortal, lightning-fast, giant pink scorpion<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> who would mercilessly slaughter them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield3">Battlefield 3</a></em>, during the second and final mission as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Miller, you have to hold out for an evac helicopter to come save you and your comrades from your disabled tank with its .50 cal machine gun for 15 minutes. It's impossible</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry2">Far Cry 2</a></em>, you start the game trying to flee a town while a civil war is going on all around you. You can't successfully escape the town, because even if you avoid getting killed by gunfire, you collapse from malaria before you can get far. Once you're out of commission, one of the factions picks up your semi-conscious body and drags you to safety to get you to work for them. Which makes very little sense, considering that you may have just shot a lot of them... and then either lost, or collapsed from your <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">terminally</span> serious case of malaria.
</li><li> The very first Big Sister encountered in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock2">BioShock 2</a></em> cannot be defeated no matter what, as she will eventually flee if either her health or Delta's gets too low. Originally, <em>all</em> fights with the Big Sister (singular, as there was only going to be one in the whole game, who would eventually be revealed as Eleanor) were going to be like this, but playtesters didn't take kindly to fighting an unwinnable battle over and over again.
</li><li> In the "Lost to Light" mission from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Destiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Destiny">Destiny</a></em>'s <em>The Taken King</em> expansion, you have to return to a location from a previous boss fight to retrieve a shard from the soul of a previous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. It's guarded by an enemy that, while not a boss, is a little tricky. But then, it suddenly vanishes, so you decide to steal the shard anyway. You get the usual "Mission complete" screen and a major NPC's closing remarks over the radio... but then the signal starts cutting out. <em>Then</em> a whole bunch of bosses spawn, which is your signal to get the hell out.
</li><li> A variation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield1">Battlefield 1</a></em> prologue "Storm of Steel". Unlike typical depictions of your main character being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a>, you're just a regular soldier fighting another army in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">Anyone Can Die</a> situation and it won't end until you are dead. Every time <em>you</em> die, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeadHaveNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeadHaveNames">you learn the name and dates of birth and death of the soldier you were controlling</a>, before taking control of yet another soldier. The sequence only stops after a minimum of four deaths, though it can keep going depending on how often you die.
</li><li> Similar to the ending of the final stage of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em>'s Knee-Deep in the Dead episode, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nitemare3D" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nitemare3D">Nitemare 3D</a></em>, when you first face off against Hammerstein he will simply taunt you and deplete your health all the way to zero, ending the first episode on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger">Cliffhanger</a>.

<ul><li> Anubis, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>, is unbeatable, and that's it. While you can just wait for the end of the game to happen, if you are fast with the controls, you can avoid any damage from him whatsoever, at least on easy. The only damage taken is that in a cutscene about halfway through the battle. What makes the battle that much more frustrating is that you spend the entire game (which isn't very long, mind you) fighting bosses that condescend and belittle you for being a kid, despite wiping the floor with them time and again. What do you learn when you reach Anubis? They were right: the only reason you were winning was because you had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">Super Prototype</a> on your hands. Anubis is the first time you've fought something that is Jehuty's equal, and worse, it's at its full potential, while Jehuty still lacks some important equipment. It is literally impossible to land a hit on the thing because it teleports from place to place constantly, away from you and dangerously close; but, to make matters worse, it can kill you if you're foolhardy enough to try to take it on (or are playing on the higher difficulty levels). The only option is to wait for the Atlantis to save you and run away. Nohman even lampshades this with quotes like, "It's impossible for you to kill me." and "I see. At least you're good at running away."
</li><li> In the second game, you have several encounters with Anubis, and, once again, it's hammered into you that Anubis just far outclasses you in every possible way. Between his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportSpam">Teleport Spam</a>, overpowered normal attacks, and ultra-tough armor, it's flat-out impossible to beat it. You <em>can</em> inflict some minor damage if you're good, but there's no way you're winning. Only at the very end of the game, when Jehuty has <em>finally</em> unlocked its full potential (particularly the ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportSpam">Teleport Spam</a> itself), can you put up a fight against Anubis. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">Oh, and the game didn't just weaken Anubis for the final fights</a>... Anubis is just as powerful as it's ever been. Jehuty has powered up <em>that much</em>, which is shown when it's capable of one-shotting what were previously very difficult bosses with ease.

He can barely be hit, and if he is hit, he takes little damage, and he regenerates more health in one second than it would take a team of 8 damage dealers to do in a minute. And he can one-shot most tanker-type characters.
<ul><li> In Issue 15's Task Forces, the Arch-Villain Reichsman takes no damage the first time you see him. You spend the next few missions devising a way to damage him, then put your plan into effect in the last mission. Even then, he's no push-over.

<ul><li> One example that's still available is Cyrus the Virus.

Otherwise, you're stuck on your knees, unable to move until the plot happens and the final phase of the battle begins.

The first time you face down Heavy <strike>Mole</strike> Lobster on the ship, he actually <em>isn't</em> invincible to your attacks or strong enough to KO you with one hit. Your attacks are as effective as normal. However, while you're fighting, Meta Knight is having a dialogue with his crew on the bottom of the screen. The dialogue doesn't last very long, and the second it ends, Kirby gets blown off the ship. So the player hypothetically <em>could</em> defeat the boss, but there isn't nearly enough time.
<ul><li> If you are <em>really</em> fast, skilled, dodge every attack without taking damage, never cease damaging Heavy Lobster, and have an appropriate weapon, it is just barely possible to kill it before you're blown away. Of course, because Heavy Lobster is only really meant to distract you at this point long enough for said blowing, it changes nothing.

There's nothing really to indicate that you can't beat him, the only hint being that the manual says there are 3 sections of the game, while this fight takes place in the 2nd section.

<ul><li> Similarly, one of the early missions in the Human campaign has you having to defend a small town against endless waves of undead.

<ul><li> In the climactic mission, the plot called for you to lose your wingmen in battle with an enemy ace and make the final attack alone: however, this was achieved by having the ace magically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RespawningEnemies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RespawningEnemies">respawn</a> so long as any wingmen were present. This lead to a surreal battle in which you might shoot him down a dozen times in a row, using up all of your missiles and countermeasures, and have no way of knowing what obscure action would cause things to proceed.
</li><li> Similarly, forgetting to use a certain technology could also lead to a constant stream of respawning aces.
</li><li> Finally, if you fail a critical mission and end up in the losing path, the final mission involves a confrontation with the <em>KIS Hvar'kann</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPrince">Crown Prince</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Thrakhath nar Kiranka</a>'s personal dreadnought, which is almost impossible to kill without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">whittling it down with many minutes of firing</a>. The expectation appeared to be for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Maverick</a> to die trying so that the Bad Ending could roll. As you were not meant to destroy it, the game has no idea what to do when you beat it, so just leaves you hanging in space.
</li></ul></li><li> While few in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat">Ace Combat</a></em> series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat04ShatteredSkies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat04ShatteredSkies">Ace Combat 04: Shattered Skies</a></em> may be the only one where there are enemy planes that are literally invincible: in your first encounter with the Yellow Squadron, their AI is so insanely beefed up that hitting them is nigh impossible... and attempting to use guns will reveal that they are invincible as well, just in case someone tried fighting them anyway. In fact, your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mission Control</a> orders you to run the hell away the second they show up; not retreating until the mission timer runs out fails the mission.
<ul><li> In the next encounter, the Yellow Squadron's piloting skills have been reduced just enough that a mid-tier plane actually stands a chance of hitting them; while they're still invincible, scoring a single solid hit on any of them will cause the entire squadron to disengage and leave the battlefield amidst surprised radio dialogue from both sides.
</li><li> There are two missions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat5TheUnsungWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat5TheUnsungWar">Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War</a></em> where you're actually unarmed (although you're actually very unlikely to get hit), and the series is sprinkled with missions where engaging the enemy aces would run counter to the mission objectives. Of particular note is the infamous <em>8492</em> in <em>AC5</em>, which sees you get jumped by a <em>very</em> large number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane">Su-47 Berkuts and YF-23s</a>... right after a very taxing close air support mission, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">not allowing you to change your</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterSelectForcing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterSelectForcing">attacker plane</a> for a more suited fighter jet between the two engagements</em>. Upon spawning, the entire enemy force immediately beelines for you and get on your tail, ripple-firing their missiles in large salvos that instantly kill even on lower difficulty levels, making even <em>fleeing</em> them (which is the objective) almost impossible. While extremely difficult to battle due to their superb agility making them impossible to out-turn without an F-22 or other top-tier monster of your own, these aces are not actually invincible and shooting them down is required for an S-rank, regardless of your teammates' insistence that staying to fight is suicide. Luckily, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight">bagging enough of them for an S-rank automatically despawns the rest and counts as mission success, regardless of whether you've escaped or not</a>. The question is whether the player actually has the skills and good enough plane to do this.
</li><li> Technically speaking, Stonehenge in <em>04</em> starts out as this. It first causes trouble in mission 7, right after you complete your main objective &#151; it's almost like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KaizoTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KaizoTrap">Kaizo Trap</a> in this sense, except you receive plenty of warning at first. You can't even attack it at all in this mission, as it's not even anywhere on the level and is instead firing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> salvos from afar (with a ten second warning, granted). You have to enter a tight ravine and stay below 2000 feet to keep out of its sights, otherwise you are dead. Later, thankfully, you're given a warning to expect it to act up, and you get more time between shots. You still can't even fight Stonehenge, however. Fast forward to mission 12, and you're actually able to attack it and know where the cannons are, making it far easier to manage. Watch your flying though: although the cannons have serious difficulty tracking you from so close, they still dish out a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> if you happen to be in the way when it fires.
</li><li> A smaller example from <em>Zero</em> is the first phase of the final boss fight against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pixy</span>. You can shoot at him and you can hit him - but until your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mission Control</a> informs you of his Morgan's weakness, you cannot kill him, the reason being that the Morgan's sophisticated ECM makes it invulnerable against both missiles and guns. Only nailing the front air intake can take it down - apparently, whoever designed the ECM thought that nobody would be crazy enough to try <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirJousting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirJousting">Air Jousting</a> with a jet fighter. Unfortunately for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pixy</span>, Cipher <em>is</em> that crazy.
</li><li> The third mission in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat7SkiesUnknown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat7SkiesUnknown">Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</a></em> has you going up against the Arsenal Bird, a massive, unmanned flying wing that deploys dozens of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrones">Attack Drones</a>. After a couple of minutes, your allies are overwhelmed and the Arsenal Bird deploys an impenetrable shield, forcing you to retreat while providing cover against the drones.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekBridgeCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekBridgeCommander">Star Trek: Bridge Commander</a></em>, there are a few times where you are encouraged to complete your objective and get the hell out of there ASAP, due to being highly out-gunned. A few times, ships respawn infinitely, but a few times you're highly rewarded for defeating all the enemy vessels.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freespace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freespace">Descent: Freespace</a></em> you can fight the <em>Lucifer</em> multiple times, but can only destroy it during the last mission due to its invulnerable shield. (This is because the final mission is the only time you encounter the Lucifer in the campgain where the "Invulnerable" flag for the <em>Lucifer</em> is <em>not</em> turned on. Yeah, that's right, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Lucy</a> doesn't have shields, just a mission editor hax.)
<ul><li> Not that you'd stand much chance of destroying it even without the shields: you're a small, one-man fighter and the <em>Lucifer</em> is a 3 kilometer long superdestroyer. It takes a full squadron of fighters guarding two wings of heavy bombers armed with bombs meant for <em>planetary bombardment</em> to destroy it in the end.

There are more ghosts than swords in the game, though, so you can never get rid of all of them.

It <em>is</em> technically possible to bring it down, but this triggers the same cutscene regardless, and there's no reward.
</li><li> Albert Wesker is impossible to kill the first time you face him in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5">Resident Evil 5</a></em>: all you're expected to do is <em>survive</em> for seven minutes. It <em>is</em> possible to inflict enough damage to end the fight early (and earn an achievement and a valuable gem for your trouble), but the following cutscene is exactly the same as if you just waited out the clock.

</li><li> The zombified Alan Morton, the final boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/AloneInTheDarkTheNewNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/AloneInTheDarkTheNewNightmare">Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare</a></em>. No matter how many times you knock him down, he always gets back up. After stunning him, you have to run into a mundane alcove which contains a spear, which Carnby automatically uses to kill Morton.
<ul><li> Likewise, Obed Morton is so difficult to defeat that to many players he <em>seems</em> like a Hopeless Boss Fight, such that even most of the game's walkthroughs indicate the only way to finish the game is to use an exploit to run past him instead of fighting him. You actually <em>can</em> kill Obed by shooting him (and it doesn't even matter what weapon you use either), but you can only hurt him when he's in a certain pose (he should be knocked backwards if you hit him correctly, indicating you got it right).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFrame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFrame">Fatal Frame</a> 2</em>, you have the Kusabi. An extremely powerful ghost, any time he appears before the end-game fight against him, he's immune to the effects of the Camera Obscura (rendering him invincible) and getting touched by him is instant death, whether you have a Stone Mirror or not. Your only option is to run.
<ul><li> The same game also features a sequence where the player must run from Sae Kurosawa, another extremely powerful one-hit kill ghost. In this case, though, she's invincible because the player has lost the Camera, and with it their only means of defending themselves against ghosts. Curiously, when she's encountered as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a>, she's no longer able to one-hit kill you.
</li><li> The <em>Fatal Frame</em> series makes a tradition out of this: Kirie Himuro from the first game is also invincible and a one-hit kill until the final boss fight. The third game has Reika Kuze, who does not have one-hit kill powers, but is invincible until (you guessed it) the final boss fight.

Occasionally, an attack will do one damage against Frigisaurus, but, more often than not, attacks won't even affect it. Even support effects and status effects miss. It's not until you get Igno that the battle is winnable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance">Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</a></em> has two of these, both of them involving Llednar. He's invincible and strong. You have to stall for several turns before the plot takes over. He does become beatable towards the game's end. Just to give an idea of how unbeatable Llednar is: Most battles have objectives like "Win battle!", "Defeat the Boss!", or the suchlike. During the fight that's just Marche versus Llednar? "Survive!".

The battle is extremely difficult with lesser enemies being summoned as fast as you can bring them down and his attacks can one-shot most of your team. The game even gives you a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadEnding">Bad Ending</a> if you lose the battle, giving an impression of a hopeless boss fight.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NipponIchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NipponIchi">Nippon Ichi</a> games, such as the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea">Disgaea</a></em> series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantomBrave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantomBrave">Phantom Brave</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MakaiKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MakaiKingdom">Makai Kingdom</a></em>, had bosses too hard to defeat without massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a>. The writers cater to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> fans, and have divergent game areas just for them. Careful, though, because <em>winning</em> some of them causes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver">Non-Standard Game Over</a> leading to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">Bad Ending</a>.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea2CursedMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea2CursedMemories">Disgaea 2</a></em> subverts this at one point. Initially, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Laharl</span> shows up and kicks your ass. However, in the process, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">breaks Rozalin's talisman, triggering her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Superpowered Evil Side</a></span>. This causes an inversion, where it is he who cannot possibly defeat you. However, you still have to lose the first phase of the fight. If you win in the first phase, then you get an ending and are forced to start the story from the top. The same with your battle with Etna. If you lose, the game continues, if you win, you get a joke cutscene, the credits roll, and you have to take it from the top.
</li><li> Another <em>Disgaea</em> subversion happens during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisgaeaHourOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisgaeaHourOfDarkness">first game</a>. Initially, during the Chapter 6 fight against the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Alternate Overlord</span>, his group of ten is all at level 75, and you're normally barely breaking 30 on your first playthrough<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0buad');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0buad" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0buad');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Meaning that should you lose, the castle retainers, their levels around 300 to 400, show up to bail you out as Neutral NPCs</span>. However, should you win this fight on another playthrough (or just level grind enough on your first time through), it turns out that the game just proceeds on. No special cutscene, nothing.
</li><li> The Nippon Ichi game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LaPucelle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LaPucelle">La Pucelle</a> Tactics</em> also had two such bosses, in chapters 4 and 8; defeating them earns a "special ending" for the chapter which grants a powerful piece of equipment.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulNomadAndTheWorldEaters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulNomadAndTheWorldEaters">Soul Nomad &amp; the World Eaters</a></em> has the titular World Eaters, and without the aid of the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniac</a>, you can't hope to defeat them.
<ul><li> Storywise, the only World Eater that falls under this category is Feinne, the first World Eater you encounter (right at the beginning of the story, to boot). Actually beating her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">triggers the battle against Asagi</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RhapsodyAMusicalAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RhapsodyAMusicalAdventure">Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure</a></em> loves to use this trope. Several boss fights (primarily with Marjoly's minions in early goings of the game) are impossible to win, simply because you can't damage them &#151; all attacks will miss). Others later you have to at least survive for a few rounds before the game ends the fight. Still, the most amusing one is during the contest when you fight Etoile. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">You vs Rocket Launchers and Machine guns. Good luck!</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MakaiKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MakaiKingdom">Makai Kingdom</a></em> actually inverts this at the beginning, placing you against a series of opponents whom you could not possibly lose to.
<ul><li> Chapter 8 ends with Alexander finally stepping to defeat you on his own, being way above your level on a first playthrough. Fortunately, Salome joins the fight as an uncontrollable third party, even higher level, and turns him into a smear. Unless you have the bad fortune to get into the crossfire, it's a sure win. And of course, on future playthroughs, you can fight them on your own for certain alternate endings.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a>: Original Generation 2</em>, you are constantly pitted against the main bosses of the game &#151; who retain their endboss-level stats the entire time. Whenever they show up, you're supposed to simply stay away from them until they leave, but one battle forces you to go all-out on one who is strictly unbeatable. In another, similar situation, the boss won't leave; either you leave, or you finally beat it by what amounts to cheating. It should be noted that this particular battle is the first time you use the majority of the units in that battle with no chance to upgrade them before the chapter begins, meaning that even with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, the battle is always a near-impossible one no matter how many times you fight it.
<ul><li> Should you actually win the first fight against the Inspectors (the Quirky Miniboss Trio), you get an awful lot of very good items, ridiculous amounts of gold and exp, and a rather amusing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall">No Fourth Wall</a> moment.
</li><li> In Original Generation 1, there is the early and optional fight against Shu Shirakawa's horrendously broken Granzon. You are encouraged to run, although battling it is an option and a viable one at that, provided you have put a lot of money and level-grinding into Irmgult and the Grungust. Even then, the Granzon still takes a beating and only your top-tier units at the time should be used against it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Warsong</em> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Langrisser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Langrisser">Langrisser</a></em> in Japan) had a non-boss version of this. In the first scenario you are supposed to escape, but a clever strategist can beat all the enemies instead. This has no effect on the plot except for a sentence or two.

However, you do get to fight him again straight afterwards using Esis, who is more than capable of dealing 80,000 damage in a single move, which is extremely satisfying.
</li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VandalHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VandalHearts">Vandal Hearts</a></em> game, the first battle of Chapter 4 pits you against a large enemy force including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the four enemy generals</span> and a large entourage of high-level crimson knights. From the get-go it is implied that this fight is unwinnable by design and you are directed to attempt to break your way through the enemy lines and flee, a fact reinforced by the mission goal being to simply escape to the gate at the other side of the map. With some patience and strategy, it <em>is</em> possible to win the fight and wipe the entire enemy force out, but you still need to move all characters to the gate and "flee" and the following cutscene does not change to accommodate your victory.

The idea is that it's a Hopeless Boss Fight so long as the hero, Delsin, sticks to using Smoke powers and stubbornly refuses to use his Neon ones. It is expected that the player will eventually run out of Smoke energy and be forced to use Neon; however, skilled players on lower difficulties can in fact beat the DUP King without having to do that. This causes dissonance in the next cutscene as the characters will behave as if Delsin gave in and used Neon. According to the developers, none of the playtesters were capable of winning just with Smoke, so they never bothered programming in an alternate cutscene.

Fortunately, once <em>your</em> health gets low enough, the guards intervene and incapacitate both of you.

This was even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invoked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invoked">invoked</a>, as the lesson Gildarts was trying to teach Natsu was that sometimes you <em>will</em> fight someone who's completely out of your league no matter how hard you try and while you shouldn't fall into despair out of fear, you also shouldn't be afraid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldEm">to surrender or run away to fight another day</a>.

</li><li> Unless you're a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation">Haki</a> user or exploiting their weakness, Logia users in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> are this. This is because Logia users are able to transform into a certain element to avoid incoming attacks.
<ul><li> There are also certain characters battles for this as well. First example is Dracule Mihawk vs. Zoro. Mihawk is not only a member of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller">Seven Warlords</a>, he is also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan">strongest swordsman in the world</a> and Zoro had the misfortune to take him on at his weakest. The battle was so one-sided, Mihawk only used a tiny dagger to kick Zoro's ass. It's clear Zoro wasn't ready for Mihawk at the time.
</li><li> Another is Enel toward everyone that isn't Luffy. Not only he is a Logia Devil Fruit user, his DF in particular allows him to control <em>lightning</em>. That means he can pretty much one-shot anyone with massive amount of watts of electricity, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Zoro</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChefOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChefOfIron">Sanji</a>! However, this gets turned around against Enel when he faces Luffy who, being a rubber man, is immune to Enel's electricity. Most of the "fight" between Luffy and Enel was Enel trying to stay away from Luffy.
</li><li> Don't bother trying to fight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishingOutDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishingOutDirt">Crocodile</a> in the desert. He <em>will</em> kick your ass. Even if you exploit his weakness to water (or any other liquids).
</li><li> This is the idea of fighting any of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteFour">Four Emperors</a>. They are considered the strongest pirates in the entire world and fighting them directly is just asking for a death wish. The only people that could clash with the Four Emperors are, well, themselves! Biggest proof is shown much later in the Wano Country arc where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kaido of the Beasts <em>one-shots</em> Luffy in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Gear Fourth form</a>!</span>
</li><li> The above example can be also be said when a pirate tries to fight a Marine Admiral. They are the most powerful Marines and simply one being in the general area will cause panic among pirates. In fact, the only ones who actually has a chance of defeating a Marine Admiral are the Four Emperors, legendary Marines like Garp or Sengoku, infamously notorious individuals such as Dragon The Revolutionary, and ex-Admirals like Aokiji.

</li><li> Discussed in detail in the Star Trek novel <em>Kobayashi Maru</em> in which we see exactly how Scotty, Chekov, Sulu, and Kirk all dealt with the eponymous training simulation: Scotty performs engineering miracles (including one that <em>only</em> works in a simulator) until the ship is finally overpowered and destroyed (this leads to him being transferred out of Command School into the Engineering Corps), Chekov <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks">rams the Enterprise into the Klingon ships</a>, destroying them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">(and the Maru as well)</a>, Sulu realized that it was likely a trap and left without crossing into the Neutral Zone, while Kirk reprogrammed the simulation so that, when he introduced himself, he was so well-known as a badass that the Klingons immediately surrendered.
</li><li> This trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanPrint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanPrint">Older Than Print</a>, as a Norse Myth had Loki of the out lands pit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">Loki</a> of Asgard, Thjalfi and Thor against opponents they really shouldn't have been expected to stand a chance against. Loki was in an eating contest with fire (or, perhaps, Logi the fire giant), Thjalfi a race against thought (no matter how fast you are, someone can always think of a second faster, even if it would be physically impossible), Thor was put in three, ending with a wrestling match against an avatar of aging itself.

The utterly mysterious lord of the Dragon Clan, who is so enigmatic that those who speak with him don't even really remember what his voice sounded like or what words were said, is actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Togashi-Kami, the immortal child of the Sun and Moon and the only remaining sibling of the first Emperor. He is also a dragon.</span> He can see the future and knows when he will die, and it sure ain't gonna be you that kills him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Lady of Pain. She is the enigmatic steward and protector of Sigil, the City of Doors, whose motives cannot be divined and who can (and has) annihilate even higher-tier deities with her power. She <em>will</em> flay you outright or trap you into a nigh-inescapable labyrinthine dimension should you ever do anything to cross her. Stats for her simply aren't given, because She &gt; You no matter how many epic levels you've got. And if you're a minotaur with an adept sense of direction? She just puts you in a single million-mile long hallway. And by the way, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">you can't die in her labyrinth dimension</a>. As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheSpoonyExperiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheSpoonyExperiment">The Spoony One</a> put it, "The Lady of Pain is 'you lose.'"
</li><li> There's also the entity known as the Guardian of the Dead Gods, a being who was formerly the god Anubis, who now watches over the dead gods in the Astral Plane and protects them from desecration. It's very hard to tell just what will make him intervene (the githyanki have built entire cities on the giant corpses and he doesn't seem to mind, but sometimes, simply touching one might get him upset). The article where he's mentioned gives a flat 5% chance that doing anything to one of the dead gods will attract his attention (unless someone does something <em>really</em> stupid, like try to completely demolish one, in which case it's almost assured), and even then, he'll usually send his servant to deal with it (who's a powerful wizard, but not unbeatable). If you're unlucky enough that he decides to deal with it personally... The same source says that your only chance is to flee (he <em>usually</em> will not follow, but there's no guarantee). Simply put, he <em>cannot</em> be hurt by anything mortals have at their disposal.
</li><li> This was a common theme in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape">Planescape</a> in general. While on a Prime (Earth-like) world, high-level PCs might get used to being the biggest badasses around, on the planes there's always a bigger fish &#151; <em>always</em>. Demon lords and archdevils were the weakest of the untouchables (who you had a chance of at least defying and defeating their servitors), then any of the gods were next up the list (with their own hierarchy from hero-deity and demigod to greater power), and finally up to enigmatic cosmic forces like the Lady (who can kill gods) and the Guardian of the Dead Gods. At the same time, Planescape was dedicated to cutting a survivable niche out for the merely mortal while in realms populated by such beings, when before the planes themselves had only really been open to high-level characters with powerful magic.
</li><li> There's something like this in the first scenario (also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice">Framing Device</a>) of the module <em>The Vortex of Madness</em>, a sort of inversion of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">Puzzle Boss</a> theme. The PCs meet an intelligent iron golem in a room that resembles a chessboard, with smaller golems as the pieces; the golem demands a game of chess. However, if the PCs do this, it demands a rematch again and again (regardless of whether it wins or loses). If the players finally catch on and decide to fight the golem, it gladly does so, with its chess pieces supporting it, and the PCs' pieces supporting them; and if defeated, the golem finally admits defeat. (The purpose of this strange encounter is an attempt by the Machine of Lum the Mad, who controls the complex, to recreate the battle between Lum the Mad and General Leuk-O, which ended indecisively. The golem represents Leuk-O, and the PCs represent Lum.)
</li></ul></li><li> In one of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a></em> tabletop games included with a few of the books, if you attempt to fight a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreCthulhu">Twoleg</a>, it ends like this. The PCs' only options are to attack, which does nothing but damage them, or run away.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">The big boss himself</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CallOfCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CallOfCthulhu">Call of Cthulhu</a></em>. In some versions, his <em>only</em> stat is that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustEatHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustEatHim">eats 1d6 characters</a> <em>per round</em> and gives you a huge hit to your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanityMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanityMeter">Sanity Meter</a> upon seeing him. And even if you <em>do</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu">manage to kill him</a>, like the sailor Johansen who fought him in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCallOfCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCallOfCthulhu">original story</a>, he'll simply come right back.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SLAIndustries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SLAIndustries">SLA Industries</a></em>, two unstoppable badasses are repeatedly made mention of: the infamous serial killer, Halloween Jack, and the king and father of all Manchines, Digger. While both are notable threats or inconveniences to the company, and have many attemps made against them, both are effectively unkillable: Jack has has a bounty of 2 billion credits on his head that no sensible op would try and collect on, and Digger has a whole army to fight with. Neither character has stats in any of the books, as they are considered to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">OHK</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">the party</a> if they ever cross paths. This is especially bad news for those taking one pre-made platinum mission, which requires them to go right into Digger's home base, and sabotage his ultimate plan to conquer Mort.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ArkhamHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ArkhamHorror">Arkham Horror</a></em>, failing to seal enough portals before too many have opened will result in the Big Bad of the session breaking through and the players facing it in direct combat. The fight is heavily stacked in its favor and the PCs are probably going to die, but it's potentially winnable... except when the Big Bad is Azathoth. If Azathoth wakes up, the whole universe ends.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ProseDescriptiveQualities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ProseDescriptiveQualities">Swashbucklers of the 7 Skies</a></em> ranks NPCs from cannon fodder Minions all the way up to powerful Archvillains, but then notes that some characters are so arbitrarily powerful they can only be designated "Plot Devices" and so doesn't bother giving them stats &#151; for example, Alexei Rostand, a retired sky-pirate who had been at the work-around 50 years before he managed to win a pardon. Even Rostand's lieutenants go un-statted and are simply described as extremely dangerous.
