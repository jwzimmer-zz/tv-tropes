Similarly, purposefully weakened characters may not always be better for the narrative. If anything, it can be the opposite; a character who is wholly incompetent can drag down the rest of the party and make it hard for them to roleplay, and in most adventuring groups, it's assumed that the main characters are at least good at their jobs, making the minmaxer's stronger builds <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">Gameplay and Story Integration</a>.

<ul><li> The protagonist Maple puts all her stat points in vitality for purposes of boosting her defense, because she doesn't like the idea of getting hurt. And we mean ALL points; she has big fat zeroes in pretty much everything else. As a result, she can't fight normally, she can't cast spells, and she moves at the speed of frozen molasses... but she's pretty much invulnerable, and can often defeat powerful foes by sheer attrition, the use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects">Standard Status Effects</a> skills she's gained from surviving constant attacks, unique boss equipment she's acquired, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic">the ability to summon an incredibly powerful poisonous hydra</a>. Even better, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance">she didn't even realize she would be able to do any of this when she started</a>.
</li><li> Similar to Maple, the twins Mai and Yui put all their stats points in one attribute, with them putting it towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteBruiser">strength</a>. Because of them being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannons</a>, they are initially low-level players who were unable to join any quest parties. However, once they meet Maple, they manage to grind their levels and gain abilities that not only increase their strength, but also allow them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding">use two giant hammers at once</a>. As such, the two become some of the strongest characters in NewWorld Online, with them <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> being able to take out numerous game bosses with just one blow</span> and giving the second-best player of the game, Dread, a run for his money during the fourth event.

To be specific, her artefact is a large book which displays someone's thoughts if Nodoka knows their name. One of the items tells her the name of anything she points at and another is an earpiece which reads the book for her while it's in her backpack (allowing her to make use of it in combat). This combination gives her <em>de facto</em> telepathy.
<ul><li> To give an example: if we sum up her speech during <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">chapter 280's fight: "What is your name? Ahaa, Dynamis. How do you use this artefact? So this is what I can do. How would you escape from this situation? OK, teleporting away."</span> &mdash; without the opponent saying anything meanwhile. Real quote: "Thank you very much, mister Mage."
</li><li> She even buffs herself beforehand &mdash; flashbacks showing her learning magical reinforcement from her party members &mdash; giving her enough temporary speed and agility to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">steal Dynamis' artifact from under his nose</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Overlord2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Overlord2012">Overlord (2012)</a></em>: While many of Ainz' YGGDRASSIL guildmates were minmaxers, he himself was more of a roleplayer, meaning he's only in the middle tier of level 100 players. However, as the game was extremely stingy with information and encouraged exploration, Ainz ended up gaining very powerful spells and classes that he would never have discovered if he'd been more focused on combat rather than roleplaying (including some that allow him to beat the combat-MinMaxed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shalltear</span>). While most of the higher-powered spells are useful or even more powerful in the new world (undead summons no longer have a time limit if corpses are used as resources, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualBossImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualBossImmunity">Contractual Boss Immunity</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> attacks is almost unheard-of), his more mundane ones are more useful (such as translating written words or modifying memories), and he has <em>hundreds</em> of spells.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter &times; Hunter</a></em>, Nen abilities can be made more powerful by imposing limits on them when they're created. The stricter the limits, the greater the power gained. Thus, min-maxing is an important in-universe talent for anyone seeking to give themselves a particularly powerful ability and yet also get good use out of that ability. While doing a poor job of selecting the limitations will result in either a weak ability, or one that's theoretically powerful but can't actually be used because the limit was too strict.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ThatTimeIGotReincarnatedAsASlime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ThatTimeIGotReincarnatedAsASlime">That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime</a></em>: Satoru Mikami ended up doing this entirely by accident when he was reincarnated as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlobMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlobMonster">Rimuru Tempest</a>.

<ul><li> Lindon learns the Path of Blackflame, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">Dangerous Forbidden Technique</a> that ravages the minds and bodies of anyone who uses it. Not only was he given an overpowered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> in preparation for this, but he has two cores; one is filled with Blackflame, while the other remains pure, which is good for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a>. He can switch to his pure core and cleanse his body of Blackflame corruption, allowing him to use it with minimal danger. Likewise, having two cores is usually a bad idea because they won't be as deep as a single core, but Eithan teaches him an advanced cycling technique that makes them <em>very</em> deep.
</li><li> Yerin's Path of the Endless Sword is extremely powerful, but it has one glaring weakness: It relies entirely on the presence of Sword <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackgroundMagicField" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackgroundMagicField">aura</a>, which comes off of edged weapons. This means that if she doesn't have a sword she is severely weakened, and if her opponents don't have one either she's practically helpless. Except that her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarkOfTheSupernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarkOfTheSupernatural">goldsign</a> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiArmedAndDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiArmedAndDangerous">large arm with an attached sword growing out of her back</a>, meaning that she is never without a weapon.
</li><li> Eithan uses pure madra like Lindon, but unlike Lindon doesn't have a second core. Pure madra cannot be restored through cycling aura, making it extremely slow to regenerate, and it can't affect physical objects either. He gets around the regeneration issue by using the same cycling technique he taught Lindon, meaning he has <strong>deep</strong> madra reserves. He has so much power that he appears to be the first person to ever realize that pure madra can be used to kill someone by attacking their soul directly (most people lose their pure madra before they are teenagers, so they'd never discover its benefits). He covers the other weaknesses of pure madra through the use of soulfire, a versatile power that anyone of Underlord rank gains access to&mdash;again, far later than most people ever use pure madra.

<ul><li> A common happening in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts">Mixed Martial Arts (MMA)</a>; while every fighter is supposed to have at least some proficiency in each of the three basic phases of the fight &mdash; striking when standing, the clinch (grappling while standing), and on the mat &mdash; usually fighters tend to have specialized in, or at least developed reputations for specializing in a particular area or method. Besides training and natural aptitude, having a clear way to "finish" the opponent tends to be more exciting (read: more pay) and is usually less risky than letting a fight "go to the judges," especially if it's hard-fought by both fighters. Due to the nature of the fight sport however, it's possible for minmaxing attempts to result in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">Crippling Overspecialization</a>.
<ul><li> And it's a constant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LensmanArmsRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LensmanArmsRace">Lensman Arms Race</a> between minmaxers and well-rounded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a> type fighters as to which skillset is better.
</li></ul></li><li> Krav Maga is basically a Martial Art that trims away all of the non-combat aspects of other self-defense forms to focus on almost exclusively on getting in close with short powerful blows to vitals and hard kicks that rarely go above the knee (but focus at the knee). Being a created-for-the-military martial art, it's objective is not self-discovery, inner peace, a good work out, or self discipline; it's to end the fight in the fastest and most definitive way possible. What this means, for the min side of things, is that it's use is <em>only</em> to end a fight in way that will most likely break your opponent (literally), and unless highly, <em>highly</em> trained and controlled isn't good for simply stopping or incapacitating an enemy with minimal harm.
<ul><li> This makes it highly popular with women's self-defense classes, where even smaller framed people can execute painful quick strikes to end an attack and get away rather than engage in any continued combat. This also makes it unpopular with martial art competitions, where the goal of points, show demonstration, and sustained battle is counterintuitive.
</li></ul></li><li> Baseball teams may go one of two ways in this vein: be "built for the homerun", which sacrifices contact and speed for power, or be a "slap hitting" team that sacrifices power for getting on-base more often and better running. Arguably <em>both</em> styles can work if done correctly, but when they fail they do so spectacularly.
<ul><li> Moneyball in action; using a limited number of points (money), selecting the players at specific positions that will maximize your team to the best of their abilities while keeping their more negative skills or traits at the minimum level of playing interference.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR">NASCAR</a> has "start and park" cars which are good enough to qualify for races but only run a couple laps. This earns the team prize money for competing, but reduces wear and tear on the car to maximize profits. The sanctioning body eventually broke this in the Cup Series by decreasing the prize money for the bottom handful of finishing spots and redistributing that among the top 35 spots, which by 2015 had stopped the practice completely. It's still common in the Xfinity and Truck series, though.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder4');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tabletop Games&nbsp;</div><div id="folder4" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> It should be noted, first and foremost, that most Tabletop Games have a built-in check against unbalanced minmaxing (unless the Game-Master likes the minmaxing) in the form of the Game-Master (Story-Teller, Dungeon Master, etc.). While many players enjoy the theoretical debate over what "could be done" using a certain interpretation of the rules, many will find their plans cut short if they actually tried to implement any of them in play.
<ul><li> On the other hand, this does heavily come down to the experience and personal tastes of the group and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">Game Master</a> in particular and is thus never <em>guaranteed</em> to actually work. GMs new to a given game themselves may not recognize potential "abuses" in the first place before they've already been put into practice; others may disagree with individual players on what does or does not actually constitute abuse, or be simply unwilling to put their foot down on something the rulebook itself presents as perfectly legitimate.
</li></ul></li><li> Steve Jackson Games published <em>The Munchkin's Guide to Power Gaming</em>, a humorous look at how to fold, spindle, and mutilate the rules (and if that didn't work, cheat).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia">Paranoia</a></em>, it is recommended that the GM treat any player that displays knowledge of the rules beyond what has already come up in the game as treasonous and have their character summarily executed, wiping the line. Because of that, the only way for a player to really use the system is to get their own copy of the rules before character creation and gear their character creation towards a better character. The game also recommends that players do this, both because it means they have to buy their own copy of the rules (and that's more money in the writer's pockets!), and because having a hard rule against reading the rules and then encouraging the players to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCheatingUnlessYouGetCaught" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCheatingUnlessYouGetCaught">break it and desperately pretend they haven't</a> is so in spirit with the game it <em>hurts</em>.
</li><li> More iterations in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> than you can count, and that the designers have spent literally decades trying to balance. It is best to say when the Min-Maxing build was in effect, since many examples will not make sense to newer players. Examples include:
<ul><li> Lasplas: a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">Lascannon</a> and a Plasma Gun in every squad (patched by making it so you need a 10-man squad to have a Lascannon and a Plasma Gun, as well as making both prohibitively expensive compared to other guns)
</li><li> Stealer Shock: using Genestealers with a previously only moderately helpful upgrade called <em>Scuttling</em> to move your entire army onto the table from the board sides, effectively jumping a castled enemy and assaulting without even being shot.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood">Assault Cannons</a>: using tons of units in as minimal quantities as possible to ensure that there are as many Assault Cannon upgraded models as possible (patched with recent fixes to limit the spam of Assault Cannons to every Marine faction except Black Templars.)
</li><li> The first splat book of Second Edition, featuring the Space Wolves, allowed for a single unit of up to 20 veteran Terminators (who, back then, saved on 3+ <em>on two dice</em>), and each of them could be equipped with an Assault Canon or Cyclone missile launcher. The cheese factor was pretty high, even if such a unit was ridiculously expensive pointwise.
</li><li> Wraithlords: it was a common practice amongst Eldar players to spam Wraithlords because in a previous edition they were completely imbalanced for how powerful they were (patched by a new army book coming out making the Wraithlords significantly less powerful than they were; the current unit-to-spam is the "Holofalcon")
</li><li> Nidzilla: a Tyranid list that fields little to no Gaunts, while taking as many Carnifexes as possible, capable through a rule in the army book that allows Carnifexes under certain points costs to be taken as Elites instead of Heavy Support choices, effectively doubling the amount of available Heavy Support slots there are.
</li><li> The Tyranid Codex spawned a number of "broken" units due to an apparent lack of playtesting. The most infamous of which was the Doom of Malai'tai. The beast can be dropped in the middle of the enemy and deploy a death aura that automatically hits all enemy units within range before any shooting is done, <em>even on your opponent's turn</em>, and THEN it shoots.
<ul><li> This was counteracted by an update of the official FAQ; it was basically one gigantic stompfest on the Nid's rules. The final nail on the coffin was the Dark Eldar Codex, where the horrendous amount of poison weapons seems to be tailor-made to kill what's left of the wimpering Nidzilla lists.
</li></ul></li><li> Chaos Space Marines, circa 2011. As a whole, many units and unit builds are simply so powerful (the "Lashprince" being the most common, also Obliterators and Plague Marines) that they are used in exclusion of other units that are otherwise perfectly decent (Chaos Space Marines themselves, Chaos Raptors, Lesser Daemons), and others that are so terrible that no one dares use them (Dreadnoughts, Possessed, and Spawn). As such, the most commonly-sighted Chaos Space Marine army features two "Lashprinces", nine Obliterators, and the remaining points are spent entirely on Plague Marines, when other armies would kill to have even some of the less-popular units in the army book.
</li><li> Orks get a big cheese with their new codex. A unit called Nobz (essential Ork "nobles") are able to be put on bikes. You take 9 of those, add a painboy (doctor), also on a bike. He allows the Nobz to ignore wounds, and gives them Cybork armor (which gives them an invulnerability save of 5 or higher). The Nobz on bikes are able to move really fast, very easily, give the nobs extra toughness and a 4+ Armor save (compared to the normal 6+), and a 4+ cover save, so you always have a chance to negate a hit. Combine this with their 2 wound and the painboys making them Feel No Pain, they are very, very good, and the winner of the grand tournament field these. Their only downside is their ludicrous points cost. Also, due to rules regarding wound allocation, an Ork player can usually distribute numerous wounds among individual Nobz with different equipment, drastically reducing the chances of outright killing a Nob in a round of shooting or combat. Eventually answered with the Imperial Guard codex, which readjusts the Guardsmen in such a way that they are the worst enemy of the Nobz. When you're facing forty-plus hits, even the most judicious wound allocation is still going to cost you the entire unit. The Nobz Mobz have essentially evaporated.
</li><li> Dark Eldar's "Dark Light Storm" the whole army exists to spam as many Dark-Light Weapons (It sort of makes sense in context, Dark Light being the closest we can describe it) in the army as possible, taking 6 units of Kabal Warriors, each unit is 5 Warriors with one carrying a Blaster, all mounted in Raiders armed with Dark Lances, take 3 Ravagers for heavy support, each carrying 3 Dark Lances, In the Elites section 3 units of 6 Trueborn, 4 carrying Blasters, 2 carrying Dark Lances, again mounted in Raiders armed with more Dark Lances. As for the mandatory HQ take whatever you feel like, you've already got 24 Dark Lances and 18 Blasters. The whole point of this is that Dark Light weapons are Lance weapons, which means they ignore any armor value above a certain point, with very few exceptions (3) they will glance all vehicles on 4s and penetrate on 5+.
<ul><li> An evolution of the Dark Eldar Dark Light Storm is the Venom Spam build, the key difference is fielding much smaller Venom instead of the Raider for transport, but equipping it with 2 Splinter cannons, this gives every unit 12 poison shots, in addition to their normal shooting instead of a single dark lance shot. The Trueborn are fielded at 1 less, being 5 with 4 blasters and 1 dark lance, but overall the army retains its fearsome anti-tank presence whilst boosting its ability to make infantry hordes evaporate. A secondary bonus is that the venom is much smaller allowing for more hijinks with terrain and LOS. At this point it becomes less min-maxing as the only thing the army can't deal with is hand-to-hand combat, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">which it avoids by shooting at a distance.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> As of Sixth Edition, many builds focus on spamming flyers; Chaos Heldrakes, Necron Flying Circus, and Imperial Guard Vendettas are amongst the most popular.
</li><li> Seventh edition has seen Eldar players spam Wraithguard, a unit that is tough to kill and can put down templates of Strength D weapons. What does this mean? The unit has an attack that never misses, can strike multiple enemies, and inflicts shockingly high damage on anything that it hits as long as you don't roll a 1 on a six-sided dice. Strength D weapons instantly kill most infantry and almost always damage vehicles. Their only weaknesses are being vulnerable to big blast templates, short range, and being unable to hit fliers.
</li><li> As of Seventh, GW basically gave up balancing the game at all. Following the force organization rules became optional, Lord of War and Forge World units previously limited to massive-scaled Apocalypse games are allowed in normal lists, and books started including special formations with increasingly ludicrous bonuses for using certain mixes of units. The tournament scene has had to turn to highly detailed house rules to keep things remotely under control.
</li><li> This actually spawned two terms within the fandom (that has since bled into various other wargames as well): "Taxes" and "Target Saturation". The former refers to units that you must take in order for your army to be considered legal; traditionally this was the minimum 1 HQ choice and 2 Troop Choices (which is why good units in those slots are often the most spammed and came at a premium). The reason for the name was because they're often chewing up huge chunks of points that could have otherwise gone to more useful units. With the advent of formations and unbound, people min-maxing their armies have come up with entire spreadsheets of ways to minimize Tax units. Unfortunately part of the balance issue with the current game is that these units were explicitly used to chew up points in an army to balance out the otherwise extremely powerful abilities of other units (A tactical squad and a devastator squad are mechanically identical, except the latter can take four times the heavy and special weapons the former can take and without restrictions on squad sizes either, but the tactical squad is a troop choice and thus manditory). On the other end of the spectrum is "Target Saturation", which means taking duplicates of a single, cost-effective and useful unit in multiples; the idea is that while one or two of them would be killed pretty early on, as long as one of them survives and deals some damage, it justifies taking all of them. If little to none of them die, then it's an even bigger bonus. One of the most infamous cases of this is the Eldar "Scatbike" (A scatter-laser equipped Jetbike); on top of being Troops (and thus bypasses "the tax") it's functionally a bike mounted with a heavy machine gun capable of mowing down heavy infantry and light tanks...in a game dominated by heavy infantry and light tanks which are slower than bikes. While putting one down within a turn or two of shooting isn't much of an issue, their low cost means that you can feasibly bring a <em>few dozen</em> of them to a match.
</li></ul></li><li> In the rather less popular game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Necromunda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Necromunda">Necromunda</a></em>, a Spyrer gang with fewer members became considerably more deadly than a larger one, due to the cost of their upgrades. A 3-man team would challenge even experienced gangs of more conventional origin, and 1- or 2-man Spyre hunts would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">nigh invulnerable</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>, obviously.
<ul><li> Spiked Chains were once thought to be nearly mandatory for optimized Fighter builds. This is not because they are a badass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUser">Improbable Weapon User's</a> dream. It's because they are mechanically superior to almost any other melee weapon, with special properties that make them well-suited to a range of effective melee strategies... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards">of which there are few to begin with</a>. It has since been realized that charging or pouncing (charging but with a jump included) are far superior, and since spike chains aren't useful for this sort of strategy, they have been dropped in favor of weapons better suited for those tactics.
</li><li> In the fourth edition, things have been toned down; however, the Swordmage class almost seems like it was meant to be like this: sink all your points into intelligence, and choose a race with a racial INT bonus as well, leaving you with INT 20. Then take the Intelligent Swordmaster feat, select an origin in the Forgotten Realms locale of Thay, and wear cloth armor; your AC (which gets a class bonus anyway), HP and attacks then all draw from the one bloated stat.
</li><li> To give an idea of how toned down 4e is on this front; the current <em>big thing</em> in minmaxing is a feat that gives you +1 to attack rolls with one weapon or implement. A similar feat in 3e, Weapon Focus, was widely considered by optimizers to be <em>garbage</em>.
</li><li> Highlights of <a class="urllink" href="http://community.wizards.com/go/forum/view/75882/136042/d20_Character_Optimization">(ab)using all 3e sourcebooks<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> include infinite stats, ascending to divinity at level 1, running faster than the speed of light to throw an enemy to the moon, doing thousands of points of damage per round, and leveling cities with a 4th-level spell.
</li><li> Pun-Pun, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">the kobold</a>: ...Oh god where to start. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?442827-Pun-Pun">Read about it here.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
<ul><li> A nearly complete list of Pun-Pun's abilities can be found <a class="urllink" href="http://www.minmaxboards.com/index.php?topic=2705.0">here.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> The creator of Pun-Pun specifically says that it was never meant to be played because it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">way too powerful</a> and that any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">Dungeon Master</a> foolish enough to allow such a character deserves what he gets.
</li><li> Of course, even if the DM was inclined to allow it, that build only works in Forgotten Realms and only if you can somehow justify having encountered the creature whose abilities you're trying to copy (its a single unique creature who only exists in that world). Also, this creature was introduced in an obscure supplement such that if this one player hadn't found the exploit, the book would be mostly forgotten.
</li><li> The most ridiculous of the above mentioned builds generally rely on exploiting an unintended alternate meaning of a word or phrase within a written rule. Min-maxers are now in the habit of distinguishing between RAI (Rules As Intended) and RAW (Rules As Written).
</li></ul></li><li> In earlier editions, darts. Yes, darts. A warrior character could throw three per attack and there was no rule preventing them from getting their full strength bonus from each one. Additionally, weapons had a "weapon speed" which worsened the initiative of the use for clumsy weapons, and darts were fast. This meant that if a fighter at mid-high level had +7 damage from Strength (magic, etc), he could trade a single attack with a two-handed sword (avg damage 12.5) for three attacks (avg damage 9). They were also more likely to beat the enemy to the punch and blow out a wizard's defensive spells. Darts were more than twice as damaging and left you with a shield to boot. The Player's Option series tried to warn the DM about this kind of minmaxing, but given just how lethal 1st and 2nd Edition were...
</li><li> 5th edition is not without the phenomenon either. Warlock and Fighter dips, the Lucky feat, and other silly things get added to characters all the time, though it's not nearly at 3.5 levels.
<ul><li> The problem with Warlock multiclassing is as such: most classes get a powerful class feature in the first three levels that scales with class level, but the Warlock's best feature, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam">Eldritch Blast</a>, scales with total character level. And while many of the Warlock's Invocations are gated behind Warlock level, several useful ones, including all the Eldritch Blast-enhancing ones, are available at level 2. Thus, a wildly disproportionate amount of the Warlock's power is available to anyone who takes two levels in the class.
</li><li> The later addition of the Hexblade Warlock took Warlock level dips to another level. With a single level, characters can get Eldritch Blast, medium armor, shields, martial weapons, Hexblade's curse (a subclass ability that gives bonuses to crits, damage rolls, and gives you temporary hit points upon the targets death), and the ability to use your Charisma bonus for weapon attacks. With a single level, Sorcerers, Bards, and even Paladins gain the ability to completely ignore every stat except Charisma while having a good armor class, attacking stat, and spell casting ability.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantsAndMasterminds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantsAndMasterminds">Mutants &amp; Masterminds</a></em>, being a point-based tabletop RPG, is very easy to min-max. However, the creators seem to realize this and go out of their way to point out potential abuses and give advice for GMs to deal with problem players ("don't let PCs take this" is one such piece of advice). This is, after all, a game where one of the official variants is <em>unlimited</em> points to buy abilities &mdash; as in the only limit is what the player thinks is reasonable.
<ul><li> The points costs is also ludicrously unbalanced; for instance, having a character speak three languages costs more than having them speak <em>every</em> language.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HEROSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HEROSystem">HERO System</a>/<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Champions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Champions">Champions</a></em> has pretty much the same situation. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">Game Master</a> who's willing to veto really game-breaking characters is essential in such cases. It's notable that the game manual itself anticipates min-maxing and provides a few examples of character builds that illustrate the point &mdash; for example, N-man, who sits at the centre of the universe and does nothing but gibber. He sees what he wants with his n-ray vision from lightyears away and blasts it.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Champions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Champions">Champions</a></em>, especially 4th edition, is <em>legendary</em> among min-maxers for what could be done. Among other things, a flaw in the way Aid (the generic term for any power that augments or repairs another) was implemented allowed one min-maxer to use 175 points to give <em>everything</em> he had, including a Variable Power Pool, ten times that. Just as a way of explanation, an area of effect Ranged Killing Attack at that level could destroy something on the order of 2 times 10^20 UNIVERSES or so, and horribly damage ones far beyond that.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em> offers some opportunities for min-maxing. For example, melee weapon damage is based on the STR score. A Troll character gets +4 STR beyond the normal human maximum of 6. Assume your Troll is a Physical Adept with 6 points in Armed Combat skill. You buy a Spell Lock focus and have your Mage friend cast Increase Strength +4 on you - which remains on you as long as you have the Spell Lock item. You spend 1 karma to bond the lock (a pittance compared to the 12 karma it costs to raise your skill from 6 to 7). You do the same for all five other stats, and Reflexes +3d6. Your melee weapon is a Combat Axe. Out of your 6 Magic points you spend 1.5 points to get +6 to Armed Combat rolls. The axe has a damage code of (STR)S. Your Strength is 14, so your damage code is 14S, equivalent to a sniper rifle or a really nice shotgun. With your natural reach and the reach on the axe (total 3), you just need to roll 2 or better on a die for a success unless you're fighting someone who has a long weapon or is a troll with a sword. This means against most people and critters you roll 12 dice and succeed on 10 of them. Even if the target wears the best possible armor he will still die automatically unless he is also a beefed-up Troll with cyber or magic. It's quite possible to destroy cars completely with this Troll.
<ul><li> A more terrible version comes in when you pick up a Weapon Focus (6) combat axe and suddenly roll 18 dice, with 15 of them usual successes. If you toss in Combat Pool you're rolling 24 dice, 20 successes. Slap on a Spell Lock for Armor from a min-maxed Shamanic Sorcerous Adept and you could see a Body score of 25+, like a Great Dragon.
</li><li> Of course, the DM can just as easily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">turn this back on the Troll</a> due to the simple fact that, on a d6 with a target of 2, <em>all</em> "failures", <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BotheringByTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BotheringByTheBook">by definition</a></em>, are rolls of <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalFailure">1</a></strong>.
</li><li> Shadowrun's character creation system is generally built for this sort of playstyle. In <em>Shadowrun</em>, more successes is always a good thing (especially in physical combat), as unlike in D&amp;D it's not a "succeed/fail" duology but "fail/barely succeed/increased degrees of success" gradient. Also, character creation is points-based, not class-based, so your ability to toy with your character's capabilities are much better. On a whole, <em>Shadowrun</em> veterans recommend making a character who is the best that he/she can be at his/her role, instead of trying to make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a> &mdash; sure, your troll melee adept can't open the right side of a first aid kit, read beyond a grade school level or solve any problem not involving "hit things really hard", but that's what the other players are there for.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a></em> is very easy to Min-Max in unless the GM sets firm limits on what options are available to the players. Characters are also theoretically balanced by their point total, but this is only really true in fairly narrow circumstances.
<ul><li> One of the specific ways to min-max in <em>GURPS</em> is by balancing the points spent on IQ with the points spent on IQ-based skills. (The same principles apply to DX-based skills.) A +1 to IQ typically costs 10 to 20 points (depending on edition and the exact number involved), and will also raise your IQ-based skills by +1. Paying to raise all those skills individually by +1 could cost lots more. Optimizing this way was so standard that an "optimize" button was built into the official character-building computer program.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SeventhSea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SeventhSea">7th Sea</a></em> looks to have been designed with min-maxing in mind. The game provides players only one chance to gain extra Hero Points for the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointBuySystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointBuySystem">Point Buy System</a>, called a Hubris. Hubrises are all open-ended and allow the GM to force the character either reroll or deliberately make a bad decision. In addition, taking a Hubris forbids taking a Virtue, a surprisingly powerful ability that a character can only have one of. In addition, the game has characters generate "Drama Dice," which can be added to rolls, used for specific abilities (Virtues, Glamour magic, etc.), and become XP if unspent at the end of a story arc. Drama Dice are assigned based on the character's <em>lowest</em> primary stat, meaning that a well-rounded character has a pretty decent chance of gaining XP faster than one with an obvious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat">Dump Stat</a>. Lastly, all five basic stats are relevant more or less constantly&mdash;Brawn affects melee damage and ability to tank damage, Finesse governs all attack rolls, Wits is used for defense and almost everything out of combat, Resolve resist fear and determines how badly wounds slow you down, and Panache sets how many times you act per combat round. Since everything is bought on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointBuySystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointBuySystem">Point Buy System</a>, this motivates all but the most specific builds (for example, a character specializing in pistols has limited use for Brawn) to avoid having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat">Dump Stat</a>.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheApocalypse">Werewolf: The Apocalypse</a></em> was mostly good about preventing such abuses due to the point build system it used, it did have one major flaw: starting Gnosis, Rage and Willpower were each controlled (respectively) by the character's chosen Breed (3 options), Auspice (5 options) and Tribe (13 options), which awarded variable numbers of points in each of these three primary stats. There were a total of 193 (one tribe allowed only 1 of the breeds) possible combinations The particular combination of Lupus (Breed) Ahroun (Auspice) Stargazer (Tribe) gave the highest starting points in all three stats.

<ul><li> The various <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> video games suffer much the same issues as their PnP progenitors, but with added twists.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonsAndDragonsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonsAndDragonsOnline">Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online</a></em> provides the usual diminishing returns point assignment variant on character creation. <br>However, as with most MMOs, most players come close to minimaxing their preferred stat anyway in both creation and leveling. This ends with the usual game treadmill where the raid bosses get the normal MMO insane stats assigned to them to offset the unlikely, by PnP standards, primary stats and ACs in the 40-70+ range by the level 20 endgame.
</li><li> Single-player games typically have optional "roll the dice" choices on character creation. The true mini-maxer can click dozens to hundreds or more times, looking for the elusive roll with multiple 18s in the primary stats. Especially insidious was the elusive 18/100 "percentile" roll for the earlier editions' STR stat for melee.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor">Devil Survivor</a></em>, there is no weapon or equipment system, making the effectiveness of combat skills depend very heavily on innate stat differences between characters. As players get to distribute stat points to the protagonist each time he levels up, many tend to focus on continuously raising a single stat at the cost of neglecting all others, often resulting in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">very specialized</a>, but unbalanced stat builds. The same applies for the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor2">sequel.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII">Final Fantasy II</a></em>, the first thing you'll want to do in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstTown">First Town</a> is to buy everyone a shield. Shields raise Evasion percentage; Evasion percentage determines chance of evading attacks, turn order, and raises the chance of gaining Agility; Agility goes point-for-point into Evasion percentage; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstableEquilibrium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstableEquilibrium">Evasion percentage...you get the idea</a>. Simply put: the sooner you start raising Agility/Evasion, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneStatToRuleThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneStatToRuleThemAll">the faster you gain Agility/Evasion</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MapleStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MapleStory">MapleStory</a></em> does this with certain builds. While normally it is very much still a min maxer's game (A mage for example can not put one point into DEX or STR, and no one ever puts points into MP or HP), there are dexless and luckless builds involve using stat increasing items for stat deficiency.
<ul><li> In the older versions of <em>MapleStory</em>, the INT stat dictated the amount of MP gained for each level or AP point placed into MP. This MP could be transferred to HP by spending real-world money on AP resets. What this meant was that all classes could gain more HP than normal by adding or equipping INT, accumulating extra MP, and transferring it into HP. Though this method, called HP washing, was ridiculously expensive and would make a character much weaker for a while, it was the only way for certain classes to survive high-level boss fights.
</li><li> The Tempest update removed all secondary stat requirements on equipment, so now everyone can put all their points into their main damage stat with no consequence. But eventually, you'll hit the maximum base stat of 999&mdash;at which point you'd probably put the remaining points into HP/MP due to how little of an impact the secondary stat has on your damage.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII">Diablo II</a></em> is pretty much an exercise in minmaxing.
<ul><li> Every build has optimal stat and skill placement and item choices. Deviating from the build in any way, or heaven forbid trying to make something unique or using whatever equipment you pick up off the ground, ensures that you will have to use effort to get through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">hell difficulty</a>, which only a few builds could realistically do even if you did min-max properly.
</li><li> This is basically because the HP of the monsters continues to increase exponentially through the game even as your skills do; spreading your skill points around and putting less than the maximum number of points in a few key skills effectively create a character who is unable to deal with 'anything' on its own beyond Normal difficulty. There is just no room for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a>.
</li><li> Minmaxing extends to the items as well as characters. Getting items with stats that are perfect or near perfect cost many times more than the going rate, even if the difference is only a 1%.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> franchise:
<ul><li> The character system of the original two games gave plenty of opportunity for minmaxing courtesy of skills and traits (chosen at character creation) and perks (upgrades gained in-game) which varied enormously in usefulness or effectiveness:
<ul><li> Most memorably was the Gifted trait, which sacrificed skill points (which with a good intelligence score you should have plenty of already), to instead gain a bonus to all the SPECIAL stats, that play a much greater role than in the third game. Part of the reason Gifted is so powerful is because Tagging skills doubles the rate they level in those two games. In addition, any particularly useful skill in Fallout 1 has a skill book that could be purchased from a merchant that restocked her inventory. Even with the time limit, you could max every really useful skill and then Tag any one that couldn't be easily raised with skill books.
</li><li> Fallout 2 generally lent itself even more to this sort of thing because, despite featuring basically the same character creation system as the first game, the game was about four times as big. Consequently many of the traits or character build choices that offered legitimate tradeoffs that needed careful consideration in the first game became complete no brainers in the second, such as taking Gifted as described above, and not taking Skilled (all but useless in Fallout 2 where you'll be swimming in skill points anyway) or more than about 4 in Endurance (in the long run it only meant a few extra hit points).
</li><li> The Fast Shot trait, which allowed you to shoot more quickly at the expense of not being able to make targeted shots (i.e. aiming for particular body parts). There was no downside at all if you planned to use burst-fire weapons like machineguns or flamethrowers which you couldn't target.
</li><li> Depending on the weapons you kind of character you wanted to build, there were a number of dump stats such as strength for non-melee characters, endurance for everyone, and charisma. If you needed to raise a particular stat to get a one-off bonus (e.g. needing high physical stats to become a porn star), you could generally just boost them temporarily with drugs.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>:
<ul><li> Each level the player gains grants a number of "skill-up" points. The number of points you gain is dependent on the character's Intelligence stat, so many would-be min-maxers treat it as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneStatToRuleThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneStatToRuleThemAll">One Stat to Rule Them All</a> and max it out as early as possible so as to maximize skill gains. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted">Subverted</a>: high Intelligence early on won't make a character much stronger by end-game. Many skills are nearly useless. It is literally impossible to lower Intelligence enough to prevent the PC from eventually getting 10's in all SPECIAL and 100's in all skills. Then again, a high Intelligence early on will allow the character to max out their useful skills very early, without gaining a huge number of levels, using DLC, or hunting down hundreds of skill books, so you might say that Intelligence is the ideal stat of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">Brilliant, but Lazy</a> characters. Doing a "Rivet City run" to grab the Intelligence bobblehead as soon as possible after leaving the tutorial is still <em>de rigeur</em> for min-maxers, as there's no down side to doing so other than the bother of avoiding encounters on the way there.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> takes steps to avert this. Armor and weapon choice play a much bigger role in your combat success, and it's a lot harder to minmax your stats, forcing you to either focus on a few choice ones or get a decentish spread over a half a dozen or so skills. There are still a few exceptions in the form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxersDelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxersDelight">Min Maxers Delight</a> perks and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat">Dump Stats</a>, though.
<ul><li> The Good-Natured trait is still an example. Trading in combat for non-combat skills is a good way to reallocate points from weapons you never intended to use for an edge in skills that will always be useful. Every good build specializes in a chosen weapon anyway, and the loss there can be recovered in one level.
</li><li> A huge boon to min-maxers is the "Skilled" trait, which raises <em>all</em> skills by 5 points. The cost is a 10% penalty to experience earned, but it's not nearly enough of a hit to keep players from hitting the level 50 cap.
</li><li> Perception can be treated as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat">Dump Stat</a>, unless you are doing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass">Critical Hit Class</a> in which case you will want 6 PER to get a perk that boosts critical damage. It increases the range that your radar can detect places, NPCs , and enemies. Which <em>would</em> be a decent reason to raise it, except that having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotBuddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotBuddy">ED-E</a> as a companion will provide you with maximum radar range regardless of your Perception.
</li><li> Endurance is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneStatToRuleThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneStatToRuleThemAll">One Stat to Rule Them All</a>, as it determines how many cybernetic implants you can get, and cybernetic implants increase the other S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats, essentially making each point spent on Endurance two for the price of one. END 7 will get you +1 to every stat except the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat">Dump Stat</a> Charisma (including END itself, for a final score of 8) plus a nice bit of Damage Resistance.
</li><li> Charisma can still be used as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat">Dump Stat</a>. It does about three things: Increase a speech and barter a little bit, add some dialog options and increase "Companion Nerve", which is a semi-hidden stat that increases the damage and defense of your companions by 5% for each Charisma point. All but the third one are absolutely useless, since a character can easily reach speech and barter 100 even with a CHA of 1. The Nerve stat can be nice, but companions still do plenty of damage without it and you can just put (most of) them in better armour to up their defense, so the points needed to raise it are better spent elsewhere. This is especially true if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdSniper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdSniper">Boone</a> is your companion, and <em>especially</em> if you pair him with ED-E mentioned above. His low defense doesn't matter when he annihilates every red blip on the radar before it can even enter your draw distance.
</li><li> Like <em>Fallout 3</em>'s "Rivet City run," min-maxers will do a "clinic run" to get the Intelligence implant as soon as possible before gaining any levels. Intelligence might not be <em>needed</em> to max all skills, but why not do so a little earlier?
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Almost</em> averted in Fallout 4. High Intelligence is still really useful but simulated with a early level Luck perk, and there's generally no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneStatToRuleThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneStatToRuleThemAll">One Stat to Rule Them All</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing">Min-Maxing</a> is still very powerful as level 10 perks are generally VERY useful, but will be countered by equally huge disadvantages.
<ul><li> Played completely straight in Survival mode. Due to it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> nature, you pretty much have to min-max in order to survive.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceOnline">Ace Online</a></em> is <strong>full</strong> of minmaxing, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hovertank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hovertank">A-gear</a> players <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">comparing the power of their mighty Bigsmashes</a> in terms of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">volume of fire</a>, B-gear players competing for either the most powerful, accurate, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">fast-firing missile (bomb) barrage</a>, and the numerous semi-serviceable weapons being sold at <em>low</em> prices due to market inflation on weapons with the crazy Super or Hyper fixes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dofus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dofus">Dofus</a></em>. Ever since the patch that gave characters 5 HP at each level-up, putting points in more than one attribute is almost always a waste. A very few builds support two attributes. Furthermore, one of the first things a character is expected to do once he gets enough money (or resources, etc.) is to "scroll" himself, which allows him to get 101 free points in an attribute. This is extremely expensive, especially for the most common builds (Wisdom, Intelligence, and Strength cost around 3 times as much as Chance or Agility). Some builds REQUIRE being scrolled from the start, otherwise they are completely worthless.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Pok&eacute;mon is among the more blatant examples as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">a good grasp on the arcane mechanics</a> can allow one to create very specialized Pok&eacute;mon. Even two members of the same species can function very differently provided that they can learn a large number of moves or specialize it certain stats.
</li><li> Almost every single Ultra Beast has one to two stats that are <em>extremely</em> high while having a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat">Dump Stats</a>. Kartana, for instance, has one of the highest attack stat with great speed, but its HP, Special Attack, Special Defense are paper thin. If that's not enough, all of them share the Beast Boost ability, which boosts their highest stat even further when they knock out an opponent.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonCrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonCrawl">Dungeon Crawl</a></em> partially counters this with stat death: if any of many temporary stat draining effects lowers your stat to 0 or lower, you die instantly. This forces troll berserkers to get a modicum of Int, mages to get some Str, heavy armor fighters to get some Dex. You need at least 8 in all stats to avoid being drained in one hit so you can somehow cure the loss.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmoredCore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmoredCore">Armored Core</a></em>, going for "Best Rating" can hurt you in the long run.
<ul><li> Depends, it just paints an impression of a numbers game, you also got to calculate what type of firing radius the gun can pull off (Missiles are good example) and the cost/benefit ratio it has to that build.
</li></ul></li><li> "Danger Mario" mode in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario">Paper Mario</a></em> is a specialized build based around making Mario have <em>as little HP as possible</em> in order to pump up both his FP and his ability to equip lots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePinIsMightierThanTheSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePinIsMightierThanTheSword">Badges.</a> Then you throw on lots of badges which boost attack and raise evasion when Mario's HP is low, making Mario the ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> who can dole out tons of damage each turn AND is nigh untouchable. You'd better keep your Partner up front against the rare enemy that can ignore evasion, though. The "Peril Mario" build takes it a step further, offering even greater destructive power, but only if Mario can stay at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">1 HP.</a></em>
<ul><li> In fact, this is actually a speedrun strategy for the game. Though instead of relying on badges for dodging, Bow's Outta Sight move and Repel Gel are used to avoid damage.
</li><li> Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor">the sequel,</a> where "Danger Mario" becomes "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> Mario" After chapter five, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniGameZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniGameZone">Pianta Parlor</a> allows purchasing power rushes with tokens.

</li></ul></li><li> In early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterRancher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterRancher">Monster Rancher</a></em> games, this was required. Trying to train a balanced monster took time, too much time and the monster becomes useless with old age or dies. Most of the enemies were also min-maxed to be more fair. Although the higher class monsters are good one every stats with one or two relatively lower(but on high numbers) stats.
<ul><li> In general the simplest way to finish the game is to make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> (train everything in Lif, Def, Ski, and preferred offensive stats) mon. This is to minimize the luck factor while building a usable monster to end the game. Alternatively you can made a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> (use Speed instead of Defense) or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> (only train offensive stats and Ski) monster, but it takes more luck to do so.
</li><li> The stats cap system in the DS games also means you need to ditch some stats. Most players go into Max Lif, Max Acuraccy, Max prefered offense, put the rest in Def and make Speed and the other offense as low as possible.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArcanumOfSteamworksAndMagickObscura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArcanumOfSteamworksAndMagickObscura">Arcanum: Of Steamworks &amp; Magick Obscura</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointBuildSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointBuildSystem">Point Build System</a> allows for a lot of flexibility when designing characters, so minmaxing is inevitable.
<ul><li> Notably, it's very easy to create a close-combat nightmare of a character right out of the gate by choosing to play as a half-ogre with the "Raised in the Pits" background. Your character won't be much of a conversationalist, but he <em>will</em> be able to kick a wolf in half with a single blow.
</li><li> However, the absolute <em>king</em> of minmaxing backgrounds is "Beat With An Ugly Stick." The reason is that Beauty is an absolute dump stat; it only affects reactions, and if you start out at a low reaction from someone and you chat them up properly, you'll be instantly raised to neutral with them. In exchange for a low Beauty, you get a major boost to combat-useful stats.
</li><li> "Raised By Monks" increases your perception by 1 in exchange for half your starting gold. You start with 600 gold by default, so you're essentially buying a permanent (and inherent) +1 boost to perception for a measly price of 300 gold. Perception raises sight range (how far you can scroll the screen) and is an important stat for both Technologists and Roguish characters, as it's tied to Firearms and Prowling (Sneaking). Perception is also hard to raise by magical means. A no-brainer for most character builds, 'though close combat specialists who don't worry about backstabbing may find "Beat With An Ugly Stick" to be more useful.

They can then regain that level with a class with high stat gain, gaining a net increase in stats in the process. Do this enough, and you can max your stats. It's one of the more esoteric and obsessive ways in which <em>FFT</em> can be completely broken.
</li><li> <em>System Shock 2's</em> Impossible difficulty more than living up to its name? Forget useless stats like Research and Exotic Weapons and focus on Standard Weapons and the Hacking Skill.
</li><li> This is practically mandatory in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonDefenders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonDefenders">Dungeon Defenders</a></em> due to the limited number of level-up points. If you try to build a purely balanced Hero (of any class) your result will be sub-par at best when you reach the higher levels. It's better to choose between a battle-based build or a tower-based build right away, and configure your characters' numbers accordingly.

</li><li> Nippon Ichi games are built around minmaxing. In most games, you can min-max your character's base stats through Reincarnation (returning to level 1 with all of the stat bonuses accumulated through your original class' lifespan and, if you're not a named character, go into a class with better stat growths). You can min-max your weapons, armor, and accessories. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantomBrave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantomBrave">Phantom Brave</a></em>, you can even min-max dungeons and titles (that give out extra statistical benefits).

Taken to the extreme, you could delay taking all but level 2 (forced on you by the introductory tutorial mission) until becoming a Jedi, thus gaining 18 Jedi levels by the end of the game instead of the normal 8/12 split.
<ul><li> This was difficult with more than one or two levels shifted, though, because, as you approached the "expected to be level 8-ish" areas, you had to rely more on the support friends, who were not really up to the task, especially on hard. Having the actually inadequate Bastila-as-lead dragging around a level 2 piece of tissue paper is quite the experience.
</li></ul></li><li> Choose a MMORPG at random, regardless of the available options for class/race you are expected to choose the best combination for either DPS, tanking or healing, you are also expected to get the best possible build, the best possible skill set and the best equipment, god forbid you use a weapon because you like how it looks (even if it's the second best).
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI">Final Fantasy XI</a></em> is particularly horrible at this, because you get a massive amount of options for weapons and subjobs, yet you are going to be picking the same weapons and handful of subjobs as everyone else. The reason is that any weapon below A skill level (very, very few classes get more than one, several don't even get one at all) basically is going to never reliably hit an enemy no matter how you are equipped. Furthermore, every job has a "best choice" subjob and picking a subjob that's not that particular choice is frowned upon. Note, however, that for the longest time, the game was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> and these things were learned the hard way.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonFighterOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonFighterOnline">Dungeon Fighter Online</a></em>, This is not so much a problem in PVE, because you aren't expected to use the claws of evisceration +10 with the blood metal set, also upgraded, with only points in skills that allow infinite juggle. The PVE is fair enough that nobody cares what build you use as long as you can do decent damage to the enemy. PvP, on the other hand, you need to because everybody else is going to as well, because any seasoned opponent is going to be optimized for PvP, meaning you need your best skills if you want to get more than 2 hits in.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriorsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriorsOnline">Dynasty Warriors Online</a></em> this is a bit of a problem. Issue: Everybody plays confront (direct PvP). Answer: Damage (That stat that governs damage to structures) becomes a dump stat that nobody considers useful. Now, PvP is good a mode or everybody wouldn't be playing it, that's for sure, but every single weapon that will be used commonly needs to have perfect PvP stats. If attack isn't tier 6 or 5 (each stat has a slot it gets upgraded at and the more it takes to upgrade the higher the upgrade will be) then that weapon better be tanking or it's useless. While the fanbase isn't strung up like other games where you get a 16 minute lecture from random people about why you need optimal attack so you can kill them quickly and how anything else is just worthless, but unless you're playing with friends you don't have any freedom to experiment or people won't join you.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Runescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Runescape">Runescape</a></em> has an unorthodox leveling system - Your player's overall Combat level is determined by a combination of your Attack, Strength, Defence, Hitpoints, Ranged, Magic, Prayer and Summoning. This combat level dictates who you can fight in the PvP Zone called the Wilderness (You need to be in a certain range of another's combat level before you can fight them). Some players, designated as "Pures", Min-Max by utterly neglecting certain stats, keeping their total combat level low while massively training specific others. For example, someone could be incredibly strong and accurate, but very bad at defending against things. This can sometimes give people an edge over more rounded people at the same Combat level. These pures are almost universally loathed by other people in the community, though this is utterly justified because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GIFT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GIFT">G.I.F.T.</a> is in full effect with them.
<ul><li> As of the Evolution of Combat update in 2012 this is no longer the case; the update makes it so that neglecting the Defence skill severely hinders pures as Defence is tied to Lifepoint total. This amounts to very little though, as PvP has become very unpopular due to the lack of will most pre-update PvPers had to learn the new mechanics.

On higher difficulties, mages need some constitution in order to survive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AreaOfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AreaOfEffect">Area of Effect</a> attacks, though, and any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> should have some cunning for persuasion skills.

The way to make the absolute strongest character possible, regardless of class, isn't to spend points in areas your class would normally use, but rather to simply pump every single one of your stat points you get at level-up into strength. With all of your stat points going into strength, not only do you hit harder physically but you're also able to carry more, meaning you can then collect tons of perfect-type figurines and get a higher number of overall stat points than you would have if you'd spread out your stat growth. Yes, the best way to get make an Erudite Wizard with a huge intelligence score is to boost his melee damage and carrying capacity just so he can lug around tons of perfect owl figurines. Alternatively, the strength bonus bestowed by bull figurines is such that not only is their weight completely moot, there's still some of the bonus left over to increase your effective capacity. Put two and two together with the item duplication glitch and go nuts.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarusUprising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarusUprising">Kid Icarus: Uprising</a></em> allows you to minmax weapons by using the weapon fusion system, which allows you to combine two weapons into a different one, with some attributes from the two weapons to be fused being transferred to the new weapon in the process. As weapon value affects your team's life bar in Light vs Dark and gives your opponents more points for defeating you in free-for-all, a popular strategy is to fuse a weapon with a negative effect such as heart bonus -4 or status resistance -4 in order to allow for either a lower overall value or to put more useful stat bonuses on the weapon than you could otherwise. Since the effects that get passed on weapon during fusion are chosen semi-randomly, there are naturally guides out there which explain how the fusion engine chooses which bonuses get passed on when fusing two weapons, maximizing the player's chances of getting a perfectly minmaxed weapon that they are after.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FallenLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FallenLondon">Fallen London</a></em> encourages this. Most equipment gives a bonus to one attribute and a penalty to another.

Each individual skill is maxed out at 5 points (bar some major skills that only take 1), and as a result, many a player tend to put all their points into one skill to make their way down, instead of spreading their points more thinly among the other skill(s) per tier.

You can level up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneStatToRuleThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneStatToRuleThemAll">one stat</a> on purpose while maintaining low level for better multiplayer PvP experiences, as most stats have softcap at 30-40.
<ul><li> Strength:, if you are a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmCannon">Cannon</a> user, all you need to do is to raise your Strength to 30 under Military Veteran class, grab all 3 Formless Oedon runes, and farm as many Bone Marrow Ash as possible.

If you start with Noble Scion as starting class, you can reach 40 Bloodtinge at Level 30. The only runes you need are Oedon Writhe (all three variants) for replenishing Quicksilver Bullets.
</li><li> Arcane: Perhaps the most useful stat, not only it raises item discovery, most spells allow you to defeat bosses at ease, resulting in the situation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards">Linear Warriors, Quadratic Wizards</a>. a notable example includes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">A Call Beyond</a>.

Endurance, the stat governing equipment load (how much weight you can bear before you start to feel the effects) and maximum stamina, stops granting more stamina at 40, but it keeps giving you higher equip load all the way up to 99. One common strategy is to find a weapon that has high base damage but low stat scaling, so you can keep your Strength and Dexterity low while putting all of your points into Endurance to crank up your equip load. With the right rings, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">you can ninja flip around the battlefield with a greatsword and armor carved from rock</a>.

A character designated as a battery is one that consumes less meter and builds more for the rest of their team, they're usually placed first or second in a team. Meanwhile, an anchor is usually a character who can deal a lot of damage but requires a lot of meter, meaning they're saved for last.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CapcomVsSNK2MarkOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CapcomVsSNK2MarkOfTheMillennium">Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium</a></em> takes this a step further with its "Groove" system. Each "groove" has its own kind of super meter, on top of additional skills. The most important skill is rolling, since a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBug">glitch</a> allows the invincibility of a roll to be transferred over to a move. This means that the best characters in the game are those that work well with the grooves with rolling (C, A, N and K). Team building then involves finding characters that work best with these grooves, while also considering the traditional rules on team composition and meter build.
</li></ul></li><li> Tag team fighting games, especially those with assists, are the king of this trope, especially some form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssistCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssistCharacter">assist</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinationAttack">team</a> attack is involved.

This synergized well with Dr. Doom's Molecular Shield assist which had him generate a field of rocks that he then threw at his opponent.

<ul><li> The game allows you to take various advantages or disadvantages during character creation. Stacking advantages makes you more powerful, but has the drawback of causing you to level up much more slowly. Stacking disadvantages has the opposite effect. As such, it is possible to take disadvantages that your race or class cancels out, while still getting the boost to level up rate. One prominent example is to play as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies">Altmer (High Elf)</a>, who have a natural immunity to paralysis, then take "Weakness to Paralysis" as a disadvantage. The game considers it a significant disadvantage, greatly boosting the speed at which you level up, but you never actually experience the consequences.
</li><li> Taking all of the various "Weakness to Fire", "Weakness to Frost", etc. disadvantages grants you a greater boost to your level up rate than taking the "Immunity to Magic" advantage penalizes you. Immunity to Magic makes all of these weaknesses completely moot.

When you level up, you get to select bonuses to three of your attributes with multipliers based on how many times you increased skills that are governed by those attributes. (For example, the Strength attribute governs the Long Blade skill. If you increase the Long Blade skill 10 times in one level either through use, training, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareCandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareCandy">skill books</a>, you'll get a x5 multiplier to your Strength attribute.) As such, in order to level in the most efficient way possible, many guides advise you to tag skills you rarely or never intend to use as your Major/Minor skills. While you'll miss out on the bonuses these tagged skills receive at the start of the game, you can easily make up the difference using the game's numerous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">Disc One Nukes</a> and plentiful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyForNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyForNothing">Money for Nothing</a> to get through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyGameHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyGameHell">Early Game Hell</a>.

Enemies level scale based purely on your level, but your actual strength in combat involves many factors besides just level (health gain per level, attributes, equipment, and skills). As such, leveling up with too many non-combat skills is likely to result in an insignificant bonus to your abilities, but all enemies still increase in strength. Even if you've been careful in your leveling, damage caps at a certain point while health does not, meaning high-level fights become increasingly drawn-out with even standard foes becoming damage sponges without providing much challenge. While becoming a full blown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin">Munchkin</a> is only necessary to max out all of your attributes, it is encouraged that you incorporate some elements of Min-Maxing toward your combat skills in order to have a less difficult time.

The point system for each line went to rank 6 and the amount of points available at max level allowed you to have three lines at rank 6, one at rank 5 and one at rank 3. But an alternative was ranking up four lines at rank 6 and leave one skill tree entirely empty, as at rank 6 you typically got some massive bonus to the abilities offered to compensate for the one that's missing. Since class and species lines would improve your passive strength and durability, the question usually became which power you are willing to forgo. The result tends to be a more specialized character, but with the right play style and synergy of abilities is a much more powerful character.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiscoElysium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiscoElysium">Disco Elysium</a></em> deconstructs the concept, and even has what can be considered a sort of an <em>Anti</em>-Min-Maxing mechanic. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">The Detective</a>'s skills is not merely "skills", but also semi-automonous parts of his personality, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganAutonomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganAutonomy">heavily implied to be based in his different sensory-organs</a>. Investing points in skills leads said skills to become voices in the Detective's head, who gives him advice on the situations he is facing, but the problem is, their advice, helpful or otherwise, will almost always pertain to their specific bodily function with little understanding of situations that do not call for them. The game treats this as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalWeakness">Logical Weakness</a>, as the Detective's adrenal gland does not understand the finer points of social protocol, and his mirror neurons are little help during a physical altercation, but that won't stop them from chiming in if they are strong enough, and the more points put into them, the more powerful their voices are. This results in all of the skills being double-edged swords &mdash; the higher they are, the more they shape the Detective's thoughts and control him. What begins as advice can eventually become a compulsion, restricting what dialogue options the player can choose in certain circumstances or just becoming overbearingly loud compared to the other skills. The end result is that Min-Maxing results in less a character excelling in one specific area over all others, and more a character who becomes completely subsumed by that area &mdash; as the strongest skill manifests itself as a personality abberation, encouraging potentially harmful acts and even blocking off crucial dialogue trees.

<ul><li> The various Naval treaties of the Interwar Period caused no shortage of Min-Maxing when it came to <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_battleship">ship design<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Because the treaties set strict limits on the number of and weight of ships, signatories spent a great deal of effort trying to work around the rules. One Min-Max technique used by the British and the French was to place all the big guns on the forward part of the ship to shorten the length of the heavy armoured citadel, at the expense of a 360 degree arc of fire. <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_or_nothing_(armor)">All or nothing<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> armouring schemes were also employed to provide the maximum protection to critical areas with non-critical areas being deemed expendable. Guns were packed into triple and quadruple turrets to further reduce the weight overhead at the expense of redundancy.
</li><li> Tank armor requires this because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareCubeLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareCubeLaw">Square-Cube Law</a> is a lot harsher for land vehicles than it is for ships. If you made the armor the same thickness in all directions, you'd have one of two outcomes: either it's thick enough to protect against enemy tank shells from every angle, while being so heavy the vehicle can't move; or it's light enough for mobility, but not thick enough for <em>any</em> part to stop a tank shell. Therefore, you've got to add armor to the most frequently attacked places while removing it from others.
<ul><li> The front of the hull and turret should be the most armored because that's the side that the tank presents to the enemy regardless of whether it's attacking or defending. There's synergy between designing a tank to be longer than it is wide, and concentrating the armor on the front: because the tank has a smaller profile from the front than from the side, you don't add as much weight by making the front <em>x</em> thickness compared to making the side <em>x</em> thickness. Up through the first half of World War II there were some tanks like the KV-1 and Tiger I which had upper side plates of comparable thickness to their fronts, which made sense for their breakthrough role which involved taking fire in the sides as well as the front. However once the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LensmanArmsRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LensmanArmsRace">Lensman Arms Race</a> of large, high-velocity guns really got going, there was no choice anymore but to lighten the sides in order to thicken the front, so at least that part would stand a chance against a full-sized anti-tank gun. The thinking became that the sides should stop anti-tank rifles and the lightest of anti-tank guns&mdash;maybe even a tank shell given a steep enough angle&mdash;but stopping a square-on main gun shell was just too much to ask. The rear would be no more armored than the sides, and honestly if you were doing your job right the enemy wouldn't ever see your rear.
</li><li> Tanks also came to be armored more above than below. When a tank comes up over a hill, you first see the turret front, then the hull's upper front plate, and finally the lower front plate. Depending on the slope of the hill and the maximum gun depression, the tank can hide the lower front plate or hopefully the entire hull so that only the turret needs to be exposed in order to fire. Thus, it makes more sense for the turret to have better all-around protection than the hull, and to save some weight on the lower front plate. The lower sides can also be thinner than the upper sides, partly because the tank's running gear provides a bit of a buffer against incoming ordnance.
</li><li> The belly can be quite thinly armored in comparison because few threats come from below. There are land mines to think about, and US gunners during World War II figured out how to destroy heavily-armored <em>Elefants</em> by bouncing a high explosive shell to explode under the thinner belly armor, but you've got to make sacrifices somewhere. Another place where you need to sacrifice thickness is the top. It&#146;s possible that a huge high explosive artillery shell will land directly on the roof and wreck you, but that&#146;s fairly improbable compared to lesser threats like grenades, Molotov cocktails, and fragments from an artillery shell exploding nearby. Enemy dive bombers and fighter bombers became a threat during World War II, but their unguided bombs and rockets were inaccurate, and defense consisted mainly of evading or using antiaircraft fire to force <em>them</em> to evade and mess up their aim. There was really no protection against a large bomb landing right on top of or next to the tank, so why bother? Roof armor did get thicker during the Cold War as ground attack planes and helicopters advanced, but to a large extent you have to rely on accompanying anti-aircraft vehicles and friendly fighters to shoot down the enemy fliers instead of overloading on roof armor for what is supposed to be a ground combat vehicle.
</li><li> And finally, the most vulnerable part of the tank: the running gear. Some tank designs have tried to protect the tracks with armor, with the German <em>Maus</em> prototype almost completely enclosing the tracks and suspension, but this can be impractically heavy and makes it more difficult to access the tracks for repairs when they <em>do</em> break. At some point, you've just got to accept the fact that the tracks <em>will</em> get blown off sooner or later: the important thing is that the crew survives and the tank is intact enough to repair.
</li></ul></li><li> Tank armament followed the same principle.
<ul><li> During the interwar period there was experimentation with multi-turreted tanks. These generally had one big gun and an assortment of intermediate guns and machine guns, divided between up to five rotating turrets. Unfortunately this made the weight, volume, and crew requirement of the tank excessive, while limiting the maximum size of the biggest gun. As the shape of tank combat in World War II emerged, it became clear that you needed a bigger gun than the enemy so you could not only penetrate his thick armor, but do so at a distance where his gun wasn't powerful enough to do the same to you. A medium turret plus two or more small turrets weren't as useful as one large turret that could mount a much bigger gun, and with enough space inside for a commander, gunner, and loader to work effectively.
</li><li> The other benefit of having just one big gun was that you could fire larger high explosive shells, which were very effective against enemy infantry, artillery, and buildings. This, combined with proper combined arms tactics, meant that you needed at most three machine guns to protect the tank: a hull MG manned by the bow gunner, a coaxial MG paired with the main gun, and a commander's MG on an anti-aircraft mounting outside his hatch. This was further streamlined in the Cold War when the bow gunner was deleted, reducing the number of crew to four and allowing either more ammo racks to be put in, or a reshaping of the hull front to better deflect shells.
</li><li> Another benefit relates to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyLogistics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyLogistics">Easy Logistics</a>; with a smaller variety of guns, you need a smaller variety of ammunition to keep your army properly supplied, which is easier for manufacturing back home to build it in sufficient bulk, less of an organisation headache for logistics in the middle, and less confusing for loaders in the frontline when they may not have time to think about the size of shell they've just picked up and why it doesn't fit the gun.
</li></ul></li><li> According to Richard Feynman an AI with heuristics did just this. Entered into a Naval war game tournament, it decided to use all available resources to make one giant battleship and won. Once this tactic was banned it proceeded, the next year, to make numerous tiny boats with one gun each to swarm the enemy; it won again. The next year the computer was banned altogether.
