Intense exercise can let you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">split boulders</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InASingleBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InASingleBound">jump three stories straight up</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindfoldedVision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindfoldedVision">"see" while wearing a blindfold</a>, and make your skin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness">bulletproof</a>... somehow.
</p><p>A lot of characters have out-and-out superhuman abilities, and the explanation for such powers is just "They <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">trained really hard</a> for several years. Train, and you, too, can bash mountains open <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UseYourHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UseYourHead">with your head</a>." Western comic book <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero">superheroes</a>, often stated to "lack superpowers", nevertheless are clearly able to hold their own and defeat villains with superhuman strength many times their own simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowKarate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowKarate">by knowing how to perform martial arts</a>. "Non-superpowered" characters such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> could beat almost anyone in a fight, dodge bullets and withstand ridiculous amounts of damage because they spent a few years living and training atop a mountain.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Although most of the western versions of this trope don't have explicitly supernatural abilities, they can do things that would be impossible for normal humans. Asian and Asian-based fiction is somewhat different, as such examples are generally grounded in Eastern mysticism, involving the development and focusing of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation">chi</a></em> (AKA <em>qi</em> or <em>ki</em>). The superpower here is thus of a more traditional sort than in Western examples, though the training is still the significant factor; Average Joe can't harness his <em>chi</em> half as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Krillin</a>. You might as well go ahead and apply your own mental <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/JustifyingEdit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/JustifyingEdit">Justifying Edit</a> to all such examples below, as this "explains" everything from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a></em> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em>.
</p><p>Or, to put it a different way, there are essentially two different variations on this trope. The first, "Don't-Call-Them-Superpowers", is the western version and has the character performing feats that are not strictly realistic, but at least seem plausible enough. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">Improbable Aiming Skills</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotPoweredStamina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotPoweredStamina">Plot-Powered Stamina</a>, and extreme cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeParkour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeParkour">Le Parkour</a> are some frequent results of this, and many a character manifesting this form of Charles Atlas Superpower will be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadAssNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadAssNormal">Bad Ass Normal</a> (though note not all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadAssNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadAssNormal">Bad Ass Normal</a> characters display this trope, the training and dedication is a key component). The second, "Skill-Trumps-Physics", has the character performing feats that are out-and-out impossible in real life, with an explanation not attributed to any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Phlebotinum</a> but instead because "they are just that damn good". This system meshes well with the idea of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation">chi</a>, though it doesn't require it, and arguably the full-on magic powers often seen in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation">Ki Manipulation</a> constitute a third form of the trope anyway. The line between the variations can be messy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoconutEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoconutEffect">subjective</a>, but as a brief example: a climber who can consistently scale a rock wall faster than the world-record holders would be the first, a climber who can scale a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteppingStonesInTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteppingStonesInTheSky">sandstorm</a></em> would be the latter, and someone who can climb a slick glass skyscraper would be somewhere in between.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The standard line here is that "the average person only uses ten to fifteen percent of their potential strength." It's possible for the brain to use far more muscle power than the person would normally consider their limit, but usually only by shutting down most other major body processes- digestion, the immune system etc.- and flooding the body with adrenaline. Otherwise known as the "fight or flight" response. In other words, it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">Dangerous Forbidden Technique</a> only ever used for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> moments. It's common for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtoSuperhero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtoSuperhero">Proto-Superhero</a> to derive his or her extraordinary talents this way, as such characters pre-date most stock superpower-origin stories.
</p><p>As a narrative device, this trope emphasizes that the character is extremely dedicated to their work. For instance, Batman's abilities fit nicely with his obsessive mindset: He couldn't have acquired this much skill if he wasn't truly dedicated. It can also make your character seem a little more realistic, since intensive training really can give you cool abilities in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, just not to the extent that you often see in comics.

This sort of idea was around long before and after Charles Atlas, however, as <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160729180303/http://www.davidszondy.com/future/man/self-made.htm">the ever-brilliant David S.

Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkHardlyWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkHardlyWorks">Hard Work Hardly Works</a>. God forbid that you give the character actual superpowers and make them an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpoweredBadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpoweredBadassNormal">Empowered Badass Normal</a>.

</p><p>The inverse to this trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxingLessonsForSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxingLessonsForSuperman">Boxing Lessons for Superman</a>, where an already-superpowered character trains in a mundane skill.

If it turns out the "mundane"-level power actually <em>was</em> a gift, that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeSuperPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeSuperPowers">Real-Life Super Powers</a>.

He also apparently has the jaw strength to nonchalantly bite people's fingers clean off, but that's neither here nor there. The author has said that the reason Claire doesn't get his own plotline is because he is the strongest character in the series.

</li><li> Guts from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> is a monster of a man who swings a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">BFS</a> with frightening speed and has survived more than two years' worth of relentless demon attacks, many of which would have killed a normal man many times over. The justification is that he has spent literally his entire life on battlefields, meaning he's also spent most of it in battle. Wielding a sword most of the day for every day of your life will eventually add up, it seems. The manga states that surviving the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hellgate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hellgate">Eclipse</a> left Guts on the boundary between the physical world and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritWorld">Spirit World</a> where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">belief shapes reality</a>, allowing him to gradually turn himself into a literal superhuman through sheer willpower... but he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">tough enough to fight and wipe out a 100-man unit</a> even when he was a perfectly normal soldier.
<ul><li> Even Guts's <em>sword</em>, the Dragon Slayer, can be considered a version of this. Guts unknowingly gave it the power to harm <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh Invulnerable</a> beings, simply by killing so many supernatural creatures with the weapon that their essence rubbed off on it and anchored it in a higher plane of existence.
<ul><li> Plenty of other characters apply to this trope as well such as Griffith when he was human (since he beat Guts twice) Casca, Pippin, Judeau, Azan, and Serpico.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidSideKick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidSideKick">Isidro</a> is getting there, though despite being trained by Guts, he is firmly told by his mentor that he won't reach Black Swordsmen's level by copying him as Guts had many brutal years to hone his blade while Isidro is still a child. However Guts also encourages the boy to develop his own style, which did help Isidro kill a troll-a creature much stronger than a regular human.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat">Black Cat</a></em> is rife with this &mdash; the setting includes an entire martial art dedicated to punching bullets &mdash; but what's notable is that the beneficiaries of this trope are for the most part more powerful than characters with genuine supernatural abilities: when Belze fights Kyoko, he notes that she's using her Taoist abilities to enhance her speed... then promptly declares that, at said speed, it's ridiculous for her to even be trying to hit him. The extreme example, though, is Sephiria's ability to disintegrate people (literally nothing left) with her sword just by hitting them a lot, really hard. Even some of the more normal characters like Saya and Kevin still have some ridiculous skills.
</li><li> Asta from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover">Black Clover</a></em>. He is exceptionally strong and agile for his age, a trait he received through own hard work and training. This has gotten to the point that when combined with his grimoire he can cleave through giant constructs made of <em>diamond</em>. It's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers">Required Secondary Power</a>, since the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a> swords his Grimoire summons are very heavy, and thus unwieldy for the average person.

A steel beam falls on him from several stories up, and he takes it like it was a weak punch. Also, his first encounter with a hollow was before he was able to see them, so Rukia told him where to swing his bat. Or at least the telephone pole he uprooted and was using as a bat.
</li><li> Go Koga, an anime-only filler character, manages to beat up Ichigo using only his physical strength, which is odd at first because his race was established to rely exclusively on familiars to fight. He then explains that his strength is not the result of his Bount powers, but rather, it's the inherent strength of his human body.
</li><li> While Ichigo is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToBadass">Brought Down to Badass</a> during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, his physical body retains the strength and reflexes gained through months of fighting monsters and dragging a giant sword around. He can still wipe the floor with pretty much any normal human even before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantStayNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantStayNormal">Can't Stay Normal</a> kicks in.

An example of her abilities is when she takes down some Gang Members riding motorcycles using a spin-kick to take one down, and a Chun-Li style Lightning Kick to take down the others, while the motorcycle is torn to bits. Spectators only see her do these insane attacks within two seconds.

<ul><li> Suzaku Kururugi is stronger and faster than normal humans. This is demonstrated rather memorably when he dodges fire from an automated ceiling-mounted machine gun, runs up a nearby wall, and destroys the turret with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurricaneKick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurricaneKick">Hurricane Kick</a> (and all of this <strong>before</strong> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he got geassed</span>). The geass placed on Suzaku <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">was the command to live, removing all hesitation during combat and made him use his super human reflexes optimally, moving fast enough to beat even someone who could see the future</span>. Apparently, this was going to be explored at some point, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> with the second season forced the writers to focus on other plotlines and leave this unexplained.
</li><li> Kallen performed a couple feats that could be said to be inhuman. In the first episode of the second season, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kallen jumps over a chess table and takes out several guards with a spin-kick</span>. She can also karate chop a bumblebee in half while it's in mid-flight, without even turning to look at it. This isn't nearly as impressive as Suzaku... except that she's never said to be trained in anything. She just has a lot of exercise gear in her room.
</li><li> Sayoko, who jumps her own height in a rather fabulous manner, and displays impressive combat skill. She's a maid. Well, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaMaid">Ninja Maid</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She was also trained as a Japanese SP... or a ninja, but she denies that.</span> Of course, she spent at least the last five years in a very low-impact lifestyle, caring for Nunnally, so any training she may have had should have long deteriorated unless she has a stellar self-exercise routine.
</li></ul></li><li> Hei of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack">Darker Than Black</a></em> is an extremely agile martial artist with amazing reflexes who can jump from heights unscathed. These qualities are also true of his sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a>, Wei. And they both have <em>actual</em> superpowers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpoweredBadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpoweredBadassNormal">to boot</a>. Notably, in fight between the two, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime">Bullet Time</a> effects are somewhat implausibly used.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba">Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</a>,</em> the Total Concentration Breathing technique used by the Demon Slayer Corps involves the user deep breathing in a way that increases the circulation of oxygen through their body and their blood, strengthening their physical attributes and heightening their mental concentration to the point that they can match the supernatural speed, reflexes, and power of the titular demons they hunt. Being able to utilize the technique and the Breath Styles of swordsmanship requires intense, painful and repetitive training, but once mastered, Demon Slayers can leap dozens of feet, slice cleanly through boulders with swords, slow the circulation of poison in their system, immediately cloat wounds, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep">Flash Step</a>, among other things. The series explicitly notes that the superhuman feats of speed, endurance and power that Demon Slayers who use Total Concentration Breathing and Breath Styles display are non-supernatural in nature, as opposed to the unambiguously supernatural powers of demons and their diverse array of spells, the Blood Demon Arts.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>: Ran is well acquainted with this trope. She's been studying karate for years, and over the course of the series, has casually bent and broken the poles of streetlights with her fist, kicked down doors, knocked out men <em>far</em> bigger than her, smashed through a glass window without being winded, jumped from her second-floor apartment's window to the street with no problem, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kicked the blade of a knife in half, and dodged a bullet</span>. Oh, and she looks just like any other waif-ish high school girl.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan">D.Gray-Man</a></em> most of the superhuman abilities of the characters are granted by a phlebotinum (innocence or dark matter). However several exorcists have shown that they are able to perform superhuman feats like Super Jump or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> without the use of phlebotinum, namely Allen Walker (capable of holding his own against a level 3 akuma, a monster who would take several dozens of humans at once with his pure physical abilities), Howard Link (capable of smashing a level 3 into a wall with a kick) or Madarao (casually stopping a direct blow of a level 3 with one hand). The two latter's are former Crows, a unit of expertly trained enforcers and the former is an exorcist (they are shown to train very hardly).
</li><li> Masaru from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers">Digimon Savers</a></em>, over the course of a single day (the first episode), beat up over a dozen thugs, fought a strong Rookie-level Digimon for a least a few hours, and later punched out a 20-foot chicken while dodging its laser blasts. Just how he does things like this is never explained, but seems to be due in part to the Digisoul/Digimon Natural Ability. Or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamarckWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamarckWasRight">Lamarck Was Right</a>.

</li><li> While most of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>'s cast are superhuman, this trope is the basis behind how they can increase their battle skills and strength to challenge their latest opponents. A core facet of this is <em>ki</em>, the lifeforce of all living beings that can increase through training, eventually allowing you to pool it and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation">fire it as an attack</a>, move it to fly, and achieve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> levels of strength. This trope is played more straight with the human cast: humans are weak beings, but characters like Krillin are able to keep up somewhat through training alone and remain useful allies for the Saiyans, who have far greater ki "potential". Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero">Mr. Satan</a> and Yajirobe, who have no knowledge of ki and only do ordinary training, can still pull 4 buses at once and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep">Flash Step</a>.
<ul><li> It's best displayed during the Buu saga during the Tournament where the Z-Fighters use the punch machine, but control their ki to hold back their result. Regular old humans can get up to 97 points but Krillin, even with a love-tap, gets 192. Goku, with his amazing ki control, couldn't even go lower than 186. Vegeta, not holding back, destroys the machine completely, leading Videl to justly question Gohan whether his friends are human or not.

He can kill a lion with his barehand, cut down a tree with a single swing from his spear, and catch an arrow from midair.

<ul><li> Shizuo's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> is a result of taking both the "removing unconscious limiters" and "bones rebuild themselves with a higher density" explanations to their logical extremes. By the time he's in high school, he can shrug off getting hit by a truck and still find the energy to try and beat Izaya to death with a door (which he ripped off of its hinges, of course) in the same night.
</li><li> Similarly, Shizuo's archnemesis Izaya is faster and more agile than any supposedly "normal" human has a right to be, and that's before we get into his ability to routinely shrug off physical abuse from Shizuo that should have left him a bloody pulp.
</li><li> Simon is even more inexplicable: he's strong and tough enough to <em>restrain Shizuo</em>, though he avoids combat whenever possible and most still count Shizuo as being the stronger of the two. Still, while there is an explanation for Shizuo, there is none for Simon except perhaps that he and his boss are both Russian paramilitary expatriates.

<ul><li> Eraser Head wields a "capture weapon" &mdash; a giant, super-strong scarf used to entangle enemies &mdash; and can use it to create <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantKnots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantKnots">Instant Knots</a> and throw people around. He's able to fight a horde of villains with mutation quirks (which he can't erase) using only his martial arts skills.
</li><li> Sir Nighteye is able to punch Rappa's clone so hard he leaves a crater in the wall, and is able to throw his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUser">five-kilogram seals</a> like bullets.
</li><li> Stain's quirk cannot be activated until after he's ingested someone's blood, yet he is able to go toe-to-toe with heroes who should dramatically outclass him in speed and strength with just his blades and skill. That said, if he does manage to land a hit, he's effectively won.
</li><li> The fact he is six feet of brick shithouse muscle comparable to All Might's musculature makes it easy to forget that Endeavor's Quirk doesn't do anything to his physical abilities. The guy still punches around bullet proof Nomu and fell higher than skyscrapers after a grueling battle already brought him to his limits.
</li><li> Similar to Endeavor and Sir Nighteye, Mirio Togata's Quirk doesn't affect his physical strength, but he trained his body so intensely that he was able to hold himself for a full 5 minutes against Overhaul <em>after</em> Mirio lost his Quirk. In fact, Mirio was so good, All Might even considered him to be a potential next user for One For All.

<ul><li> Chakra is a fundamental part of the human anatomy in the series, so it is sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a>. The entire premise is that everyone is a potential Charles Atlas.
</li><li> Rock Lee practically embodies this trope, even by ninja standards. Not having the ability to control chakra, he constantly trains with insane exercises like always wearing leg weights that appear to have the same mass as a small house. Each.
</li><li> On a similar note, the show, and in particular Rock Lee, seems to reference the unconscious inhibition that the mind places on the body via the Eight Gates. However, opening them to go into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a> will quickly lead to exhaustion, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">opening all Eight Gates</a> leads to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade">death</a></em>. The purpose of the Gates is essentially to allow the user to go past the basic human limitations and use 100% of their full physical power.
</li><li> Lee's mentor Might Guy possesses physical power that makes his student look like a pillowcase in comparison. In Six Gates Mode, Guy punches so fast that his fists set on fire simply due to friction, and in Seven Gates Mode, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he punches the air so hard that it compresses into a giant exploding tiger head, the size of an island, by <em>physical strength alone</em></span>. However, this has more to do with the Gates than him specifically. His <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> father, the "Eternal Genin", used all Eight Gates at once, and curbstomped the seven strongest swordsmen in the world. All at once. With what we've seen on screen of it, the Eighth Gate allows the user to <em>bend space</em> with their speed, and break their own legs by kicking someone. Of course, that kick would probably turn a normal person into paste</span>.
</li><li> The Third Raikage has superhuman resilience from training alone. His lightning armor is its own brand of absolute defense, but with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway">wind abilities</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors">able to take it out</a>, he has trained himself to be so resilient that even the <em>Rasen-shuriken</em>, the most powerful known <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway">wind technique</a> up to that point, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">does not affect him</a>. He also has the endurance and strength to rival a tailed beast, unarmed and unarmored, and he goes out by managing to take on <em>10,000 soldiers for 3 days</em> before dying of exhaustion.

Every power mentioned in the trope description&mdash; most often <em>literally the intentionally hyperbolic description given</em>&mdash; is displayed by someone in the series.

Zoro slices through rocks and steel like paper, and can lift buildings. Sanji's incredible kicks allow him topple giants, have kicks superheated by friction to the point they actually <em>ignite</em>, and even <em>walk on air</em>. By the end of the Dressrosa Arc, the only Straw Hats who hadn't got in on the action are Chopper (whose Devil Fruit ability gives him actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a>) and Nami (who by that point had settled into a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a> role).

<ul><li> Parodied with the main character, who through training becomes strong enough to defeat any opponent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">with one punch</a> (and he lives in a world where city-destroying monsters are quite common).

Neither of the people he told this believe that's actually how he got so strong, guessing there must be some other reason Saitama himself doesn't understand.
</li><li> Several monsters indicate that they gained their powers and transformations by doing one thing obsessively, such as eating huge amounts of crab and turning into a crab monster. Interestingly, this is technically what Saitama did; obsessively strength training every single day without fail for three years straight turned him into the strongest man alive.

(The series itself does somewhat attempt to justify all of the Charles Atlas Superpowers: Soujirou spent his childhood carrying heavy objects and sealed away his emotions due to abuse; Aoshi is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja">Ninja</a> and thus an expert in stealth techniques; Usui's blindness subsequently enhanced the senses already sharpened by years of training; etcetera.) Of particular note is Sano's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> that lasted only a week and taught him to punch in a special way that would make things explode.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBatmanAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBatmanAdventures">The Batman Adventures</a></em> #6, it was a plot point that Bruce Wayne is capable of an unassisted ten-foot vertical jump (the world record is <em>four</em>). He would later move away from this, winning battles less because of training and more because of tactics. One could say that Batsy's power is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis">Awesomeness by Analysis</a> to an amazing degree; he makes sure he can analyze any weakness as quickly as possible. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a> is largely responsible for switching Batman's primary ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a>, but he still managed to, having tea with a monk, <em>reflexively</em> swap cups, assuming his was poisoned (it was), <em>in the time it took the monk to blink</em>.

Dick Grayson (now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Nightwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Nightwing">Nightwing</a>) is the child of circus acrobats and is thus incredibly agile. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries">Tim Drake</a>, on the other hand, is more methodical and uses strategy instead of strength most of the time. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedHood">Jason Todd</a> is powered by RAGE to the point where he uses battle tactics to bring you into a world of pain, even defeating his 'brothers' in combat on several occasions.

He was even more rigorously trained, at a younger age, than any previous Robin in physical combat and martial arts.

Even when she is actually hit by a bullet, she can do so without flinching, because she was conditioned from when she was very young to ignore the pain. As a means of explanation that strains credulity, she was not taught to interpret speech or writing but instead taught human movement as a language (e.g. through recognition of tensing in specific arm and hand muscles, avoids gunfire by reacting first away from the direction of a pointed gun). She is shown on multiple occasions as basically having Spider-sense. It's implied that there might be something more to her abilities, given that her mother (who did not go through that training) has similar abilities (and it's confirmed multiple times that neither of them are metahumans), but it's never really explored, save for a brief mention by some government agents that her hormone levels are incredibly odd.
</li><li> In one story, Robin is amazed by the physical feats of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Bane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Bane">Bane</a> and, logically, assumes he's on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSerum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSerum">venom</a>.

The latter includes throwing incredibly un-aerodynamic things, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathDealer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathDealer">playing cards</a> and straightened paperclips; indeed, it's been said that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUser">anything</a> is a deadly weapon in his hands, to the point that his prison guards won't even give him a plastic spoon to eat with, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">his meals have stool softeners mixed in them</a>.

</li><li> In the original <em>War Zone</em> series, Punisher once went up against a mercenary named Roc, who was impervious to harm. The explanation given was that he was incredibly muscular and had no nerve endings. This doesn't explain how he was able to survive being shot at point blank range with a double-barreled shot gun, or how he shrugged off getting a large knife shoved between his shoulder blades.

In <em>GF</em> #10, two biofeedback nuts throw down against each other. They ignore blow after punishing blow, shrug off gunshot- and stab-wounds, and continue functioning despite bent-backwards joints and a plucked-out eye.

Also, years of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpectacularSpinning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpectacularSpinning">spinning</a> increased his intelligence and gave him <em>immense psionic powers</em> because apparently, all the spinning caused <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinetyPercentOfYourBrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinetyPercentOfYourBrain">dormant brain cells</a> to move to the outer areas of his brain.

His incredible physical capabilities mirror those of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>, but are due to a severe, revolutionary diet and exercise regimen that he'd been put through since <em>infancy</em>.

It is soon found out that Underhall has paid a tremendous price for these 'abilities,' and that his body is worn out, he's broken every bone in his body including his spine, and he's a pain killer addict.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SinCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SinCity">Sin City</a></em> has its fair share. Miho, Kevin, and Wallace all perform feats that should be impossible for normal humans, apparently due to their martial arts abilities. Miho kicked a man's head off his shoulders (granted, she sliced his neck first but that's still damned impressive), Wallace used a meditation technique to remember events after he was drugged and could catch a thrown knife in a dark forest despite not knowing he was being watched, and Kevin can apparently make people go numb with a quick jab.

</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Storm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Storm">Storm</a> lost her powers, she just relied on her natural abilities. She could have taken on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Galactus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Galactus">Galactus</a> like that. Same thing when Wonder Woman lost her powers too. Most of the X-Men are capable of extraordinary feats unrelated to their powers.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Aquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Aquaman">Aquaman</a> is a borderline case: Technically, he doesn't have super-strength, but he has an Atlantean physique, built to withstand the ocean currents - Which means that he's stronger than an average surface dweller of the same build. In his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">original</a> Golden Age origin story, this was played straight.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KickAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KickAss">Kick-Ass</a></em>, Big Daddy and Hit-Girl (in particular) are capable of crazy stunts and incredible exploits by virtue of good ol' training and perseverance. Kick-Ass and Red Mist are certainly aware of the trope, but don't get anywhere near that.
</li><li> Kate Kane's training to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batwoman">Batwoman</a> involved a number of superhuman-like feats, such as fighting blindfolded, catching arrows in flight, learning to ignore pain, and building up resistance to drugs and other chemical agents. The results left her with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">incredibly high pain tolerance and durability</a> (best seen when she was stabbed in the heart and fully recovered) and strength well above that of an average human (such as being able to shatter a stone statue with a single punch).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SheHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SheHulk">She Hulk's</a> super strength in her Hulk form is proportional to how strong her base human form is.

</li><li> A necessary part of live action movies that feature actors who are clearly not trained athletes. In the final scene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LaraCroftTombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LaraCroftTombRaider">Lara Croft: Tomb Raider</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AngelinaJolie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AngelinaJolie">Angelina Jolie</a>, who is athletic but not particularly buff, takes a series of punches and kicks that would break the bones of an offensive tackle, then picks her 110 lb. body up off the ground, beats the bad guy, and sprints away at top speed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KillBill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KillBill">Kill Bill</a></em>, where the bride punches her way out of a coffin and the rest of the cast are no slouches, either.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Rocky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Rocky">Rocky</a></em> tends to portray its boxers as doing things no real man can do; sometimes it's intentional, sometimes it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightSceneFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightSceneFailure">Fight Scene Failure</a>.
<ul><li> Rock himself is the best example. In addition to beating the blatantly superhuman Ivan Drago, he generally is able to take <em>way</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">too many punches to the face</a> from fellow heavyweights without really being debilitated. <em>Rocky Balboa</em> also features Rocky as an arthritic 60+ year old man with a head full of brain damage that we spent an entire movie looking at and which was supposed to <em>kill him</em> if he took another strong blow to the head, training for about a month before climbing into the ring with unreasonably successful heavyweight champion Mason Dixon (who A. is half his age, and B. had previously smashed dozens of top-tier heavyweight fighters with such ease that his sponsors were seriously considering dropping him because all his fights were too one-sided). Mason proceeds to punch Rocky in the face for for ten rounds until he breaks his hands, then barely remains conscious through the handful of cumbersome blows that the geezer who hadn't boxed in decades lands on him.
</li><li> Mason's hyperbolic level of success (all of his fights ended in the first few rounds, and he had never been so much as knocked down) arguably qualifies on its own, especially since Antonio Tarver is actually a cruiserweight (occasional light heavyweight) in real life and looks it in the film.
</li><li> Ivan Drago, due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Soviet super-steroids</a> enhancing his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HuskyRusskie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HuskyRusskie">already muscular 6'5 240 pound frame</a>, is strong enough to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeckLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeckLift">Neck Lift</a> a man with one out-streched arm. At multiple points in the film he also demonstrates a punch measured at 2,100 pounds of force, which his trainer points out is nearly <em>three times</em> that of the average heavyweight boxer.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4h6rp');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4h6rp" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4h6rp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The film says "PSI" (pounds per square inch), seemingly confusing it for pounds-force; 700 pounds-force would indeed be around the level of a typical heavyweight boxer in the 80s. As it stands, 2,100 pounds-force would make Ivan Drago the strongest puncher ever (Frank Bruno, an extremely successful super heavyweight world champion and one of the hardest punches ever, had his strongest blow measured at 1,420 pounds-force, for comparison).</span> He trains to hit <strong>even harder</strong> for the climax round,

The Comedian is able to punch through brick, survive getting his head slammed into a granite counter-top and jump from an aircraft that looks to be almost 3 men off the ground and not give a damn. Ozymandias is not only able to catch a bullet, but can jump nearly his entire height (almost six feet) from a sitting position. Rorschach is shown to practically run up a tower in one instance.

Halfway through the film, they slice up a well-trained Europol squad but get the tables reversed on them at the end in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> moment. Can't really "shadow-blend" with floodlights in your face.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CinderellaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CinderellaMan">Cinderella Man</a></em>, Jim Braddock explains that he developed an unusually strong left arm when he had to use it to haul fish for his day job after injuring his right.

Luchadors are shown performing extraordinary feats of strength and will power, but are not treated as "superhuman" in the ordinary sense of the word.
</li><li> Most of the Joes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GIJoeTheRiseOfCobra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GIJoeTheRiseOfCobra">GI Joe The Rise Of Cobra</a></em> are pretty impressive, but Snake Eyes takes the cake. He does more during the Paris chase scene than the rest of his team combined (including catching up to Baroness' Humvee on foot... faster than his teammates in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> and a motorcycle).

Enter the Fist</a></em>, where thanks to spending his life under constant attack the Chosen One can create wind by spinning a staff really fast, do several <em>dozen</em> somersaults in one jump, and do push-ups without using his hands. Master Pain/Betty is somehow even more ridiculous, given he can take four people whacking on him with sticks without flinching, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">repeated blows</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">to the crotch</a>.

Furter says of his newly-finished creation Rocky that "he carries the Charles Atlas seal of approval". Near the end of the movie, it does take quite a number of shots from Riff Raff's "anti-matter laser" to bring down Rocky. In the original musical, the song "I Can Make You A Man" and its reprise were both originally called "Charles Atlas".
</li><li> Almost any film starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArnoldSchwarzenegger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArnoldSchwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> will have Arnold's character demonstrate this, unless the character actually is superpowered. Prominent examples include <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Commando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Commando">Commando</a></em> where Arnold's character is able to rip a phone-booth out of the ground and hoist both it (and the man currently using it) over his head, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRunningMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRunningMan">The Running Man</a></em>, where he is able to rip an entire weight-machine off the floor and hold both it (and the woman currently sitting in it) up one-handed without visible effort. There's also him punching through a car window in anger in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TrueLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TrueLies">True Lies</a></em>... except that actually happened, since Arnold missed the prop glass window he was supposed to break and <em>actually punched through a car window</em>.
</li><li> In the Serbian film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Underground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Underground">Underground</a></em>, Blackie is an electrician by trade, which means he gets shocked all the time and has become completely immune. In an opening scene, he sticks live wires in his mouth without discomfort while fixing a ceiling fan. When Nazis attempt to torture him with a defibrillator, it seems to have no effect on him, even on the highest setting. Confused, a Nazi checks to see if the machine is working and is instantly electrocuted.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManFromUNCLE2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManFromUNCLE2015">The Man from U.N.C.L.E.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UnderworldRiseOfTheLycans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UnderworldRiseOfTheLycans">Underworld: Rise of the Lycans</a></em>, Raze was remarkably strong for a human. He was able to punch out a Werewolf and fight off the rest. When he is enslaved by the Vampires, he was able to knock one of them away and three were needed to restrain him. He was eventually bitten by a Lycan and turned, which naturally augmented his strength.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YouDontMessWithTheZohan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YouDontMessWithTheZohan">You Don't Mess with the Zohan</a></em>, Zohan and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> Phantom have a full range of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockSuperpowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockSuperpowers">Stock Superpowers</a> through what appears to simply be intense training.
</li><li> DSS agent Luke Hobbs from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFastAndTheFurious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFastAndTheFurious">The Fast and the Furious</a></em> series sometimes demonstrates outright <em>superhuman</em> strength. In the 8th film, he is able to <em>toss humans around like paper</em>, punch dents into <em>steel walls</em>, <em>rip off metal handcuffs</em>, <em>shrug off rubber bullets</em> and even break through <em>barricades of police officers with riot-control shields without slowing down</em>. Considering <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson">who</a></em> portrays him, this shouldn't come off as a surprise.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DocSavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DocSavage">Doc Savage</a>, from pulp era novels, is a result of a rigorous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> routine from birth initiated by his father. "Doc Savage Magazine" discussed the training routine, in 23 articles published from July 1935 to May 1937.

</li><li> A convention from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> series is that survival is a learned skill - the longer you live, the longer you're able to keep living.
<ul><li> Cohen the Barbarian is a lifelong adventurer who survived to become a very old man, making him for all intents and purposes unstoppable. <em>Interesting Times</em> mentions his "economy of movement", so that Cohen and the other oldsters of the Silver Horde, are simply always where they want to be, which is never where anyone's sword is. It also helps that Genghiz Cohen and his horde have become smart enough to recognize how Discworld works. Five or so noble men facing an evil army <em>will</em> enjoy some success.
</li><li> His daughter, Conina, is an even better example due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamarckWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamarckWasRight">Discworld genetics</a>. From her mother she got good looks and a voice that can make a porn star blush. From dear old dad she got "sinews you could moor a ship with, muscles solid as a plank and reflexes like a snake on a hot tin roof" plus (<em>ahem</em>) heroic instincts and an ability to use <em>anything</em> as a deadly weapon. This doesn't really help in her chosen profession of hairdressing. Being able to disembowel someone with a pair of shears and blind someone with a pair of bobby pins from 20 paces <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">doesn't really look good on her resum&eacute;</a>.
</li><li> Captain Carrot also has some degree of this. Raised from birth as an adoptive dwarf, and working in the mines from the moment he was able to hold a pickaxe, has left him nearly as broad across the shoulders as he is tall, able to knock out Detritus (a huge troll made of <em>stone</em>) with a single punch, run a sword <em>through a stone pillar</em>, and back all that up with incredible stamina and endurance. When the abovementioned Silver Horde was confronted by him, they wisely chose to give up. This is because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a> works both ways: yes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfNinjutsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfNinjutsu">the small Silver Horde will defeat the big army any time</a>. But guess what happens when a <em>sole hero</em> faces the <em>Horde</em>?
</li><li> The History Monks are able to "slice" time and briefly move outside of it simply as a natural extension of their already astonishing martial arts mastery. Lu-Tze, their greatest agent and sole practitioner of <em>D&eacute;j&agrave; Fu</em>, can even wipe the floor with the son <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and, later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">Anthropomorphic Personification</a></span> of Time itself.

How strong is Tarzan, you ask? In one story, four burly sailors are struggling with Lord Greystoke's shipping trunk, so he casually picks it up and carries it himself! If the sailors can haul their own weight, a reasonable strength at the time, and weigh about 175 lbs., then he's casually shifting some 700 lbs. or more.
</li><li> The protagonist of Kristin Cashore's novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Graceling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Graceling">Graceling</a></em> has this as a magical talent. In a setting where certain people are "Graced" with a magically-enhanced natural talent that can range from mind control to swimming to cooking, the heroine Katsa is Graced with superhuman survival skills that let her function perfectly without sleep or food for days, withstand blizzards, instinctively know how to live in the wilderness, see in the dark, navigate without a compass, defeat anyone in any kind of combat, and kill anything that she sees as a threat with her bare hands.

Young Nick's mind was stored with knowledge of a peculiar sort. His gray eyes had, like an Indian's, been trained to take in minutest details fresh for use. His rich, full voice could run the gamut of sounds, from an old woman's broken, querulous squack to the deep, hoarse notes of a burly ruffian. And his handsome face could, in an instant, be distorted into any one of a hundred types of unrecognizable ugliness.

</li><li> A slightly justified example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SuperPowereds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SuperPowereds">Super Powereds</a></em> with Chad. While Chad is a Super, his power is "total mind and body control". When another character hears this, he makes fun of Chad's power as being useless. Chad explains that, by itself, it is, but he has used to it and this trope to turn his body into a killing machine. Using his power, he can ingest massive (sometimes lethal) quantities of minerals and calcium and force his body to accept and process them, making his bones <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">nigh-indestructible</a> and his muscles extremely strong. The "mind control" part of his power allows him to rewire his brain to be more efficient, which grants him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperReflexes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperReflexes">Super Reflexes</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sell</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a> (not only can't psychics affect him, but they also can't sense him).

Implicitly explained as the result of years of the highest level of training, but still far beyond what's realistic - Ward and May are described in-universe as being the equals (or near-equals) of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackWidow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackWidow">Black Widow</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Hawkeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Hawkeye">Hawkeye</a>, who fight alongside the superpowered Avengers.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Buffyverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Buffyverse">Buffyverse</a></em> usually subverted this as many characters have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> or Magic but other characters fit this trope well.
<ul><li> Rupert Giles aka <em>Ripper</em> seems like a pushover bookworm, but when serious he can beat the shit out of a legendary vampire (Angelus) with a burning baseball bat, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeckLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeckLift">Neck Lift</a> a man and is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman">Master Swordsman</a>. Then he learns magic and gets even stronger and can equal Dark Willow in power.
</li><li> Xander reaches this level <em>eventually</em> as he can stake dozens of Vamps alongside Slayers, like Giles becomes skilled with a sword, kills demons, and most notably uses a wrecking ball to corner-shot a god through a brick wall. By the end of the series he becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NickFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NickFury">Nick Fury</a> since he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">lost his eye</a>.
</li><li> Cordelia got good at the bow at the end of Season 3 of <em>Buffy</em>, but in Season 3 of <em>Angel</em> she gets trained by the titular protagonist himself and can kill Vamps and demons with the rest of the gang. Then it's subverted as Cordy gets demon powers, which defeats the purpose of this trope.
</li><li> Wesley is a standout example, despite his previous combat encounters with Vampires at the Watchers Council being "under controlled circumstances". During his time in <em>Angel</em>, Wesley becomes ridiculously badass, capable of rendering dozens of Vamps to dust, slicing demons clean in half and in his coolest moments going <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">Guns Akimbo</a> on The Beast and Skip (both armor-plated Super-Demons).
</li><li> Gunn holds claims to this trope as much as Wesley; he's been fighting Vampires since he was fourteen and later in the series took out six Asian warrior monk-types without getting hit once. Gunn and the street-gang members he once led also fought vampires using improvised melee weapons, with more success and less casualties than the <em>US government's secret black-ops demon-fighting organization</em>.
</li><li> Last but not least is Holtz, considered the <em>greatest non-supernatural vampire hunter in recorded history</em>, who hunted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnholyMatrimony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnholyMatrimony">Angelus and Darla</a> across Europe and North Africa and came exceedingly close to killing them, then when awoken centuries later he butchers an entire military squad <em>with guns</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome">off screen</a>. If that wasn't enough Holtz survives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell">Quor'toth</a>, "darkest of the dark dimensions". If that doesn't label him as ultimate hardcore badass nothing does.
</li></ul></li><li> To be effective as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCape">The Cape</a></em> Vince Faraday is put through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingfromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingfromHell">intense training by fairly ruthless circus performers</a>, the physical part described as "to the very limits of the human body". Later, after barely surviving being poisoned by an enemy's blade, he on his own builds up his body's immunity to many toxins and trains himself to catch a thrown knife in a very short amount of time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>: Gregor Clegane is capable of crushing a man's head with his bare hands, as seen with Oberyn Martell. Elia went the same way. In his zombified form, he's able to rip a man's head off with his bare hands.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HerculesTheLegendaryJourneys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HerculesTheLegendaryJourneys">Hercules: The Legendary Journeys</a></em>, Iolaus was able to stay underwater for a long time. He explains that he picked up meditation techniques that slow down your breathing and heart rate.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>. Locke tries to claim that the reason he survived a gunshot is that it hit meat that <em>used</em> to have an important but expendable organ; it wasn't there anymore. Other characters recognize that for the b.s. it is; a shot in the chest is nasty business no matter what.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNewAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNewAvengers">The New Avengers</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the episode "The Gladiators" was a martial arts expert who could punch through steel plate and swat aside automatic gunfire.

On the other hand, since some people do <em>naturally</em> possess such abilities due to unusual brain structure, etc, a simple logical explanation is that Shawn possesses a double-whammy of natural abilities and extensive training, but this scenario is never discussed.

</li><li> The Catachan guardsman Sly Marbo is a version of this and an in-story <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">Memetic Badass</a>; his reputation states that he has, among other things, killed an ork warboss, taken out a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthExpert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthExpert">Tyranid lictor</a>, destroyed an entire enemy armored column by booby trapping a ravine, and captured an enemy command post singlehandedly to kill its commander and entire bodyguard. It's gotten to the point that the colonel who debriefs him can recite the commendation for the Star of Terra in a single breath, and has a box full of the awards that Marbo never keeps.
</li><li> A Heavy Bolter is an advanced weapon that fires .75 calibre explosive rockets. Normal humans can't use <em>regular</em> Bolters without breaking their arms, forcing the Imperial Guard to use Heavy Bolters as fixed emplacements, and the superhuman Space Marines may carry it around like a squad support weapon, but still struggle to handle the thing with sustained fire. This facet of 40k lore needs to be explained to Gunnery Sergeant Harker of the Catachan Jungle Fighters. He uses this beast of the weapon in the same way a lot of Guardsmen use their Lasguns, and he can move through terrain like a scout with it. It <em>barely</em> encumbers him at all. Not to mention his personal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">Moment of Awesome</a>; he was on an assignment when a Tyranid Ravener burst out of the ground beneath him and knocked his bolter away out of his hands, only for Harker to catch the thing in a headlock and <em>crush it's neck with his biceps</em>. Seriously badass.
</li><li> The Catachans are this in general: their home planet, the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld">Death World</a> in 40K, is a possibly sentient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HungryJungle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HungryJungle">Hungry Jungle</a> with more horrible lifeforms than Australia. Surviving to be older than 10 is a feat in and of itself, which is why every Catachan soldier is, without exception, seven feet tall with bodybuilder muscles, specializing in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Rambo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Rambo">fighting i</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Predator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Predator">n the jungle</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDeerHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDeerHunter">and red headbands are a popular accessory</a>). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heavyworlder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heavyworlder">Their planet's gravity is said to be slightly higher than Terra's</a> as a bit of an explanation.
</li></ul></li><li> Given the speed at which a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> character gains experience, one can go from level 1 to level 20 in a bare six months &mdash; and that's if you use the optional training rules which make it longer and costlier. Given how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a> work in <em>D&amp;D</em>, a normal person would have extreme difficulty killing a high-level character in his sleep by stabbing him in the throat with a two-handed sword.
<ul><li> The special abilities many classes gain bear some mentioning. Rogues can hone their reflexes to the point where they can dodge a fireball&mdash;<em>while standing at the epicenter of its explosion</em> (though a more technical read of the rules might indicate that they need at least a little cover or wiggle room to evade an explosion capable of leveling mountains unscathed), and Barbarians become so resistant to damage that an ordinary human with an ordinary knife could never hope to hurt them. Monks take this trope to a whole other level, training so hard that they <em>literally</em> no longer count as mortals and become Outsiders, stop aging, become immune to poisons, have fists that count as harder-than-steel magical weapons, and can heal wounds by meditating on them. And dodge fireballs like a rogue.
</li><li> Epic characters from 3rd and 4th edition break through the 20 Level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap">Cap</a> and here is where things really start to get interesting. Dodging a fireball? Pfft, please. An Epic Rogue could probably be able to deftly balance on a <em>cloud</em>, or go unnoticed while standing in the centre of a room bathed <em>in broad daylight</em>, or use a tumble to survive <em>a fall from orbit</em>. An Epic Monk could behead a man with a single karate chop, and an Epic Barbarian could <em>swim through lava</em> and emerge unscathed. FYI, Epic magic users are even more impressive; Epic Druids are basically earthbound nature deities, and Epic Wizards can blow up planets and <em>duel gods</em>. Oh, and before you get any ideas, the Epic Level Handbook explicitly makes it clear these are <em>not</em> supernatural. They're just <em>that</em> good.
</li><li> Martial adepts are explicitly based on wuxia films and anime, and consequently, they're all over this trope. Crusaders can regenerate anything short of instant death, cut through the armor plating of an iron golem with a normal sword, and issue commands so forceful they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">break the action economy.</a> Warblades can strike an opponent fourteen times in six seconds, ignore poison and disease by gritting their teeth, and wield a two-handed sword while grappled. Swordsages are the most infamous: they can produce flames with their bare hands, throw basically anything, and bend shadows to <em>turn invisible, teleport, and fly.</em> Unlike the monk, whose more outlandish powers are generally Supernatural and therefore magical to an extent, these abilities are all classified as Extraordinary - they work perfectly even when there's an antimagic field up.
</li><li> 4E averts this trope in regards to hit points, which no longer represent pure vitality and are more like "plot points" instead - minion monsters only have 1hp regardless of level, a character isn't really considered "hurt" until they've lost half their hp, and large quantities can be easily regained by inspiration as easily as by magic. This is actually returning to a concept originally invoked in the first edition's Dungeon Master's Guide, which justifies hit points by saying that they do not represent mere physical toughness, but all the things that can make a character hard to kill (toughness, divine favor, sheer dumb luck, etc). Conversely, this trope is alive and well in regards to character abilities, and is the official explanation for the martial power source. How can a rogue turn himself invisible, or a warlord rally an unconscious ally back to fighting form? Training and practice.
</li><li> Given how stats scale, 10 is the human average while 18 is considered to be within the realms of ordinary possibility but extraordinarily rare - a character who <em>starts</em> with 18 strength, for instance, might've grown up as some larger-than-life <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AndreTheGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AndreTheGiant">Andr&eacute; the Giant</a>-esque character who even as a child was famed in the village for his ability to single-handedly right an upturned farm cart. Should you use the rolling method for determining stats at character creation, you can possibly get 18 for a stat at the first level, and everything up from there qualifies as this trope.
</li><li> Having 20 in a stat is implicitly suggested to be superhuman. You can easily train to 20 in two stats with ASIs, especially if you min-max.
</li><li> Proving that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad">Tropes Are Not Bad</a>, the thief-acrobat in 1st Edition averted this, with all their acrobatic stunts being well within the range of human achievement - a high-level one would be about on par with a gold-medal Olympic athlete. This is one of the more criticized elements of the class, as being able to do an eighteen-foot pole vault isn't very impressive when other characters in the party can <em>fly.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> This is explicitly the case in <a class="urllink" href="http://aarnblog.blogspot.com">The World Of Aarn<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. In the setting, magic is a simple fact of life, often taking the role that electricity does in our world, and it's also present in every living thing. As a result, Mundanes, those who don't use straight out magic, end up having their intrinsic magic express itself physically, so they can hit much harder, take harder blows, jump 12 feet in the air, and resist magical attacks to a greater degree than mages can.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension">Mage: The Ascension</a></em>, where the monks of the Akashic Brotherhood gain tremendous powers through intense training, meditation and the practice of martial arts, but even the Brothers admit that they are breaking the laws of physics as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">sleepers</a> know them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> you can perform incredible feats with charms, but even without enhancing your performance with them, an elder Exalt (with more than five dots in the attribute) can jump impossible distances and punch holes in steel.
<ul><li> Even un-Exalted mortals can learn to wield spiritual power through meditation and training, and learn incredible supernatural martial arts and thaumaturgy.
</li></ul></li><li> This is an option in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantsAndMasterminds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantsAndMasterminds">Mutants &amp; Masterminds</a></em>, which features the "Innate" power feat which can theoretically be added to any power. It means the power is essentially something the character can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">innately</a> do, so it can't be nullified via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a> or the like. This allows for characters capable of doing things like shattering a tank with one blow, because they're just <em>that damn good at kung-fu.</em>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PalladiumBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PalladiumBooks">Palladium Books</a>'s Megaversal system allows characters to take physical training skills to increase their physical stats and Structural Damage Capacity (one form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a>) to the point that a first level character can have immense physical abilities and can shrug off multiple gunshot wounds.

It's repeatedly stated that Princesses don't so much <em>use</em> magic as <em>be</em> magic, especially when transformed. An observer might see a Princess dodge out of the way of a blow and then throw a fireball back at her attacker, and conclude that the dodge was "mundane" while the fireball was "magical". But in truth, both are equally "mundane" or equally "magical", in that both are equally natural expressions of the Princess's will and nature.

</li><li> Due to the game's mechanics, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em> and the spin-off <em>Cityof Villains</em> includes 'natural' characters who shield themselves with protective balls of fire, regenerate instantly from near-fatal wounds, phase out of normal existence, or <em>fly</em>. Canonically, Malta's paramilitary forces have been quite capable of facing down evil interdimensional invaders assuming even numbers (who seldom took casualties when facing the American military), and can put up a hefty challenge to individual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifferentlyPoweredIndividual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifferentlyPoweredIndividual">Heroes and Villains</a>.

Of particular note is the Ninjitsu power set; most of its powers are fairly reasonable (increased agility, better perception, etc.), but the final power in the set (Kuji-In Retsu) allows you to <em>alter the way time and space affect you</em>, turning you into a nigh-untouchable blur of attacks.
</li><li> Pretty much the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot">entire point</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crackdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crackdown">Crackdown</a></em>. The agent you control is already enhanced by surgery and cybernetics, but you can drastically increase his already impressive strength and agility through sheer practice. The agent starts the game able to jog at 20 mph, leap 20 feet into air, and lift roughly 200 pounds. Simply by jumping across rooftops a lot and punching lots of criminals to death, you can increase these abilities to jogging 40mph, leaping 50 feet and carrying 10 tons. Training with explosives makes the same grenades you pick up off gang corpses explode bigger and harder. Even more ridiculously, you can also make your bullets hit harder and force cars to <em>physically transform</em> into better versions of themselves by training your firearms and driving skills, giving some cars powers like guns and jumping abilities.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crusader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crusader">Crusader</a></em> games both use and subvert this trope. In the first game, the opening cinematic shows a single mech killing two Silencers. The third (the eventual player character), not embroiled in their argument, managed to get out of its field of view and toss a grenade. The character then goes on to mow his way through hundreds of enemies in the game, shrugging off <em>grenade</em> blasts, and destroying a few dozen of the mechs that killed his compatriots. Then, in the second game, after sitting in a cramped lifepod for almost two days, he proceeds to kill two guards at range firing a burst from his assault rifle <em>one-handed</em>. Finally, the second game seems to take roughly a week, with no noticeable breaks for rest, or even eating or drinking.
</li><li> At the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Cuphead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Cuphead">Cuphead</a></em>, the titular character and his brother Mugman are no stronger than average civilians.

The story goes that Doom Guy was apparently a fairly/very competent trooper, who got reassigned to Mars as a grunt after punching out a superior officer when given a direct order to fire on innocent civilians. Of course, shortly after he arrived, shit hit the fan. Figures, huh? In the first novel he gets the hell beat out of him a lot and has a lot of trouble going on. Thank goodness for the in-canon magical healing balls of creepy. And if you believe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Doom">the comic</a>, Doom Guy was quite unhinged and seemed likely to be the kind of guy who you'd expect to be able to survive a trip to hell and back just because of his sheer lack of a grip on reality. Whether or not this came before or as a result of the Hell invasion is open to interpretation, however.

<ul><li> Starting from the very first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI">Final Fantasy I</a></em>, we have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk">Bare-Fisted Monk</a> Black Belt class, fully capable of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu">punching out</a> an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>.

In the actual game, he also held up a giant collapsing mansion for several minutes by simply standing under the doorframe and posing heroically; in the ending cinematic, he also saves Edgar from an I-beam that, if Sabin were not in the party, takes three people to lift.
</li><li> Tifa of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em> accomplishes similar feats despite being a slim (but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoobsOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoobsOfSteel">buxom</a>) girl because of her years of martial arts training.
<ul><li> Technically Cloud only became super-powered when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Dr Hojo</a> subjected him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSerum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSerum">Mako-energy</a>, so his feats prior to that event i.e. stabbing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Sephiroth</a> straight through the chest and then throwing him down Mako Reactor <em>while impaled</em> are done when he was just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">a human</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Ironically averted in the case of Zell in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em>, whose extreme physical power comes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersAsPrograms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersAsPrograms">junctioning Guardian Forces</a> to boost his physical abilities. Well, except for that one limit break where he <em>runs a lap around the entire goddamn planet</em> and uses the inertia to damage the enemy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em> features Blitzball, an <em>underwater, full-contact sport</em> played by normal humans.

</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> series, pretty much everyone has the potential to become this if you're lucky with levels. Depending on their stats, combined with other features like supports, units can do things like mowing down legion after legion single-handedly, have 100% chance to use critical attacks or take things like artillery and devastating magic to the face and not even flinch. Of special mention is the My Unit/Avatar from New Mystery of the Emblem. He/she was put through rigorous training by their grandfather since they were kids in order to become knights, and it has become but a pastime by the time they're adults. Because of this training, he/she is one of the most strong and broken units in the entire series (the high strength growth can even get in the way if you're playing as a magic unit), and their support conversation with the knight Draug involves lifting three people with a pinky.

While there is a limit to the improvement you can make each day, it still only takes a maximum of about a week to go from a complete wimp to being one of the strongest, fittest people ever.
</li><li> Chipp Zanuff from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear">Guilty Gear</a></em> is an American ki user in a setting where only the Japanese have a natural affinity for channeling ki. Chipp had to learn to use it the hard way: through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">lots and lots of training.</a>
</li><li> Partly averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters">The King of Fighters</a></em> series, where several of the characters introduced in that series have powers due to "Orochi blood", and the China team's powers come from being psychics (and Athena's partly because she's the reincarnation of a goddess). The rest of them, though, can throw fireballs just because they practiced.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostOdyssey">Lost Odyssey</a></em>, main character Kaim Argonar is shown in the opening scene working as a mercenary for Uhra, in the midst of a heavy battle. While Kaim's allies are getting stomped (roughly 20 of them seem to die for every one enemy soldier they manage to kill), Kaim is busy tearing the enemy to shreds by the dozens, and even killing an enormous war engine equipped with flamethrowers with a single blow. The next CD has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildMage">8 year old</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagicianGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagicianGirl">white mage</a> with no combat experience or training who still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatisticallySpeaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatisticallySpeaking">by the numbers</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderratedAndOverleveled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderratedAndOverleveled">hits harder and can take more damage</a> than Kalm could at the beginning of the game, even ignoring her primary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage">healing magic</a>. The entire Uhra military can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWasBeatenByAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWasBeatenByAGirl">be beaten up by a little girl</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em>:
<ul><li> Solid Snake is a clone of a legendary soldier, and picks up some impressive gear of the course of his adventures, but is otherwise &#147;mostly&#148; normal. That doesn't stop him killing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screwing</a> floating psychics and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">giant nuclear-armed walking tanks</a>, and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots">Metal Gear Solid 4</a></em>, he cuts through three war zones and two enemy bases while having <em>the body of a seventy-year-old</em>. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em>, he destroys a tank using only <em>grenades</em> because he didn't have any anti-tank weapons. This is referenced to by Otacon in <em>Guns of the Patriots</em>, in which Otacon calls him "the most hardcore badass on the planet" for managing it.
<ul><li> It&#146;s clear Snake has some level of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> since he can wield the Rail Gun without strain.
</li></ul></li><li> His clone brother Liquid Snake is similarly impressive, shooting down F-16s with a Hind helicopter, which he's able to pilot in the middle of a <em>blizzard</em>. Surviving the crash of said Hind, the destruction of Metal Gear REX with him aboard, falling 3 stores off REX's remains after a fistfight with Solid Snake, and being repeatedly shot with a machine gun. It takes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">FOXDIE forcing his heart to stop beating</span> to actually kill him.
</li><li> Their clone father Big Boss is no different. Just read his medical history at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a></em>.
</li><li> There's also Gray Fox who, even before he gained his cyborg exoskeleton, was capable of blocking machinegun fire with his sword. Gene from <em>Portable Ops</em> was also disturbingly fast. To the point of dodging rail gunfire at <em>point blank range</em>.
</li><li> One of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveals</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearRisingRevengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearRisingRevengeance">Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</a></em> is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jetstream Sam</span>'s only augmentation is an arm. Apart from an exoskeleton which is inferior to cyborg tech, he's otherwise human. His ability to defeat Raiden the first time and still give him trouble after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade">Mid-Season Upgrade</a> is otherwise due to pure, inhuman skill. It's even mentioned that feats he manages in the prologue, such as taking on a squad of rifle-armed soldiers with only his sword and killing them all without a scratch, are things he's been pulling off <em>before</em> he got that augmentation.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare">Modern Warfare</a> 2</em> multiplayer allows you to do things like become immune to falling damage via the Commando Pro perk by killing enough people with your knife. Or carry extra ammo by Scavenging ammo from corpses enough times. Etc. etc.
</li><li> The titular hunters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a></em>, while able to heft weapons nearly twice their size and weight, fall three to ten stories without breaking a bone, receive attacks from ferocious behemoths that would otherwise shred a lesser person to ribbons and subsequently take down said behemoths with enough persistence, are otherwise <em>regular, athletic human beings</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Averted</a> according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> &mdash; as it turns out, most if not all Monster Hunters are descended from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldiers</a> used by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Precursor</a> society to battle the creators of said monsters.

And it was developed solely through training his swordsmanship: he has no supernatural powers whatsoever. He literally just practiced super-hard at it until the laws of physics gave up. Expanded materials and other works in the <em>Fate</em> universe show that for every Heroic Spirit with a legendary weapon or otherworldly power given to them by birth or their actions in life, there's another one who's just <em>really</em> good at being a sword fighter/gunfighter/spear-wielder/martial artist, etc.
</li><li> Kirei Kotomine from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em> is a former Church Executioner, and his hand-to-hand combat abilities are <em>terrifyingly</em> good. In addition to standard Church abilities mentioned above, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero">Fate/Zero</a></em>, he shows the ability to block bullets from an automatic weapon, and matches a guy explicitly using magic to move at twice, and then three times normal speed without apparent effort ("So you're moving twice as fast? Then I just need to adjust my timing."). In the Visual Novel itself he doesn't get much chance to show off, but when he does... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he defeats a Servant. Granted, an Assassin-class Servant, who are among the weakest in combat, but still, <em>he defeated a Servant!</em> He also manages to hold his own against Shirou, who's using Archer's powers and fighting with the skill of a Servant, and is <em>winning</em> before he keels over due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingOnBorrowedTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingOnBorrowedTime">running out on his remaining time before Shirou</a>.</span>

</li><li> Ryu Hayabusa from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjaGaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjaGaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a></em> proudly states that his "strength comes from training, not from some curse in my blood". It must really have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a>, as he performs undeniably superhuman feats. In the XBox version, he can launch armoured men with a single slash and keep them airborne while attacking, leap from wall to wall to continue a wallrun, block bullets with a <em>wooden sword</em>, run and leap unhindered by a <em>100-pound</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">BFS</a> on his back, and zoom with an <em>unaugmented bow</em>. As in, naked eye. That doesn't even cover the full extent of his abilities. Subverted when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Doku's ability to awaken the Fiend blood in him suggests that his power comes from Fiend abilities</span>, but then double subverted when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> this does absolutely nothing to affect Ryu's combat prowess, suggesting otherwise</span>.
</li><li> The Fighting type in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em> would fit this trope for the most part. Most of them have some absurd combat abilities judging by the Pok&eacute;dex data, such as Machamp's absurdly fast punches at a rate of 1,000 punches doled out per every two seconds. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors">Fighting-Type moves</a>, usually consisting of punches and kicks, can bring down <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishingOutDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishingOutDirt">Rock</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChromeChampion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChromeChampion">Steel</a> Pokemon in a single hit.

And they themselves tend to be pretty buff too, but within human standards.
<ul><li> Then there's Unova's Champion Alder, who can stop a rampaging Bouffolant with his bare hands and jump down tall cliffs like they're nothing, and Drayden the Gym Leader, who frequently wrestles with his high-level fully-evolved Dragon Pok&eacute;mon to toughen <em>them</em> up.
</li></ul></li><li> In the first two (platformer) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PrinceOfPersia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PrinceOfPersia">Prince of Persia</a></em> games the Prince can climb up arbitrary number of levels vertically by jumping up, grabbing the ledge above him, then pulling himself up. He can also jump over a large gap, grab a ledge a level down, then pull himself up. The later games are designed with the very same concept. Starting with the <em>Sands of Time</em> series, the Prince's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeParkour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeParkour">parkour</a> allow him to run almost twenty feet along a wall before falling. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersia2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersia2008">2008 reboot</a> takes this to an even greater extent, allowing the Prince to jump from one wall to another and keep running. There's even a <em>ceiling run</em> move.
</li><li> The player-character in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/RecordOfLodossWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/RecordOfLodossWar">Record of Lodoss War</a></em> Dreamcast game learns magic like a child learning algebra, so most of the time you must rely on physical attacks. At level 100 you can punch sandworms and 'lighter' golems to death, despite the fact he's supposedly just an average well-trained knight once you take off his magical armours and weaponry. (And one of those swords, the Hakuring, was the sword of an OGRE. Yes it is expectedly slow as molasses, but if he were so 'normal' it should be CRUSHING him! Cloud's cricket bat pales in comparison and isn't even double-sided like this is. The hilt alone is the size of your shortswords.)

Even after all that, she can only use her powers in the first place because she carries around a mini-Hakkero, essentially a magical battery (or before that, magic mushrooms). Despite this, Marisa can hold her own against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">youkai</a>, demons, even deities, while keeping up with the growth of the few other humans in the series, all of whom have magical powers.

Humans can quickly surpass them if they have a proper teacher, but learning from an angel is generally a bad idea.

</li><li> Most of Aang's speed and agility are shown to be from the use of his airbending, but he's also displayed feats of this trope that can't be attributed to it.

In the Book Three finale, she becomes so enraged that she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">breaks apart unbendable platinum chains</span> by nothing but raw strength.
</li><li> Similarly, the athletic-but-not-overly-buff Mako has casually tossed his bulky brother over his shoulder, thrown mooks away with a single hand, and doing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeckLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeckLift">neck lifts</a> with no major exertion.

<ul><li> Some unscrupulous martial arts "masters" claim to have achieved supernatural abilities through training. Websites like bullshido.net and badmartialarts.com are dedicated to debunking them. In spite of this, several martial artists and fighters have developed reputations for seemingly superhuman physical abilities.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceLee">Bruce Lee</a> was able to perform a number of spectacular physical feats that he put to good use in his acting career. His films made it seem that he could translate his physical abilities into nearly superhuman fighting ability, but his true skills were never thoroughly tested.
</li><li> Mas Oyama, the founder of Kyokushin style karate, was said to kill bulls by punching them in the face, before or after hacking their horns off with his bare hands. He was also said to crush rocks with his hands and fight one hundred people in a row with minimal breaks. The degree of truth to these stories is debatable. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MapyZq4YIo">YouTube<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> features a video of his bull exploits, though it only shows Oyama wrestling a harnessed bull to the ground and features a clearly faked portrayal of him hacking off a horn.
</li><li> A popular legend states that former boxing Lightweight champ Roberto Duran once knocked out a horse with one punch.
</li><li> After <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-top-eight-oh-shit-moments-in-mma/">Fedor Emelianenko<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was suplexed directly onto his head in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts">Mixed Martial Arts</a> match, he got up and went on to win the fight in less than a minute. When asked how he managed to recover so quickly from such a harsh throw, Fedor explained, "It didn't affect me. I train to fall great distances." In reality, with some training, flexibility, and luck, professional MMA fighters can avoid significant damage from attacks that appear to be quite serious.
</li><li> Played with by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCosby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCosby">Bill Cosby</a> in one of his early routines, where he talked about a karate instructor who could break bricks and boards, all the while telling his students that the secret was to think <em>through</em> the brick, i.e. try to hit a point beyond the brick and not just focus on the surface. Being Bill Cosby, this was brought to its logical conclusion by the instructor getting a brick, yelling that he wasn't thinking of the surface of the brick, he was thinking two feet past it, and karate chops the brick. Unfortunately for the instructor, <em>this</em> brick was thinking <em>"oh, no you won't!"</em> The end result being a karate instructor with a broken arm.
</li></ul></li><li> Many physical stunts appear to display superhuman abilities, but are not quite as impossible as they seem:
<ul><li> Legendary illusionist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryHoudini">Harry Houdini</a> could famously absorb extremely heavy blows to his abdomen with little to no effect if he prepared properly. In reality, the abdomen is naturally resilient to damage while the abdominals are being flexed. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByIrony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByIrony">Ironically</a>, a sucker punch might have caused or hastened Houdini's death from peritonitis, though it also might have simply delayed him seeking treatment.
</li><li> Some martial arts and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeParkour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeParkour">Le Parkour</a> stunts that seem impossible, such as punching through bricks and falling from great heights, really just take some training and some fearlessness. Others take advantage of artful performance and stagecraft to appear more difficult or impressive.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, many of the CGI-assisted acrobatic stunts of Legolas were criticized as unrealistic<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0li9g');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0li9g" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0li9g');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A criticism which seems somewhat irrelevant since Legolas <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">is an elf</a></span>, but some of his feats, such as mounting a horse at a gallop, are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">preexisting stunts</a> that could be performed live by the right kinds of gymnasts, circus performers, or classic vaudeville stuntmen.
</li><li> Even as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellHound">fighting dogs and attack dogs are terrifying for most people</a>, enough to blame it on some genetic memory of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavageWolves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavageWolves">chased by wolves</a> in the distant past, trained dog breeders can neutralize the attack of the beast by simply sticking a closed fist between its jaws to keep them open and unable to bite. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome">too counter-intuitive to be performed at home if untrained</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> History is filled with people who thought they could perform supernatural feats with enough training and other preparations, but were proven quite mistaken:
<ul><li> In the Maji Maji rebellion in German East Africa during the colonial days, tribes thought something similar. Through training and washing in magical water blessed by local shamans, they thought they would become immune to machine gun fire.
</li><li> The Society of Right and Harmonious Fists (more commonly known as the Boxers of the famous Boxer Rebellion) believed that through training, diet, martial arts, and prayer, they could perform extraordinary feats and become immune to swords and bullets.
</li></ul></li><li> Contrary to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathBullet">Instant Death Bullet</a> trope, sometimes people don't even realize they've been shot or otherwise don't realize how badly they're injured until the adrenaline wears off, resulting in people running around or moving with potentially fatal gunshot wounds, or not realizing what being shot feels like. Additionally, combat reflexes can be dependent on your culture to some extent; a culture which hasn't been exposed to firearms very much doesn't know that hitting the dirt in response to gunfire reduces your likelihood of getting hit, and thus may be more likely to remain standing while being shot at. This may look like incredible, inhuman bravery to people who are more familiar with firearms.
</li><li> This is also why <em>grand mal</em> seizures are so dangerous; such involuntary convulsive movements use all available muscle power, and a person experiencing one is not only at risk of biting through their tongue or breaking their own spine, but unnervingly difficult to restrain. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndKnowingIsHalfTheBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndKnowingIsHalfTheBattle">Which would be why you're not supposed to restrain people having seizures, but make sure to move breakable and hard objects out of the way and leave them alone.</a>
</li><li> Similarly, a drowning person in a state of panic may exhibit much greater strength than normal for that individual, due to the rush of adrenaline. This is why lifeguards and others responsible for water safety are strictly cautioned to swim out to still-conscious drowning people only as an absolute last resort, when other methods of rescue such as poles, ring buoys and boats aren't available or feasible, due to the risk of becoming victims themselves.
</li><li> It has been found that one can increase bone strength through their density but this requires heavy physical training and does not aid much more than allowing for fewer broken bones later on. The easy way is to train in martial arts or other physical combats that create micro-fractures in the pores of the bone and allow them to heal and fill.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_16449_7-people-from-around-world-with-real-mutant-superpowers.html">Well-disciplined Buddhist monks can reduce their metabolism by 64% and raise the temperatures of their fingers and toes by 17&deg;F (9.4&deg;C), just by meditating<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
<ul><li> It is possible for anyone to do a less extreme version of this using <a class="urllink" href="http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/biofeedback-000349.htm">biofeedback<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> The human body is always in a mild state of alertness while awake (it can remain in this state while asleep due to certain disorders), causing vitals to be consistently elevated above absolute baseline. By deliberately clearing the mind and shutting off outside stimulus, meditation can allow a person's physiological systems to settle down to a level comparable to deep sleep while arguably still conscious. This also explains the regenerative effects meditation seems to have as sleep also triggers healing and growth mechanisms.
</li></ul></li><li> Tori Allen, a champion rock wall climber, got that way by climbing trees constantly from the age of four. By chasing after her pet monkey when her own limbs were maturing, she acquired phenomenal grip strength and a disproportionately-powerful bone structure. Now, she could give Spider-Man a vertical run for his money.
</li><li> Some blind people are able to learn to navigate through echolocation, just like bats do. All humans have the ability to a certain extent, but with training, it can be greatly improved.
</li><li> Although films like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBourneSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBourneSeries">The Bourne Series</a></em> get panned for showing the titular protagonists doing unbelievable stunts, in reality most of the actions shown are actually possible. Various studies and TV specials, including two from Discovery and the Science Channel, show that there are people who can pull off those insane driving scenes, marksman who can hit a dozen targets at various ranges with a pistol, and fighters that can take on five men at once and curb stomp them. The biggest problem in the portrayal is that nobody can do <em>all</em> of this; it requires an enormous amount of training not just to learn these skills but to maintain them as well.
</li><li> There are plenty of stories of people who survived things that should kill them. For example, <a class="urllink" href="http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=4646774">this 7-year-old girl<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> who took six bullets and not only survived, but is able to walk and talk like normal even after doctors predicted she'd be paralyzed and mute for life.
</li><li> Many elite-level athletes have physiological "quirks" that allow them to excel at their particular sport, such as swimmer Michael Phelps<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5pxrv');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5pxrv" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5pxrv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">his arms are longer than average for his height; a 6'7" wingspan for a 6'4" man</span> and ultra-marathon runner Dean Karnazes<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6tlvu');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6tlvu" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6tlvu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">his body's production of lactic acid actually decreases the longer he exercises</span>. They still need to train extensively to compete at the highest levels.
</li><li> Some attribute their extraordinary speed and endurance of Kenyan marathoners to simply training religiously in the high altitude of Western Kenya.
</li><li> Paramedics and Emergency Physicians are capable of saving people whose hearts aren't beating or who have taken bullets to the brain only through insane amounts of training and experience. However, the strain of this can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">lead to depression and anxiety</a> especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTherapists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTherapists">without treatment</a>.
</li><li> Throwing a needle through glass is impossible, you say? <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7JByZs2Kys">Just watch.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> While it's nowhere near <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> levels in real life, sufficiently-trained martial artists can break human bone with a single attack (note that bones are about as dense and hard as concrete), as well as other seemingly impossible feats (such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceLee">Bruce Lee</a>'s famous One-Inch Punch). Heck, sufficiently-training at the Shaolin Temple can allow you to harden your body against bladed weaponry.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisColfer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisColfer">Chris Colfer</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em> fame developed an <em>incredible</em> vocal range simply by continuing to sing in a high pitch into adolescence, thereby retaining his childhood range even as his larynx grew to encompass much lower notes too.
</li><li> People can be surprisingly flexible when they train their flexibility properly. Heck, it can be argued that full side and forward splits are the minimum to considered flexible. Up to eleven with professional contortionists, who can be accurately described as human pretzels.
