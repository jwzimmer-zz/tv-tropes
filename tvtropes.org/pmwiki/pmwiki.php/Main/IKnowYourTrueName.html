</div></div><p>This is a version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic">Functional Magic</a> that revolves around the use of "true names". A true name perfectly describes something's essential nature. Knowing a true name gives one power over the owner of the name. In some portrayals, using a person's true name forces them to obey your commands. In others, a true name gives you a connection to the name's owner that allows you to work magic on them from a distance. Sometimes, a person's true name is needed if you want to work any magic on them at all.

As a rule, objects do not have true names &#151; but even that rule isn't obeyed by all universes.
</p><p>A person's true name might be self-determined, or bestowed on them by someone else &#151; possibly in a religious or magical ritual. In works which feature true names prominently, people tend to guard them jealously, and will even have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveManyNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveManyNames">a second name</a> (or two or three or more, depending on the character's age) for everyday use.
</p><p>Audiences might think that having a very long or difficult-to-pronounce true name might provide one with a shield against being enspelled, but it never occurs to characters. Demons are an exception, with names that are frequently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnpronounceable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnpronounceable">impossible for humans to pronounce</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AyakashiAyashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AyakashiAyashi">Ayakashi Ayashi</a></em>, the protagonist can reveal the true name of anything he comes in contact with and use its power. The 'name' usually manifests as a tool of some sort, and is the most effective way to fight the monsters the heroes are meant to hunt down. Alternatively, destroying a Youi's name, will destroy the Youi itself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: Spiritual Power requires the use of true names for abilities and attacks to function at maximum potential. Zanpakut&#333; cannot be released without using their true names, and Kid&#333; (spellcasting) power is reduced when verbalisation is skipped. Yumichika takes advantage of this to lie about his Zanpakut&#333;'s name to prevent his power functioning so that he can blend in with his divisional philosophy. Zabimaru lies about its name to prevent Renji accessing its full potential. Ichibei Hyosube, the Commander of the Royal Guard and the highest-ranking and most powerful of all Soul Reapers, is responsible for naming all things in Soul Society. His Zanpakut&#333;'s shikai form removes the name of something to depower it and his bankai form renames it to give it attributes of Ichibei's own choice.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloodBlockadeBattlefront" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloodBlockadeBattlefront">Blood Blockade Battlefront</a></em>, this is the weakness of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">Blood Breed</a>. Here, the Blood Breed are created by writing magic directly on DNA, explaining why knowing their true name is important since it's their only real weakness.

Corrupting the name will send the vampire on an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> rampage for blood when ordinarily, the urge to drink it is controlled quite easily.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodeGeassOzTheReflection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodeGeassOzTheReflection">Code Geass: Oz the Reflection</a></em>, Clara Lanfranc has the Geass power to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplePuppets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplePuppets">control a person's body</a> if she looks them in the eye and says their true name. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When she tries it against protagonist Oldrin Zevon, she gets shot dead; it turns out Oldrin's twin brother Orpheus got wise to Clara's power and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinSwitch">traded</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisguisedInDrag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisguisedInDrag">places</a> with her.</span>
</li><li> The eponymous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> requires that you write the true name of your intended victim, hence some of the characters using aliases whenever possible. The user is also required to know the face of the target.
<ul><li> The definition of 'true name' beyond 'the name a shinigami's eyes see floating over your head' is not provided, but in the majority of cases it appears to be the legal name provided at birth. Meaning L apparently had fucking loonies for parents, unless he was named in unusual circumstances.
</li><li> Alternatively, one's 'true name' is simply the name people call themselves in their heads. For nearly everybody this is the legal name provided at birth; L may just have spent so much time <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">self-identifying as L</span> that this is actually how he thinks of himself.
</li><li> Light does not appear to have lost too many marks to name changes, probably because he concentrated his efforts on persons already investigated thoroughly by the police, and Japan has a pretty tough name-record system in place with the family register. Modern record-keeping generally makes complete identity change much harder. A Death Note user in Japan a couple hundred years earlier would have had an interesting time working out which of a man's names was 'true.'
</li><li> Very minor, but the reason why a face must be known with the name was because the Death Note itself recognized that several people might have identical names, down to surnames, so you had to know the face of who you're writing down or else everyone with that name would all instantly drop dead. L managed to outsmart Light early with this by using the name "Hideki Ryuga", knowing that there's a famous Pop Idol with the same name and if he should happen to drop dead, it would mean Light is the culprit. (L wasn't aware of the rules and didn't yet know that a notebook was the method of killing, but given the circumstances of his decoy Lind L. Tailor's death he correctly guessed that names had to be involved. Light knew that even if Hideki Ryuga was his real name, the image of the pop idol might accidentally flash in his brain anyways, so Light couldn't even "test" it).
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry">Devil May Cry</a> 3</em> manga says that a demon's name is so important to him that by taking it away, the creature can be sealed for eternity.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket">Fruits Basket</a></em>, Hanajima's brother Megumi claims to be able to curse people if he knows their names. Hanajima had warned the Yuki Sohma Fanclub representatives not to say their names in the house, but later Megumi reveals they did just that.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulHunter">Soul Hunter</a></em> during a battle where the enemy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUser">Paopei was a megaphone</a> that could freeze a person in place by shouting them to do so, as long as the user knew his target's real name. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Tai</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">koubou</a> has fun with this.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Isuca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Isuca">Isuca</a></em> the main character has the ability to reveal the true name of any magician and demon or otherwise supernatural being through&#133; mouth contact. Yes, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ecchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ecchi">that kind of manga</a>. Without knowing a monster's true name, you can only seal it and not truly banish it. Also, the first being to speak a monster's true name gains control over it.
</li><li> True names play a big part in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Loveless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Loveless">Loveless</a></em> as they determine who your partner will be.
<ul><li> When Soubi fights with Ritsuka he goes against his name since he and Ritsuka don't share names, which not only weakens their power as a whole but causes his name to bleed.
</li></ul></li><li> Nodoka Miyazaki in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> requires at least a name for her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy">mind-reading</a> book to take effect. Recently, with the help of a dungeon-crawling adventuring party, she's gained two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NextTierPowerUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NextTierPowerUp">Next Tier Power-Up</a> accessories (both supposedly useless, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game Breaking</a> in her hands): the <em>auris lectans</em>, an ear-piece which immediately reads out words on paper to her mind, and the <em>comptina daemonia</em>, which can read a target's name (in a sense) to her. While less powerful and discreet than the shinigami eyes, it's much cheaper.
<ul><li> Also, at least one opponent, at the sight of the book, wondered if it was the Death Note.
</li><li> Interestingly, it has been revealed that one's True Name is the name that they <em>think</em> is their True Name. Also, if you name, say, any of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality">a person's multiple personalities</a> and so on, it would still work. It gets kinda complicated regarding the specifics on true names and souls and all that.

<ul><li> Superman often encounters Mister Mxyzptlk, an imp from the 5th dimension who is sent back when he says his name backwards. As he's invulnerable otherwise, the only way to get him out of your hair is to trick him into saying his name backwards. During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnByrne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnByrne">John Byrne</a>'s run though this was nothing more than Mxyzptlk being sporting, as being truly untouchable by the 3rd dimension natives would be boring.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmperorJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmperorJoker">Emperor Joker</a></em> storyline, the Joker tricks Mxyzptlk into revealing his "secret imp name", allowing the Joker to steal 99.9% of Mxy's power.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ActionComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ActionComics">Action Comics</a> #273</em> (February 1961), Superman decides to pay Mxyzptlk back for his pranks by visiting HIS home dimension and playing pranks on <em>him</em>. Mxy then tries to trick Superman into saying his name backwards (Namrepus) to send him back to Earth; when he finally succeeds, nothing happens, because unbeknownst to Mxy it isn't Big Blue's real name. After Supes has had his fun, he returns home by saying "Le-lak" ("Kal-el" backwards).
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperFriends">Super Friends</a></em>, they record Mxyzptlk saying his name and then play the recording backwards, which banishes him.

Up to this point the Spectre was portrayed as an unstoppable embodiment of the Wrath of God (or the Presence, the closest thing to God in the DCU). Considering the shitty job Crispus Allen had been doing since becoming the Spectre, it's actually not all that surprising. Especially since Libra was working with... you know... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">Darkseid</a>.
<ul><li> <em>Final Crisis: Revelations</em> instead implied the reason to be that Spectre only delivers justice to those God wants justice delivered to via him - he is the hammer of God. He smites what God wants him to smite. Libra's fate (and that of Darkseid) had apparently already been decided, and it didn't involve Spectre. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">As a result, Spectre wasn't allowed to interfere with that particular issue.</a> Either that, or since Evil won the war between the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewGods">New Gods</a>, Darkseid was dragging the entire multiverse into the Forever Pit and receiving massive amounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay">Villain Anti-Decay</a>, at this point he had more power over the multiverse than God. Neither the Spectre nor the Radiant could feel God's presence at the time, despite being aspects of Him.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest">ElfQuest</a></em>, the telepathic Wolfrider elves all possess "soul names", the knowledge of which gives another elf access to the owner's most intimate thoughts and feelings. Therefore all Wolfriders guard their soul names carefully from all except their closest friends and lovers. However, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindlinkMates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindlinkMates">involuntary mating urge</a> called Recognition sabotages this by <em>forcing</em> the affected couple to exchange soul names. On one occasion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Winnowill learned Dewshine's soul name and attempted to use the knowledge to coerce her, which only went to show how evil Winnowill was. On another occasion, Nightfall unilaterally gave her lovemate Redlance her soul name before placing herself in danger, so that if she died her soul would still be joined to his. She later brought Redlance back from the verge of catatonic shock by persuading him to give her his soul name, causing their souls to become one.
</li><li> This was a favourite trick of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConMan">Con Man</a>/Occultist Igor Bromhead in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellboy">Hellboy</a></em> comics. Most memorably used in the "<em>Box Full of Evil</em>" storyline to enslave H.B.'s demon-cousin Ualac, and then to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">paralyze Hellboy himself so they could steal his mystical Crown of the Apocalypse and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand">Right Hand of Doom</a></span>. It backfired, though, since Hellboy's "True Name", Anung Un Rama, means "World Destroyer, The Great Beast"&mdash;a role Ualac had just usurped from Hellboy by stealing his crown. When Hellboy realized this, Bromhead's hold over him was broken. Most recently, he used the true name of the human component in Hecate's replacement body to imprison her.
<ul><li> Specifically in <em>Box Full of Evil</em>, this is done thrice: first with Igor Bromhead commanding the demon Ualac using its true name, secondly with Bromhead commanding <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hellboy himself with his true name, Anung Un Rama</span>, and finally with Hellboy commanding Ualac using <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his own name (Anung Un Rama, again) which had transferred to Ualac when the demon stole Hellboy's crown of fire</span>.

During "Unthinkable", he used that name connection to channel dark magic through Valeria to attack the Fantastic Four.

He suffered but as a god was unable to die. She wrangled his True Name from him in exchange for the antidote which ended his suffering.
<ul><li> There was also the belief that if you destroy all records of someone's name, their '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent">Ka</a>' would no longer exist. This has been attempted on unpopular pharaohs (like Akhenaten by everyone, and Hatshepsut by either her successor and stepson Thutmose III or his own son and successor Amenhotep II<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ehak');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0ehak" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ehak');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The latter is now considered more likely by Egyptologists; most evidence indicates that Hatshepsut and Thutmose ruled jointly on good terms until her death. It wasn't until long afterward (when Thutmose was himself quite elderly and his son as co-regent effectively already ruled the kingdom) that Hatshepsut's monuments began to be defaced, and the current theory is that Amenhotep did this in an attempt to claim them as his own creations. Though given that Amenhotep II did not allow records to be kept of his wives' identities, he might also have been trying to erase the precedent of a female pharaoh.</span>).
</li><li> Likewise, in the Egyptian <em>Book of the Dead</em>, the names of a number of guardians of gates in the netherworld are listed; by knowing them, the deceased gains power over them and will be able to pass through those gates.
</li><li> Furthermore, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">goddess/incarnation</a> of justice, Ma'at, has a true name that is not written anywhere because of the danger that someone might decide to speak it backwards.
</li></ul></li><li> In the original writings of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>, God's name is written around 7,000 times; the four letters that make it up are called the Tetragrammaton. Later on the Jews became superstitious regarding the name and would not say it, and since the original written form of the Hebrew language only consisted of consonants, the original pronunciation was lost. Another theory is that, according to Wikipedia, four letters of the Hebrew alphabet can double as vowels, ie <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mater_lectionis">mater lectionis<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, including Yodh "Y, I, J, or a vowel"; He "H, silent, or a vowel"; and Waw "W, V, or a vowel"; which all make up the Tetragrammaton. That is why in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Gnosticism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Gnosticism">Gnostic</a> literature, one of the names of the demiurge is Iao, Jao, Yao, or any other derivative form you can get from using the mater lectionis method. Either way, the loss of the correct pronunciation of the name of God in the present can make others mistakenly believe that the name of God was used in this manner by those who did know it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">while actually</a> the name was well known and often used during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BibleTimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BibleTimes">Bible Times</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">It was a crime for the Jews to practice magic.</a>
<ul><li> Confusingly (but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JewsLoveToArgue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JewsLoveToArgue">very typically</a>), the actual definitions of "Jews", "using", "magic" and "illegal" are constantly up to debate, and in practice, orthodox Jews of the Hasidic sect are <em>fervent</em> practitioners of folk magic and mysticm (including such things as consulting a divination specialist before making important decisions, buying amulets and charms for various benefits and fearing a curse when bad things happen). The Jewish term for a magician? "Bal-Shem", literally meaning "Master of Names". They are believed to derieve their power from knowledge of the true names of spirits, which they normally utilize by writing them down and hiding the pieces of paper inside the amulets.
</li><li> And one of the privileges God granted to Adam was to name all the animals in creation.
</li><li> There's a Jewish legend that changing the name of a gravely ill person can hide him from the Angel of Death. Similarly, it is against custom to name a baby after a currently living relative, since, should the Angel of Death seek out the older family member, the younger might be taken by mistake.
</li><li> Shemyaza, one of the Grigori/Watchers (the angels who were enamoured by human women and came down to earth to take them as their wives) was seduced by Istahar into revealing God's true name. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHaveIDone">He regretted it later</a>, and threw himself into the constellation Orion.

Since (in orthodox Christianity) Jesus has no need of spells, it certainly doesn't give him any <em>more</em> power over the receiver than he already has, and this is most likely emblematic of the absolute knowledge of the individual believer that Christ already possesses.
</li><li> In Homer's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOdyssey">The Odyssey</a></em>, Polyphemus the Cyclops is tricked by Odysseus/Ulysses. Odysseus claims his name is "no man," causing the Cyclops to be thought insane or cursed when he says that "no man" blinded him. However, Odysseus seals his fate after escaping when hubris prompts him to announce his True Name, allowing Poseidon, the Cyclops' father, to take revenge by sending a storm to destroy Odysseus' ships.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a>, specifically some re-tellings of the story of Sigurd, telling a dying person (and particularly a dying Dragon) is a bad idea, because if a dying person (or Dragon) curses you by name, that curse is guaranteed to be carried out.
</li><li> Traditional Shinto beliefs include a form of magic called <em>kotodama</em>, in which you can compel your target to do almost anything if you know their true name. Series that feature this include <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/WagayaNoOinariSama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/WagayaNoOinariSama">Wagaya No Oinari Sama</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Tactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Tactics">Tactics</a></em>, and <em>Her Majesty's Dog</em>.
</li><li> Finnish mythology has a variation of this trope: knowing something's <em>birth</em> gives you power to reverse it, and gain control over it. There are hundreds of fractures of "birth-words" for various things, gathered from oral tradition. For example, knowing the Birth of Iron should allow one to treat wounds caused by an iron weapon. On the other hand, speaking the true name of something powerful may also call it present, which is why the most commonly used words for certain things are not their original names. For example, the word for bear, "karhu" comes from the rough texture of a bear's fur. Also, the name the sky-god of old Finnish mythology is known by nowadays is "Ukko", meaning old man, as you definitely did not want to attract the attention of the god who decides the weather every time you had to mention him in a conversation.
</li><li> The City of Rome's true name was an actual state secret kept as jealously as the US missile launch codes which is understandable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">given their beliefs</a>. It was illegal to speak it out loud lest priests from a enemy state use it to curse Rome. As a result, nobody knows Rome's true name anymore.

When a dragon's True Name is spoken, there's a 5% chance the dragon will hear it, no matter how far away, and know the distance from and direction toward the speaker. A dragon is immune to Charm and Hold spells and magical control devices unless the caster speaks its True Name. If someone drinks a Potion of Dragon Control and knows a dragon's True Name, the dragon gets no saving throw vs. the potion. If someone speaks a dragon's True Name to it and makes a request, the dragon must grant it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Dragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Dragon">Dragon</a></em> magazine #91 article "Nine Hells Revisited". Greater devils each take a personal name that defines its form. This protects the devil from having its form changed against its will. Asmodeus, the archdevil who rules the Nine Hells, is the only being able to change another devil's name - and its form.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/WhiteDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/WhiteDwarf">White Dwarf</a></em> magazine #27, article "Summoners". Summoners are a sub-class of magic users specializing in summoning creatures to serve them. In order for a summoner to call or control a creature, they must know the creature's unique name (AKA <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueName">True Name</a>).
</li><li> Mezzodaemons and nycadaemons had personal names which they kept very secret. If an archdevil, demon lord or other powerful infernal creature discovered their name, it could be used to control the daemon.
</li><li> Both demons and devils had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakOfTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakOfTheDevil">Speak of the Devil</a> variant. If the name of a demon lord was spoken aloud there was a 5% chance it would turn its attention to the speaker. Each devil had a talisman with its name on it, and speaking the name on the talisman would call forth that devil to appear before the speaker. In both cases, unless the demon or devil were controlled, it would attempt to kill the speaker.

</li></ul></li><li> 3<sup>rd</sup> Edition:
<ul><li> The supplement <em>Creature Collection</em>. In order to destroy an Unhallowed, its True Name must be learned and spoken aloud to attract the attention of the gods before attacking it.
</li><li> The supplement <em>Book of Exalted Deeds</em> goes into some detail with the Words of Creation. As a precursor to the Celestial tongue these are considered inherently good (no evil creature can speak them or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote">bear their sound</a>) and include creatures' true names. A true name is unique to a single individual and is expensive and time-consuming to research, but discovering it allows the character to perform various useful tricks on them, anything from a penalty on saves to casting <em>teleport</em> or <em>greater teleport</em> on them, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyIsNotSafe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyIsNotSafe">at the cost of 5d4 points of nonlethal damage to the speaker</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Edition 3.5 has a character class called the "Truenamer," who used this style of magic by learning the language of creation. A truenamer can technically use any utterance (spell) he knows any number of times per day, limited by the fact that the universe hates being screwed with, so spells get progressively harder each time per day they're used. That, and they screwed up the main way to use it so badly that it's nigh impossible to say it more than once.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>:
<ul><li> Demons of Chaos are vulnerable to their True Names. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonSlaying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonSlaying">Ordo Maleus</a> maintains those which are known in The Grimoire of True Names, which in-game enables those equipped with a Grimoire to cut the Daemon's Weapon Skill (ability to strike blows in close combat) in half. (Hey, it can't kill you if it can't hit you!) Sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonLordsAndArchdevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonLordsAndArchdevils">Greater Daemons and Daemon Princes</a> will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">go so far as to announce their true name</a>, just to point out how doomed whoever stands against them is.
</li><li> Works mechanically in two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkHeresy">Dark Heresy</a></em> supplements. Knowledge of a Daemon's True name gives the player bonuses to summoning and commanding that particular daemon. It is also featured in the "Thy Name I Keep" background where a character starts knowing a daemon's true name (or at least a fragment of it).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BlackCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BlackCrusade">Black Crusade</a></em>, player characters can receive a Daemonic name from their patron Chaos God. This brings them additional Infamy but should an opponent discover the name they gain an additional Infamy/Fate point (which can be spent to reroll failures, enhance successes or even avoid death) when fighting said player.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a> Magic</em> the alternate rules suggest that knowing someone's true name (which can be things like DNA or Social Security number) give a very large bonus on targeting them with a spell. It also makes it easier to control summoned creatures.
</li><li> The supplement book <em>Mythic Egypt</em>, written for both Rolemaster and the Hero System, naturally discussed true names. For purposes of magic in that setting, many spells meant to affect others required knowledge of their true name first (though there was also a spell to discover that by observing somebody directly which naturally didn't have that prerequisite) or otherwise simply wouldn't work, and one of the supernatural races of the setting had the explicit weakness that all of them shared the <em>same</em> true name...that had gotten out long ago.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LegendOfTheFiveRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LegendOfTheFiveRings">Legend of the Five Rings</a></em>, the "Lying Darkness" had avoided being named at the creation of the world. This left it undefined and without limitations, and it tried to unmake the world. The world's heroes were finally able to stop it by gaining the power to name it, thus fixing its nature and imparting the qualities of the (previously existing, but no longer used) name Akodo.
<ul><li> Also, name-based magic is practiced by non-rokugani. Within Rokugan, it is practiced by the nezumi (rat people) and an angered nezumi shaman can cause a minor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">Cosmic Retcon</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson">Unperson</a> you if he snatches your true name away.
</li><li> Oni can do something similar. They are nameless in their native realm and can't remain in the mortal world unless someone lends them a name. If the oni ever fully wrests the name from its original owner, the now-nameless victim is forced to obey the oni's commands.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> features a reversal with She Who Lives In Her Name. Anyone who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote">hears her true name</a> becomes a drone who can only meditate on the inherent harmonic perfection of it.
</li><li> Almost all magic in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Earthdawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Earthdawn">Earthdawn</a> system is based off of Names. The importance of Names in the system is emphasized by the fact that the collective term for all sentient races is "Name-Givers."

<ul><li> Using the target's true name is necessary or helpful when using certain Power Words. Including the target's true name makes the Power Word "ASKIIR!" (Psychic Disrupt) much more effective on it.
</li><li> It is necessary to use a target's true name when using the Power Words "KROLAK!" (Neural Disrupt) or "SCHANG!" (Resume True Form) against it. If the target does not have a name, the user must have a higher Psyche score to use those Power Words against it.

<ul><li> Knowing a creature's True Name allows the casting of or enhances the effect of the following spells: Spirit Son, Bond of Blood, Spirit Brother, Spirit Father, Magician's Mark, Sigil of Warding, Mark of the Minion, Mark of Dominion, Summoning of the Unseen, Exorcism, Exchange of Hurts, Strip Power, Compel Truth, Breath of Crom Slough, Compel Spirit, Eye of the Avenger, Circle of Summoning, The Unseen Hand, S&eacute;ance, Trap Ghost, Raise the Dead, Charm and Scry.
</li><li> Creatures can have the Mystical Price called True Name. If another being uses the creature's True Name while conversing with it, the speaker gains a bonus on the use of personality-based skills against the creature. It is also more difficult for the creature to attack someone who has spoken its True Name.

A public name known by all with no power. 2. A private name with limited power (required for certain spells) given to allies, and 3. A true private name, known to the Ven and their mother (who gives them that name) which removes almost all spell resistances given only to the most trusted of allies and usually only needed for Unbreakable Vows.

<ul><li> An interesting twist on the theme occurs in the game, in which the main character is the Nameless One. His utter lack of a name prevents mages, demons, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bads</a>, and anyone else from scrying upon him, and makes it next to impossible to find any history related to him. This can be annoying because The Nameless One has lost all memory of his past life, and is on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestForIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestForIdentity">Quest for Identity</a> while stranded smack dab in the crossroads of the multiverse. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Later discovering his original true name grants him what is possibly the largest single-shot experience gain in any RPG, ever (2 million XP in case you're wondering). It also lets him get the best ending by itself.</span>
</li><li> The trope is twisted even more if the Nameless One attempts to <em>take</em> a name. Calling himself "Adahn" to NPCs results in an unusual focus of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">belief</a> in the world; he's certainly not Adahn, but people start to believe that there is an Adahn wandering around that looks and acts just like you. Do it enough times, and eventually enough people assume that Adahn exists that... well, you can meet him yourself in a bar, proving that words cannot only break your bones, they can make them, too!
</li></ul></li><li> The fairies of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OdinSphere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OdinSphere">Odin Sphere</a></em> have two names, with one being born with which they declare upon their death. This plays a significant role when King Onyx sets out to disprove the existence of the World Tree, which threatens his kingdom. During the game's true ending he is killed by a mortally wounded Mercedes, a fairy who declares her real name as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Yggdrasil as she dies. Not only is this translated to "World Tree", but she eventually becomes that tree when the world is saved and reborn from Armageddon</span>.
</li><li> True names become important in the last chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights">Neverwinter Nights</a>: Hordes of the Underdark</em>, when you become trapped in the eighth layer of Hell and knowing the true name of the gatekeeper is the only way you can return home. You can also learn the true names of several important characters in the process, including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, which lets you do things like skip the final fight with him, force him to return to Hell and never set foot in Toril again, grant you a layer of Hell to rule as you see fit, and/or make him to serve you as a lackey for the rest of eternity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a></em> lets you learn the True Names of a few beings and use them to various ends:
<ul><li> The devil Mephasm will willingly tell you his True Name, because he's trapped in the mortal world and only someone who knows it can safely banish him back to hell. Later in the game, you can use it as part of a summoning ritual, which lets you trade magical trinkets with him.
</li><li> You can learn the True Name of the Demon Zaxis from a Succubus who wants you to find ways of using Zaxis' True Name to make it suffer. You can then force Zaxis to lend its magical energy to open a portal for you, tell it to stop talking like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdPersonPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdPersonPerson">Third-Person Person</a> (which fails because Zaxis is too stupid to understand the difference between third- and first-person), or give it to an Erinyes to complete a quest.
</li><li> The True Names of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Shadow Reavers</a> can be found on a scroll which you acquire during the late game. When fighting a Shadow Reaver, you must have one of your companions read the scroll in order to make them vulnerable to damage.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Achaea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Achaea">Achaea</a></em>, the Occultist class has the ability to take a "true name" from a player's corpse. They can later use the true name in a very strong attack against that player.
</li><li> The "No one ever seems to realize this" bit is pointedly averted in the MUCK game <a class="urllink" href="http://scross.homeip.net/Wiki/index.php/Main_Page">SouthernCross<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, as those taking the flaw 'Bound by Superstition', among other significant quirks, have a True Name. This is so common in the setting's fae cultures, that a deep-set tradition is to either name an afflicted child with a difficult and esoteric name, then give them a new name by which they're addressed normally, or for the afflicted character (if they have one) to see to it that people always call them by the name of their domain (the concept or element many fae-blooded characters embody). 'Course, it's also played straight in that another part of said culture is the intrinsic value placed in knowledge of one's true name, and so just forgetting what your True Name is and having done with it is rather frowned upon.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em> universe, knowing a demon's true name gives you some power over it. This is presumably how warlocks control their demon minions, as enslaving a random demon will only allow them to control it for a few minutes and the two warlock minions without an individual name (Doomguard and Infernal) will only stay summoned for a limited time (they used to break free and attack the player, but now they just despawn).

</li><li> In the lore of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a>,</em> this is why generic demons are referred to only by their rank, while particularly powerful ones are named.

Only the Speaker uses the name (always the Full Name) of the members, and explicitly "naming" someone is either an insult, a reprimand, an enormous faux pas, or is calling for them to speak - depending entirely on context.
<ul><li> In the United States Senate only the presiding officer may be directly addressed in speeches; other Members must be referred to in the third person. In most cases, senators do not refer to each other by name, but by state, using forms such as "the senior senator from Virginia" or "the junior senator from California." <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxLV0bVysnk">The reason for this: it minimizes the chances of having bad tempers on display.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>

<ul><li> Thanks to the Internet, openly showing your real name or e-mail address can lead to all sorts of unpleasantness coming to light. (This isn't the case if your name is exceptionally generic. But if they also have a general location...)
<ul><li> On <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/MySpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/MySpace">MySpace</a>, there is an option you can enable that requires people adding you to know your last name or e-mail address.

</li></ul></li><li> Some say that the best way to make a troll stop is to call them out by their full name. More thorough retaliation involves phone numbers, addresses, class schedules, friends, relatives, and photos. Collectively these are known as "dox" and to release this information is to known as "dropping dox." Take note that this is risky business for the namer, as many forums have strict rules against posting the personal information of others to prevent cyberbullying. Ironically, this is also a common harassment tactic used by trolls themselves. The best way to use this against trolls it to reveal small kernels of information at a time, things that let the troll know that <em>you</em> know who they are, but without fully revealing their identity to others.
</li></ul></li><li> A variety of cultures still believe that names have power, and often people are given a name for daily use in order to keep their "true" name sacred.
<ul><li> In certain rural locales in the Philippines, sickly children are believed to be targeted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a>, and as such are given a "second baptism" in an attempt to throw the Fae off. This ends up sometimes with a person being known by his legal name in the city and by his second name to his folks who stayed on the farm / island.
</li><li> This is true of some Native American peoples. Some give a child an unpleasant name at birth (to trick envious spirits), and then a more appropriate name later on. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pocahontas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pocahontas">Pocahontas</a> ("little mischief"), for example, was not the Powhatan princess' true name (which was Matoaka). The Din&eacute; (Navajo) have a true name ('war name')&#151;generally known only to their maternal grandparents, who gave it, and their medicine man&#151;and go by another name for everyday purposes. The Navajo also taboo naming people or pets after dangerous animals, because calling for your dog, 'Bear', is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews">calling bears to you</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the United States, one's Social Security Number is effectively a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueName">True Name</a>. They are designed to be unique, used only when unambiguous identification is necessary, and if someone else gets it they can cause some problems, to the point that people do not share them with even their closest friends or family members. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1emd2');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1emd2" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1emd2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> US SSNs are technically not unique to a person. They are recycled after a period of time. Thus, while a number will be unique to a <em>living</em> person at any time, it's entirely possible that your SSN was once held by a person long-dead. After all, there's only 1 billion possible SSN combinations ; in a country of 300+ million alive right now (and 10+ million new births/immigrants each year), reuse is inevitable (and there have been well publicized cases of confusion). Also, you <em>can</em> get your SSN changed under certain circumstances. </span>
<ul><li> In many countries who practice ID cards, the ID card number.
</li></ul></li><li> This is undeniably true in the case of an employee ID number, especially for someone who works in a public or semi-public service (such as an internet service provider). Because such companies use such ID numbers to deal with internal affairs, an outsider (or unscrupulous coworker) with such an ID number could wreak havoc, costing the person in question their job, if not more.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Sovereign_citizen">"sovereign citizen"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>/<a class="urllink" href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Freeman_on_the_land">"freeman on the land"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> movements hold that as the government and the courts do not use what they say is their True Name, those entities have no authority over their members. (Their True Names are some variant of their legal name, such as "John of the family Smith," "John of Smith" or even "John: Smith.") As the number of "citizens"/"freemen" who have lost legal cases or been jailed attests, they are wrong.
</li><li> The big reason companies give nametags to their employees is so the customer has an easier time identifying who they're complaining about. It's much easier to say "Johnny was here this day," than "the guy with the clean-shaven face and buzzcut that are company-mandated." If your job doesn't reprimand you for doing so, you could easily bypass this by hiding or not wearing your nametag.
</li><li> If you call someone by their name, they will usually stop for a moment to hear what else you have to say. However, if this power is abused, it will become less effective.
<ul><li> One of the more puzzling phenomena in experimental psychology is <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_party_effect">people's ability to hear their own name being mentioned in a conversation across the room<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> &mdash; even when they can't hear any other part of that conversation. It presumably indicates the brain processes the stuff it "hears" first to look for significant signs like one's name and then throws away a lot of information that never gets processed further. This also happens with people who've changed their names due to familiarity (if not satisfaction) with the old name.
</li></ul></li><li> Because religious intolerance has and still exists, part of Gerald Gardner's "Old Laws" for Wicca touches upon persecution and the need for secrecy and the usage of names at rites. <em>"And while there, none shall say whence they come, or give their true names."</em>
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Confucius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Confucius">Confucian</a> doctrine of the "Rectification of Names", which can be summed up in the proverb "The Beginning of Wisdom lies in calling things by their proper names." Its purpose was to prevent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">Poor Communication Kills</a>, which Confucius believed would snowball into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">societal collapse</a> if left unchecked. Other sources (this is not the place to decide between interpretations) would have it that it was even closer to the trope in that it actually meant the rectification of <em>things</em> so that they matched their <em>names</em>, because the names had separate metaphysical power and the world would only work if things in it matched them. A ruler not acting as a ruler should was not only acting in ways that didn't work, but this was tied to the fact that he was not realising the essence of rulership properly.
</li><li> This is the underlying principle behind middle names. You can't avoid telling people your first name, and not telling your last name is inconvenient when your village has five other Johns. So what can you do to protect your kid from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a>? Give them a third, secret name (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongName">several names</a>) and instruct them to not give said name to strangers. Problem solved!
