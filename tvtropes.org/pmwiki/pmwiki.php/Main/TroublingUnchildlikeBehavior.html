That means worrying about little kid things and doing little kid things, such as playing on the trampoline, watching TV, going fishing, or whatever it is that kids do locally. What we don't expect kids to do is to drink alcohol, smoke, have sex, use drugs, hitchhike, commit violent crimes, or do other things we associate only with teenagers or adults. Yes, many adults get upset when a teenager drinks beer, but when a 10-year-old does it, outrage turns to concern and worry.
</p><p>In fiction, there are two ways this tends to occur. Sometimes the kid is shown engaging in such behavior as though it's normal for them, and this can be used to show that the child has had a harsh upbringing. Other times, the kid is trying an "adult" behavior for the first time, which may sometimes have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin">disastrous consequences</a>.

Children who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConditionedToAcceptHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConditionedToAcceptHorror">Conditioned to Accept Horror</a> are often tragic examples, being forced to age quickly in order to survive their surroundings.
</p><p>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilleFatale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilleFatale">Fille Fatale</a> is considered this less than is plausible, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">sexual precociousness is often a sign of sexual abuse</a>.
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">Child Soldiers</a> are a particularly tragic and horrific example of this.

This is for when actual children are the ones engaging in unchildlike behavior.
</p><p>This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> insofar as there are indeed preteens out there who smoke, drink alcohol, have sex with each other, and so on.

</li><li> A print advertisement campaign for Carib&uacute; bitter chocolate, called "The Dark Side of Sweetness", consisted of two ads.

<ul><li> The students of class 3-E. They are tasked with the mission to kill their own teacher and instead of displaying fear or hesitance, they show great enthusiasm in planning how to kill him. Even more disturbing in that even after they've bonded with said teacher and developed affection for him, it doesn't slow them down for a bit. Granted, the fact that their target is not human (he is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a constantly-smiling bullet-proof tentacle monster that destroyed most of the moon who has threatened to do the same to Earth in a year's time should they fail to kill him</span>) may be a factor in this behavior, but still, as another teacher had said, this is not normal:
<div class="indent"><em>"A group of junior high students are joyfully discussing an assassination. If you look at it normally, this is the pinnacle of madness."</em>
</div></li><li> And among them, there is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nagisa</span>, who displays this trope on an even higher level, as it's shown that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he will not hesitate to kill</span> even if the opponent is human.

<ul><li> Eren and Mikasa's backstory, which involves them killing a trio of human traffickers. While ruled self-defense, 9-year old Eren calmly justifying the brutal killings by explaining that they weren't "people" anymore leaves the Military Police shaken.

</li><li> In confusing flashbacks and illustrations, Alice, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">or more accurately, the Will of the Abyss... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">sometimes</a>...</span>, also does this, displaying somewhat unsettlingly flirty behavior with Jack and being cheerfully vicious with Vincent. Eventually leading to yet more of this trope from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>Gilbert</em></span>, who tries to strangle her. Later chapters reveal that Alice is actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an aversion. In her human form, Alice (white dress) is actually the Will of the Abyss with a huge crush on Jack. Alyss's vicious interaction with Vincent is actually a result of Jack's manipulation (even though she does sound awfully cheerful about it). Alice (black dress) is actually a pretty normal girl herself. She just prefers Glen to Jack because of the destruction of her plushie in the real world and Jack's eventual causing the tragedy of Sablier. Her creepiness in Jack's memoirs is a more likely a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a> considering what we learn about him later</span>. The Will of the Abyss may qualify for this trope in her scene with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Break</span>, but that aspect of her personality never comes up again.

<ul><li> The first ones we see are Al and Jeff Bowen, who attempt to blow up a high school partly for their mission, but more so because they themselves were teased in school. Al spends the rest of the series methodically working his way through various battles and trying to kill a Keith with a gun at one point. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Also, a flashback shows us that the twins murdered their own parents and killed a bunch of kids at their school with a poisonous gas that they invented to leave no traces.</span>
</li><li> Then we get Carol, an adorable little girl who is introduced cheerfully telling Ryo that she has the power to twist and crush things like metal and human bones with her mind and that she very much enjoys the power that comes with doing this. It's implied that she only went through life by having people fear her, and Ryo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">calls her bluff on her enjoying it</a>.

</li><li> Commander Gabriel Miller in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em> was highly curious about souls at a young age ever since his father, a bug collector, told him that bugs keep on living for a bit even if their heads are severed from their bodies. This spiked Gabriel's curiosity, which led to him wondering if human souls hide somewhere in the head and, while alone, <em>murdering his childhood friend with an iron stake through her ear</em>. He apparently claimed that her soul got into his mind for a moment and let him experience brief flashes of her life, and from there on, he gained a psychotic fascination for murdering people to experience that feeling again. It says a lot a hi-tech virtual world can only find a <em>void</em> in his body, so he <em>may</em> just be speaking the truth.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul">Tokyo Ghoul</a></em>. Ghoul children are just as innocent as human ones, with flashbacks showing most of the cast were unhappy about having to eat humans to survive. That doesn't stop Ghoul Investigator Kureo Mado from spreading a rumor that ghoul children can and <em>will</em> gleefully tear a grown human to shreds for fun, hoping to use the resulting paranoia to smoke out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyNeighborhoodVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyNeighborhoodVampire">Arata</a>'s children. Tragically, this lie ends up <em>forcing</em> Touka to kill a man in self-defense, traumatizing the Kirishima siblings and leaving them homeless. They end up having no choice but to become as brutal as rumored, just to survive.

</li><li> Recurring but lesser-known villain The Gorgon from Marvel qualifies; though it's not shown, he was described as being born with near-full-adult intellect, saying his first words at two weeks, walking at three weeks (and he only took that long because his body had to build up), and being fully literate before his first birthday. He also <em>first</em> tried to commit suicide at age <em>six</em>, shortly after writing his first opera, and mathematically proved the existence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">the One-Above-All</a> by 13, three more suicide attempts later due to realizing how utterly insignificant and worthless not just he himself but the entirety of humanity was to the universe at large. "Prodigy" barely covers his mental ability, and if he hadn't developed the mutant power to turn people to stone by looking at them (hence the name Gorgon) and hooked up with HYDRA around the time most of us are just starting to plan for college, he probably would have ended up <em>successfully</em> killing himself.

Bruce originally didn't let him out in the field, and he only became Robin under Dick. Dick got him to act a little more normal though Dick's extreme own personal combo of experience, patience, and just being a good person. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batgirl2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batgirl2009">Stephanie</a>, after learning Damian had never really played in his life, pretty much forced him onto a moon-bounce with her (though she admitted she was pretty sure he wasn't joking about stabbing her several times during her run) and usually ignored him when he got bratty. Damian acted a little more like a kid around Colin Wilkes (probably to put Colin, who was the same age, more at ease), but it was a major change from his original characterization. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedRobin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedRobin">Tim</a> and many other people still found him very unnerving even by the time of the reboot, though. <br><br>One of the major themes in Batman and Robin from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a> reboot is the difficulty Bruce is having in keeping Damian under control.

By itself, that's horrifying enough, but the real kicker is that the kids are doing it for themselves, not to afford food or shelter or to pay off a pimp. Some of them even own luxury apartments from the money they make that they haven't already spent on drugs, and the homes are tripping over themselves trying to get the kids to stop.

Being mentally reconditioned to and being so detached from pain stimuli as a result, she has been noted to be harming herself, something that a normal person wouldn't find from a three-year-old, not one without severe mental or behavioral problems. To top it off, Reimu has a habit of hitting, scratching, and biting others, apparently unaware that the others can and do respond to pain and injuries, or she is merely trying to relearn how to feel and respond to pain, though the former is likely than the latter. In 20XXV, it's noted that she tried to stab someone with scissors, but it's never revealed why. Then again, she is suffering from kind of mental illness.

Junior also looks up to a criminal the majority of the film and pretty much aspires to be just like him. Ben, Junior's well-meaning, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">good-hearted</a> adoptive father, puts up with Junior's behavior for the majority of the film and is patient about it, despite the rest of his family telling him to get rid of him, with his wife even suggesting to replace the boy and get another cat. Averted in the ending, when Junior does a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a> after he is kidnapped by his "idol" and apologies to Ben for his behavior. While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, Junior's behavior can be seen as accurately depicting a severe personality disorder and some of his actions, especially his knack for harming and almost killing cats, can be seen as horrific to many.
</li><li> Somewhat downplayed in the sequels. Though they have the same concept, this time with <em>two</em> children taking part of destruction and mischievousness, the fact that it has a lot more slapstick and more comedy than the first makes it hard to take seriously, being more like a live-action cartoon. There is also no abuse inflicted on animals as in the first.

She also killed Baron Vladimir Harkonnen and several soldiers, earning the nickname "St. Alia of the Knife".

He then murders their governess after she tries to intervene. The governess herself is horrified at what she sees as unchildlike behavior from both the kids since Jordan already knows the word orgasm (although she learned it from an older teenager) and uses tampons, rather than sanitary towels, for her premature periods.

Although his intention wasn't to kill the bully, just to beat him so badly that he and the other bullies would be terrified of Ender from then on, and thus, leave him alone. Somewhat justified in that the school he later attends <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">deliberately recruits children who act and think "older" than their age in order to train them to be part of the war machine</span>.

The entire cast is aged fifteen and under, and Sam and Lana both dwell on how disturbing it is to see young children drinking, smoking, and doing drugs. Not to mention the plentiful violence.
</li><li> In <em>Goodnight Lady</em> by Martina Cole, at age eleven protagonist Briony is already a seasoned prostitute (who asked to be sold to a brothel in her sister's place) and has more sense of the "business" than women three times her age, later causing her to become rich and successful as the owner of many brothels of her own.

Needless to say, it's easy for It to use him as a scapegoat for It's 1957-1958 killing spree.
</li><li> Patrick Hockstetter, another member of Henry's gang, is even worse. He kills small animals for fun by smothering them in an old refrigerator, fondles the girls in his class, gives Henry a handjob and offers him oral sex, and is revealed to have smothered his own baby brother to death with a pillow when he was only <em>five</em>.

He's also given a sharp dagger by a hare who thinks nothing unusual of a kid stabbing people with one hand and sucking the other. By comparison, the young, gangly teenager that goes on to see new friends and an adoptive father/Abbot poisoned to death, kills massive numbers of vermin, faces and decapitates a snake that could eat him alive, and comes plummeting from the top of an Abbey with a bird stuck in his shoulder, all by the age of thirteen seasons, seems almost reasonable.

However, scans show that this man has been shot 17 times. When the daughter is questioned about the event, she asks why her father wouldn't just die, since she had shot him so many times.

The most notable &mdash; and most chilling &mdash; example of a child killer is Jenny Brandt from the episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/LawAndOrderS10E2Killerz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/LawAndOrderS10E2Killerz">Killerz</a>", a ten-year-old girl who not only intentionally murdered a six-year-old boy, but mutilated his body on top of it all.

The child actress who played Jenny Brandt, Hallee Hirsch, was only 12 at the time and honestly should have won an Emmy for that performance.

Usually the behavior itself is relatively harmless and the primary concern is that it's an indicator of an underlying problem (i.e. a kid suggesting getting naked with a friend because they were sexually abused and it screwed up their compass for appropriate behavior), but there are a few examples where a child commits horrific acts for no reason, just because they feel like it, as well as at least one case where the kid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviouslyEvil">completely failed to recognize that he was hurting anyone</a>.

As a teen, he frequently goes on destructive rampages/rebellions, such as stealing his mother's car, sleeping around, smoking, drinking, getting four nose piercings, and other similar behaviors, all just to spite his mother or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">just for the heck of it</a>.

The cast consists of a kindergarten class and its staff, but nearly every mission involves killing at least one person, often intentionally, and even the ones that don't will still likely have someone getting hurt either physically or mentally. Just to name a few examples:
<ul><li> Cindy's mission in the first game has her have the protagonist help her bully Lily mercilessly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy">as revenge for her now-missing brother dumping Cindy earlier</a>. This gets to the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Carrie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Carrie">dumping a bucket of blood over Lily's head</a>, which is the straw that breaks the camel's back and causes Lily to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">jump to her death</a>.
</li><li> Monty's mission in the second game, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad">Breaking Sad</a>", centres around helping him make drugs to sell to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddledAddict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddledAddict">Addled Addict</a> teacher.
</li></ul></li><li> Ienzo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em>.

Plus, the Outcasts in the even worse Undercity know her as someone who explores places even their scouts fear to read, which means going toe to toe with <em>rakghouls</em>. There was also a significant gap of time between when her piece of <em>ossik</em> brother abandoned her and she started traveling with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">Zaalbar</a>.

And it's implied it's all he knows.
</li><li> Silver's behaviour is especially apparent when contrasted with the bratty rival Blue in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">the previous generation</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Giovanni's</a> son, he hates Team Rocket, and will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters">use their own methods against them</a> if it means stopping them.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">Cyrus</a> apparently displayed this at a young age.

Then again, his absurdly perfectionist parents didn't help at all.

He is incredibly abrasive in conversation (when a Skull Grunt questions Guzma why he outranks them, Gladion more or less tells said grunt to shut up) and a perfectionist in battle. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This likely stems from being disowned by Lusamine as a result of not wanting to follow her example.</span>

</li><li> Then there's Crystal and Clem. They're seen messing around with poison, and there's one scene where they talk about how everyone is "going to be sorry" in very somber monotones far divorced from their usual chirpy facade as they watch the sunset on the top of the roof. After you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">rescue their brains</a> Crystal does explain their previous behavior: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">They were trying to kill themselves</a>, and if you read the message boards around the camp you find out it's because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">they were being bullied for acting positive all the time and trying to make others happy</a></span>.

Since then, he's been shown still using his Magic Paintbrush, summoning giant killer robots, and kidnapping Peach, along with assisting in unprovoked military attacks. There are also some implications that he's a gambler. All this, from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge">a 3- to 5-year-old child</a>.

So, this kid who is using his father's corpse to kill other people with his now-weaponized taxi? <em>He's eight years old.</em>

For instance, Ivy's only reaction to the Diego battle is to joke about how he wasn't strong enough to beat them. Weirdly, this doesn't seem to be intended as a red flag, as the girls act like normal, well-adjusted people otherwise. It is possible that this is simply meant to reflect their isolated upbringing.

</li><li> <em>Minipops</em>, a 1980s TV show in the UK, consisted of young children dressed up as famous pop stars and singing popular hits. It drew a lot of controversy over showing kids wearing adult clothing, often performing songs that referenced sex.

<ul><li> According to <em>The Encyclopedia Of Serial Killers</em>, 10% of serial killers make their first kill before the age of 10. And even if they haven't killed anyone just yet, there are often signs that something is not right about the child. Torturing animals and sadism are two common signs. An odd example is the case of Ted Bundy, one of America's most notorious serial killers. Although he didn't kill anyone (that we know of) in his childhood, there <em>was</em> that time when his aunt woke up to find her bedspread covered in knives&#151;and little Teddy sitting beside the bed, <em><strong>smiling up at her</strong></em>... That "childhood" thing isn't so certain either. When Bundy was 14, an 8-year old neighborhood girl disappeared and has never been found. Until the day he was executed, Bundy denied any involvement in her presumed murder, but many investigators believe she was his first victim, especially since he was already displaying delinquent behavior at this age &mdash; theft, voyeurism, etc.

</li><li> About a dozen twelve-year-old religious Israeli girls in Hebron (a town in the West Bank) decided to go into the Palestinian section of town one day and start harassing vendors in the market. The three Israeli soldiers on the scene (who lacked the power to arrest Israeli citizens) could not even touch the covered arms of the girls since the soldiers were all men (there's a religious taboo), and if the Palestinians had fought back, the soldiers might have had to arrest them, even knowing how ridiculous the situation was. Since police never came, all the outnumbered soldiers could do was try to stand between the girls and the vendors. Clearly, the girls had planned ahead and realized what they would be able to get away with considering the division between army and civilian control. This incident was not repeated.
