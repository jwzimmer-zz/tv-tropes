</li><li> <strong>Cringing Bootlick:</strong> Bob is treated like dirt by Alice, but is still loyal, due to a debt of gratitude, masochism, hope for reciprocation on Alice's part (e.g. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIgor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIgor">The Igor</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRenfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRenfield">The Renfield</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr">Love Martyr</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadLove">Mad Love</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SycophanticServant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SycophanticServant">Sycophantic Servant</a>), suffers from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome">Stockholm Syndrome</a>, or simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotUsedToFreedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotUsedToFreedom">doesn't know any better</a>.

</p><p>This may also occur if a couple takes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropertyOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropertyOfLove">Property of Love</a> to its logical extreme. For some people in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BDSM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BDSM">BDSM</a> relationships "enslavement" can be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualKink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualKink">Casual Kink</a>, which presumably makes them happy to participate in or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleThirtyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleThirtyFour">at least fantasize about</a>.

<ul><li> Nana in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em>. While she's treated as horribly as any other Diclonius, Chief Kurama, one of the scientists in charge of her, sees her as something of a surrogate daughter and treats her at least slightly more humanely than the other subjects. In return, Nana genuinely loves him and seems to just accept her treatment as "the way things are".
</li></ul><ul><li> Sort of played straight by Wormmon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em>. He serves Ken out of a feeling of obligation as Ken's Digimon partner and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr">a hope that he can make Ken good somehow</a>.

</li><li> Saito in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero">The Familiar of Zero</a></em>. Despite all the treatment he gets, he still loves Louise, and she loves him too. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Not that she'll admit it</a>. There are also moments where Saito has some control over her in the later seasons. It helps that his familiar runes make him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">forget the bonds he has with his family and old world</a> and, over time, replace them with a desire to serve and protect his master. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When the mind control gets erased he has a major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> but eventually gets over it. The books end with the two married and going to Japan to introduce Louise to his parents.</span>
</li><li> Haji from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodPlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodPlus">Blood+</a></em> does weird things with this trope. For at least the first 2/3 of the show, he embodies this perfectly: a servant that is completely and utterly loyal to his master, because as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">chevalier</a> he's biologically hardwired that way. Then it turns out that chevaliers can betray their masters and abandon them without remorse; Haji is simply <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush">that</a></em> devoted to Saya.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheLawOfUeki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheLawOfUeki">The Law of Ueki</a></em>: Due to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr">love</a> for Robert Haydn, Rinko is almost slavishly devoted to him. However, soon after meeting the protagonist of the series and realizing how little Robert actually cares for her, she decides to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">join</a> said protagonist's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DearS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DearS">DearS</a></em>, perhaps a little further than usual with this trope. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">hat</a> that all the DearS wear is exactly this &mdash; they're a slave race, content to do whatever their master tells them. In this case it has to do with the fact that they have to be loved and trusted or at the least appreciated by another race in order to survive <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> If that doesn't work and they stop being trusted and loved they kill off the master race and find a new one</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun">Trigun</a></em>, Legato Bluesummers is this way towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Knives</a>. Despite Knives essentially crippling him, beating him up, and calling him "trash," Legato remains in complete bliss as long as he serves under Knives. Most <em>definitely</em> the "cringing bootlicker" kind. Knives <em>does</em> treat Legato (at least in the manga where he has a backstory) better than anyone <em>else</em> Legato ever knew&mdash;that is, he turned up and killed all the people Legato hated most while they were engaged in <strong>raping him to death,</strong> and then decided not to kill the kid and let him come with him, and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">asks him his name</a>. (The kid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">doesn't have one yet</a>.) And then evidently gives him some clothes and eventually puts him in charge of minions, and at least implicitly approves of and values his creepy superpowers, and trusts him to run things while he, Knives, is in the Gunsmoke version of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">bacta tank</a>.... The bar is low, but Knives clears it by a mile. Which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">in itself horrible</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a>: TSR</em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyTwins">Creepy Twins</a> Xia Yu Fan and Xia Yu Lan are this towards <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Gauron</span>. Because they feel so indebted to him for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry">taking them in</a>, they are shown to be willing to undertake a suicide mission that he orders. Of course, it's possible that it's not just gratitude, and there are hints that they have feelings of love that contribute to them being so loyal to him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em>:
<ul><li> Seras Victoria is offered her freedom by Alucard, but refuses to leave her vampire master.
</li><li> Alucard himself doesn't seem terribly bothered calling Integra "master" either, in fact, he greatly enjoy his servitude to Integra, in the manga he even says that he has a beloved master [Integra] just for him and servant [Seras] that only loves him.

<ul><li> The various slaves in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Naofumi's village</span> eventually came to be happy with their new Master. Some of the younger slaves even think of him as a mother, much to his annoyance.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> is such that as a Demi-human Raphtalia is <em>safer</em> as a slave under a nice master instead of being free, as then she at least have some legal protections, as opposed to none if she where to be free. In the situation where Raphtalia was temporarily freed, she could have been killed on the spot by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPrincess">Evil Princess</a> without legal repercussions, because demi-humans have no legal standing in that country.

Not to mention that previously mentioned trauma, which has shown to actually affect his perceptions. He's completely forthright with everyone joining his party about these conditions. Also Naofumi states outright that as soon as the slave sigil is applied, he removes <em>every</em> possible condition except a) the ability to lie to him and b) the ability to betray him, stating that 'It's almost impossible to build a good working relationship otherwise'.
</li><li> This is also emphatically <em>inverted</em>, when Naofumi's inner circle is transported to yet another world, and Filo is enslaved in a conventional manner by a tavern owner. She's 'only' commanded to sing on cue and unable to escape the place, but she's utterly miserable and scared the whole time.

In their very first appearance, they appear to be merely unfortunate slave girls sitting at her feet with chains around their necks, whimpering when appropriate. By their next appearance they're piloting one of the ships in her armada, still decked out in their slave collars and rags, and enthusiastically helping their queen.

Alice treats Teresa more like an employee than a slave, however, utilizing Teresa's natural talents and making her the face of the store she opens, where Teresa is quite popular, as well as making sure Teresa takes days off to relax. Teresa, for her part, is loyal to Alice and her life with Alice is a significant step up from where she had been; Teresa's parents were abusive due to her not having a special ability like most demons and the whole reason she had been available for purchase in the first place was humans kidnapped and sold her to the person Alice bought her from. This is best demonstrated when Teresa's younger sister, Dolores, tracks Teresa down intending to rescue her and is dismayed to find her big sister doesn't really <em>need</em> rescuing.

The people of Krypton endured this situation until a slave called Val-Lor refused to pretend he was happy and openly defied their torturers.

The Vrangs forced their Kryptonian slaves to pretend happiness because it fed their egos and kept their slaves subdued.

This being <em>Touhou</em>, their relationship has been portrayed in all manner of ways, but most commonly romantic... which lends to this trope a fair amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">squick</a>, given that Yoshika is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUndead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUndead">dead</a> and Seiga was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer">necromancer</a> who raised her...

Hermione even talks about cleaning the kitchen, although God literally puts the food on the table and provides lots of other miracles on request.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Maleficent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Maleficent">Maleficent</a></em> fanfics, this trope is sometimes played for drama, as Maleficent of course wants to set Diaval free after her problems are resolved and his life-debt repaid, and he takes this as her sending him away and is deeply hurt that she would discard him.

Notably, when the two conquer a backwater planet to set up their empire, everyone else coming with them is kept in suspended animation until technology reaches a certain level; Akitsu on the other hand begs to be let out the moment they secure their rule, despite knowing that no time would pass at all to her. When she starts growing old, Akitsu isn't worried about someday dying since she'll die by their side. Still, she's ecstatic that Xanna both restores her youth and accepts her request to be killed in her sleep should Naruto and Xanna ever tire of her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/OffTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/OffTheLine">Off the Line</a></em>, Vincent becomes Cloud's pet because being a pet would protect him from the countless players out to kill him and finally give him some sort of safety. Cloud and his friends otherwise treat him as a regular person otherwise. Cloud is very respectful of Vincent's boundaries and is trying to find a way to free Vincent. Vincent doesn't like being a pet and wants to eventually be free but is otherwise grateful to Cloud.

Not only does May initially appear with her arms bound, a ball-gag in her mouth and naked apart from her shoes and bandana/hat, but she later reflects warmly on a past instance where she and Misty went swimming and May let Misty take advantage of her new weakness after exposure to water.

The novelization takes this scene a bit further. The bartender says "I only stock for organics, not (very distastefully) mechanicals." C-3P0 assures Luke "That's all right, master.

</li><li> The two native races of Utapau are a "cultural" example &mdash; the short, humble Utai willingly submit themselves to the rule of the tall, long-lived, near human Pau'ans. There is no animosity between them, and the arrangement suits both species pretty well; the Utai are naturally hardy and well-suited for a work-heavy lifestyle, while the Pau'ans are highly intelligent and have great leadership skills. In all likelihood, they'd probably be much worse off without each other, and they trust each other so much that the Utai even allow themselves to be represented in government by a Pau'an. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1b8n9');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1b8n9" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1b8n9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> this is, in all likelihood less an example of slavery and more an example of symbiosis. It's not clear that the Pau'an are capable of doing what the Utai do, or the Utai doing what the Pau'an do. They are not the same species, and both are native to the planet. The name of the planet even suggests this: combining the names of the two races. It's likely that these two species simply evolved to depend on one another. Certainly, neither seem to be deprived of anything they value as a result of this arrangement: which is unlike real world slavery. </span>

She generally seems quite happy with her lot in life, although she is sometimes commanded to do things she doesn't want to. It should be noted that, because of her medical expertise, and the fact that she is the slave to the leader of the light fae, she actually enjoys a great deal of prestige and influence within the fae community. Nevertheless, she clearly is a slave, and clearly is reasonably happy with that fact. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Although it seems that she is likely to be substantially less happy under the new Ash</span>. The Ash in season 1 also never openly referred to Lauren as a slave, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the one in season 2 however refers to Lauren as "chattel" and his property, both of which infuriate Bo</span>.

Most Fae think that Kenzi also falls into this category since they consider her to be Bo's property. It does not cross their minds that Bo considers Kenzi to be an equal.

Servilia's body slave <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> kills herself when her mistress does</span>, Atia is constantly crying in Merula's arms, and Posca never seems to long for freedom while he's Caesar's slave.

Justified: to an artist of the Italian Renaissance, employment with a patron who gives you unlimited resources and freedom to create would have been hitting the jackpot.

Naturally, there is the case where the slave wants to remain (the Bible says when their master gives them a wife and children), while the procedure for this is also described &mdash; if the slave wishes, just pierce the ear, and he remains with you for life (given the ambiguous nature of ancient slavery, this may occasionally have happened, though the Bible doesn't record any specific examples).

</li></ul></li><li> Some religions preach that submission and obedience to God is good and leads to happiness. Islam is perhaps most well-known for this. The common Arabic name Abdallah/Abdullah means "servant of God" or "slave of God"; many other Arabic names beginning with <em>Abd</em> mean "slave of [one of God's many titles]", e.g. <em>Abd-al-Jabbar</em> "slave of the Omnipotent".
<ul><li> Christianity also has these themes, with Jesus described as coming to Earth as a servant, and new testament verses such as "Only fear the Lord and serve him faithfully with all your heart. For consider what great things he has done for you." In James 1:1 Christians are spoken of as "bondservants of the Lord" approvingly.

Chapter Serfs are an integral part of a Chapter, filling all roles that aren't impossible for anyone other than a Space Marine to fill, and they do so far better than their counterparts outside the Space Marines. They are treated accordingly by their masters, considered full members of the Chapter Cult, and their lifestyle is superior to that of all but the richest people in the Imperium. Chapter Serfs are often made up of those who aspired to become Astartes, but failed along the way before even joining the Neophyte rank (scouts in most chapters, Blood Claws in Space Wolves), so they're likely chosen as a sort of consolation prize, as well as to ensure that only those who would dedicate a lifetime to the Chapter would serve it.Of course, the details are highly dependend on the chapter in question and can go all the way: From the Salamanders considering their serfs nearly as equals, over the space wolves, that may let the younger ones ignore or belittle the serfs, but have highly respected traditions that may see serfs in highly respected roles like story teller or brewer getting respect similar or even more than the wolves themself at times, towards the Ultramarines, that respect the serfs due to the necessity and importance of them therefore having professional respect for them, even if on a personal level the serf is clearly inferior, right on to extremes like the Marines Malevolent, who despise their serfs (and most others) and oppress everyone below them with passion therby averting the trope.

You can clearly see that Pozzo, who is blind and lashes on Lucky with a whip, is guided by Lucky, who is mute and wears bags of sand for him. At a certain moment Pozzo and Lucky fell and split apart. while Pozzo was still awake Lucky was knocked out. Pozzo recommends Estragon to hit him in order to awake him again and recommends that it is done on the head or the private parts. After Estragon hits Lucky on the private parts he has pain on his feet but still managed to awake Lucky. Estragon then orders him to search for his whip and bands that tie them together and Lucky obeys.

More generally, it is itself practically a trope of late nineteenth century Russian literature to depict the serfs as having been better off before emancipation. Chekhov again features wonderful examples in his short story "Peasants."

However, it also notes that most of them are perfectly happy with their lot in life; the T-Dolls that the player controls are in particular treated very well and quite loyal.

As their name implies, they are uplifted canines and predisposed towards a pack-like mentality, seeing their owners as the alphas. From the same game, the K'tang Kattori may also qualify, simply because though they believe themselves leaders of the Hegemonic Crux, they're too dumb to realise every other race in the Crux knows how to push their buttons to get them to do exactly what they want.The player character can do this as well, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">pushing the buttons to make them angry and attack you</a> leads to much funnier rants.

The slave and her "agent" both agree that, while not preferable to freedom, her tenure of slavery would grant an end to her debt and provide a sterling reference on her resume. In fairness, the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">indentured servitude</a>" is not necessarily slavery - she still has rights under the terms of the contract (such as sufficient food, accommodation, sapient rights etc), and Illium, the anarcho-capitalist paradise, <em>will</em> break its "no rules" rule to enforce them.

As thanks, the drell willingly serve the needs of any hanar out of gratitude. Comparing this to slavery is a great way to annoy the drell; Thane even gets offended when Commander Shepard says that sounds unfair, explaining that it is entirely voluntary and anyone can choose not to serve, it's just that few actually do.
</li></ul></li><li> It's implied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> that this is what elven slaves are like in the Tevinter Imperium via brainwashing. Fenris explains that a slave would not generally think to run simply because they do not know any better; his first escape was an accidental separation during a battle. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> If you choose to give him back to Danarius, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">his memories of Hawke and everyone else are erased, returning him to this obediant state</a>.</span>
<ul><li> One girl who you liberate from slavers asks you if you're her master now. If you take her on, she'll become a housekeeper at your estate. Fenris will blow up at you, asking if you want a slave that badly, but immediately backpedal when you point out that she's getting paid and is free to leave, making her an <em>employee</em> and not a slave.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fenris' sister</span> also plays this straight <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">going so far as to betray Fenris in exchange for an apprenticeship under Danarius.</span> If she is allowed to live, she tells <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fenris</span> that freedom without power was no blessing at all and that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fenris got the better end of the deal with the power his lyrium tattoos gave him.</span>
</li><li> Also applies with the Qunari and their Saarebas mages, who if they believe in the Qunari religion would rather die than be free.

If you're a REAL bastard <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> you can kill his dad, and force him to kill his best friend - only the latter will send him into a suicidal rage</span>. HK-47 also doesn't mind being your property - you keep him properly maintained, and your penchant for attracting trouble lets him indulge his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> programming <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and he is utterly <em>delighted</em> to find out you're the one who built him in the first place</span>!
<ul><li> The second game takes this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squicktastic</a> levels, especially with Visas Marr, whose greeting line is "My life for yours." Most of the party has been blackmailed, bullied, broken, or conned into coming along. The only thing holding the mess together is the low-level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> that Exile (and/or Kreia) has on them. Still, even after finding this out, none of them really minds it. Whether this is because they come to follow Exile on their own accord and their own reasons (as Disciple suggests), or their minds and wills are too ensnared by the Exile's Force Bonds for them to be able to leave is entirely up to interpretation.
<ul><li> This was further <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> in the magnificent Brotherhood of Shadow mod for the first game. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Channa Mae was so enthralled with Revan that she turned her back on everything, even her own concept of self, to become Revan's aide/assassin/secret apprentice.

A parallel is Solomon <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who gave up <em>his</em> identity and sense of self to avenge to loss of his Padawan, Channa Mae</span>. The Brotherhood <em>itself</em> also took its pride in destroying all sense of self, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> acting only as an extension of the will of the Sith King, of which their grandmaster was the last</span>.

In the Monster Guide, the entry for the succubus stated how its not uncommon for a warlock's succubus to fall madly in love with their master. This however, can also be disadvantageous, as they subsequently become insanely jealous when their master deals with other females (nevermind that succubi spend their time seducing everything that moves). Presumably this could also lead to trouble if the master is male and gay. Also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squick</a> if the master is undead. Basically, there's a lot of ways this could go sideways (though to be fair, that's generally true of romance on Azeroth).
<ul><li> A possible instance of this trope is Dar'khan Drathir. The way he speaks of the Lich King is...weirdly erotic. Though it might be less the Lich King and more the magical power that turns him on. Dar'khan betrayed his people, the High Elves, leading to an invasion and genocide. When your character shows up to kill him, he still apparently thinks the Scourge are going to help him: even though that prospect would not sound likely to any reasonable person at this point. Though again, he might just be extremely arrogant, it's a bit hard to say.
</li></ul></li><li> Danced around with the Night Elf campaign in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcarftIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcarftIII">Warcarft III</a></em>. Though Illidan is not a slave, he's also not free: he was imprisoned for life for attempting to make a magical well. Basically, Tyrande takes advantage of the fact that he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr">Love Martyr</a>, and forces him to do a bunch of stuff. Though to be completely fair, she's not actually aware of how much the things she's doing align with his real goals because she is very cynical. Illidan is only half doing this stuff because she is telling him to. Also, he uses the opportunity to escape his imprisonment.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment">Planescape: Torment</a></em> has a few interesting takes on this. At least three of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the joinable party members: Ignus, Dak'kon and Morte</span> are revealed to effectively be 'slaves' of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Nameless One</span> and are unwilling to leave: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ignus</span> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> and can only remember him as 'his old master' despite how much the two have changed over time. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dak'kon</span> is bound by a sworn life-debt he cannot repay <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">because The Nameless One is immortal</span>, and the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the latter does not know of it</span> does nothing to alleviate said debt. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dak'kon</span> literally cannot disobey any order given to him, no matter how unspeakably full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">Video Game Cruelty Potential</a>. Finally, there's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Morte</span>: No matter how badly he has been treated <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by some of The Nameless One's prior incarnations</span> &mdash; and he's been treated <em>pretty</em> badly &mdash; it's nothing compared to the alternative, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">namely, the massive guilt he'd incur were he ever to leave: The Nameless One's condition is implied to be his fault because he gave him false information while he was still alive</span>. Even more screwed up when you consider that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Avellone himself has said that "there is no evidence for this other than Morte's suspicion." Planescape canon is that petitioners can never remember anything from life; it's very possible that Morte is completely wrong. He was in Hell for a horrible crime he could not remember committing and would never feel closure for and then met a psychologically abusive man with the Mark of Torment mentioned below. Now that's an epic guilt-trap.</span>
<ul><li> This, of course, comes in <em>addition</em> to the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarkOfTheBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarkOfTheBeast">Mark of Torment</a> essentially forces slavery on the tormented souls that get attracted to The Nameless One</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Loved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Loved">Loved</a></em>. You play as a small, catlike creature that is given commands by your 'master'. Disobeying the commands makes the environment more colorful, but makes the landscape and enemies harder to understand and have less detail, making a metaphor that doing what you want provides happiness, but sacrifices the well-defined borders of your cage. Your master also becomes upset, asking why you disobeyed them, when they loved you. On the other hand, obeying their commands gives better detail and understanding to your environment, but your environment has absolutely no color, and your master still treats you like a pet, but treats you well.
</li><li> The Minions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overlord">Overlord</a></em> will gladly sacrifice themselves for you as long as you lead their race to world domination.
</li><li> It could be argued that the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin">Pikmin</a></em> have this kind of relationship with Captain Olimar and Louie. While it was more of a case of mutual co-operation for survival in the first game, the two Hocotatians are using the little plant people solely for capitalistic recovery (and, later, gain) in the second. In spite of that, there's never any sort of dissension within the Pikmin ranks, and, if <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esYm9q-bi4w">'Ai no Uta'<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is anything to go by, they're perfectly willing give their lives for their master(s).

</li><li> This is a central concept to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em> &mdash; though the anime often has abusive trainers that the Pok&eacute;mon serve because they've been caught and have no choice, for the most part in the games Trainer and Pok&eacute;mon always get along well. Even among the villainous teams some of them get along fine with their Pok&eacute;mon, either because they treat them well or because the Pok&eacute;mon adapts to enjoy the villainy they're used to commit. <em>Black and White</em> explores this in depth, some members of Team Plasma who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well Intentioned Extremists</a> unaware their leader is evil release their Pok&eacute;mon as ordered near the end of the game, and are confused when the Pok&eacute;mon don't want to leave them because they've grown attached to their trainer. This can also be subverted, however &mdash; in many games traded Pok&eacute;mon will not obey your commands without proper Gym Badges, implying you have to earn their loyalty and respect.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonsDogma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonsDogma">Dragon's Dogma</a></em>, the Pawns are definitely this trope.

Notably, hanging around their Arisen will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityIsInfectious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityIsInfectious">eventually lead the pawn to gain emotions and free will</a>, but even these "liberated" pawns still retain traces of their master/servant relationship with their Arisen.

Demons can be controlled, depending on the technique, to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplePuppet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplePuppet">People Puppet</a> degrees. They won't ever leave you, but that doesn't mean they <em>like</em> you.

You can, if you want, immediately remove the collar as soon as she asks, but your character actually says "It is not freedom, though." If you then treat her well, she's quite happy to tag along with you, even as she remains your slave (apparently for legal reasons). If you're male and have removed the collar, you can romance her, and towards the end she notes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she kept the collar and has some ideas for its use&mdash;though in fairness this doesn't mean <em>she'll</em> be the one wearing it</span>.

In turn, she adored him, and the two considered each other husband and wife. The two of them even fought side by side at the storming at the Coruscant Jedi Temple. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">Still, Eleena had no legal status other than being the favored property of her "husband" and Malgus killed her when she became a potential liability to him, despite her misguided devotion.

If said pops are collectivist too, they happily accept it for the greater good of their empire. Under the right government, a fanatic collectivist pop may even be <em>happier</em> enslaved than free!
<ul><li> Averted with the <em>Utopia</em> DLC. All enslaved pops now receive a 10-20% happiness penalty regardless of their ethos, and are far more likely to cause unrest that needs to be suppressed.

How could you?" When pressed for an explanation of what there is to "understand," she blurts out, "I... <em>like</em> it."
<ul><li> This appears to be the default attutide of anyone who isn't a ruler, caster, or warlord in Erfworld. In the text updates, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater">Parson</a> gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squicked</a> by the flirting of the cute <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CharliesAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CharliesAngels">Archons</a> when he realizes they don't even understand the concept of a 'volunteer'. Every unit under his command would do anything he asks, including have sex with him (which a female caster seems to consider SOP for male warlords with archons). Justified since the world is governed by the rules of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TableTopGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TableTopGame">Table Top Game</a>, where units always obey your orders. But here Parson walks among those 'units', who have feelings and personality, but still blindly follow orders and like it...
</li><li> The whole thing is unclear. The archons confronting Jullian definitely don't think it's normal to like being mind controlled, and the caster Parson was talking to about the whole rape thing seemed to be witholding her disapproval&mdash;good thing too, since it turned out the idea squicked Parson out. And while Parson comments that the archons seem to have no will of their own, this is only a paragraph after the archons mention that Charlie usually left them to their own discretion when dealing with clients. Note Jaclyn, who had a habit of telling her clients about active spells, despite the fact that "they haven't paid for spell security."
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Amazoness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Amazoness">Amazoness!</a>!</em>, the Amazons' female slaves seem to enjoy their captivity and Belandi is even outright rebellious against Pantariste. Then again, this is set during a time where they wouldn't be treated much better in a non-Amazonian free area. In fact, the patriarchal tribes would likely subject them to forced pregnancy on top of treating them like slaves, regardless of official status.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius">Girl Genius</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php?date=20051010">J&auml;gerkin<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> would certainly seem to qualify in their adoration of and devotion to their Heterodyne masters. So much so that they <a class="urllink" href="http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php?date=20080227">refer<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> to one who has forsworn his loyalty to the House of Heterodyne as "no longer a J&auml;ger." They will also obey someone who has married into the family, if only for the fact that they respect that one of the family is in love.
</li><li> The generals have a different view, however. While the J&auml;gers were created by the Heterodynes (from volunteers, or so they claim), they continue serving the Heterodynes out of love and loyalty. They also state that the true reason the J&auml;gers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">hate the Other's creations so much</a> is that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">force people to obey</a>, which the J&auml;gers consider abhorrent.
</li><li> The people of Mechanicsburg likely count too. Being minions is in the bloodline, and as Carson says, "People here are desperate for a new Heterodyne. <em>Any</em> new Heterodyne."
</li><li> The Geisterdamen also qualify; they're hardwired to obey the Other's voice, and spent twenty years in her absence tirelessly working to bring her back.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Freefall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Freefall">Freefall</a></em>, Florence and Helix enter into a discussion while Florence repairs some part of the ship before it first takes off. Florence relates a story of a feudal Japanese servant whose master beat him and treated him severely, and another feudal lord saw how dedicated the servant was, offering him a place in his manor, where he would be treated fairly. The servant declined, stating that he found his life harsh, but it was necessary, and proved how strong a person he was.
<ul><li> Also Florence herself, to some extent. She gets angry when Sam calls her a slave, but admits that she can't own property, vote, or travel without her owner's consent. Since her owner essentially treats her as a kid sister, and is lightyears away for the duration of the comic, it's not a huge deal for her. She does try to get the Ecosystems Unlimited corporation to realize the full extent of the sentience of their creations though, but has had little success.
<ul><li> It does bear mentioning that this is the same Sam who insists that, whatever logic Ecosystems Unlimited and its employees can come up with, Florence is a person and deserves to be treated as such. He's been known to use his power of authority as her captain to <em>order</em> her to have more freedon and independence, or teach her to circumvent bad orders that curtail said freedom.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Sam:</strong> Never ask for permission. Always arrange things so that you automatically have permission unless someone actively takes steps to stop you.
</div></li><li> And of course the robots. Many would argue vigorously against anyone who would claim that they're anything but property.
</li><li> Gets an interesting application when the governor inadvertently gives Florence an order she <em>wants</em> to obey. She gets the normal reward-response from her system for obeying the order, plus an additional rush because she just really, really wanted to do that anyway. She mentions that in uplifted chimps (a previous iteration of the same project that produced Florence), the same phenomenon resulted in addiction problems.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://freefall.purrsia.com/ff2300/fc02282.htm">Clippy is quite happy, as long the orders get carried out.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Then, Mr. Kornada is very careful to shelter Clippy from the outside world.
</li><li> While some robots are happy in slavery others are not. Florence is a mix and match of the options. She is likely designed to be this trope. Her master sees and treats her like a little sister. Having a sympathetic master makes it easier to work within the system than having no master would. She actually wants her children to be free but does not believe freedom would be good for her species yet.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Terinu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Terinu">Terinu</a></em> eventually finds out that his race, the Ferin, were uplifted to be the servants <em>cum</em> power sources for the Varn Dominion, and as such were designed to find service pleasurable.
<ul><li> To a lesser extent this trope is also found among the Vulpine, where the "Commoner" class have no say in government and are not permitted to own land. Subverted slightly in that Commoners aren't bound to a Farm Lord, and have the option of gaining social status by joining the military and/or marrying up.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TwoKinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TwoKinds">TwoKinds</a></em> has a few examples:
<ul><li> Kathrin has a wonderful life by slave standards and is happy with her lot in life (until recent plot lines have caused her to question this).
</li><li> Main Heroine Flora used to be a slave as well. However, she was lucky enough to be purchased by a friendly human family who treated her more like a daughter then a slave, and they actually let her return back to her people after a few years. Thus, Flora recalls her days of slavery with an unusual fondness.
</li><li> Mike, on the other hand, falls squarely into the 4th category; <a class="urllink" href="http://twokinds.keenspot.com/archive.php?p=618">he was born into slavery and wouldn't survive out among the Keidran tribes.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>

<ul><li> There's also Vaelia. Ariel released her when she saved her life, but this didn't prevent her from continuing to protect Ariel and follow her orders, and calling her "Lady-child." Since Ariel saved her from the gladiator pit, she considers her life to be Ariel's property, no matter what, large due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">wanting to atone for the mistakes of her past</a>.

</div></li><li> Of course, in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em> episode "Twilight" when Darkseid appeals to the League to <em>help save Apokolips from Braniac,</em> Superman is willing to let Darkseid AND those who didn't finish him off when they could ALL perish at Braniac's hands (because he knew Darkseid was playing the others in the League with the plea for help). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Darkseid also wanted to get close enough to Brainiac so his intelligence could be used to solve the Anti-Life Equation and assimilate New Genesis.</span>

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a> <em>Lil' Butler</em> is about a family who find a baby on their doorstep and raise him as their butler. He seems pretty content.
</li><li> Implied to have once been the case with Pearl. Pearls are little more than servants on Homeworld and it seems to be par for the course for other gems to treat them as lesser beings. The Crystal Gem Pearl was the personal servant of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pink Diamond, who ultimately took up the identity of</span> Rose Quartz, who treated her as an equal and who Pearl was happy to serve, willingly giving up her chance to return home to stay in Rose's services. After Rose's death, Pearl remains devoted to her and her cause, and is a primary maternal figure to her son, who also loves her. However, this also ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed">Deconstructed</a> to an extent, as she always cared more about Rose than humanity and remains the most dismissive of the Crystal Gems towards Earth and humanity as a whole even to the present.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> episode "Every Dog Has His Day", Soto agrees to become the pet as while his dog becomes the owner &mdash; all because Soto couldn't fathom life without his dog. It also makes perfect sense because Soto is a dumb, destructive baby while his dog is intelligent.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> has the episode "Squid on Strike," in it Squidward goes on strike to protest Mr. Krab's policy of charging his employees instead of paying them. SpongeBob on the other hand is more than happy to forfeit his paycheck and give Mr. Krabs all the money he has without question. Other episodes heavily imply that Mr. Krabs takes advantage of SpongeBob's love of fry cooking to pay him either a rate that is well below minimum wage, or nothing at all. And SpongeBob will rarely question the morality of the current <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme">Zany Scheme</a> Mr. Krab's talked him into.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> episode "Not All Dogs Go to Heaven", Meg invokes Brian's canine instincts against his will:
<div class="indent"><strong>Meg:</strong> Hey, Brian. In hopes that you'll open your heart to God, I wanted to give you this cross. <br><strong>Brian:</strong> No, I don't want a cross. <br><strong>Meg:</strong> Would you want it if I threw it over there? <br><strong>Brian:</strong> No. Please don't do that. <br><strong>Meg:</strong> You gonna get it, boy? <br><strong>Brian:</strong> No. <em>[desperately]</em> Please, no. <br><strong>Meg:</strong> Go get it, boy! <em>[she throws the cross; Brian runs off to fetch it, barking enthusiastically]</em>
</div></li><li> In the "Pax Romana" episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IlEtaitUneFois" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IlEtaitUneFois">Il &eacute;tait une fois...</a></em>, Pierre and Jumbo are depicted as Gallic POWs. After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicFireRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicFireRescue">saving a rich man's family from a house fire</a>, the rich man takes them in as his own servants.
