Despite being warned about a forfeit if the reprehensible act is not done, the hero reluctantly stands by the decision and accepts that the challenge is lost, expecting no credit for the deed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark">often not expecting anyone to know</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Alternately, the hero may be faced with a task outside of the challenge that is noble, but doing that task will force him to lose the prize &#151; an innocent stranger to save during a heated race, for instance, or helping a competitor who had become injured rather than just running to the end himself. The hero says "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight">Screw the Rules, I'm Doing What's Right!</a>" and goes to help.
</p><p>However, the hero is then told that that forfeiting the challenge in this way is exactly what was needed to triumph. It was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheWorthyMayPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheWorthyMayPass">a test of character</a>, and the hero has passed with flying colors.

More often, the hero is profoundly relieved and/or pleased that his apparent sacrifice to his conscience has been rewarded after fearing they have lost everything.

<ul><li> An invisible god and his sisters come up with a test for a prospective bride. Girls are brought to his dwelling place, and whoever can actually see him is worthy to be his wife. Many girls (including the protagonist's wicked older sisters) try, some even lying. But the only one who can actually see him is a kindhearted and shy girl who goes by Oochigeaskw ("Little Burnt One," or "Rough-Faced Girl," because her sisters pushed her face into the embers of their fire.)
</li><li> The secret test of character is more apparent in versions of this tale where all the prospective suitors before Oochigeaskw claim that they can see the invisible god and are sent away for lying, but Oochigeaskw herself admits that she <em>cannot</em> see him and the invisible god then shows himself to her as a reward for her truthfulness.

All the adults are upset, of course, but they can't agree whether the kid is really guilty or not. Then, one wise man comes up with a solution: He offers two gifts to the kid, an apple and a golden coin, and tells the kid to choose one of them. The kid immediately takes the apple, and he explains: The kid is still naive, and thus innocent; but if the kid had taken the coin instead, this would have proved the guilt, since the kid must have had enough experience with the world to know that killing is wrong.

<ul><li> "I was a very happy person. My wonderful girlfriend and I had been dating for over a year, and so we decided to get married. There was only one little thing bothering me... It was her beautiful younger sister. My prospective sister-in-law was twenty-two, wore very tight miniskirts, and generally was bra-less. She would regularly bend down when she was near me, and I always got more than a nice view. It had to be deliberate because she never did it when she was near anyone else. One day her "little" sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived, and she whispered to me that she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome. She told me that she wanted me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister. Well, I was in total shock, and couldn't say a word. She said, "I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want one last wild fling, just come up and get me." I was stunned and frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. I stood there for a moment, then turned and made a beeline straight to the front door. I opened the door, and headed straight towards my car. Lo and behold, my entire future family was standing outside, all clapping! With tears in his eyes, my father-in-law hugged me and said, "We are very happy that you have passed our little test. We couldn't ask for better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family!" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoofAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoofAesop">The moral of this story is: Always keep the condoms in your car.</a>"
</li><li> Another military joke where you [insert branches of choice here]. Three officers (in different units, say Army, Navy and Marines) are arguing about whose soldiers are the bravest while standing on building/a ship. The first two each call up a private/seaman/other "grunt" and tell him to jump off. The soldiers say "Yes Sir!" and jump. The last officer smiles, calls up a private from his unit, and tells him to jump. The private stands up straight, salutes, and says "Fuck you" before leaving. The officer turns to the others and says, "That, my friends, is true bravery."

Long before the time of the setting, Malekith, the greatest warrior and sorcerer prince among the High Elves and would have been shoe-in for the second Phoenix King except he was really unpopular for his arrogance and for the harsh customs of his home kingdom of Nagarythe, was passed over for another war hero named Bel Shanaar. Morathi, Malekith's mother (also secretly a devotee of Slaanesh and evil as hell) went ballistic about her son not being chosen to be Phoenix King, so together they had Bel Shanaar murdered before the gathered nobles and tried to frame him as a Slaaneshi cultist.

<ul><li> Richard Strauss' fairy-tale opera <em>Die Frau ohne Schatten</em> (The Woman Without a Shadow) The daughter of Keikobad, king of the spirits, has married the Emperor, a mortal man, but has to gain a shadow (that is, the ability to bear children) or the Emperor will turn to stone. She tries to con a human woman to sell her shadow, but in the end, although the Emperor is turning to stone before her eyes, she will not take the woman's shadow, having seen what misery this will bring the woman and her husband. She then gets her own shadow and the Emperor turns back to flesh and blood.
</li><li> In Rossini's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LaCenerentola" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LaCenerentola">La Cenerentola</a></em> (his version of the Cinderella story), there are two secret tests of character for Cenerentola and her family:
<ul><li> The fairy godmother is replaced by the prince's tutor, Alidoro. Alidoro visits the house of the three sisters disguised as a beggar; the stepsisters send him away, and only Cenerentola is kind to him. He rewards her later by giving her a dress and making it possible for her to attend the prince's ball.
</li><li> Also, the prince and his valet Dandini have exchanged identities so that they can observe the true characters of the women vying for the prince's hand. At one point, the "prince" (Dandini) offers to let one of the stepsisters marry his "servant" (the real prince), and they recoil in horror. Cenerentola, on the other hand, turns down an offer from the "prince" on the grounds that she's in love with his "servant."
</li></ul></li><li> At the climax of the play <em>The Caucasian Chalk Circle</em>, a judge must decide whether a child should be returned to his biological mother or remain with the woman who had raised him as her own son. He settles it by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">drawing a circle with chalk</a> and placing the child in the center of it. He tells the women to pull on the boy and that whichever of them can pull him out of the circle first will be considered the true mother. The birth mother pulls hard, the adoptive mother lets go rather than injure the child. Similar to the Judgment of Solomon story, the judge then reveals that it was a test, and that the adoptive mother has proven herself to be the better mother because she alone put the child's interests ahead of her own.
</li><li> Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> used this trope from time to time.
<ul><li> In <em>The Merchant of Venice</em>, Portia's deceased father leaves behind a test for her suitors. They are presented a room with three chests, each one made of gold, silver, or lead, and told that one of the three contains a painting of Portia; whoever finds that painting will win her hand. Choosing the expensive chests ends in failure&mdash;the leaden chest is the correct option, as it shows that the suitor is not motivated by greed. In an interesting twist on the trope that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">foreshadows her brilliant mind</a>, Portia takes action when Bassanio, a man she actually likes, comes to try the test. She arranges a song which contains a clue to the answer ("Tell me, where is fancy bred? / In the heart, or in the head?", and so on) to play while Bassanio is the room with the chests&mdash;after all, her father only said she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">couldn't outright reveal the trick</a>, so hinting at it is perfectly OK.
<ul><li> The same play later subverts the trope for comedy. Portia and her servant Nerissa, who have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisguisedInDrag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisguisedInDrag">dressed themselves as a male lawyer and clerk, respectively</a>, to save Bassanio's friend Antonio from his contract with Shylock, decide to play a trick on their husbands, who don't see through their disguises. Lawyer!Portia demands that Bassanio reward "him" with his wedding ring, which he had previously promised to never give away under any circumstance; Clerk!Nerissa asks the same from Gratiano, her own spouse. Both men hand over the rings (albeit with much reluctance), and when they meet their undisguised wives, the women make a big show of accusing their husbands of being lying, cheating jerks for giving up the jewelry&mdash;it's all clearly stated to be a joke, though, and they're not <em>actually</em> judging Bassanio and Gratiano, just having some fun at their expense. Portia and Nerissa then drop the ruse and reveal the truth, much to the men's surprise.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth">Macbeth</a></em> has a meeting between Malcolm and the recently-defected Macduff. Malcolm acts the part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">Card-Carrying Villain</a> whose rule would be even worse than Macbeth's, after which Macduff bemoans Scotland's prospects and refuses to join his cause.

See the note; it's not for the squeamish. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12m1z');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note12m1z" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12m1z');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">
<ul><li> You were randomly chosen to be the teacher or learner. You got the teacher role and the learner was sent off to memorize word pairs. You were seated before a switchboard with an intercom. There are switches for shocking the learner. You get a sample shock of 75 volts, and it hurts. The switchboard has voltages ranging from 15 volts to 450 volts, with labels indicating how dangerous the shock was.
</li><li> Your task is to provide a word and four choices for its word pair. You are to punish the learner for every error, starting at 15 volts and increasing by 15 volts per error.
</li><li> The learner starts making mistakes. At 75 volts, he screams and says he is in pain. By 300 volts, he's screaming about his heart. At 315 volts, he lets out a blood-curdling cry and no words. At 330 volts, silence. The experimenter says no answer is a wrong answer - keep shocking the learner. At 450 volts, continue administering 450 volt shocks.
</li><li> Nothing physically restrains you. You could stop hitting switches at any time. You could run. You could refuse. You could swing at the experimenter, who is calmly writing notes in the back in his lab coat. The experimenter insists they are responsible and insists you continue. The experimenter remains calm and has the authority of an Ivy League university behind him.
</li><li> The experiment tests obedience to authority. The subjects were ordinary Americans from New Haven, CT, recruited for the experiment at Yale. The proposed goal was to see if it took some kind of lunatic to do serious violence to another person just because an authority said to do it. Most experts thought less than 4% of the population would hit that 450 volt switch. About 65% did.
</li><li> Everyone but you is an actor employed by the experimenter, including during the variants discussed below. The random process of determining teacher vs learner was rigged; you were always the teacher. No one was in any real physical danger.
<ul><li> Further experiments tested variants. Having to see (or touch) the victim drove up disobedience. Being part of a group was dicey; when one person objected, others (with visible relief) also rebelled. Being in a group going along with it drove down disobedience.
</li></ul></li><li> Subjects showed a lot of emotional stress even when shocking the learner. They cried, chain-smoked, swore, shouted, protested, apologized, demanded to speak to the experimenter's boss...and kept right on shocking the learner. The experimenter had four pre-scripted lines; he insisted you continue, he said he was responsible, and he said the shocks might hurt but were harmless. He would stop the experiment after his fourth pre-scripted answer to your objections was noted.
</li></ul></span></li><li> The Asch Conformity Experiment. The test subject was placed in a room with other people where everyone was shown a set of lines and asked which one was the longest. The answer was blatantly obvious, but unbeknownst to the test subject, everyone else was instructed to give the wrong answer. The subject was asked for their answer last. In those situations, they answered wrong <em>much</em> more often.
</li><li> A guide on giving job interviews suggested giving an applicant a piece of cake, but no fork to eat it with, then observing how the applicant reacts. Presumably, the right kind of applicant would ask for a fork while the wrong kind of applicant would sit quietly and not ask for a fork, but the test doesn't take into consideration what happens when the person isn't hungry or a diabetic or something. Or eat it with their hands. Or if they just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">use the titanium spork they always carry</a>.
</li><li> In the 19th Century, the final exam for British Army officers included the question "How do you dig a trench?" as a test of whether the candidate had an officer's mentality. Candidates who gave an answer involving the actual physical actions required would fail the test. The correct answer was "I say, 'Sergeant, dig me a trench!'" If he was in the Navy, officer candidates would be expected to know what they were ordering the hoi polloi to do &mdash; they'd still make the PO do it, but they'd know what would be involved.
<ul><li> A variant that is likely an urban myth: when selecting an NCO candidate, the command simply tells the candidates they want a trench 30 feet long, six feet wide, and six inches deep. Of course no one knows why they were given these instructions and everyone complains or has questions. The best candidate is the one who first confirms they have correctly understood what command wants, then immediately yells at the others, "Alright, boys, grab the shovels. Who cares what it's for? Let's knock this out so we can get out of here!"
</li></ul></li><li> Some teachers use a simple test to see if the students can follow instructions: At the top of the paper, you are told to read the entire test, and then perform the tasks. The tasks can include anything from simple math, to standing on one foot while singing the national anthem. The trick is of course that one of the last instructions on the page is: "Ignore all the other tasks. All you need to do to pass is to write your name at the bottom of the paper." Most students will start carrying out the instructions before reading all of them, and properly look like fools to the few who actually remember what the test was about: following instructions.
</li><li> There is a psych-class test like this. In the middle of class a person dressed in a ski-mask and all black clothing steals the professor's notes and runs out. Then the professor asks the class to describe the attacker. In order to pass you have to prove you can overcome preexisting social assumptions by not assuming the attacker is (among other things) male.
<ul><li> Tests like this one can go very "meta" at times. One variant rates as a double subversion: the students are brought to a basketball practice session and told to count how many times the players pass the ball, as a test of their observation skills. As they're taking their seats, a door to the locker room "accidentally" swings open to reveal someone dressed in an unlikely combination of colors, pulling on an equally-odd-colored hat/sock/jacket. Thus forewarned, the students start watching for this figure, who darts onto the court yelling and then dashes away, just as expected. When the students return to their classroom to complete a quiz on their observations, prepared to relate every detail of what they'd seen, it consists of only one question: "What did the person dressed in [long detailed list of the figure's clothing] <em>say</em>?"
</li></ul></li><li> Applicants to a position of a newsperson/secret agent are asked to deliver a sealed envelope to some other location. One of them is overcome with curiosity so he hides in a closet and opens the envelope. Inside there is a note saying: "Come back, you are hired."
</li><li> An apocryphal Indian software company would place a precariously balanced cup of coffee next to the entrance to the interview room, in such a way that you were bound to knock it over as you entered. Candidates who tried to clean it up were <em>not</em> hired. The reason? That's not your job!
</li><li> Students in the intelligence school are completing an essay test. While they are at it, their professor is sitting at his desk, tapping nonchalantly with his pen. Suddenly two students stand up, go to his desk, and he gives them both an "A" without even looking at their writing. It turns out he was tapping "Come here, and I'll give you an "A"" in Morse code.
</li><li> Similarly, men waiting for interviews as telegraph operators sit nervously in a workroom. No one has been seen for an hour since the interviews were scheduled to begin. One man strolls up late and sits down for a few minutes, then stands up and walks past the secretary and straight into the boss's office. A telegraph in the workroom had been tapping out a message to barge into the office and claim the job. This variant is near-certainly apocryphal, since, even in the early age of communication, any attempts by workers to listen in on what could be private customer communications was frowned upon by management, at best.
</li><li> If you saw a young girl&mdash;let's call her Talie&mdash;wandering around a city, saying that she lost her mother, would you help her or walk away? If you answered the former, you may be in the minority. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.aol.com/article/2015/07/14/this-shocking-social-experiment-will-terrify-you/21209146/?interactionId=99999999999999999999002&amp;utm_source=apester&amp;utm_medium=scs&amp;utm_campaign=apester2015#confab-comment-25837341">The experiment shown here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> shows rather shocking results. The most disturbing part of this experiment is that one man who <em>did</em> offer her help was a known pedophile who was not allowed to be around children. (Thankfully, two actual Good Samaritans became suspicious of his aggressive behavior and called the police.)
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3749187/If-boy-girl-cat-dog-left-park-rescued-Social-experiment-shows-subject-people-responded-fastest-completely-ignored.html">There was a similar experiment by the Daily Mail, involving a little girl, little boy, dog and cat (in a carrier) left alone in Manhattan's Washington Square park<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Who would be helped first? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In order, Girl, dog, cat. That's not a typo. <em>Nobody</em> helped the boy.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> A group of similar stories involving guilt:
<ul><li> Supposedly this was used as a judging technique in ancient India: the suspects would go into a darkened room containing a donkey and were told to pull its tail; if the donkey brayed, the suspect who pulled its tail was guilty. However, what the suspects <em>weren't</em> told was that the donkey's tail was covered in black powder that wouldn't show up in the darkness. If a suspect came out of the room with powder on his hands, he was innocent, under the idea that a guilty person would only <em>pretend</em> to pull the donkey's tail so it wouldn't bray.
</li><li> A similar story is told of ancient China: three suspects would be told to plant sticks of equal length into the ground, and are told that by morning, the stick belonging to the guilty man will have grown one inch. The next morning, the authorities arrest the man whose stick is one inch shorter than the others; the guilty man, afraid that his stick would grow, secretly cut an inch off it in the middle of the night.
</li><li> One of the legends of Ooka Tadasuke, the famous samurai judge, has him using the same trick. The mechanism in this case is a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wattpad.com/wap/112606?m=51">dusty old Jizo statue<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. (This statue was a favourite of Ooka's &mdash; he used it as a <em>witness</em> in another case.)
</li><li> Those stories have nothing on medieval judges according to research into trial by ordeal that is discussed by Freakonomics authors Steven Dubner and Stephen Levitt. Let's suppose you have some sort of tort - say, Rolf is accusing Wilhelm of using crooked scales last week at market - and you're a medieval judge who has fifty such cases before him. Good luck getting any evidence to resolve this case. So you send Wilhelm off to grab a red-hot iron bar before the congregation under the supervision of the clergy. We expect Wilhelm to get crispy, right? The research looked at 308 similar cases. In 100 cases, the defendant refused to undergo the ordeal, settling the matter nicely. In the remaining 208, only one in three ordeals resulted in injury to the defendant. This requires modest speculation, but it seems that the priests would tamper with the trial by ordeal. This accomplished several things:
<ul><li> Anyone willing to undergo the trial clearly had a lot of reasons to back out if they thought they were guilty, since they believed God would know the truth and they knew many people were spared but many others were not.
</li><li> It made a public spectacle of justice, reinforcing the belief of the people in this legal system (and belief in God's justice).
</li><li> Priests are only human, and so they may combine a mix of belief that God is truly willing to bless their judgment with a belief that a nice bribe could determine the outcome of the trial by ordeal.
</li><li> If Wilhelm comes out of the trial alright, Rolf certainly has a strong reason to let the matter drop now. God has exonerated Wilhelm. The authorities might prefer that feuds and hatreds are dropped rather than allowed to fester due to a lack of evidence.
</li><li> The remaining 1/3 of people who were hurt by trial by ordeal may be either due to failure to rig the ordeal, priestly tampering to cause injury because they believed the party was guilty, priestly tampering in line with their own interests, or even a sort of "necessary evil" to keep the system in place.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Apparently, Vlad the Impaler did this when a foreign merchant reported that he'd been robbed of a bag of gold while traveling through Vlad's kingdom. Vlad asked him how many gold pieces he had lost, then told the merchant he would send for him if found the gold. A few days later, the merchant was called to the castle and Vlad handed him a bag of gold. Opening it up, he counted the gold pieces and then handed it back to Vlad, saying the gold wasn't his because there was one more gold piece in the bag than what he had lost. Vlad told him to take the gold, because it was just a test of his honesty and the merchant passed. <em>Vlad also made it very clear what would have happened if the merchant had not admitted that the gold was not his.</em>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Snopes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Snopes">Snopes</a> contains a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glurge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glurge">glurgey</a> example that acts as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">deconstruction</a> of these tests. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.snopes.com/glurge/rose.asp">The Rose<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> acts as a fairly typical test of character, with the lady of the story telling her penpal that she will be identifiable by the rose on her lapel; when he arrives, he sees an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">undesirable</a> older woman wearing the rose, but reluctantly approaches her, where she is glad to inform him that a beautiful young woman who had caught his eye earlier, tempting him, had given her the rose to make sure that he would go through with his promise. But <a class="urllink" href="http://www.snopes.com/glurge/info/rose2.htm">this rewrite<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> from the old woman's perspective demonstrates that sometimes, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy">want their beloved to be happy</a>.
</li><li> It is sometimes said that a way to test a forum or internet community is to join, post a deliberately flawed (though <em>not</em> to the extent of trolling) and controversial argument and judge whether or not to continue your membership from the responses &mdash; if people are dismissive and unpleasant, rather than polite and reasonable, don't stay in. Now, even if you're not actually trolling, this is still a very manipulative thing to do and likely to get you ostracised if you're found out, especially if they've happened to "fail" the test. It's also quite likely (unfortunate perhaps, but still likely, given that you're dealing with human beings) that even the most patient and gracious forum members[[note]]who, after all, might have a bad day or inadvertently find their buttons pushed will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuffersNewbiesPoorly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuffersNewbiesPoorly">show less tolerance towards someone they don't know</a> (see next paragraph for an example), so their reaction to a test like this may in fact not be a sufficiently good measure of their actual character. All in all, a quick test along these lines is probably not a good substitute for getting to know a forum or community (and letting them get to know you) over time.
<ul><li> An attempt at this that backfired spectacularly was carried out by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAtheistExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAtheistExperience">Matt Dillahunty</a>. He used an anonymous account on a certain forum (where he was already a prominent member) in order to prove to the forum's critics and detractors that the forum members were polite and reasonable people. Unfortunately, they failed his test and his posts were met with disdain and derision by both the members and the moderators: Only when Matt revealed his true identity was he treated more respectfully. But then his anonymous account was banned for going against the "No <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sockpuppet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sockpuppet">Sockpuppets</a>" rule, and he was demanded to issue an apology for his experiment. When he refused to do so he was banned altogether from there. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zX65hlHKEQg">The whole affair explained here in detail.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li></ul></li><li> Michael Lewis discusses this in his autobiographical story of the Wall Street firm Salomon Brothers, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiarsPoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiarsPoker">Liars Poker</a>. First, the Brothers used all kinds of job interview stress tests to weed out people who were too "weak" for the kind of environment of 1980's investment banking. Even then, applicants weren't offered jobs. They had get the hint to come take the damn job and tell the interviewer to shove off if he didn't like it. After that, the trainees were thrust into a downright abusive environment full of these little trials. Anyone who wasn't cunning, charming, ruthless, aggressive, and manipulative enough to survive in that kind of environment had no business ripping off customers as badly as the Brothers did in the early eighties.
</li><li> An old Jewish story tells of Reb Eisele Charif challenging all the young yeshiva students with a difficult Talmudic question, declaring that the one who answered correctly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngagementChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngagementChallenge">could marry his daughter</a>. No one came up with a correct answer, so he packed up and left. However, on the outskirts of town he noticed he was being chased by one young scholar, who admitted that despite failing the challenge he still wanted to know the answer to the question. Whether or not this was Reb Eisele's original intention, he decided that someone so dedicated to knowledge should be the one to marry his daughter.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanHalen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanHalen">Van Halen</a>'s infamous rider demand for M&amp;Ms with the brown ones picked out was actually a secret test of character. They used the demand (which was buried <em>deep</em> in the technical specs) as a check on how closely the venue had carried out the rest of their rider, which included technical details that were important for the band's performance and safety. For perspective, the band usually travels with <a class="urllink" href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/brown-out/">up to nine eighteen-wheelers full<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of complicated, heavy equipment that you do <em>not</em> want to set up unsafely. Brown M&amp;Ms (or, worse, <em>no</em> M&amp;Ms at all) indicated a slipshod job that would have to be double-checked by the band's crew, which according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidLeeRoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidLeeRoth">David Lee Roth</a> inevitably found something technically wrong with the production setup which in some cases were grounds for the concert being cancelled.
<ul><li> Van Halen's concern wasn't a substandard show. They were using so many lights, flying harnesses, and so much pyro, that people (band members, crew, or audience) could be crippled, burned, or killed if a rig wasn't up to standard.
</li></ul></li><li> This one is an old favourite of professors. One example is a professor telling the class that the next lecture will have no new material for the upcoming exam or that he/she's hosting an optional review session at some inconvenient time like Friday night. Anyone who is diligent enough to attend regardless gets a massive help for the upcoming exam, such as a list of topics that will most definitely be on it. As for the first example, no lies were told as it was stated that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">no NEW material would be covered</a>. How fair this is to the students who could not or chose not to attend the review session is up to you.
</li><li> Another one was used by a teacher to explain racism to her class called the brown eye/blue eye experiment in which she told her class that one group of people with a specific eye color was superior to the other and she was shocked about how quickly the children started believing it and even came up with their own slurs.
</li><li> A positive example: In the aftermath of the October 2014 Parliament Hill's shootings in Ottawa which were perpetrated by a Muslim extremist, three students <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9rFprD_Qf4">performed a social experiment<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> on the street in which one of them would dress in a typical Muslim attire while another one would verbally harass him and blame him for the shootings, the video shows many Canadians standing up for and defending the Muslim guy from the other guy's bigotry, one of them at the end even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkToTheFist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkToTheFist">punches him in the face</a></em> when he has enough of his prejudice.
</li><li> One common experiment is to leave a wallet or purse in a public place and see how many people return it with the cash inside. Variants include adding pictures of children or a well-worn bus pass to suggest the wallet's owner is poor.
</li><li> Secret shoppers routinely employ this, to make sure that store clerks are providing decent service and to make sure that they aren't breaking any laws (e.g. selling alcohol/tobacco to minors). In some cases, young adults will even be employed to persistently insist on being sold alcohol/tobacco without a photo ID &mdash; to see if the cashier, eventually, caves in. Some do take it a bit too far, though &mdash; and will persist until the cashier threatens to call security (or even the police).
<ul><li> In some jurisdictions, the police will have a minor doing community service enter an establishment and ask for a pack of cigarettes and/or alcohol, also to see if any laws are being broken.
</li><li> In stores that don't sell age-restricted products, secret shoppers are still hired by head office.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2cjaf');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2cjaf" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2cjaf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is to check that sales assistants are following company policy &mdash; wearing the uniform correctly, having a professional demeanour, and following protocol at the counter such as by talking about competitions or loyalty programs. Secret shoppers will then fill in a report or write their own review of the staff member's performance and give it to head office for them to praise or chew out the staff member about, depending on their performance.</span> While secret shoppers are supposed to leave sales assistants blissfully unaware of the secret shopper's task, even first-time sales assistants (presuming they've been warned) will often easily tell them apart from regular shoppers within the first minute or so and remember exactly which shopper wrote the report later on. What gives the secret shopper away? The secret shopper will almost always either ask or use the assistant's name at some point &mdash; something unusual enough for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">even the friendliest, most long-term customers familiar with the staff to do, let alone a new face</a>. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3508p');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3508p" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3508p');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Secret shoppers have to name the sales assistant who served them to head office. Even if the sales assistant is wearing a name badge, secret shoppers will often make a big deal out of reading the name off the badge or otherwise make sure to say their name out loud in order to better remember the name for the performance review when they have to write it.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> An executive takes a prospect to lunch at a restaurant. If he puts salt on the food before tasting it, he's clearly someone who jumps to conclusions without investigating the situation and is unfit for the position. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Because it's impossible that he's eaten there before and knows how they cook the food.</a> This story is often associated with Thomas Watson of IBM or United States Admiral Hiram Rickover, the father of the "Nuclear Navy", both of whom were hiring people for technically-demanding, detail-oriented work.

Weinstein, by actually reading the script, demonstrated that he was the only executive who was invested in the script and was prepared to personally push the film to be made</span>.

</li><li> The Freakonomics authors discuss a beautiful example of this. They designed an algorithm that looked at terrorists' bank habits and gave it to the government of the United Kingdom. The algorithm was very effective at turning in suspected activity, with a very low chance to flag an innocent person and a very high chance to snag a terrorist (in statistics, a sensitivity and high specificity - see note). However, because the innocent so greatly outnumber the guilty, many innocent people still wound up on a list thanks to the algorithm (in statistics, there was a low positive predictive value - see note). So the authors and the government went to press to discuss their project and revealed one of the algorithm's most powerful predictors: terrorists are young enough with enough family to justify life insurance, but they don't buy it (as it wouldn't pay off if they died in an attack). Naturally, the press was outraged that this secret would be revealed. The foolish Americans were excoriated by the British media - "How dumb are those Yanks? And how dumb is our government?" Despite the guffawing, the now in-place algorithm was watching that list of suspects to see who suddenly ran out to buy insurance... <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note50hih');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note50hih" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note50hih');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In statistics, sensitivity is the percentage of people who actually have the condition you are interested in that your test identifies correctly. Specificity is the percentage of people who your test correctly identifies as not having the condition of interest. As an exercise, let's say that the test is an algorithm designed to ID terrorists. It has 99.5% sensitivity and 99.5% specificity. Wow! Near perfect, right? Surely you can take the answer the algorithm gives you to the bank? Well, not so fast. Imagine you have a country like the UK, with a population of about 50 million. Your intelligence agencies, collaborating with your allies, estimate you have about 500 possible terrorists to find. With sensitivity 99.5% and specificity 99.5%, an algorithm would positively identify about 497 of the 500 terrorists. That's very helpful. Unfortunately, with a population of 50 million innocent people, your algorithm correctly weeds out "only" 99.5% of them. That means 0.005% of 50,000,000 people are incorrectly flagged as terrorists - or 250,000. Your positive predictive value - the odds a person the algorithm has flagged is actually a terrorist - is 497.5/250,497.5, or about 0.2%. For every 500 investigations you launch, you might investigate zero-three actual terrorists. Clearly an algorithm which ID'd terrorists with a sensitivity and specificity of 99.5% would not be nearly good enough for a situation like what the UK was facing. The UK's algorithm was apparently good enough to keep using, and even to keep refining with the nasty little secret test discussed above.</span>
</li><li> An escape room puzzle in the United States, unnamed here to preserve the secret for people who might play it (if you're dying to know, it is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "Summerfield Place," a game in Toms River, New Jersey</span>) features this in its ending. The game has players trying to solve the mystery of a family's inexplicable disappearance from their home. It's eventually revealed they were abducted by aliens, and a page of the mother's diary reveals that the beings are planning some kind of "experiment" with the human captives. To complete the experiment, the aliens need a chalice that has been hidden on their ship, which must be placed on one of two pedestals in the room when found. If the players choose to put the chalice on the left pedestal, the captured family will go free in exchange for the players themselves becoming prisoners. Putting it on the right pedestal releases the players, but sentences the family to death. If the group chooses to sacrifice themselves, an alien appears on a TV screen and congratulates them: the experiment wasn't scientific, but <em>ethical</em>, and the extraterrestrials were trying to see if humans were empathic enough to give themselves up for total strangers. By choosing this option, the players are rewarded with their freedom.
</li><li> According to legend, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> made a personal visit to Finnish Field Marshal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GustavMannerheim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GustavMannerheim">Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim</a> to encourage him to increase Finnish resistance to the Russians, Mannerheim casually lit a cigar during their private conversation. The famously tobacco-averse Hitler made no reaction to smoking in his presence. Mannerheim recognized it as a sign that Hitler was in a weak position, so he felt free to refuse Hitler's requests.
</li><li> The demonstrators of the laser exhibit at the Ontario Science Centre occasionally like to spring one on the guests. The centerpiece is a giant chemical laser which can be filled with many different types of gases, leading to lasers with different colors and properties. When the demonstrator fills the tube with carbon dioxide, they will ask if anyone can see the laser beam. There will always be one or two people who claim they can. The demonstrator then informs them that a CO2 laser is infrared, so only lizards would be able to see it.
</li><li> One common test for someone cleaning a house or other building is to put a bit of money under a carpet. The rationale goes something like this: if the money is still there after they perform their service, then they're sloppy. If the money isn't there, but isn't returned to the person who hired them, then they're untrustworthy. But if the money is found and returned, then they're honest and reliable.
</li><li> A viral social media post relates a "traditional" Chinese test of values posed to a toddler in the form of trinkets: to choose between wealth (a coin), pleasure (a toy), and knowledge (a picture book). In the described incident, the toddler <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">ignores all three and runs to his parents instead.</a>
</li><li> The Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles has an exhibit at the beginning before people enter where they show a video with a long list about groups people are prejudiced against, starting with common targets (such as other races or LGBT people) and going on to more obscure targets. At the end the visitors are invited to enter through one of two doors, one marked "prejudiced" and one marked "Unprejudiced". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the "Unprejudiced" door is locked, in order to show no one is without prejudice. That said, some people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticallyMissingThePoint">still bang on the locked door and demand to be let through.</a></span>
</li><li> Anna of Cleve's failure of Henry VIII's test was a disappointing start to a disappointing marriage.
<div class="indent"> "(Henry VIII and his men), being disguised with mottled cloaks with hoods so that they should not be recognized, came secretly to Rochester, and so went up into the chamber where the said Lady Anne was looking out of a window to see the bull-baiting which was going on in the courtyard, and suddenly he embraced and kissed her, and showed here a token which the king had sent her for New Year&#146;s gift, and she being abashed and not knowing who it was thanked him, and so he spoke with her. But she regarded him little, but always looked out the window&#133;. and when the king saw that she took so little notice of his coming he went into another chamber and took off his cloak and came in again in a coat of purple velvet."
