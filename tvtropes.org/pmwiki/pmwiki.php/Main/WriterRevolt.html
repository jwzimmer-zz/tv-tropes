<ul><li> It's a commonly held fan belief that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">The End of Evangelion</a></em> was a subversion of the ending fans wanted for the series, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideakiAnno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideakiAnno">Hideaki Anno's</a> middle finger towards both the fanbase and those who were dissatisfied with the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding">original ending</a>. While this may be true in regards to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">''tone''</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatAudience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatAudience">of the ending,</a> it seems likely that the events themselves unfolded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords">according to the scenario</a> &mdash; err, that is to say, as intended by the writers.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam">G Gundam</a></em> was originally created, Bandai wanted the plot to be a simple story about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobotGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobotGenre">super robots</a> fighting each other in a worldwide competition. Instead, Yasuhiro Imagawa created a series where the tournament was simply a backdrop for Domon to meet allies and fight his enemies, while the real plot was that several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy">nations tried to gain control of the Devil Gundam</a>, a super-powerful robot capable of dominating the world. This also led to some of the most memorably ridiculous designs in mecha history, such as a windmill gundam.
<ul><li> Even before <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam">G Gundam</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YoshiyukiTomino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YoshiyukiTomino">Yoshiyuki Tomino</a>, the creator of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> and its sequels, plotted a director revolt against Sunrise and Bandai with his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam">Victory Gundam</a></em>, making it his single darkest <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> show. As a part of his rebellion against the two said companies' merchandise interest at the expense of several plot elements in his Gundam series, he even created a motorcycle-like Zanscare battleship as an irony whilst the main stage of the show was meant to be Earth. The high character death rate along with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Katejina Loos' sudden <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Face&#150;Heel Turn</a></span> also have things to do with Tomino's rage.
</li><li> Tomino has a habit of doing this. The original Gundam was supposed to be a toy ad for an older elementary-school demographic. He turned it into, basically, "Ur-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">BSG</a></em> with a more coherent plot". Let's not even discuss <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">what he did with</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceRunawayIdeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceRunawayIdeon">Space Runaway Ideon</a>, although he was more directly responsible for that series; its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a> is still pretty much a giant middle finger to his bosses.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">director Masashi Ikeda said</a> in an <em>Animerica</em> interview that, while not wholly against it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHuggingNoKissing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHuggingNoKissing">he hadn't intended any romance between the characters</a> because there were more important things going on. The primary writing staff, however, seems to ship Heero / Relena very heavily, especially in the numerous manga spinoffs like <em>Battlefield of Pacifists</em> and <em>Blind Target</em>. <em>Frozen Teardrop</em> even ends <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with them engaged and planning to start a family.</span>
</li><li> When the first installment of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GalaxyAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GalaxyAngel">Galaxy Angel</a></em> video games was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">delayed for a long time</a>, BROCCOLI was fenced in with nowhere to go but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDecay">Adaptation Decay</a> for the still-scheduled anime. They decided to throw the whole thing out and turn the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GalaxyAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GalaxyAngel">Galaxy Angel</a></em> anime into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagSeries">Gag Series</a> that had nothing to do with the plot of the games and sometimes contradicted it.
</li><li> This might have happened at the end of the Cell saga in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama">Akira Toriyama</a> wanted Cell's second form to play a large role in the story, but his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">editor thought the design was ugly and told Toriyama to hurry up and have Cell change into his final form</a>. Toriyama complied, and second-form Cell didn't get to do much besides act as a punching bag for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LookWhatICanDoNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LookWhatICanDoNow">a powered-up</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Vegeta</a> before transforming again. Then, during the final battle of the saga, Cell reverted to his second form, and it was in this form that he made his largest impact on the story: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> killing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">the main character Goku</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAttack">self-destructing</a>.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>'s gradual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift">Genre Shift</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaremSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaremSeries">Harem Series</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShonenDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShonenDemographic">Shonen</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingSeries">Fighting Series</a> is a direct result of Writer Revolt in action &mdash; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenAkamatsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenAkamatsu">Ken Akamatsu</a> wanted to create an action manga, but the execs wanted him to do another harem series like his widely successful <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina">Love Hina</a></em>. When the execs decided to try to take away all the rights to the work, including the copyright itself, Akamatsu opted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchTheFranchiseAndRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchTheFranchiseAndRun">Torch the Franchise and Run</a>, ending the series abruptly with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a>, dealing with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> offscreen, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking">Ship Sinking</a> the four most popular pairings for the main character, and basically making any kind of continuation near-impossible. It still got a successor in the form of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UQHolder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UQHolder">UQ Holder!</a></em>, though.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em>: James' voice actor Eric Stuart was angry that 4Kids wouldn't be paying voice actors for commercials anymore, so he hid <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TEzLbzf2CE">a back-masked message in episode 130<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, where James yells backwards: "Leo Burnett and 4Kids are the devil!"
</li><li> Early in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ajin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ajin">Ajin</a></em>'s run, the initial writer quit and the artist took over the story. This led to a 180 turn in Kei, the lead character's, personality. Initially he was a pretty moral guy in a world of a lot of complete bastards and would try to avoid hurting people with his powers whenever he could. But after the artist took over, he became a sociopath who only really cared about his own survival over everything else. Fortunately, it didn't feel like an overly gratuitous change as there were elements in the original writer's story that lent themselves to the change, such as Kei's sister disliking and distrusting Kei even though he planned to become a doctor to cure her illness. That got used with her disliking him because despite him being kind and affable on the surface, she could see through it and see that he was really becoming a doctor for his own benefit, not hers.
</li><li> The writers behind <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalPrincessMinkyMomo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalPrincessMinkyMomo">Magical Princess Minky Momo</a></em>, frustrated with the toy company backing the show canceling it due to poor toy sales, had Minky Momo get run over by a toy truck and die.

Her appearances in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JessicaJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JessicaJones">Jessica Jones</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MarvelComicsOneThousand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MarvelComicsOneThousand">Marvel Comics #1000</a></em>, and <em>her own one-shot</em> all flat-out ignored Aaron's interpretation, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUnbelievableGwenpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUnbelievableGwenpool">Gwenpool Strikes Back</a> featured "Fem-Hulk" with an unsubtle complaint about being forced to depict her as such. In her appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ImmortalHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ImmortalHulk">Immortal Hulk</a></em>, the title character points out how they're not so different these days as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakThemByTalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakThemByTalking">Break Them by Talking</a> moment.

And recently in the Immortal She-Hulk one shot, it reveals she's STILL in trauma over the Grey She-Hulk odreal, and also dealing with the fact she may infact be immortal, though under Al Ewing he showed her as far more in control of herself despite the Hulk-speak than Jason Aaron has done.

He was replaced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeCasey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeCasey">Joe Casey</a>, who made changes, but put in as little of the Savage Hulk as he could (mostly just making him mute), and was on record as saying he respected David's run.

Marvel proposed him to write a spin-off comic, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateWolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateWolverine">Ultimate Wolverine</a></em>, but Millar wanted to make the <em>Ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a></em> instead. On the other hand, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtBusiek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtBusiek">Kurt Busiek</a>, the writer of the Avengers at the time, did not want that to happen, as he feared that the regular Avengers would be left under the shadow of this new comic book. As the Ultimate universe was turning into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise">Cash Cow Franchise</a>, so badly needed by Marvel to get rid of the risk of bankruptcy, they allowed Millar to work with the Avengers. And yet, the new team got a different name, as Busiek requested, and was named "The Ultimates". Still, it was not enough for him, who resigned from writing the Avengers as a result.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">Parodied</a> in a two-issue crossover in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em> where Jean Grey inadvertently swaps Peter's consciousness with Wolverine. Not only did both issues show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianMichaelBendis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianMichaelBendis">Brian Michael Bendis</a> apologizing for the storyline and berating the man who came up with it when Jean shows up and fixes it, Cyclops says that the whole thing seems ridiculous and unbelievable. Then Brian Michael Bendis outright states "Even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">I</a></em> couldn't stretch this over more than two issues."

Unfortunately for him, every writer since has written related stories, plot summaries, or character histories as though it were. Particularly funny as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarrenEllis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarrenEllis">Warren Ellis</a> (the original writer) wrote the series on the assumption that it was out of continuity as well and said as much in interviews. (Quesada has been opposed by everyone who has ever worked for Marvel at some point, though he does tend to listen to all parties and thus why Marvel is more creatively diverse these days than it ever used to be, though the price &mdash; a lack of consistent continuity &mdash; is hefty.) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MightyAvengers2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MightyAvengers2013">Mighty Avengers (2013)</a></em> eventually established <em>Nextwave</em>'s canon status; the characters in question did form a team by that name, and the entire comic took place in an offbeat alternate universe that the Beyond Corporation of the core universe sent them to.
</li><li> James Robinson's final issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica">JLA</a></em> drew attention from websites such as Bleedingcool for taking some very blatant shots at DC's then-upcoming <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a></em> reboot. The issue contains jabs at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GrantMorrisonsBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GrantMorrisonsBatman">Batwing</a> for getting his own title ahead of a number of DC's existing black superheroes, as well as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">not-so-subtle dig at fans who criticized Robinson's run</a>.

The line limped on for a while before collapsing, and Marvel wrapped things up by getting Len Kaminski to write a one-shot, <em>2099: Manifest Destiny</em>. Kaminski was the writer of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GhostRider2099" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GhostRider2099">Ghost Rider 2099</a></em>, and the opening narration makes it quite clear whose side he's on:

He got the idea of having the two parties meeting briefly in the shadows of a warehouse. Then he saw that Howard was scheduled to make appearances in some of Marvel's other comics, so he had the Savage Dragon / Destroyer Duck side of the meeting changed in that Howard gets himself cloned by a villain. In the confusion, one of the clones left the warehouse with Spidey (as seen in the Spider-Man side of the story, under the pretense that no cloning incident ever happened), while the real Howard is rescued by Savage Dragon and Destroyer Duck. The real Howard adopts the identity of "Leonard the Duck" (with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance">girlfriend</a> Beverly Switzler likewise becoming "Rhonda Martini") and makes appearances in Image Comics and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VertigoComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VertigoComics">Vertigo Comics</a> thereafter.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski">J.

So, he threw in Aunt May saying that it was her time to go, and Peter should just let it happen; a little girl who appears to Peter and drops anvil-sized questions about what will happen if she never is; visions of his life without Mary-Jane, all of which are rather lacking; and the little girl showing back up after the deal is made, revealing that she was Mary-Jane's unborn daughter who will now never be and saying, in essence, "Wow, you really fucked this one up, didn't you?". She also called out Peter on being a constant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst">Wangst</a> machine and hinting that he had a belief that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArtIsAngsty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArtIsAngsty">True Art Is Angsty</a>. He also has Mephisto proclaim that a "small part of their souls will remember what you have lost", thus somehow implying whatever Peter and MJ become on the surface is just an extension of Mephisto's spell and that the real Peter and MJ are locked away, waiting for release.
<ul><li> A happy ending to the <em>OMD/BND</em> mess was lampshaded in MJ's speech about how "nothing could destroy the relationship", indicating that her deal with Mephisto is to ensure she can somehow remain close to him and break both pacts one day with an ace up her sleeve, as well as the wedding scene depicted in the <em>Mary Jane</em> TPB reprint of <em>Parallel Lives</em> (the annual containing the retconned wedding was not included in this TPB), indicating that a new version of the wedding will one day unfold with the pacts broken. A few months prior to <em>OMD</em>, during his conversation with an angel, Peter is told he and MJ will overcome everything and still have kids.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianMichaelBendis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianMichaelBendis">Brian Michael Bendis</a> set out to completely derail the <em>BND</em> era just as it was beginning by having Peter unmask in front of his secret Avengers teammates right after Marvel had taken great pains to hide Peter's identity again. A strong fan of Peter and MJ's marriage, Bendis went on to imply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderWoman">Jessica Drew</a> remembered that he was married, with Peter denying it. <em>How</em> Jessica is aware isn't made clear.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a>/Spider-Man crossover that occurred shortly after established that thanks to his fourth wall awareness, Deadpool remembers the events of OMD.

</div><ul><li> When Tom DeFalco and Howard Mackie's 2009 Clone Saga redux was released as a trade paperback, it bore the title "The REAL Clone Saga". The redux, rather than try to amend the '90s Clone Saga so that it fits into the drastically altered BND timeline, simply tells a much happier, upbeat version of events where every character that was killed over the course of the saga SURVIVES. The story ending with Peter and MJ becoming proud parents is seen as another big "F You" to the 616 continuity.
</li><li> Most of the Spider-Man writing team and editorial team behind <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga">The Clone Saga</a></em> bailed in frustration because of that various mandates being handed down by the <em>merchandise department</em> and the editorial department constantly changing the story on them. One of them, Dan Jurgens, quit <em>Sensational Spider-Man</em> when the mandate came down that Ben would be revealed as the clone and Peter as the real one, feeling cheated that he wasn't writing the "real" Spider-Man.
</li></ul></li><li> When Dan Slott had May 'Mayday' Parker's family killed off in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderVerse">Spider-Verse</a></em> event, he swiftly began making Mayday more vengeful and bitter as she and her fellow Spiders faced a losing battle, going on to call the others assembled from across the multiverse "fakes" when her baby brother is abducted by the Inheritors, and that her dad was the "real one". This drew significant ire from fans and Ron Frenz in particular, who declared Slott was "no Roger Stern" and went on to point out damning continuity errors in Slott's take on Mayday. When the time came for the original creative team to tackle Mayday in a team-up book, Tom D and Frenz wasted no time at all in deliberately "adjusting" to Slott's writing style and not-so-subtly implying this Mayday was an alternative version as opposed to the one they worked on from 1998-2010. This has continued on into Mayday's backup stories during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretWars2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretWars2015">Secret Wars (2015)</a></em>, with Frenz even more incensed at the ending to <em>Spider-Verse</em>, where she takes up Peter's old costume and declares that she's Spider-<em>Woman</em> and that she's over it. Instead, everyone's still calling her "Spider-Girl", and she hasn't gotten over Peter's death.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns">Geoff Johns</a> pulled a very polite one when editor Dan Didio forced him to eliminate his two favorite characters, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superboy">Superboy</a> and Kid Flash, from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a>. Superboy was killed off for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExiledFromContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExiledFromContinuity">legal reasons</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1qbn7');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1qbn7" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1qbn7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">because of the then-ongoing legal dispute between DC and the Siegel/Shuster estates over the copyright to Superman was, at the time, tilting towards DC losing the rights to Superboy. DC reacted, naturally enough, by killing Superboy off (and having recurring antagonist Superboy-Prime change his name to Superman-Prime). Superboy's resurrection came when the courts made it clear that it was only "young Clark" Superboy who the estates might have a claim on, and other characters using the name belonged to DC. In a nice touch, the villain in the miniseries that Superboy and Kid Flash returned in? Superboy-Prime, going back to his original name</span>, while Kid Flash was aged up and became the new Flash (and was later killed off due to poor fan reaction). Johns continued to write the title, but the quality went downhill, and most of the stories seemed to be a meta-commentary on how much the book was missing. He wound up leaving after about a year of stories, and the title has never been the same. Interviews upon his departure made it clear that he would have still been on the title if the characters were still around. When fan reaction proved him right, Johns was commissioned to write the miniseries that brought both the characters back to life.
<ul><li> Also, killing Superboy was actually the lesser of two evils. Didio originally wanted to kill off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing">Nightwing</a>, the original Robin and one of DC's oldest and most prominent characters, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis">Infinite Crisis</a></em>. Johns pulled off a literal writer revolt and refused to write that, substituting Superboy so that a BigThree legacy would still die and that DC would at least be able to kill two birds with one stone.

He wrote a story called "Dreamquest" under the alias of John Harkness, which had the FF captured by Aron, a member of the same alien race as Uatu the Watcher, and replaced with brain-washed, "action figure" duplicates that a curious Aron uses to recreate the early Lee/Kirby stories ("you want Lee and Kirby? I'll give you EXACTLY Lee and Kirby!"), regardless of the consequences to the modern Marvel Universe (such as torpedoing a nearly-completed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a> by the Mole Man, whom the fake FF attack without provocation, causing him to swear vengeance). Meanwhile, the stasis-imprisoned real FF have dreams that function as ultra-condensed versions of the stories that Englehart <em>would</em> have written; the highlight was a war between Doctor Doom and an impostor who believed he was Doom, in which both assembled teams of supervillains to fight on their sides.

His boss wanted numerous changes, and though he negotiated down to just "turn the guy's girlfriend into a stronger character," he was inordinately offended by the idea of this re-write ("Saving fair damsels, is what heroes do. Especially saving the girlfriend!! But, no. Let&#146;s just put this premise on the respirator in the ICU before it&#146;s born..."), and retaliated by renaming the girlfriend "Tara Bates" - as he explained: "Tara was the home of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoneWithTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoneWithTheWind">Scarlett O&#146;Hara</a> (whom I consider the bitchiest character of all time) and Bates was the last name of Norman Bates of ran the Bates Motel in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Psycho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Psycho">Psycho</a></em> and he was, well, psycho." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Sheesh, dude.</a>
</li><li> Many of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Bat-family</a> (or related) writers weren't thrilled to have their book derailed to deal with the storyline <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DeathOfTheFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DeathOfTheFamily">Death of the Family</a></em>. Adam Glass (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuicideSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuicideSquad">Suicide Squad</a></em>) <em>really</em> didn't like doing it (and had to because of Harley Quinn), so he ended up re-writing some of the early events of the story to show that Harley was doing this unwillingly then jumped back into his storyline as if the tie-ins didn't occur. J.H. Williams (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batwoman">Batwoman</a></em>) and Grant Morrison (<em>Batman Inc.</em>) outright refused to derail their storylines for this and, thus, had no part in it.
<ul><li> Williams revolted again, with even more fury, when DC pulled the major dick move of denying Batwoman and Maggie Sawyer their marriage, even though the two had been in a relationship for a good long while. Williams and the rest of Batwoman's creative team were so disgusted that they straight up <em>quit</em>, sending the comic into chaos as DC scrambled for a new creative team.
</li></ul></li><li> Following the event story <em>Wrath of the First Lantern</em>, Joshua Hale Fialkov was pinged to write both the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern Corps</a></em> and <em>Red Lanterns</em> books, but would later leave the books due to "editorial not letting him tell the stories he wanted". It's still unclear if that included a rumor that Fialkov would've been mandated to kill off John Stewart (a major GL player and one of DC's most famous black characters; and that Fialkov resigned in protest of this), but currently the hero is safe, as the main Lantern in GLC under main <em>Green Lantern</em> writer Robert Venditti &amp; Van Jensen. <em>Red Lanterns</em> (with Guy Gardner) eventually was assigned to Charles Soule.
<ul><li> As a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentGag">nod</a> to the massive controversy surrounding the leaked news of Stewart's supposedly-planned death, Venditti and Jensen's first issue opened with John triumphantly screaming "Sorry, I'm not dying today!" while taking down a group of bloodthirsty Durlans.
</li><li> Similarly, the next writer of <em>Action Comics</em> following Grant Morrison's run, Andy Diggle, was given a large amount of publicity and buildup, but wound up leaving the book after only a few issues were written and leaving Scott Lobdell as the writer of both <em>Action</em> and sister title <em>Superman</em>. Both incidents have reignited scrutiny at DC for their editorial policies, especially after it was reported that the company would relax their numerous mandates at a major convention held in Memphis just a few weeks earlier to the announcements.
</li><li> On a similar note, J.H. Williams III decided to quit <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batwoman">Batwoman</a></em> after DC refused to allow Kate Kane to get married to Maggie Sawyer. This helped expose DC's mandate that everyone in the Bat Family be miserable, as DC was forced to talk about the mandate in order to reassure enraged gay and lesbian fans that their meddling wasn't due to homophobia.
</li></ul></li><li> Tyroc, of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a></em>, was added by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> from editor Murray Boltinoff. The writers had been wanting to do a black character for years, but Boltinoff blocked any attempt to even show black people in <em>crowd shots.</em> Tyroc was introduced to explain this, claiming that all the black people in the DCU at the time were racial separatists living on an island that disappeared regularly. Mike Grell hated Tyroc's entire concept and deliberately gave him the dumbest design and power he could imagine (he can warp reality by screaming) before writing him out. Several artists have also stated that Tyroc's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout">scream-based</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">reality-bending</a> powers with effects that were tied to specific screams were difficult to properly visualize, so they avoided drawing him whenever they could get away with it.
</li><li> According to Louise Simonson, in the early 90s DC's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superman">Superman</a> writers wanted to have Superman marry Lois Lane, which publisher Jeanette Khan vetoed because they weren't married in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoisAndClark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoisAndClark">Lois &amp; Clark</a></em>. And then...
<div class="indent"> We were a little disgruntled, and then as she closed the door, Jerry Ordway said what he always says, which was "Let's just kill him."

</li><li> During the short-lived 2006 run of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheThing">The Thing</a></em>, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanSlott" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanSlott">Dan Slott</a> wanted to have the Thing propose to Alicia Masters.

And they got away with some nasty stuff: for instance, the original subtitle was 'All Hell Breaks Loose', changed to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">hidden penis joke</a>.

This joke resulted in eggs on their faces when Jeffrey Katzenberg received the memo and thought Schneider was being serious, which led to Katzenberg ripping into Schneider, who then ripped into the animators. And then a stray copy wound up in the hands of the L.A.

He later regretted this, later admitting that movie ended up being <em>too</em> dark and serious to fit in alongside the series' usual loopy comedy.
<ul><li> Zig-zagged in that the executives in charge when the film went into production were absolutely fine with the tonal shift, and even pushed a good deal of its commercial advertising to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">[adult swim]</a> and other adult-oriented channels/blocks to support it.

One of these is that regardless of how many books they write, they may not have their own continuing characters. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianeDuane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianeDuane">Diane Duane</a>, among other authors, carefully ignored this rule when writing her series of <em>Trek</em> novels and created her own supporting cast among the crew of the <em>Enterprise</em>, including Ensign Naraht (the first Horta in Starfleet) and K&#146;t&#146;lk/K&#146;s&#146;t&#146;lk, an alien physicist resembling a glass spider.

</li><li> Note that most of the revolt against the publishers was focused against one man in particular - Richard Arnold, who vetted all novel proposals for the studio and demanded a strict lack of inter-novel continuity. Once he was let go, the restrictions went with him.
</li></ul></li><li> Due to the often draconian rules placed on the writers of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft">Ravenloft</a> novels, and after getting asked for one revision one too many times, P.N Elrod wrote in a character named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SdrawkcabName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SdrawkcabName">Tew Yssup</a> (Wet Pussy) in <em>I, Strahd: The War Against Azalin</em>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a> was once asked to write a story as a ghostwriter for Zealia Bishop. He got an outline of what Zealia wanted. "There is an Indian mound near here, which is haunted by a headless ghost. Sometimes it is a woman". Lovecraft hated it because it sounded like a generic ghost story, but the outline was vague enough that he could apply a lot of license to it. What he ended up writing was <em>The Mound</em>, a story about an explorer discovering and living with an ancient race of subterranean immortals who worship Cthulhu.
</li><li> Both played straight and averted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LFrankBaum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LFrankBaum">L. Frank Baum</a>, creator of the Wizard of Oz-verse, intended to end it after 1, 3, or 4-5 books, depending on which account you trust (Baum stated various numbers). He tried several times to end it and had to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">Retcon</a> several times to write new books. Every time he tried to end the series or plant none-too-subtle hints in his books that he <em>would like to stop now, please,</em> he was swayed by the countless letters that would pour in from children, begging for just one more book. He continued writing on Oz right up to his death for fear of disappointing the children.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Kings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Kings">Kings</a></em> is a modern retelling of the story of King David. The executives, in hopes of hiding this, made a strict rule that the phrase "King David" never be spoken. In the last episode of season 1, David is referred to by Rev. Samuelson as "David Shepherd, son of Jesse, son of Judah." Not even "King David" could rival that phrase in obviousness.
</li><li> Executives asked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski">J.

In one specific instance, he was asked to write in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts">more sex</a>. He did. One of the characters was revealed to be a total pervert, fascinated by sex between alien races. In one episode a clip is shown of a Pak'Ma'Ra engaged in doggy-style sex with a Drazi, something that is completely impossible, especially in the manner described, due to the actual locations of the reproductive organs presented as though in the same place as humans. They are not. The clip is even plot-relevant: it is used to distract some guards.

In season one, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement">Product Placement</a> is played fairly straight, with Hiro and Ando's trusty Versa practically having more screen time than every other vehicle put together. However, season 2's hapless Rogue got only two or three shots in the premiere before being stolen from Claire Bennet in the second episode and appears later on as the vehicle of choice for smuggling illegal immigrants across the U.S. border. Meanwhile, Claire's father harped on the theft as a way to "compensate" for Claire's irresponsibility.
<ul><li> Indeed, Nissan's omnipresence in the series is snarked on mercilessly in the episode commentaries by writers and actors alike.
<div class="indent"><strong>Sendhil Ramamurthy:</strong> Look, I'm drinking Nissan coffee!

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em> webseries <em>Heroes: Destiny</em> in part served the purpose of promoting the Samsung Instinct. In one episode of the main series, the writers make fun of the product placement. Hiro and Ando are trying to crash a woman's wedding in India. Ando asks how Hiro plans to stop it. Hiro responds, "Instinct." And then says, "Let me get out my phone," and takes a picture of someone, while the phone is in the center of the frame.

The DVD release has all the cuts reinstated but the subliminal, having served its purpose, is gone.
<ul><li> Namely, "<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Grade Is A Cunt</span>".
</li></ul></li><li> In a scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Moonlighting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Moonlighting">Moonlighting</a></em>, David and Maddie were in a car, breaking the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWall">Fourth Wall</a> with a discussion of how they couldn't get together because the drama would go out of the show, it would start to suck, they would lose viewers and be canceled before they knew it. This didn't stop it from happening, though.
</li><li> In the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays">Happy Days</a></em>, the executives didn't want the Fonz wearing a leather jacket since they thought it made him look like a thug. Garry Marshall convinced them to allow him to wear it only when he was riding his motorcycle since it would then be a legitimate piece of safety equipment. Marshall then told the show's writers to never have a scene where Fonzie wasn't on his motorcycle, just having gotten off his motorcycle, or just about to get on his motorcycle.
<ul><li> One episode had a one-off police officer character hold such an idea. Richie and his pals vehemently try to disabuse the man of this notion. When that didn't work, they revealed their trump: they got the entire town to take up the fashion. Cue the entire main cast in leather jackets.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment">Arrested Development</a></em> was frequently pushed around by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Meddling Executives</a>, which the writers usually expressed through dialog with the protagonists' customers.
<ul><li> During the first season, the network demanded a more formulaic episode, in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">Michael would teach a lesson to his son, George Michael</a>. The writers obeyed... but they called the episode "Pier Pressure", included a subplot about Michael's father teaching his children trivial lessons by traumatizing them <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">thanks to a one-armed man and fake blood</span>, made Michael's lesson a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockAesops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockAesops">Stock Aesop</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad">Drugs Are Bad</a>)</span>, which they subverted <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by making his son buy pot for someone who needs it medically</span> and ended the plot with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">people coming to load up the family yacht with boxes, the police coming with sirens blaring, and the one-armed man</span> shouting "And that's why you never teach your son a lesson!".
</li><li> Near the end of shooting of the second season, the network cut the episode order from 22 to 18 episodes. In an amazing coincidence in a later episode, Michael complains a client cut their building order from 22 to 18 houses, stating that would ruin his carefully created building plans.
</li><li> Also, towards the end of the final season, the Bluths' plan for success depended on becoming more likable and relatable, echoing many complaints from the network.
</li><li> One late third season episode crams as many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatingsStunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatingsStunt">standard gimmicks</a> as possible: 3D shots (gratuitous and add nothing to the plot), shocking revelations (not really), special guest stars (who were those guys?) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TonightSomeoneDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TonightSomeoneDies">Tonight, Someone Dies</a> (a random extra chokes on a chicken bone, spoiled 5 minutes in the episode by the narrator.)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars">Veronica Mars</a></em> producer Rob Thomas threatened to kill off Sheriff Lamb if his fans didn't stop asking to make him "nicer" and "shirtless more often." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He went through with it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">Brutally.</a> </span>

They wrote in a party sequence that abruptly ended with an accidental explosion with several casualties. They say execs never meddled again.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a> was asked by Fox to include some actual aliens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em>. His response was to have a seedy carny hawk "alien body parts" on display, which were, of course, fake. There's also the character of Inara, who was included after Fox asked Whedon to include a "space hooker" in the cast. Inara's character was made to be a Companion, basically a high-class, educated woman who acts as a cross between a courtesan and a geisha. Several times throughout the show, Mal refers to her as being a whore, to which she is <em>never</em> happy.
</li><li> The on-going storyline of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AaronSorkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AaronSorkin">Aaron Sorkin</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SportsNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SportsNight">Sports Night</a></em> has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a> teetering on the edge of cancellation, suffering through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> and finally its network up for sale. After several episodes wondering who would buy the network and if they would keep the show on the air, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a mysterious billionaire comes out of the woodwork and buys the network, declaring, "Anyone who can't make money off <em>Sports Night</em> doesn't deserve to be in the business of making money." In an episode that turned out to be the series finale</span>. The series itself won critical acclaim, but struggled in ratings and only lasted two seasons on ABC.
</li><li> In-universe example: On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock">30 Rock</a></em>, Liz and her writers were told to add <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement">Product Placement</a> to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within The Show</a>. They responded by writing a self-referential sketch about product placement. <em>30 Rock</em> itself <em>seemed</em> to have an extremely blatant product placement for the McDonald's McFlurry, but the writers claim they just really like the product.
<ul><li> The second episode features a literal example: the writers pelt Liz with things for some reason or other.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewsRadio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewsRadio">NewsRadio</a></em> was the king of this. The writers were told to add a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a> plot, so they did. The answer was "yes", in episode <em>two</em>. Later they were told to add a funeral plot as part of a "Three Weddings And A Funeral" cross-series gimmick, so they did an entire episode about the death of a beloved office rat.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidSimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidSimon">David Simon</a> got fed up with people demanding the Marlo Stanfield on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em> be thrown in jail, so the series ends with him being arrested, then let go due to the police's illegal wiretap forming a key part of their evidence. However, he did throw the fans a bone: even though Marlo ends up a free man, he's stuck in his own personal Hell, completely forgotten by the city's other drug dealers and forbidden from any further drug activity himself, and it's implied he'll go out every night picking fights with street toughs until one of them kills him.
</li><li> Whenever <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a> brass have tried to change the format of the popular current affairs show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Newsnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Newsnight">Newsnight</a></em>, its fearsome presenter Jeremy Paxman (who enjoyed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateJobSecurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateJobSecurity">Ultimate Job Security</a> due to his popularity and name-power) would always have one of these. The most famous example was when their editor tried to replace financial news with a weather report ("it's April, what do you expect" was Paxman's "effort" as a weatherman) which Paxman sunk by being sarcastic and condescending when forced to read it, but perhaps the best example was when they tried to set up "Oh My Newsnight" when viewers could submit their own video and get on the show. Paxman was not amused:

The actor playing Greenzo then went crazy, thinking he actually was Greenzo, and began pushing for much less business-friendly actions.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyNameIsEarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyNameIsEarl">My Name Is Earl</a></em>, Earl's prison warden forced him to shoehorn a green message into their scared straight program, although it's out of place and would heavily derail the message of their skit.

There was absolutely no environmental message and hunting wasn't really even portrayed negatively; the closest to a message was the importance of gun safety. The network responded by using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTrustATrailer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTrustATrailer">misleading advertising</a> to portray the episode being in line with "green week" (basically the ads all showed scenes of the characters in the woods without explaining what they were doing).
</li><li> The first time <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em> ever ran into this policy, the relevant episode <em>was</em> titled "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/CommunityS1E10EnvironmentalScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/CommunityS1E10EnvironmentalScience">Environmental Science</a>," but the main plot thereof involved Jeff trying to fix Chang's love life, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeaser">The Teaser</a> contains all the episode's ostensibly pro-environmental material: Dean Pelton attempts to change the school's name from "Greendale" to "<strong>Enviro</strong>dale" and prints 5,000 flyers promoting the new name. When someone points out to him that the original name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">already contained the word "green"</a>, he changes the name back and prints <strong>another</strong> 5,000 flyers with the old name. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint">"I'm trying to save the planet!"</a>

Much hay had been made about the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourLesbians">the 24th century didn't seem to have openly gay people</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WhoopiGoldberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WhoopiGoldberg">Whoopi Goldberg</a> protested the fact that one episode had her explain the concept of love to a new lifeform by saying, "When a man and a woman are in love..." She managed to get it changed to "two people"; as it was part of a holographic presentation. <em>Neither</em> line appears in the final episode, according to transcripts.
<ul><li> This trope led to the creation of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Ascended Extra</a>. In the episode "Unnatural Selection", there was supposed to have been a character named Rina, whose unnatural beauty would cause a few comedic pratfalls. She would ultimately be the one to solve the problem of the day with La Forge, having Picard praise her for her ingenuity. Showrunner Maurice Hurley apparently was not fond of such a blatant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Creator's Pet</a> and rewrote the script to completely erase her. In her place for solving the problem of the day was Colm Meaney's character, who was just referred to as "Transporter Chief" at the time, and was given the surname "O'Brien". Thus began the long history of one of Starfleet's most normal (and ambiguously ranked) members.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheState" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheState">The State</a></em>:
<ul><li> A minor case occurred when MTV executives tried to make them change a reference to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan">Bob Dylan</a> in a sketch because no one in the audience would know who he was. Thus, as an in-joke, the name "Bob Dylan" kept getting slipped into dialogue, though usually not in reference to the singer.
</li><li> Executives demanded a character with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">Catch Phrase</a>, so the troupe created <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">"Louie, the guy who comes in and says his catchphrase over and over again."</a> However, the character ended up making several appearances because the cast <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">liked him.</a></em>
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds">Criminal Minds</a></em> episode when JJ is promoted, listen very closely to the dialogue. AJ Cook was let go from the show for purely financial reasons, a decision that the cast and crew obviously reviled, and the subplot is about how her promotion is being forced by "people above their pay grade" (the network). She really lays into them in her closing monologue in place of the usual ending quote.
<ul><li> Considering how the writers, the cast and the <em>entire</em> fanbase <strong>hated</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">what the network executives did</a>, there is a general consensus that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> against them was entirely justified <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2o95o');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2o95o" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2o95o');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">and cathartic</span> (and one of the few times when a Writer Revolt has been fully supported by more than just fanbase splinter groups).
</li><li> Fortunately there is a happy ending to all this as AJ Cook became a series regular again at the start of season seven. The main reason she was let go was so the execs would have money to do that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMindsSuspectBehavior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMindsSuspectBehavior">spin-off</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">but it got cancelled after only 13 episodes due to huge ratings drops out of the parent series, which led into it</a>. So with their funds now freed up, CBS soon rehired Cook, perhaps knowing that there would be a good chance of a sharp drop in ratings if they didn't bring her back.
</li></ul></li><li> As part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> that affected the 1970-71 TV series <em>The Young Lawyers</em>, the more hot-button and racially-mixed elements were toned down. One particular change is best explained by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarlanEllison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarlanEllison">Harlan Ellison</a> (who wrote an episode of the series, and wasn't pleased with the finished result):

</div></li><li> In a weird example of an in-fiction type being applied to a real episode, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen">Mad Men</a></em> has an episode with a B-plot centering around 1960s lawyer show <em>The Defenders</em> and their controversial episode about abortion. Harry Crane's friend at CBS explains the writers wanted to get it made, but the executives balked at the subject matter. So they instead do a trash script about cannibalism, the network rejects it on its face, there's not enough time to write a new script, but they do have this one waiting in the wings...

When Drew asked the audience to suggest a sitcom title, someone said "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCosby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCosby">Bill Cosby</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Hitler</a>." The director stepped in and forced them to change it. The cast spends the rest of the episode throwing in as many references to Hitler as possible. This tends to happen any time the director stops or says they cannot perform a theme due to censorship or controversy reasons; the cast usually spends the rest of the episode making fun of the director in subtle ways and throwing in light references to the censored activity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SCTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SCTV">SCTV</a></em>'s "Great White North" sketches were added to comply with a Canadian government directive that all CBC shows include at least some "Canadian" content. Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas complied... by creating two likeably dumb talk show hosts who were stereotypical Canadians. It became the most successful element of the show, sparking a hit single and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StrangeBrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StrangeBrew">a moderately successful movie</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em> has an in-universe example, where the titular character (a mystery novelist) begins the series having violently killed off his long-running character. It is hinted that, along with boredom, he did so to annoy his ex-wife and publisher, and had been growing tired of Storm for some time by that point already. Immediately lampshaded by several characters, and an ongoing joke <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceDoneNeverForgotten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceDoneNeverForgotten">six seasons later.</a></em>

In the final episodes of the show, Peele ended up the butt of a particularly cruel plot twist directed straight at his manly sexiness, in which what appeared to be him achieving a cliche <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexFaceTurn">Sex&#150;Face Turn</a> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Lucas</a>'s girlfriend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp">Selena</a> turned out to be the set-up for Selena trying to kill Lucas for entirely selfish reasons and framing Billy for it.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a>'s record label once insisted that he include a parody of the then-hot new single, "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" for his <em>Dare To Be Stupid</em> album. Al himself didn't want to and responded to the pressure by intentionally making "Girls Just Wanna Have Lunch" as lame as possible. (Weird Al fans widely consider it his worst song by a wide margin.)
<ul><li> In the same album, they wanted him to do a straight cover of a song (as in, not a parody). So he covered the theme to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GeorgeOfTheJungle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GeorgeOfTheJungle">George of the Jungle</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiChristmasSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiChristmasSong">"Christmas at Ground Zero"</a> was born because the executives wanted Weird Al to write and record a Christmas song, despite the fact he doesn't celebrate it. The subject matter proved so radioactive that it was actually banned from the radio.
</li></ul></li><li> Kevin DuBrow, lead singer of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/QuietRiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/QuietRiot">Quiet Riot</a>, was less than thrilled about doing a cover of "Cum on Feel the Noize" (originally released by Slade), so he decided to make his singing voice as grating as possible. He stated that he, as well as the rest of the band, failed to make it bad, nailing it instead. The song became a hit and the album was the first #1 metal album (only to be displaced by MJ's <em>Thriller</em>).
</li><li> Just prior to their live performance of "Light My Fire" on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheEdSullivanShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheEdSullivanShow">The Ed Sullivan Show</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDoors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDoors">The Doors</a> were told to change the line "Girl, we couldn't get much higher" due to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItWasntMadeOnDrugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItWasntMadeOnDrugs">alleged drug reference</a>. The band agreed, and performed it accordingly in rehearsal, only for Jim Morrison to sing the original line live on the air. And Morrison reportedly blew off the network executives who tried to take him to task for it after the show. The version of the story that says Morrison did this deliberately to spite the executives was popularized by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OliverStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OliverStone">Oliver Stone</a> film: other accounts of the story hold that Morrison was simply very nervous going onstage, and forgot to change the line. The actual video footage seems to suggest this as well since Morrison wasn't even facing the camera when he sang the line as he was in the movie. Pretty much all accounts do agree that Morrison's response to being told The Doors would never play Ed Sullivan again was "Who cares... we already played Sullivan!"
</li><li> Another live version gone awry for this: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV">MTV</a> forbade <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana">Nirvana</a> from playing the song they wanted at the VMA, "Rape Me". The result? <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdNP9QPSqFc">They played the opening of "Rape Me" before moving onto "Lithium".<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Awkward Hilarity Ensued</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica">Metallica</a> was asked by the EMA to avoid swearing. Thus instead of playing "King Nothing", they went for <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kggWc9dFs9E">two covers<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMisfits">"Last Caress"</a> (rape and child-killing) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BawdySong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BawdySong">"So What?"</a> (for starters, a full-on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb">Cluster F-Bomb</a>).
</li><li> British singer Lulu's late 1960s show is best remembered for another instance of this. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimiHendrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimiHendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a> Experience got two minutes into "Hey Joe" before Jimi stopped "this rubbish" and announced they were dedicating the song they really wanted to do&#151;a cover of "Sunshine of Your Love"&#151;to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cream">Cream</a>, who had just broken up. Hendrix was told he would never be on the BBC again after he finished the song, which suited him just fine as he'd felt "ridiculous" going on the show to begin with.
</li><li> That story inspired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisCostello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisCostello">Elvis Costello</a> and the Attractions when they were the musical guest on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em> in 1977, a replacement for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SexPistols" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SexPistols">Sex Pistols</a>, who had trouble getting visas because of their criminal records, whereas Costello and his band were already in North America touring. Costello had wanted to do "Radio Radio" on the show, but Columbia wanted him to perform "Less than Zero", as it was already known as one of his songs and would help him and the band sell records. They decided to "pull a Hendrix on the Lulu show" and stopped "Less than Zero" after <em>two bars</em>, told the audience there was no reason for them to play it, and then went into "Radio Radio". In the booth the directors panicked, fearing the song would have foul language they couldn't stop. The show has been much nicer about this than the BBC was to Hendrix&#151;he's been on since then, they did a sketch mocking it, and then Costello himself interrupted the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BeastieBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BeastieBoys">Beastie Boys</a> on the 25th anniversary special so they could all do the song together.
</li><li> Sara Bareilles was apparently told to make her love songs more commercial. So she wrote "Bottle It Up", essentially about how pissed off she is about being told what to write.
<div class="indent">There'll be girls across the nation who'll eat this up <br>Babe, I know it's your soul, but could you bottle it up...?
</div><ul><li> This is more or less the story of her career. Her first hit single, "Love Song," was a giant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> at meddling executives trying to tell her what to write.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChelyWright" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChelyWright">Chely Wright</a>'s record company apparently disliked the gloominess of one of her recent albums, and requested that she write "something positive and hopeful". And <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJZHDBS6lS0">so she did.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>

</li><li> After the success of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDarkSideOfTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDarkSideOfTheMoon">The Dark Side of the Moon</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd">Pink Floyd</a> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">pressured by their record company into coming up with a follow-up album</a>. Roger Waters responded by cramming their next album, <em>Wish You Were Here</em>, with songs that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">ridiculed the record industry</a>.
<div class="indent">We're just knocked out <br>We heard about the sell-out <br>You've got to get an album out; <br>you owe it to the people. <br>We're so happy we can hardly count!
</div><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SydBarrett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SydBarrett">Syd Barrett</a>, Floyd's original songwriter, did this at least three times during his tenure in the band. The first was when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> forced him to censor the drug references in their song "Let's Roll Another One" (renamed as a result to "Candy and a Currant Bun"). He responded by inserting the line "Please, just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">fuck</a> with me". The executives comically failed to notice. The second was Barrett's response to getting kicked out of the band due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">growing mental instability</a>; he wrote the song "Jugband Blues", which addresses his feelings of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtistDisillusionment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtistDisillusionment">Artist Disillusionment</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EtTuBrute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EtTuBrute">Et Tu, Brute?</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a>. It is the last song on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ASaucerfulOfSecrets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ASaucerfulOfSecrets">A Saucerful of Secrets</a></em>, the last album Barrett recorded with the band. The final was Barrett's deliberately unlearnable song "Have You Got It Yet?", which Barrett kept changing every time he "taught" it to the rest of the band. Waters' realisation that Barrett was deliberately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator">trolling the rest of the band</a> is noted as the last time he and Barrett played together, although Waters also later called it "an act of mad genius". Neither Barrett nor Floyd ever recorded the song.

<div class="indent">Album just dropped and I've been on the cover covers <br>Black and white tux, ain't no need for no other colors <br>T-t-t-talking 'bout "W-w-why don't she change her clothes?" <br>Well they ain't seem to mind the last three times I posed in Vogue...

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SexPistols" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SexPistols">Sex Pistols</a>' manager Malcolm McLaren wanted them to write a song called "Submission", obviously expecting an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObligatoryBondageSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObligatoryBondageSong">Obligatory Bondage Song</a>... They mocked the idea by making it a song about a submarine ("I'm on a submarine mission for you, baby"). Although it still had an awful lot of double-entendre lines about "going down"...

Despite the song becoming popular among fans, they never performed it again.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MikeOldfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MikeOldfield">Mike Oldfield</a> was, before switching record labels, constantly hounded by Virgin Media to produce a sequel to the hit album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TubularBells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TubularBells">Tubular Bells</a></em>. His response was <em>Amarok</em>, an hour-long mostly instrumental series of ever-changing themes, not one bit of which could effectively be aired as a single. To top it off, 42 minutes in, there is a message in Morse code that reads 'FUCK OFF RB' (Richard Branston being the head of Virgin at the time). Immediately after switching to Warner, he proceeded to produce and release <em>Tubular Bells 2</em>.
</li><li> At the start of the 20th century, Richard Strauss had severely pissed off various publishing houses by his successful campaigns to improve the position of composers with respect to publishing and performing rights. Being under contract to deliver a set of his famous <em>Lieder</em> to the Berlin publisher Bote &amp; Bock, he wrote the <em>Kr&auml;merspiegel</em> op. 66 - acid and outright libellous satires against various companies under paper-thin aliases, full of puns and self-quotations. He was promptly sued for breach of contract and instead wrote the <em>Lieder</em> op. 67 - which were the most recondite, technically challenging and innovative he had ever done, and so deliberately hard to sell. No publisher deigned to produce the original set until forty years later.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel">Billy Joel</a>'s hit "Piano Man" was edited down by his record company from 5:38 to 3:05 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">for commercial reasons</a> for the single, which infuriated Billy. He wrote "The Entertainer" on his next album <em>Streetlife Serenade</em> in protest.
<div class="indent">It was a beautiful song, <br>But it ran too long, <br>If you wanna make a hit, <br>You just gotta make it fit, <br>So they cut it down to 3:05.

</li><li> Depending on who you ask, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Journey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Journey">Journey</a> did this with the infamous "Separate Ways" music video. Steve Perry was on record as <em>hating</em> the whole idea of music videos, dismissing bands popularized by them as "fashion music," and sticking to performance videos when asked to provide them for airplay.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TalkingHeads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TalkingHeads">David Byrne's</a> 1992 album <em>Uh Oh</em> was one of the last compact discs to be packaged in a "longbox", a cardboard sleeve much taller than the disc itself - the format was initially conceived so that music stores could file CDs and records in the same bins, and was also considered a theft deterrent, but was eventually phased out as it was considered needlessly expensive to produce and environmentally wasteful. While some artists refused to let their albums be packaged this way altogether, Byrne just had the following sticker affixed to the longbox of his album:
<div class="indent"><strong>THIS IS GARBAGE.</strong> <br>(This box, that is). The American record business insists on it though. If you agree that it's wasteful, let your store management know how you feel.
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan">Bob Dylan</a> claims that <em>Self Portrait</em> and <em>Nashville Skylines</em>, his early 1970s records that veer drastically from his 1960s "rebel-poet voice of the youth" image (the former being an album mostly of cheesy covers, the latter being smooth country and western), were one of these. Apparently, he'd gotten long fed up with everything demanding that he be the rebellious voice of an entire generation (and all the hangers-on and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan">Yes-Man</a> that it came with) and just decided to mess with everyone instead.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FallOutBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FallOutBoy">Fall Out Boy</a> has a history of having incredibly long song titles on their albums. When their record label asked them to write songs with shorter titles, they instead refused &amp; simply disemvowelled the title of one, producing "Thnks fr th Mmrs" from this experiment.
</li><li> Once Pete Townshend discovered his managers hid over a million dollars of his royalties in a bank account he never knew, the next <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho">The Who</a> album was filled with complaints ("Music Must Change", "New Song", "No Road Romance", "Sister Disco").

In addition, they refused to release Trent from his contract when he tried to leave the label. This resulted in the secretly-recorded EP <em>Broken</em>, which had Trent comparing his experience with them to slavery and telling TVT founder Steve Gottlieb to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">eat his heart out</a> at the beginning of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenTrack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenTrack">Physical</a>". Even the liner notes contain sentences like "no thanks: you know who you fucking are" and "the slave thinks he has been released from bondage only to find a stronger set of chains". Years later, <em>Machine</em>'s 2010 remastered release say "fuck you" to TVT - which has been defunct since 2008.

</li><li> Tom Batiuk, artist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FunkyWinkerbean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FunkyWinkerbean">Funky Winkerbean</a></em>, killed off John Darling, star of the spin-off strip of the same name (in the penultimate strip, to boot), because he wanted to end the strip, didn't want to re-integrate him into FW, and didn't want his syndicate to use the character elsewhere, without his input.
</li><li> Bill Watterson, creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes">Calvin and Hobbes</a></em>, frequently had rows with his editor about the subject of merchandising. Several strips had paraphrases of the editor's arguments as punchlines, such as Calvin's dad telling him he sees everything in black and white or has no perspective, leading to the boy imagining a literal case of the ailments. He got his point across.
</li><li> Manfred Schmidt, author of German comic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/NickKnatterton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/NickKnatterton">Nick Knatterton</a></em>, always held the opinion that comics were a lower art form. After about nine years of drawing the strip, he was so fed up with it, he couldn't make his fingers draw the pictures anymore &mdash; or so he said.

<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW">ECW</a>'s waning days, the promotion's rocky relationship with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SpikeTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SpikeTV">TNN</a> pushed them into full-on revolt as part of a desperate bid to get their show cancelled so they could shop it to other networks before the promotion completely ran out of money. The most obvious facet of the revolt was Cyrus, an executive from "the network", who was out to take away everything that made ECW special and make it into good, wholesome, family-friendly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW-style</a> sports entertainment. Many of Cyrus's appearances came laced with digs at TNN's other programs, such as <em>Rock 'n Bowl</em>. Sadly, this gambit didn't work, as TNN kept the show on long past the point of no return.

<ul><li> In prior editions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>, many players, when confronted with the unbelievable racism, psychosis, corruption, fascism, and hopelessness of the Imperium, tended to latch onto the Eldar as "good guys" despite the setting being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil">Evil vs. Evil</a>. The developers took steps to undermine this, and indeed explicitly stated in one of their releases that they were attempting to correct what they saw as a misconception. The same has happened to the Tau over time, although to a lesser extent. It's especially ironic because the Tau were conceived as a fundamentally decent race by their developers &mdash; in their own words, "a likable, if a bit naive, addition to the universe."
<ul><li> After the first codex, another developer said that people who thought Tau were good were missing the underlying message of their actions: join us, or be blown out of the sky (though, to be fair, most of the other factions don't even offer the "Join Us" option). The second codex had such decencies as suicide bombers, combat drugs, mentions of orbital bombardment on races that didn't accept the Greater Good, and subtle hints about how the Vespid are effectively enslaved by the Tau interface helmets.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation">Or maybe they aren't</a>. That's the thing about the Tau: everyone else's evil is all-too-obvious and apparent, but <strong>none</strong> of the Tau's is. One such evil is the "Join Us" option, which is basically slavery.
</li><li> It isn't helped that most of the examples of Tau crimes are given by the Imperium where they aren't exactly honest about what their enemies are like.
</li><li> Of course after all this, 5th edition became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a>, because fans started seeing all the GRIMDARK as one big joke.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Early in its history, the design team of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> was asked by Games Workshop owner Bryan Ansell to make up a unique species "to be as distinctive of Warhammer as the Broo are of Runequest", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MascotMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MascotMook">a race that could be used in marketing</a>. The design team created the Fimir, a bunch of hideous, swamp-dwelling, reptilian, cyclopean monsters that reproduced by raping abducted young women, a deliberate hodgepodge of the most despicable and lamest traits possible. They largely disappeared when the next edition (4th) was released, relegated to brief allusions in the fluff.
<ul><li> There's also the story behind the infamously hideous miniature that <a class="urllink" href="http://chestofcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/worst-miniatures-ever-made-01.jpg">Nagash<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> ended up stuck with for around two decades before they finally replaced it with something relatively fitting for the guy who invented Necromancy and has been a threat to the entire setting for millennia. The sculptor wanted to have more of a desiccated corpse look, while a skeletal look was being demanded from above. In an attempt to force them to accept a resculpt with a non-skeletal face, he made Nagash's skull as stupid-looking as he could. Unfortunately, they decided to go with that sculpt instead of demand he redo it.
</li></ul></li><li> While creating the Mirage set for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>, the designers were ordered not to name anybody after an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignificantAnagram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignificantAnagram">anagram</a>, because the editors didn't like it. Their response was to name a main character Mangara. They also created Telim'tor, which is an anagram of Mr. Toilet.
</li><li> For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> 3rd Edition, they created "iconic" characters for each class to be part of the art for the books. One of them, Regdar the fighter, was born from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, forced to be a generic human white male fighter (they'd already come up with a male dwarf fighter as the iconic character for that class). The artists had their revenge by making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">something horrible happen to him in almost every single picture Regdar appeared in.</a> The tradition even continued into the 4th Edition corebooks (and to a lesser extent, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a>'s</em> Valeros).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Spelljammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Spelljammer">Spelljammer</a></em> exists because the development team was told "Make a space D&amp;D game because science fiction is popular." They decided to make it cool instead of just a cash grab. The fact that it only got one edition was because this upset the CEO at the time.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenrikIbsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenrikIbsen">Henrik Ibsen</a> was forced to write an alternate ending for the German release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ADollsHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ADollsHouse">A Doll's House</a></em> because the climax &mdash; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeavingYouToFindMyself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeavingYouToFindMyself">a woman running away from her husband and leaving their children behind</a> &mdash; was seen as too shocking for Victorian society. Ibsen detested having to do it and wrote an ending where, as she leaves her husband, she sees her two children in the hallway and collapses in anguish, as she can't bring herself to leave them behind but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">understands perfectly how horrible her life will be if she stays</a>.

<ul><li> A bit more subtle: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/DisneyThemeParks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/DisneyThemeParks">Walt Disney World</a> has recently appeared to be using a policy that fans have described best as, "Oh, the older ride is not as popular as the new rides? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">Tear it down and build something new!</a>" Evidently, many Imagineers are as upset about this as the fans are, and you can often spot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout Outs</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.yesterland.com/nods.html">to the rides' original iterations hidden in the newer rides<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. To wit:
<ul><li> There is a painting of Mr. Toad passing the deed to his property to Owl in <em>The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh</em>, which replaced <em>Mr. Toad's Wild Ride</em>. You can also spot a memorial for the older ride in the pet cemetery outside the exit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheHauntedMansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheHauntedMansion">The Haunted Mansion</a>.
</li><li> The logo on the Gravity Wheel and cash registers in <em>MISSION: Space</em> is that of the ride it replaced: <em>Horizons</em>. There are also several references to the much older "Mission to Mars" ride and even a connection to the movie it inspired in 2000 (via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GarySinise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GarySinise">Gary Sinise</a> as the host of the preshow video). Several <em>Horizons</em> references would be inserted into Space Mountain's post-show when that ride was renovated in 2009.
</li><li> By far, no ride suffered more than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/JourneyIntoImagination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/JourneyIntoImagination">Journey into Imagination</a></em> at Epcot &mdash; when it was revamped at the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, it was penny-pinched and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasRushed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasRushed">Christmas Rushed</a> (to coincide with a park anniversary and the forthcoming Millennium Celebration), and went over so poorly that Imagineers were allowed another crack at it. Version 3 thus promoted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a> Figment to protagonist, included the original theme song (with some new verses), and brought in as many remnants of and references to the original version as possible. Pay attention to the show Figment is watching in his upside-down house, the various forms he takes in the finale, and the office belonging to a fellow named Dean Finder. As well, the plot of this version &mdash; a series of tests in sensory labs to "capture" the imagination getting playfully sabotaged by Figment &mdash; is effectively the 2.0 version being invaded by 1.0, a situation portrayed as a wonderful thing.
</li><li> The "Under New Management!" refurbishment of Disney World's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/TheEnchantedTikiRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/TheEnchantedTikiRoom">The Enchanted Tiki Room</a></em> that opened in 1998 seemed to have been written by people who really weren't all that enthusiastic about updating the show. It featured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin">Iago</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing1994" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing1994">Zazu</a> buying out the Tiki Room (seriously); after watching a few seconds of the old show, Iago comes down and angrily decries the tiki birds for being "boring" and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">demands changes to the show</a> in order to make it more "hip", much to the ire of Zazu who thinks the show is fine and warns Iago against messing with it. Eventually the tiki gods themselves get tired of Iago and banish him, putting on a show their own way. "Under New Management!" was closed in 2011 after the Iago animatronic fittingly caught fire during a refurbishment, and the show was returned to its pre-1998 state later that year.

Not everyone liked the change of guard. Therefore, the queue movie has one sequence showing Doc Brown trying but failing to save his facilities &mdash; thanks to Professor Frink travelling back in time to <em>help</em> but instead doing exactly the opposite &mdash; and eventually selling the property's deed to Krusty, who hires him on for the Krustyland theme park once he gets a haircut. Later, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/Jaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/Jaws">Jaws</a></em> ride was demoted to expand <em>The Wizarding World of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>.

Miyamoto, who was strongly opposed to the idea, instead went for a cutesy, crayon-drawn look in an act of rebellion against his executives, which made them see the error of their ways, and the game was eventually developed and released as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisIsland">Yoshi's Island</a></em>. The game still used pre-rendered models in the introduction and ending, though, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioRPG">pre-rendered Mario game</a> that Miyamoto wasn't directly involved with was eventually released.

Ironically, Wario became rather popular and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter">got his own spin-off games</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX">Mega Man X</a></em> series. In the early stages of the series' development, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom">Capcom</a> thought that the new Mega Man's design was a complete overhaul from the original. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeijiInafune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeijiInafune">Keiji Inafune</a>, the "father" of the series, was forced to make a second X with a design that would be more familiar to fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic">Mega Man</a></em>. Inafune didn't discard the original design, however, and made him into a supporting character instead. What happens next? Inafune made it so that <em>his</em> X would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">figure more into the storyline</a> than the second X. Moreover, in an irony of what Capcom envisioned, he also became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">more popular with the fanbase than the "second" X himself!</a> Any fan should know this story by now (that first X became Zero, for people who haven't caught on yet.)

Or Otacon commenting about how the next-gen version of Shadow Moses is indication that it's "not so bad getting old" (i.e. the old games should just be allowed to be what they are). And telling Snake at the end that he will always remember "what you were" (i.e. what you were back before Kojima was forced to throw in his artistic integrity). It's kind of a depressing game. Also, originally, Kojima wanted to end the game with Snake and Otacon turning in to authorities only to be executed for being terrorists.

(It should be observed that the Japanese loan word "cunning"/<em>kanningu</em> has a much harsher connotation than in English, meaning "cheater".) An early story mission explains that since the higher-ups disappeared, the unit has been at a total loose end, apart from a single engineer who is doing his best to hold everything together but is powerless to do so - a situation so specific that it is easy to speculate it is a developer cry for help.

Later translations of the interview that claimed that revealed that he was just upset Banpresto never paid the licensing fee for it. Either way, it'll be a while before we ever try to see that series in any installments since he's refusing to let it be used because of that snafu while he's still living.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em> was ported to PlayStation, Sony's policy to add achievements to every game forced Toby to comply - even though he actively disliked the idea, given the nature of the game. Therefore, he deliberately made mocking achievements, awarded for stuff like: anticlimatic actions (picking up 1, 2, 3, and 4 items); reaching specific areas (that you have to go through anyway); or donating various amounts of money to a newly added Dog Shrine (which is completely useless and extremely tedious). The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Nintendo Switch</a> port <em>obliterates</em> the Dog Shrine but otherwise adds actual new content with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Mad Mew Mew</a>.

The game begins with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionPrologue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionPrologue">Delta in the middle of a helicopter chase</a>, before flashing back two days earlier. Writer Walt Williams was <em>very</em> opposed to starting with an action-packed setpiece, feeling it spoke down to players and implied that they wouldn't be interested without explosions. At first, he thought the game started more slowly and only learned of the change in script while recording voice lines. Out of spite, he promptly wrote in Walker's line, "<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Wait, this isn't right! We've done this already!</span>" when the game catches up with the chase to imply that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Delta died in the helicopter crash and the game is Walker reliving events in either purgatory or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingDream">Dying Dream</a></span>.

Since the game was out while the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a></em> series was taking off, the creators of <em>Spooky's</em> were constantly asked to add a monster based on the <em>Five Nights</em> franchise.

By and large, <em>2</em> is pretty quiet about this... except for one side-quest where a woman hosting a cooking show on Asgard tries selling some merchandising, only to admit that due to complex copyright laws, they can only tell viewers about it, because it's sold by their rivals.

Doug Walker then moved on to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DemoReel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DemoReel">Demo Reel</a></em>, a project he had been wanting to do for a long time.

Doug eventually brought back the Critic with the last episode of Demo Reel revealing that it was just purgatory for the Critic, retconning a bit of his previous character arc in the process. Since bringing the Critic back, Doug's reviewing style is accused of having become more mean spirited, such as being much quicker to attack actors involved in the films he reviews. He himself has stated in several vlogs and commentaries since the Critic's return that he doesn't care as much about offending fans as he did before.

The result was them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BotheringByTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BotheringByTheBook">Bothering by the Book</a> that they asked to make a show about Batman and <em>not</em>, specifically, Bruce Wayne, creating a show with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">Legacy Character</a> being mentored by Bruce that owed more to things like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan2099" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan2099">Spider-Man 2099</a></em> than any sort of high-school setting, and was much darker by leaps and bounds than the unknowing executives were thinking when they made that suggestion. Ultimately, fans found the premise much easier to swallow (and more interesting) with a new Batman under the cowl, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropesAreTools">and the show remains a fan-favorite</a>.

Don Oriolo, Joe's son and then-owner of Felix the Cat, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">insisted that they at least include certain elements from it like the Magic Bag so that the show would have some kind of tie to his dad's work.</a> By the time the second season started production, Phil Roman and Don Oriolo decided to take the series into a direction more in vogue with the Joe Oriolo Felix cartoons, with much more linear plotting and less surreal humor, as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack">bringing back some of the Oriolo era characters</a> like Poindexter, Master Cylinder and The Professor. This was a move that did <strong>NOT</strong> sit well with the staff&mdash;In response, "Attack of the Robot Rat" had the writers shoot back by making it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">very mean spirited parody of the Joe Oriolo Felix cartoons</a>. "Phoney Felix" can also be seen as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthParody">Stealth Parody</a> of the retool of Season 2, with Felix <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostileShowTakeover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostileShowTakeover">having his show hijacked</a> by an imbecilic imposter who imitates some of the traits of Oriolo Felix, such as saying his "Righty-O!" catchphrase, singing the TV show theme song and using a (shoddy knockoff) of the magic bag of tricks. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TwistedTalesOfFelix2x04TheFuzzyBunnyShowTheMilkyWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TwistedTalesOfFelix2x04TheFuzzyBunnyShowTheMilkyWay">"The Fuzzy Bunny Show"</a> also takes a shot at Don Oriolo himself for the retool, whose in-universe cartoon counterpart (named Donald) replaces Felix's show (which in-universe is already renamed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">"The Not-So-Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat"</a>) with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeDiabetes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeDiabetes">unbearably cloying Fuzzy Bunny show</a> and is congratulated by a network exec for it.
</li><li> The writers at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em> were once required to have the main cast using a helicopter, as they would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">make a toy out of it</a>. It felt quite out of place in a series focusing on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid">Winged Humanoids</a> who can fly, and then they <em>didn't even release the toy</em>. It was pointedly never mentioned a second time in the show. When required to put in a motorcycle, they had it blow up after being used for five minutes.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> done to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinkyAndTheBrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinkyAndTheBrain">Pinky and the Brain</a></em> (such as adding Elmyra to the show) pissed off writer Peter Hastings so much that he left <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a> to create <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OneSaturdayMorning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OneSaturdayMorning">One Saturday Morning</a></em>. Before he did that, though, he made fun of Jamie Kellner's orders in his last script, "You'll Never Eat Food Pellets in This Town Again", in which Brain dreams that he and Pinky are sitcom stars whose popularity is sabotaged when various unfitting changes are made to their show. (As you can guess, Kellner did not take the advice this episode was telling him). Then there's the (in)famous episode "Pinky and The Brain... and Larry", in which writers Gordon Bressack and Charles M. Howell IV responded to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">demands</a> to throw a new character into the mix by creating Larry, who is shoe-horned awkwardly into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositoryThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositoryThemeTune">Expository Theme Tune</a> and adds <em>absolutely nothing</em> to the plot (a trait that the Brain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">identifies</a> as the reason behind their failure in tonight's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a> scheme). Alas, the execs didn't get the hint (see above about the addition of Elmyra).

<ul><li> One episode ended with Iggins, an obnoxious one-shot character, getting crushed in an elevator accident. When that earned an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveVeto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveVeto">Executive Veto</a>, the writers tacked on an additional ending after a "The End" screen where said character burst out from the elevator wreckage and flew towards the camera in a superhero pose with a matching backdrop and "IGGINS!!" displayed underneath. Unlike many examples on this page, this <em>was</em> noticed by the network and did rather anger them.
</li><li> The episode "Mysterious Mysteries" seems to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> to both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a> and possibly the viewers &mdash; the characters go on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a> <em>Mysterious Mysteries</em> and tell <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RashomonStyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RashomonStyle">"Rashomon"-Style</a> story about how Dib got Zim on tape, ending with a completely ridiculous story from GIR involving a giant squirrel who "eats Dib's greasy head" and flies into space to "fight all the bad guys." The host declares all of them crazy, but his producer tells him that it's popular and so he should take the show in that direction. The host, notably, seems to be cracking himself...
</li><li> In the episode "Zim Eats Waffles", Zim is shown experimenting on a boy named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nick</a> who must constantly smile and be happy... not to mention he also has the orange splatter symbol on his shirt.

What do they have to lose? "NOTHING! There is nothing at stake and no threat, beyond the shame of defeat!" Interestingly enough, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">they did raise the stakes</a>: It was the first episode in the series where the universe was in danger of ending (Farnsworth's plan to win the harmless match led to a harmful collapse of time and space).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> executive Eddie Selzer was generally a bore who knew nothing about comedy (he once yelled at the animators for laughing while making storyboards demanding to know what the hell laughter had to do with making cartoons), and would make idiotic decisions like telling Friz Freleng not to make a cartoon starring Tweety and the recently created Sylvester. After Freleng threatened to quit over being told how to make cartoons, Selzer relented with the result being an iconic duo. He also told Bob Mckimson not to make anymore Tasmanian Devil cartoons because he thought the character was too grotesque; he only changed his mind after he found out Taz was popular. He did do some good &mdash; since the directors all hated him, it gave them something to fight against like when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckJones">Chuck Jones</a> made <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BullyForBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BullyForBugs">Bully for Bugs</a></em> because Selzer had told him that bullfighting wasn't funny, and Jones wanted to prove him wrong. The legend is that there wasn't even any logic going on &mdash; Selzer merely barged into the office and burst out, completely at random, that bullfights weren't funny and there were to be no bullfighting shorts to be had at <em>his</em> animation studio. Figuring that if Selzer was against bullfighting, then there had to be something in it, they started thinking about a bullfighting short. The story was that Selzer had actually seen one while on vacation, but he failed to tell HIS animators why he declared bullfighting unfunny.

Of course, some fans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom">didn't get it</a>, and declared their hatred for the episode.

Trey &amp; Matt stated that they would return to their normal uncensored ways by the next episode. Said episode featured a handicapped kid getting raped by a shark. Before that, "201" took a potshot at the Muhammad taboo by including scenes of Buddha snorting cocaine and Jesus looking at pornography, both of which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">went completely uncensored</a>.

But <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hasbro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hasbro">Hasbro</a> wanted Waspinator in the show due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">merchandise</a>, so the writers decided that if Waspinator had to show up, he'd show up <em>in pieces</em>, and had him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries">violently removed from the episode whenever he appeared</a>. The fandom noticed this pattern... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy">and thought it was hilarious</a>. Because of this, the writers wound up <em>increasing</em> Waspinator's screen time rather than <em>decreasing</em> it, and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavedByTheFans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavedByTheFans">convinced Hasbro not to kill him off because the fans were so fond of him</a>.
</li><li> Infamously done with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures">Tiny Toon Adventures</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeShorts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeShorts">Three Shorts</a> episode "Elephant Issues". What was supposed to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">Very Special Episode</a> about television addiction, racism, and the dangers of under-aged drinking ended up as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthParody">Stealth Parody</a>, opening with a monologue by Gogo Dodo unsubtly saying the upcoming show is about to make "a fruitless attempt to win another Emmy". As for the shorts themselves, "Why Dizzy Can't Read" ended with a shot of kids so engroused with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadingIsCoolAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadingIsCoolAesop">reading</a> that they've stopped watching <em>Tiny Toons</em>, "C.L.I.D.E. and Prejudice" revolves around Montana Max bullying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLostUncleAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLostUncleAesop">a new student</a> for being a robot, and "One Beer" had Buster outright breaking the 4th wall and mentioning for the sake of the story, they would be acting out of character, and it ended with the characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedActors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedActors">leaving the studio after they "died"</a>, hoping the audience understood the moral and that their next episode would actually be funny. The episode was created in protest to the higher-ups wanting the showrunners to shoehorn morals into their episodes. The morals of "watch TV responsibly", "treat minorities well", and "alcohol is bad" were poorly implemented on purpose just so the executives would ask them to never try implementing morals in the show again, and <em>it worked</em>.

<ul><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">Nazi Germany</a> occupied <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheChannelIslands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheChannelIslands">The Channel Islands</a> off the British coast. They also printed their own stamps during this time. After the war, the British printer was accused of collaboration, but he defended himself by showing that those stamps bore four little A's in the corners &mdash; standing for "Ad Avernum Atrox Adolf!" (Latin for "Go to hell, atrocious Adolf!")
</li><li> Bishop Hans Brask managed to survive the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_Bloodbath">Stockholm Bloodbath<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> because he could prove that when he signed an unpopular parliament decision, he hid a note in his seal saying "To this, I am forced and compelled." To this day, "brasklapp" ("Brask's note") is the common Swedish word for "hedging your bets."
</li><li> There's been some of this in recent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Usefulnotes/OlympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Usefulnotes/OlympicGames">Olympic Games</a> opening ceremonies:
<ul><li> In 2012, London's ceremony had a segment celebrating the NHS, the country's universal healthcare system, against objections from the conservative government. Director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DannyBoyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DannyBoyle">Danny Boyle</a> says he had to threaten to resign before he was allowed to keep the segment in.
</li><li> In 2014, a year after Russia passed a law banning "homosexual propaganda" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkOfTheChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkOfTheChildren">for the sake of the children!</a>), the Sochi opening ceremony paid tribute to some of history's most famous gay Russians (Tchaikovsky, Nijinsky, Diaghilev) and had a live performance from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tatu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tatu">t.A.T.u.</a>
