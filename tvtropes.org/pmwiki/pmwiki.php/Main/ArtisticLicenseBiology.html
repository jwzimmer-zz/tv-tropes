<ul><li> In an <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMoRw8IKcvk">H2OH commercial<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, the narrator's voice comments how cool it is that nature gave spikes to the hedgehog, instead of you (human). In the video, though, the guy <em>shoots</em> spikes all around. It's said that porcupines can shoot their quills &mdash; porcupines are not hedgehogs, however, and the popular belief is in fact false. Porcupines may have their spines dislodged while swinging their tails around because the spines are very loosely attached to the porcupine so that they'll come out once they've been lodged in another creature's skin; however, they don't deliberately shoot their quills at a target. They're much more likely to reverse into your leg and fill it with hooked barbs.
</li><li> Yellow, the peanut M&amp;M from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/MAndMs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/MAndMs">the candy commercials</a>, messes up when he and Red show off their muscles. Yellow boasts "Check out my adenoids!", but adenoids are tonsils, not muscles. Probably more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus">Genius Bonus</a> since neither of the M&amp;Ms (<strong>especially</strong> Yellow) have ever been portrayed as incredibly smart. Of course, candy obviously doesn't have muscles (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">thankfully</a>), so there's that.
</li><li> Lots of ads and other kinds of artistic portrayals show "parrots" that don't exist in nature, with bizarre coloration, patterns, etc. Oh well. But even depictions which were obviously done with good attention to detail, including real-life parrot coloration, feather layout, anatomy, etc. still often mess up the feet. A very large fraction of all parrot artwork gives them "chicken feet" (with three toes facing forward, one facing back) instead of real parrot feet (which have two toes forward, two toes backwards). Corona Beer ads are especially bad about this. The same problem often crops up in depictions of toucans, woodpeckers, cuckoos, and roadrunners, which also like parrots have <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dactyly#Zygodactyly">zygodactyl<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> feet.
</li><li> Most commercials for hair care products use words like "nourishment" or "healthy hair." One commercial years ago even went so far as to call hair "a living, breathing part of your body." Too bad that the part of the hair being "treated" is biochemically dead. The only part that's actually alive is underneath the skin, in the follicle.
</li><li> There's the "oxygenated water" thing. Drinking water with more oxygen packed into it is good for you, right? Well, only if you had fish gills in your stomach. If your stomach and intestines could perform that sort of gas exchange, Coke and Pepsi with their carbon dioxide would be a deadly poison. Lungs do that function excellently, thank you.
</li><li> There's one vitamin commercial that claims that it helps repair your "cell <em>walls</em>", a feature not found in mammalian cells. Even if they're just trying to put "cell <em>membrane</em>" in simpler terms, those terms only <em>exist</em> in biology (nobody knew about the things to name them before the invention of the microscope), so their technical usage is their only correct one.
</li><li> Many "Blue Wilderness" dog food packaging show an adult wolf <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note24ml2');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note24ml2" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note24ml2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> their whole marketing gimmick is likening dogs to wolves naturally desirous of meat, and thus hungry for their meat heavy product </span> with digitally altered blue eyes. Adult wolves do not have blue eyes. Puppies do, but they change before they reach that age.

However, they are portrayed as children to show that, like the cells of real-life newborns, they haven't entirely grown into their roles and are somewhat inefficient in their jobs.

</li><li> A major plot point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon">Doraemon</a></em> involving Sewashi changing the past by sending Doraemon back to the 20th century to improve Nobita's future, resulting in his great-great-grandmother being changed from Jaiko to Shizuka. He demonstrates that no matter who Nobita will marry, he will always be born which is not possible due to his 1/16 gene is different, thus, he will cease to exist. The fact that this doesn't occur in any of the mangas or adaptation so far as to suggest that there is something that Sewashi didn't tell or either the authors just didn't think about this.

<ul><li> Ken Akamatsu seems to have been blindsided by myths about eyesight. Supposedly, Naru 'ruined her eyes' by studying so much for her entrance exams, and towards the end, Keitaro has developed night blindness, unstated but implied to be from going on so many digs with Seta. While these things are possible, they would require our fun couple to do most everything by dim candle-light, never get enough Vitamin A in modern culture, and seems a combo of somewhat realistic biology and old wives' tales. Maybe this was meant to symbolize their blindness about their mutual feelings, but genetics also plays a huge role in eyesight.

Eyes are repeatedly removed and given to other people. In one case a character manages to pluck out another character's eye by apparently just grabbing it when running past them during a heated battle. Even better, said character just plops the eye into their own socket and is <em>immediately</em> able to use it perfectly. Another character managed to pull out his own eyes and put them into someone else's head without that other person noticing what had happened. Human-to-animal transplants are apparently flawless, too, as seen when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Itachi transplants one of Shisui's eyes into a crow</span>. The one-time eye surgery is portrayed somewhat realistically, requiring a lengthy recovery period, it is used to temporarily write a character out of the plot.

<ul><li> This was even hammered home further with the introduction of the hybrid Daycare in Chapter 142.
</li></ul></li><li> This series also gets several other things wrong about biology although some of them may be intentional. For example, it greatly exaggerates the deadliness of Komodo dragon venom. In real life they are not a very venomous species, but the series depicts Gosha has having to be extremely careful not to accidentally poison people and dripping large amounts of venom from his mouth when excited, and when he is especially upset his venom acts like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAcid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAcid">Hollywood Acid</a>. It also gets where they secrete the venom from wrong. In real life Komodo dragons secrete venom from a pair of sacks in their lower jaw, not from the upper jaw like Gosha does.
</li><li> In Chapter 154, some of the history of this civilization is revealed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Apparently when the carnivores or "life animals" first encountered the herbivores or "nature animals", some form of magical "survival instinct" triggered causing the carnivores to view the herbivores as objects of protection, rather than potential meals even though the historical account just established that the carnivores would eat each other to survive.</span> It remains to be seen how much of this account is factual versus mythical versus revisionist history but, needless to say, the current story flies in the face of established predator/prey behavior observed in nature.

<ul><li> When Ellis wrote <em>Iron Man: Extremis</em>, he explained the eponymous magic bullet (a single injection which would turn ordinary mortals into supermen) as a "Data package contained in a few million carbon nanotubes, injected directly into the brain". The information package would then rewrite the repair center in the brain &mdash; that is, the part of the brain which keeps a complete 'map' of our organs and functions. "The brain is telling the body is wrong"... and it compliantly changes according to the Extremis instructions.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AfterEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AfterEarth">After Earth</a></em>, humanity's former homeworld Earth is depicted as having changed dramatically in the thousand years since humans left the planet. Since then, the planet's rainforests have overgrown the continents, the weather changes from warm to ice cold every night, and "everything on this planet has evolved to kill humans". However, evolution does not work <em>that</em> fast. Biological changes on the scale depicted take millions, not thousands of years, and most plants and animals would have gone extinct trying to adapt to temperatures that fall far below freezing each night. In the time it would take for animals to change that much, humans would have changed significantly as well. Also, there'd be no reason for the animals to continue evolving abilities to efficiently kill humans since humans don't even live on Earth anymore. The primary predator of the film, the Ursa, is a blind creature that hunts by smelling the pheromones produced by fear. This is not a great feature for a predator; most predators hunt by ambush since prey goes down faster if it doesn't know you're there. But if the prey is displaying fear, it likely knows the predator is there and so has a chance to run or fight back, which would only make things more difficult for a fear-smelling hunter. Also, being blind is a huge disadvantage for an animal that lives on the surface of the Earth and would make it very difficult for a large, active predator to simply navigate, much less hunt, given that it would be unable to see any obstacles in its path like trees or cliffs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlienResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlienResurrection">Alien: Resurrection</a></em>:

Furthermore, red blood cells don't even contain DNA (though, white blood cells do contain DNA, so that might explain it).
</li><li> Supposedly Aliens bond with their hosts at the genetic level, hence all the weird superpowers Ripley got from the genetic mutations caused by the Alien (like the corrosive blood). That doesn't make very much more sense, but hey, it's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Alien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Alien">Alien</a></em>.

While cortisones do reduce inflammation (swelling), and can, therefore, make injuries <em>feel</em> better, they actually <em>slow down</em> the healing process.
</li><li> '50s B-movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingColossalMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingColossalMan">The Amazing Colossal Man</a></em> has one of the doctors tending to the eponymous rapidly-growing man describe the human heart as "one big cell." As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Tom Servo</a> says, "You're not a <em>real</em> doctor, are you?"
</li><li> Oh so very much in the killer snake movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Anaconda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Anaconda">Anaconda</a></em>, all in the name of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfScary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfScary">Rule of Scary</a>. Among other things:
<ul><li> Anacondas get huge, but they spend the majority of their time in the water, only going on land if necessary. Water provides the buoyancy to <em>allow</em> them to grow massive (and never to the size of the snakes in the film, but the entire point is that these are special species that <em>do</em>. Problem is, they'd die if they tried to be arboreal.)
</li><li> Its worth noting that their have actually been reports and claims of giant anacondas going back to the colonial times, which is what the film is probably based on. These giant anacondas are classed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurCryptidsAreMoreMysterious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurCryptidsAreMoreMysterious">cryptids</a> and are thought to either be oversized green anacondas or a new species entirely. There is at least one species of prehistoric snake which did grow that large, <em>Titanoboa</em>, but it went extinct about 58 million years ago.
</li><li> They don't move at the speed of a cheetah in a chase. They can <em>strike</em> that fast, but not chase things that fast, even in water.
</li><li> They don't predominantly prey on humans (though it has happened), especially after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPersistentPredator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPersistentPredator">encountering life-threatening resistance each time</a>.
</li><li> They don't eat multiple prey the size of a human being one after the other. After consuming a meal like that (which can take hours), the snake will find a secure location where it will remain immobile for months to digest its food.
</li><li> They certainly don't regurgitate their prey just so they can hunt again out of sheer sadism. They sometimes do this for safety purposes, such as when they're threatened by a predator and they can't afford to be lethargic by having such a big meal in their stomach, or if they find their meal is too big to eat.
</li><li> The faces of the movie anacondas look more like the faces of vipers and other poisonous snakes than actual anacondas or other pythons because the former look more intimidating.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aquaman2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aquaman2018">Aquaman</a></em> has made many mistakes regarding sea creatures:
<ul><li> Sharks don't roar. And they would never slam their noses into glass hard enough to break it, since their noses are extremely sensitive.
</li><li> Whales never go to the bottom of the ocean because they breathe air. They'd never be able to hold their breath long enough. Besides, the pressure would crush them and they wouldn't be able to see anything in the darkness.
</li><li> We see familiar fish in Aquaman's army, except fish that exist that deep tend to be blind and super-ugly.
</li></ul></li><li> Despite some scientists trying to handwave things in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Arachnophobia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Arachnophobia">Arachnophobia</a></em>, no species of giant spider could possibly exist in the real world.
<ul><li> While there really are <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_spider">species of spiders that live in colonies<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, none of these are male-dominated colonies, nor do they have a singular "queen" like ants or bees.
</li><li> Arachnids and other insects breathe through their skin, and there simply isn't enough oxygen in the modern world's atmosphere for them to get any bigger.
</li><li> Scientists use a paralyzing agent to make spiders fall out of a tree in the film. Despite falling more than a hundred feet, the spiders survive. In the real world, that fall would have killed each and every spider; their bodies simply could not handle that much force.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame">Avengers: Endgame</a></em>, we see the effects of the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar">Avengers: Infinity War</a></em> when there's a five-year time skip, showing that at least Manhattan has been left abandoned and plant life is slowly reclaiming certain places. It's even mentioned that certain species have recovered. As it stands, it wouldn't be <em>that</em> catastrophic for most species - culling half of humanity's population of (as of 2019) ~7.7 billion means knocking it down to about 3.85 billion, which is about Earth's population in the <em>1970s</em>, a fifty year gap and certainly a gap that could be cleared easily. The worst off would be the animals who were on the verge of extinction as an act like that would certainly doom them all.
<ul><li> However, it is implied that humanity as a whole entered a state of depression, likely lowering birth rates and reducing human activity overall.
</li></ul></li><li> Mice live a very short life &mdash; 3 years at the most, but in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cinderella2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cinderella2015">Cinderella (2015)</a></em> Gus Gus and Jacqueline are shown to have long enough lifespans to witness Cinderella growing up from a little girl to a young woman.
</li><li> In <em>The Cleaver Family Reunion</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Grandma Cleaver</span> reveals that she's been white all of these years, but has been taking melatonin to make her look black. Melatonin doesn't work that way... The correct term is "melanin". Melanin is what causes pigmentation of the skin. Melatonin is a natural sleep aid.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Doom">Doom</a></em> has the mutant monsters come from the genetic experimentation of long-dead human Martian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Precursors</a>. Fair enough. But it turns out that the mutations are caused by there being a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood">gene for evil</a>" in the "poorly understood 10% of the human genome" which the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticEngineeringIsTheNewNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticEngineeringIsTheNewNuke">genetically engineered</a> chromosome reacts to. Now, when one of these mutants bites a healthy human, it infects them like a <em>virus</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Elysium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Elysium">Elysium</a></em>: After his accident, Max says that he has so much radiation in his body that he is probably irradiating people in close proximity. Carlyle makes a similar claim when he worries about having to replace the sheets in the factory medbay, due to Max's skin falling off (which doesn't happen from radiation poisoning, either in reality nor in the movie itself). Both are wrong because radiation can only be emitted by radioactive material; human tissue does not qualify. There are excuses for both, though; Max was trying to intimidate someone and may not even know better, and Carlyle is just a jackass.
</li><li> In a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FinalDestination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FinalDestination">Final Destination</a></em> movie, a girl is slowly pulled into the machinery of an escalator. As soon as her feet get crushed, she starts spewing blood all over her boyfriend. No reason for that, really. No digestive or respiratory organs in the feet. However, it is possible that getting her legs crushed between those cogs and gears caused her blood pressure to skyrocket, which would pop blood vessels (starting with the very weak ones, such as the capillary bed in the lungs). Imagine rolling a tube of toothpaste starting from the bottom up.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFifthElement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFifthElement">The Fifth Element</a></em>, the head scientist, while referring to the still-a-sample Leeloo, says "I can't wait to meet him.", even though he has complete access to her DNA, so he <em>really</em> should be able to notice the lack of a Y chromosome.

Where is his skull? Never mind the weight of an open-air elevator being lowered that slowly wouldn't be enough to cause that much damage, most likely just pressing the lungs until he asphyxiated.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1998">Godzilla (1998)</a>:
<ul><li> Godzilla runs at a rather high speed, at one point chasing down an attack helicopter. Coinciding with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareCubeLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareCubeLaw">Square-Cube Law</a>, large real-world creatures a fraction of Godzilla's size would splatter if they ever tripped moving that fast. And this ignores the physics of getting a creature with that much mass moving at that speed using anything close to real-world biology.
</li></ul></li><li> The reason why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTactics">infrared-guided anti-aircraft Sidewinder missiles</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustPlaneWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustPlaneWrong">fired from AH-64 Apaches</a> failed to lock on Godzilla is because it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMetaphor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMetaphor">"cold-blooded"</a>. Cold-blooded creatures don't literally have cold blood. They lack built-in mechanisms of keeping their body temperature at a constant level, independent from the environment.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a> film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goldfinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goldfinger">Goldfinger</a></em>: A Bond girl is asphyxiated by covering her entire body with gold paint. Bond explains that people need at least a small patch of bare skin at the base of the spine for their skin to "breathe." This isn't true. At the time the novel was written, "skin asphyxiation" was taken seriously, at least by the public. The studio had a team of doctors on hand while shooting the death scene, and left actress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShirleyEaton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShirleyEaton">Shirley Eaton</a>'s stomach unpainted to make sure she could breathe.

This is exactly the wrong way round; the stamen is the male part of the flower and the pistil is the female part. (Since they're not paying attention to the actual lesson, it arguably makes sense that they'd get it wrong...)

Protozoa are single-celled lifeforms, and "protozoan" is the word for describing one in the singular. Also, algae are not "aquatic plants". They're algae. But they're often referred to as aquatic plants, so that one gets a pass as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiesToChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiesToChildren">one character simplifying the truth to explain it more easily</a>".

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Interstellar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Interstellar">Interstellar</a></em> has, as a major plot point, a world-scale blight wiping out all plants and thus depopulating the world.

In comparison, two-thirds of the entire world at present is dependent on wheat, rice, and corn). Moreover, crop scientists are always specifically aware of the potential of disease, and develop new varieties to deal with them, even in crops which are all direct clones (such as common fruits like bananas, apples, and oranges). And the blight shouldn't be so devastating towards wild plants, since <a class="urllink" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5192947/">wild plants have greater genetic diversity<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (giving them greater potential to develop resistance) and tend to grow in mixtures of multiple species (<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyculture#Disease_control">making it harder for diseases to spread, compared to the monocultures that many crops are grown in<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>).
</li><li> <em>Island City</em> a 1994 made-for-TV movie, had the few remaining regular humans living in a small enclave surrounded by animalistic mutants. The mutants were called 'recessives' because the trait was inherited that way. One of the characters was &mdash; get this &mdash; HALF RECESSIVE, with all the increased strength and toughness but without the bestial aggression and reduced intelligence. Also, the inhabitants of the city wore colored crystals making their genetic status clear, to prevent the wrong kind of couple forming and producing the wrong kind of offspring. That would be fine, except there were THREE colors (should only be 2, carrier or not) and people were forbidden from mating with anyone whose crystal was a DIFFERENT color (should be, 2 carriers may not mate).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws">Jaws</a></em>:
<ul><li> This film and its sequels are infamous for depicting sharks as relentless man-eaters. Great white sharks do not see humans as food due to lack of enough fat to provide them calories and usually (<em>usually</em>, not always) attack if provoked, smelled blood, or in a case of mistaken identity. They also need much of their energy to maintain their body temperature. Being opportunists, they will eat most things they can catch, but they don't specifically target people. Also, according to scientists in the 2000s, another reason sharks don't attack people is sharks apparently don't like the taste of human meat. After all, humans don't live in the ocean.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws2">Jaws 2</a></em> has an orca that is mauled to death by the great white shark, and the supposed marine biologist claims that there are far greater marine predators than it, referencing the shark. In real life, orcas are capable of killing great white sharks and the only predator (besides humans and other great whites) that preys on great whites. There have even been cases of entire populations of great whites fleeing from an area due to orcas preying on one individual. Even a fully-grown shark would not bother attacking an orca as it is still less than half the size of the mammal.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JawsTheRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JawsTheRevenge">Jaws: The Revenge</a></em> has the shark roaring, which sharks are incapable of due to lacking vocal cords (or <em>lungs</em>, for that matter).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JurassicPark">Jurassic Park</a></em> contains a few:
<ul><li> One character who is supposed to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePaleontology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePaleontology">paleontologist</a> saying "Dinosaurs and man. Two species separated by sixty-five million years." The problem being that dinosaur is not a species designation, but a much higher taxonomic rank. There are currently known to have been more than 1,000 species of dinosaur. Furthermore, most of these species have been extinct far longer than 65 million years (and most paleontologists would argue that some dinosaurs live to this day &mdash; these dinosaurs are technically known as "birds"). It's almost like Dr. Grant knew he had to say something <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall">for the movie trailer</a>.
</li><li> Another scene has him holding a baby dinosaur in his hands. "What species is it?" he hisses to a nearby geneticist. "It's a <em>Velociraptor</em>," responds the geneticist. Neither of these trained scientists who really ought to know these things picked up on the fact that <em>Velociraptor</em> is the genus name. This is averted in the book, where the baby is identified as <em>Velociraptor mongoliensis</em>.
</li><li> An early scene has the paleontologists digging up a <em>Velociraptor mongoliensis</em> in the Montana badlands. As the name implies, they lived in Mongolia, and not Montana. The misidentification of <em>Velociraptor</em> was actually due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">Science Marches On</a> &mdash; the original book based its research on a (now debunked) palaeontologist who argued that <em>Deinonychus antirrhopus</em> was, in fact, a species of <em>Velociraptor</em>, which means what they were digging for in the novel (which the film did not correct) was a north-American <em>Velociraptor antirrhopus</em>. Every instance where the book and the film use <em>Velociraptor</em> is therefore in actuality a reference to <em>Deinonychus antirrhopus</em>. This does not take into account the lack of feathers and an egregious misunderstanding of <em>Deinonychus</em> anatomy, but this could be explained away (at least in the book) by the knowledge that these <em>aren't</em> "real" dinosaurs but a facsimile created by geneticists working with patchwork DNA and a flawed understanding of the beings they're trying to re-create. The cheetah speed (the actual speed was closer to that of a wolf, or only about half this) and chimpanzee intelligence (they were very smart, but not <em>that</em> smart) can at least be filed under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">artistic license</a>.
</li><li> The premise of the movie (and the book). If the amber-preserved blood was any more than 1 million years old, the DNA would have been irrecoverably decomposed, no matter what it was preserved in. Cloning extinct species from before 1 million years ago is impossible. Also, if the DNA were available, we have absolutely no idea how to turn that DNA into a viable dinosaur egg. You'd need complete information about how the oviducts of that particular species operated even to get started, and we don't even have any fossils of dinosaur oviducts, let alone a clue as to their gestational duration, average internal temperature, etc.
</li><li> The Lysine plan. A plan to limit the growth of the dinosaurs by making them dependent on the amino acid Lysine, by taking away their ability to produce it themselves. Lysine is an essential amino acid. Most modern-day vertebrates (including crocodiles and sharks; superorders that existed in the Jurassic period) can't produce it either. And we make do without it because we get Lysine from our gut flora or by eating things containing Lysine. The Lysine plan is a great way to limit the growth of genetically modified bacteria, which depend on Lysine in the media if they can't make it themselves. For vertebrates, that obtain it from eating things anyway, it's not. The book at least acknowledges this as an in-universe whopper by InGen's scientists, as it turns out it was no hindrance to the dinosaurs whatsoever.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LittleSweetheart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LittleSweetheart">Little Sweetheart</a></em> almost avoids this, until the last few seconds. Elizabeth has taken a bullet to the arm, a bullet to the gut and then spent at least several minutes face-down in either the Pacific or the Gulf of Mexico. She's easily being moved by the ocean and she's not moving. A band-aid to the head is all you need!
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix">The Matrix</a></em>, Agent Smith gives a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakThemByTalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakThemByTalking">Breaking Speech</a> on how humans are viruses because they don't instinctively develop an equilibrium with their environment like other mammals and instead breed until they can't support themselves. In reality, animals do not instinctively find an equilibrium with their environment; it's forced upon them by outside factors. We see invasive species of animals run rampant in new ecosystems all the time. The only difference with humans is that we have the power to push past most opposing environmental limitations. On the other side, there are plenty of viruses that can inhabit a person but not kill them and form their own equilibrium, like many of those diseases that never really leave your system but also don't cause major symptoms.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MissionToMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MissionToMars">Mission to Mars</a></em>:
<ul><li> One character arranges Skittles in the air in microgravity in the shape of about ten base pairs and declares it's the genome of his "perfect woman" (the human genome contains about 3.2 <em>billion</em> base pairs). Another character eats a couple; apparently, it's now the genome of a frog. Easily written off as a joke, until later in the film: after seeing about five base pairs on a screen, a character declares that it "looks human". Five BP on their own would tell you nothing whatsoever about what you're looking at, not even which <em>kingdom</em> it belonged to, never mind species.
<ul><li> Perhaps more egregious in this particular scene is how the floating candy DNA chain somehow rotates on an axis.
</li></ul></li><li> The writers clearly lacked an understanding of genetics. To start with, one of the characters constructs a model of a DNA molecule from supplied spacial coordinates, then Jim is able to <em>look</em> at a (very small) string of computer-generated DNA, and see that it "looks human". This is impossible, because a) you can't tell what species a sequence came from by looking at such a small sample and b) spacial coordinates that form a double helix say precisely jack shit about what bases (and, by extension, what genes) are contained in the DNA sequence. Then someone mentions it's missing "the last pair of chromosomes," when the simulation makes it readily apparent it's missing the last pair of <em>bases</em>. To top it all off, the coloring of the bases appear to suggest that a base pair is made up of two identical bases, which is just wrong.

</li><li> The low-budget monster flick <em>Octopus</em> attributes its giant cephalopod's prodigious appetite for meat to a severe deficiency in iron, such that eating iron-rich flesh is all that's staving off its death from anemia. Mollusk blood uses <em>copper</em>, not iron, as an oxygen-carrier, so if anything it should have been chewing on the imperiled submarine's electric wiring, not its crew.

Every predator gets about 10% of the energy his prey took in. So, every generation of piranha should have lost 10/11 of their population. Even assuming they magically preserved 90% of the energy, they wouldn't have made it that long without producers in their food chain!

On top of being quite cringeworthy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawlessToken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawlessToken">Flawless Token</a>, the premise is flawed for two major reasons: firstly that it hinges on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolutionaryLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolutionaryLevels">Evolutionary Levels</a> fallacy, and secondly that the characteristics of the condition (troubled social interaction and impaired communication skills) work precisely against what evolution stands for (better adaptation to the environment and better chances to survive and reproduce, which in humans is parallel to social functioning, and humans are social animals - romance is one thing autistic people notoriously struggle with).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Push" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Push">Push</a></em> has the lead character <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">inject soy sauce directly into his bloodstream with no side effect at all</span>.
</li><li> In the low-budget monster flick <em>Razortooth</em>, the giant killer eel breathes air and slithers like a snake. It's also alleged to be incapable of metabolizing glucose "like a diabetic": a double error, as A) diabetics <em>can</em> metabolize glucose, they just don't do so at the right rate, and B) any animal with a nervous system that can't metabolize <em>any</em> glucose would be dead, as neurons quickly die from accumulated waste products if they have to subsist on fatty or amino acids instead.

In reality, you would need (on average) two offspring to survive (and reproduce) per couple just for the population to remain stable. Even if the cultists recruit outsiders to marry the kids they don't sacrifice, attrition would still wipe them out, as some of each generation are likely to die, fail to reproduce at all, or leave the cult.

<ul><li> The snakes are shown as shockingly aggressive, actively pursuing prey, whereas most snakes (including those shown in the film) are relatively sedentary; the snakes in the film bite repeatedly for no apparent reason, simply killing without eating the people or defending themselves, and then move to attack and kill other people who are neither a threat nor viable prey. The snakes are described as being so aggressive and violent because they are being stimulated by sexual pheromones, except that snakes are not praying mantids or black widows and do not kill their mates while they have sex. If snakes <em>were</em> to be brought into a violent frenzy when in the presence of sexual pheromones they would require separate pheromones for each individual species and would be just as likely to attack each other as humans, as any other species would be as much of a threat/competition as the people would.

Finally, the python has no problem getting human shoulders down its throat. A real python would need a few moments to unhinge and stretch out its jaw, and then would probably need some time to properly position a meal that wide. Assuming a snake that size (about 16 feet) could get its head over an adult male's shoulders in the first place; even most potentially man-eating snakes (over 20 feet) will have trouble consuming a large person and take hours to do so. Yes, there were time constraints, but still. At least the python seems to still have been working on its meal when the poor thing got sucked out the window.

The bugs are referred to both as "insects" and "arachnids" throughout the movie. Apart from those being mutually exclusive terms, it's unlikely that alien creatures from across the galaxy would belong to <em>any</em> terrestrial animal class. The film also ignores the square-cube law that would make those giant bugs collapse under their own weight.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuperSizeMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuperSizeMe">Super Size Me</a></em> contains plenty of questionable science behind the "30 days of eating nothing but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds">McDonald's</a>" experiment, the one thing that's blatantly incorrect was the DVD extra where a McDonald's burger and fries were allowed to sit on a counter with food from other restaurants to see how long they took to decompose. The other sandwiches and fries showed signs of decay and mold before accidentally getting thrown out, while the food from McDonald's was virtually unchanged the entire time, with the implication that they're artificial to the core and pumped with preservatives. The <em>real</em> reason they didn't grow mold was that they were thin, greasy, and salty; what little water they contained evaporated quickly, leaving no suitable environment for mold to grow. It's the same reason fresh bread in a sealed bag will become moldy, while bread sitting on the counter will simply dry out and turn stale.

The amount they received on their dangerously low blood pressure should also have given them heart failure within minutes.
</li><li> A scene in the bad Canadian vampire B-movie <em>Thralls</em> features the lead villain vampire <em>punch another man through his stomach, tear part of his spine out and show it to him as the now-spineless man merely <strong>stands there</strong></em>.

This is credited with removing his sense of touch, despite this not being where the sense of touch is in the brain. The sense of touch is in the parietal lobe (mostly) which is at the top back of the brain. The medulla is at the bottom of the brain. While some have survived with bullets in their brains, such as Kiran Prajapati, who they were likely thinking of, if a bullet was damaging your medulla your heart would quickly fail, you would stop breathing, and your sense of touch would be fine.

<ul><li> Mutants cannot be called another <em>species</em>, given that they can still interbreed freely with normal humans. There is also the continuous reference to a so-called "mutant gene". In reality, any gene in the genome has the potential to be mutated. Even if you don't have a biology diploma, it ought to be obvious that there could be no universal "cure" that suppressed all the flashy mutations (but not "regular" ones like, say, heterochromia?) on any given mutant without affecting anything else, and certainly not in a matter of seconds.

This implies that the gene is carried on the Y chromosome, which if it were true, would mean that there would be no female mutants. However, the scene makes it clear he just said this to get under Mr. Drake's skin.

When exposed to radiation, the Mountain Men break out in instantaneous lesions and bleeding wounds, which are treated with blood transfusions from Grounders or citizens of the Ark. The blood transfusions not only prevent further damage from radiation, but heal what wounds they have already sustained. The Mountain Men later move on to bone-marrow transplants from the Arkers they have in captivity, as the bone marrow allows the Mountain Men to metabolize radiation on their own. Their bone marrow plot seems to be "take someone's bone marrow and stick it into anyone else," which is hardly the case in real life.

Evolution does not work that way! Sheldon Cooper is also egotistical and occasionally delusionally convinced of his own superiority. He has been known to occasionally ignore various scientific principles in order to win arguments, particularly when it comes to superhero physics. Given that humanity is still evolving, every generation is a new stage. Sheldon's only mistake is that he overexaggerates his own significance in the process. He is also missing the point of natural selection. Because of his psychological quirks and self-centeredness, his "fitness" level currently appears to be very low (moreover he has a very low interest in finding a mate in the first place, much less conceiving and raising a child). Unless his attitude changes completely, he is going to be naturally selected against, and not pass on his genes. Evolution favors those who have multiple children. Though really, it was just an excuse for not being able to learn to drive, rather than him making a definitive statement about his evolutionary significance.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "The Dwarf in the Dirt", Dr. Brennan tells Sweets the chunk of brain Booth is missing would in no way mess with his aim because it was taken from his Frontal and Parietal lobes (which according to her only deal with memory). She then states that only the Occipital lobe (sight) and Cerebellum (coordinated movement) have anything to do with aiming a gun. The part of the Frontal lobe closest to the Parietal lobe is called the "Motor Cortex" and, oddly enough, is in charge of motor control. The Parietal lobe (which is a major part of spatial relations) has a part next to the Motor Cortex called the "Sensory Cortex" which, you guessed it, is about feeling ones body. Moving, feeling and spatial relations have nothing to do with aiming a gun... Nothing at all...
</li><li> The frontal and parietal lobes are the largest two lobes of the brain, so it depends on which parts were taken. But the motor cortex and sensory cortex are right beside each other, straddling the border between the lobes, so it's hard to imagine how a single piece could be removed that incorporates both lobes and <em>not</em> involve the motor and sensory cortices (in which case Booth would have troubles far more than just aiming a gun &mdash; he'd be liable to be paralyzed on one side of his body in at least one limb). Also, the part of the brain most involved in memory is the Temporal lobe. And in a later episode they show an MRI scan of Booth's brain, and the missing part is most definitely not anywhere near the frontal or parietal lobes.
</li><li> In a minor example, one episode starts with a human falling to his death and landing in a field of cows. The witnessing cows just stand there placidly, and politely keep their distance from the investigators. Real cows tend to be curious, so would gather to see what was going on.

First, it's highly unlikely that all three dead cheerleaders would have had the same blood type and been compatible enough for their parts to be grafted together. Second, there's no way any of their cells would have still been living by the time the bodies were recovered and used. (ditto with the dead football player who was brought back). Third, no one seems to recall that heads can't be transplanted without severing the spinal cord and resulting in complete paralysis. It's hard to imagine that's what the re-animated dead kid had in mind when he wanted a girl built for him.
</li><li> This trope is occasionally lampshaded in the scripts. A line in the script for "Some assembly required" written by Ty King describing a medical drawing reads, "it's of a woman's body, with muscles, joints, all kinds of equations and science type stuff (English major much?) scribbled all over it". Joss Whedon's script for "Graduation day, part one" has the stage directions "swabbing blood off the tip and putting it on a slide. That sounds real sciencey! Did I mention I was an English major?"
</li><li> Somewhat justified since Sunnydale sits on top of a Hellmouth, which constantly leaks magic (and attracts supernatural creatures) &mdash; this probably allows a lot of people to do what they <em>want</em> to do, if they want it badly enough, even if normal biology wouldn't permit it.

It's as if the writers believed that women normally have no testosterone in their bodies at all (in actuality, they do, and some have more of it than others).

AB- people can also receive red blood cells from all other blood types, however if it was a whole blood transplant, as would happen in an emergency, the sera (which contains antibodies) could cause major problems if not also from an AB- donor, as it would "attack" and cause an immune reaction against the recipient's own cells.

Although it is rare, the man could have been <em>cis-AB</em> and had an O child.

</li><li> Less than a day is insufficient time to determine, via rat observation, if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">The Virus</a> is airborne.

</li><li> Viruses are not typically searched for by shape, and when Julia says she's searched for all of them, "<em>even</em> isocahedrons" she's treating the most common shape as though it were unexpected.
</li><li> The Zeiss phase-contrast microscopes depicted can't produce such animated images, much less show a virus that's smaller than usual. (viruses also don't move like protozoa). They'd need electron microscopes to see such small objects.
</li><li> In "Vector," Julia says rabies "doesn't include a compulsion to spread the disease" but that's <em>exactly</em> how rabies works. This error is odd since Peter's first symptoms are a supernatural exaggeration of rabies. His frightened refusal of water mirrors its hydrophobia, and the neck pulsations evoke the painful throat spasms that happen after those with rabies try drinking.
</li><li> Isolation and safety protocols are more talked about in the abstract then abided by. Isolation facilities should be larger and more secure given Arctic Biosystems extensive work with pathogens. In "Vector" Dr. Bryce is correct that he and Sulemani should be separated from the sicker Haven, since late stage infectees are super strong and violent. In "274" Daniel is likewise correct when he thinks now-symptomatic Sulemani and Bryce should stay isolated from the asymptomatic in quarantine, and Alan's failure to account for this violence results in Bryce and Sulemani's deaths.
</li><li> By the same token, the switch, over the course of three days, from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HazmatSuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HazmatSuit">Hazmat Suit</a> to face shield for interacting with infected is unwise, given that, in "274" its easy for a Vector to slip one off mid-assault, and one strain is known to be hemorrhagic and lethal.

Animals do not have cell walls (in fact, Animalia is the only kingdom where they are absent). Yes, they probably just don't want to explain what a cell membrane is/assume the audience won't understand the explanation, so they use a term the audience will know. Considering Discovery's association with fact and science, it seems like they would be willing to spend an extra ten seconds quickly explaining what it is.
</li><li> A Korean drama special entitled <em>Last Flashman</em> has a girl find out a shocking birth secret (that she's an alien or something) because she has blood type O but both her parents have type A. Most of the people are shocked and confused and maintain strongly that it's impossible to have blood type O from A parents. This is biologically wrong, since having O blood type with A parents are perfectly possible &mdash; a person with A bloodtype can have the allele pattern Ai, and if each parent donates an i, the child gets an O. It would be odd if it was two ABs giving birth to an O, or two As giving birth to an AB, or two Bs giving birth to an A, or two Os giving birth to an AB or A or B, but this is not the case.

Isn't the whole point of inherited genetic characteristics that each parent contributes HALF of their DNA to the child, and not more than half?

Among other "facts", he claimed that Rhinos are dinosaurs, because he thought they were called "Rhinosaurus".
</li><li> In another episode, host Stephen Fry rather patronisingly "corrects" Jimmy Carr when the latter suggests that marsupials are mammals, which they are.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em>Rides</em>, the build team works to incorporate a real human skull into a spooky-themed vehicle's sound system. The narrator constantly refers to the skull as "he" and "Don", yet the <em>numerous</em> close-ups show features that suggest it's really a "Donna". Granted, the show's cast have no training to recognize this... but you'd think the suppliers who provided the skull would've mentioned it.

</li><li> The Asgard have a serious problem &#151; they are all clones and because they simply clone their last body their DNA is degrading! It seems that nobody had the bright idea to not copy the last clone, but just use the original copy every time. Though this is actually the point &#151; they do not have any original from back in the time when they were still well enough. They found some ancient frozen Asgard, but those were not yet ready to be used as "hosts". There is no saying what the requirements of the clone are &#151; possibly, the mind transferring process isn't actually as simple as they make it to be &#151; possibly, the body has have some compatibility with the "transplantee". By the time they realized they have a problem, it was already too late. Yes, they could have bought some time if they stored some current copies for later use, but at the end of the series, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they made it clear they do not want to protract their "death" as a species any longer, when there are no advancements in their condition</span>.
</li><li> In <em>Stargate Atlantis</em> Dr. Becket concludes that the Wraith evolved from the Iratus Bug by using every trope in the biology book. The DNA of the Iratus Bug mixed with human DNA, and because parasites are normally identical to hosts they feed from, the Wraith were born.

<ul><li> In the episode "Macrocosm" we have viruses(!) which can grow in size &mdash; up to a meter, fly, and hover in the air. It turns out that they somehow could do it by taking an alien growth <em>hormone</em>.
</li><li> The Occampans (Kes' race) in <em>Voyager</em>, can only reproduce <em>once</em>, and have <em>one child</em>. What kind of species would evolve such a trait and thrive? You'd need EVERY member of your race to reproduce to have 0 population growth. If any member of the race dies, then the race as a whole has taken a blow it cannot recover from! <em>How</em> did the Occampan race come about? Since they can have only one child, and thus cannot grow in numbers, how are there so many of them? It was actually explained in a novella that twin and triplet births were extremely common among Ocampans, so it depends how you look at it. It still doesn't excuse the fact that they can only give birth while <em>standing up,</em> increasing the chance somebody is going to drop the baby upon delivery. <br><br>The way Kes's species reproduces makes no real sense. The child can only be delivered standing up (the baby coming from the back), maximizing the chance of mortality from the baby falling to the ground, sex is a very complicated procedure which includes foot massaging, and they can only have ONE child in their ENTIRE lives. Even if both the men and the women of the species had babies with a 0% mortality rate (and none of those babies die between birth and having their own child) that means they can only maintain their current numbers.
</li><li> Though there is some evidence that human birth is easier on the mother if done while standing up
</li><li> Perhaps those are limitations caused by the dependence from the Caretaker.
</li><li> In the second episode, Kes asked for soil samples to help her in setting up a hydroponics bay. Hydroponics is the means of growing plants <em>without</em> soil. Possibly excusable if the samples were being analyzed to determine the right proportions of minerals to add to the hydroponic fluid.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">TNG</a></em> episode "Genesis" was on a par with "Threshold" &mdash; demonstrating that Brannon Braga may have a PhD in this trope. Switching on Barclay's T-cells causes the Enterprise crew to &mdash; sigh &mdash; devolve to a variety of different species... most of which have common ancestors diverging HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO &mdash; and Spot the cat becomes an iguana. Apparently in Star Trek, everyone walks around with copies of not only the future evolutionary patterns of their own species but ALSO whole swathes of species that are completely unrelated to them from their home planet. The worst offender being Barclay's devolution (and presumably re-evolution) into a <em>spider</em>, which would only be possible if he devolved into a pre-Cambrian lifeform first.
<ul><li> Data devolving into a pocket calculator would have made more sense.
</li><li> This was already plumbed with <em>TNG</em>'s "The Chase", which attempts to cure at least three problems at once...by making all of the Alpha Quadrant's DNA part of a message by a progenitor race, also humanoid, that "seeded" planets with their genetic code in the hope of more sentient humanoids like themselves popping up. Cue Picard facepalm.
</li><li> An original idea that inspired a lot of 'ancient ancestor' settings. The original humanoids found that their home galaxy (not just one quadrant) contained no life that was like them. Their own extinction fears drove them to seed the Milky Way and as a result encourage humanoid life to develop. The code was like a signature for them &mdash; they wanted the Milky Way races to find out their origin to encourage cooperation.
</li><li> Which, of course, implies that every <em>non</em>-humanoid carbon-based life form in the <em>Star Trek</em> franchise, from the grape vines in the Picard family vineyards to Captain Archer's beagle, is essentially doing it wrong.

A large Nile crocodile can weigh five times as much. Potentially due to confusion over "Carnivore" (as in "order Carnivora", of which the lion is indeed the largest member in Africa), and "carnivore" (as in "meat-eater in general"), which is often used interchangeably with "predator" (despite scavengers also eating meat).

This is backwards from how snakes normally feed (granted, doing it the right way around would make for a much shorter song...)

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WhiteWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WhiteWolf">White Wolf</a>'s <em>Aeon Trinity</em> contains the following gem: "[Psions are] the product of natural human evolution, not genetic mutation." This was later retconned to refer to mankind's <em>spiritual</em> evolution.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>:
<ul><li> All human/tiefling descendants are tieflings. Forever. Nobody ever finds a tiefling hiding unknown in their family tree; oh no, if your great-grandfather is a tiefling so is everyone descended from him. Apparently, when devils are involved, Mendel's laws are more like suggestions. Depending on the sourcebook, some tried to correct it to "half-demon for a few generations, tiefling for a few generations, human eligible for Demon Bloodline feats", judging by the various sourcebooks on the subject (and depending on who you mate with).
<ul><li> As of 4th edition, though, tieflings are back to having supernaturally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood">tainted blood</a>, rather than a genetic condition; the first tieflings were the result of normal humans undergoing an infernal ritual, rather than interbreeding with demons.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BrimstoneAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BrimstoneAngels">Brimstone Angels</a></em> novel series offers a further clarification for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em> setting; thanks to a powerful ritual, all tieflings are, spiritually, considered descendants of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatanicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatanicArchetype">Asmodeus</a> regardless of their actual lineage. Since Asmodeus is a god, his power is just that virulent and natural laws really <em>are</em> just guidelines as far as he's concerned. That said, tieflings with a lot of human blood are still depicted as being somewhat more human looking than those who are closer to the fiendish end of the family tree.
</li></ul></li><li> Some <em>D&amp;D</em> examples of this trope don't even have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">A Wizard Did It</a> as an excuse. One of the Mystara setting's supplements featured a former underground empire of gnomes, now abandoned and infested with kobolds, various dungeon vermin, and wild herds of fungus-grazing <em>mules</em>. The mules were supposedly the feral descendents of the gnomes' mule beasts of burden. While female mules may not be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByCounterfactualClue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByCounterfactualClue">100% sterile</a>, fertile <em>males</em> are so rare that the only evidence of such creatures is anecdotal, making a wild population of mules virtually impossible even on the surface, never mind underground!
</li><li> Fungal enemies, such as the shrieker or violet fungus, are generally listed as belonging to the Plant type. "Plant" and "fungus" are mutually exclusive &mdash; in fact, fungi are more closely related to <em>animals</em> than to plants. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em>, being spun off from <em>D&amp;D</em>, initially did the same thing, but Second Edition introduced a separate "Fungus" creature type.
</li><li> The rules for creatures that can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwallowedWhole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwallowedWhole">Swallow Whole</a> say that if a swallowed opponent manages to cut their way out of the stomach, "muscular action" will force the hole shut behind them. Of course, muscles don't work like that, but the rule was instituted as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">Obvious Rule Patch</a> to keep the creature from becoming little more than a really macabre water slide. Fifth Edition changed things so that instead a creature will involuntarily regurgitate everything it's swallowed if it takes a certain amount of damage from creatures it's swallowed whole in one round.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FATAL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FATAL">FATAL</a></em> allows for completely out-of-whack character biology. Would you like to have nipples the size of your head and anus with negative circumference? Equally silly is being able to hit a very specific internal organ AND NOTHING ELSE on the enemy; to quote <a class="urllink" href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/14/14567.phtml">one of the more infamous reviews<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>:
<div class="indent">"The two stared at each other, then struck simultaneously. Jack's sword cleaved through the cultist's chest, cleaving through the nipple, the xiphoid process &mdash; the lowest part of the sternum &mdash; and the shoulder blade. The cultist's blade only caused damage to Jack's appendix and his adrenal gland, somehow missing everything else in front of and in back of Jack's adrenal gland and appendix."
</div><ul><li> Having your heart torn out kills you in two rounds, which is <em>slower</em> than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">having your testicles cut off</a>, which with a failed save will kill you instantly. Exactly why the creators of FATAL consider the testicles more vital to life than the heart is left as an exercise for the reader, one you probably don't want to solve. Considering the sophomoric sensibilities of the creators, it's possible that they personally value their testicles more than their hearts.

</li><li> Two specific cases in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts">Rifts</a></em>, listed separately:
<ul><li> In the Atlantis Sourcebook, a parasite called a Brain Feeder is said to "...excrete a chemical that anesthetizes the area of the brain it is eating..." This would be unnecessary, as there are no pain receptors in the brain, and therefore it can't feel pain.
</li><li> This one could well be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">Science Marches On</a>. There is an animal race in the books called an Ostrosaurus, which is not a dinosaur but "a large featherless bird." According to modern paleontology, birds are dinosaurs.
</li><li> The description of dragons says that they are actually mammals, not reptiles, even though they are scaly, hairless, egg-laying creatures that don't produce milk.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> science generally takes a backseat to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>, but...
<ul><li> One particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> example needs to be mentioned: The Eldar are stated to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology">TRIPLE HELIX DNA</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9fyr9');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note9fyr9" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9fyr9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which DOES technically exist, but is considered very unstable</span> and are <em>somehow</em> still hinted to be capable of birthing a viable human/Eldar hybrid, the sole example of which is one of the Ultramarines. This has since been retconned out of existence. The fact that female Eldar may have ample chests even though Eldar have literally not a single gramm fat in their bodies is almost tame in comparison.
</li><li> The Kroot. Mostly blank DNA, and they evolve very rapidly by incorporating DNA from everything they eat into their genetic structure. Now answer us this: if their DNA is "blank", how do their embryos form into Kroot in the first place? Definitely a case of 'well, it sounded cool when I wrote it''.
</li><li> Ork DNA, in past editions, contained an "algal base" that explained their resilience. This made no sense whatsoever and was dropped; now their DNA just happens to be very, very similar to algae, to the point where they can photosynthesize.

However, if the Makuta were originally <em>meant</em> and specifically engineered by the Great Beings so that this would happen, this would make it simple metamorphosis.
<ul><li> Greg Farshtey has addressed his use of the term "evolution." Because natives of the Matoran Universe don't biologically reproduce, such changes are referred to as evolution. In the story's final days, it was revealed that dead beings are sent to the Red Star for healing and repairs, but a malfunction kept them from returning.

</li><li> Series 2 of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/TreasureX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/TreasureX">Treasure X</a></em> line introduced "Mini Beasts", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncattyResemblance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncattyResemblance">animal skeletons that resemble the treasure hunters</a>.

<ul><li> Even if he could have all of Big Boss' recessive genes, there is nothing about this that would make him inferior. Really, one learns in <em>fifth grade</em> that a gene being recessive simply means it will be overridden by a gene that is dominant to it, which is not the same as saying the dominant gene is better. There's also the part where Liquid grossly misapplies Asymmetry Theory.

</li><li> It's also later revealed that it was actually <em>Liquid</em> who got all the dominant genes, and Solid got the recessive ones. One problem - Liquid Snake is blond. The gene for blonde hair is recessive. Similarly, Snake has brown hair, when the "brown hair" gene is the dominant one. If Liquid really got all the dominant genes and Solid got all the recessive ones, then Solid should be blond and Liquid should be brunet. This is possibly partially averted, as the briefing footage depicts Solid's hair as fair-colored or blonde, implying that he had dyed his hair brown before the mission. This is not the case in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">The Twin Snakes</a></em>, where the footage was recreated with the character models.

<ul><li> Several of Cubone's Pok&eacute;dex entries state that it wears the skull of its mother. Every Cubone encountered has a skull on its face, which means that EVERY SINGLE Cubone commits matricide (or its mother just dies) shortly after birth and each female Marowak/Cubone can only have one child. The species should have either died out or have rapidly dwindling numbers at this point. However, worth noting is that when breeding Cubones, you can get as many of them as you want from one mother, and they will all already have skull helmets. Additionally, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonOrigins">Pok&eacute;mon Origins</a></em> a Cubone is seen with its alive mother Marowak, and yet it has a helmet.

</li><li> The Pok&eacute;dex also states that Vaporeon's "cell composition is similar to water molecules. As a result, it can melt away into water." A cell is a lot more complex than a three-atom molecule.

At one point, Dolly begins aging at an accelerated rate, going from a teenager to middle-aged overnight. While there was some speculation that this was the reason for the real Dolly becoming sick and needing put down at half the typical lifespan of a sheep, it was eventually concluded that there was no evidence to support this. Also, the thinking behind this speculation was that Dolly's cells might have started out at the "same age" as her donor-mother, but in <em>Kevin and Kell</em>, Dolly (like most fictional clones) is <em>already</em> the same age as the donor (Corrie Dale), and the increased aging makes her noticeably <em>older</em> than Corrie.

One may also argue that 'sea cow' (a common name for dugong) is yet another, now extinct animal also known as Steller's Sea Cow (<em>Hydrodamalis gigas</em>). Furthermore, the song contains the phrase 'Compared to dolphin, its very close cousin...'. Dugong and dolphins are water mammals, but they belong to different orders (dugong to <em>Sirenia</em>, dolphins to <em>Cetacea</em>). Hardly 'very close cousins'.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/Serina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/Serina">Serina</a></em> normally tries to keep even its most fantastical creatures solidly grounded in biology, but there have been a few notable times where it falls into artistic license territory.
<ul><li> The planet having a lower gravity doesn't seem to affect the wildlife save for the evolution of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantFlyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantFlyer">Giant Flyers</a>, completely ignoring more serious side effects of minimal gravity such as loss of muscle tone or circulatory problems.
</li><li> Several bird lineages become quadrupedal, most notably the serezelles and the bumblets. However, the avian wrist is not adapted for bearing weight, as well as their shoulder joints being located very far up on their backs, making quadrupedal avians highly unlikely.
</li><li> The tribbetheres have horizontally-slitted pupils like a frog or goat...even the predators. Horizontally-slitted pupils are a trait of prey animals, as it gives them a wider field of vision to better watch out for danger, while predators often have round pupils (for diurnal hunters to have better forward vision), or vertically-slitted pupils (for nocturnal hunters, to increase their vision at night as well as narrow into small slits to shut out bright light).
</li><li> The King Trawler is a massive highly evolved sea snail that is comparable in size and niche to Earth's baleen whales. The problem is that it's described as being a water breather, which would make its size highly unlikely, if not outright impossible, as water holds much less oxygen than air. This is why the largest marine animals in Earth's history have been air breathers.
<ul><li> Somewhat mitigated by whale sharks, the largest living fish, so it's possible that King Trawlers have a similar metabolism as them.
</li></ul></li><li> The dogbeasts' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TripodTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TripodTerror">tripedal gait</a> is described as being superior to the quadrupedal gaits of the serezelles. In reality, it would be largely inferior - fewer limbs would need more energy to reach similar speeds and would be much more unstable when moving quickly.
<ul><li> There's also the issue of a vertebrate tail, an extentsion of the spine, being modified into a limb with knee and ankle analogues while containing the end portion of the spinal cord, as well as the lack of a hip joint or pelvis that is likely to compromise the movement or mobility of the limb.
</li><li> And not to mention plain redundancy of having a "spare" limb: a quadruped that injures one of its hind legs can at least limp away from danger and have a chance to recover, while a tripedal tribbethere that breaks its sole back leg is hopelessly crippled (and is indeed a hunting strategy of the bludgebirds, who target the single rear limb of their circuagodont<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14gpgk');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note14gpgk" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14gpgk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">ungulate-like mammal-analogue herbivore</span> prey to incapacitate them).
</li><li> This somewhat mitigated by the squaves, a group of neotenic Ornimorphs who have evolved into quadrupedal lizard-like creatures as it's stated that their gait is more efficient than that of the three legged tribtiles and they are now outcompeting them on the ground.
</li><li> It's also heavily implied that it severely limits how large they can get due to the fact that the largest terrestrial tribbetheres are the omniphages which only get up to 1,500 pounds, much smaller than earth's quadrupedal megafauna despite the stronger gravity. This is supported by the Unnamed Giant Molodont Predator, these are bipedal molodonts that have managed to reach a large size presumably due to their more even weight distribution.
</li></ul></li><li> The tribbets develop a forearm structure very similar to the tetrapods, even though they descended from ray-finned fishes, while the tetrapods evolved from lobe-finned fishes. It's from these "lobe" structures that the basic tetrapod forelimb was modified from: ray-finned fishes, lacking any sort of structure, would more likely evolve a very different type of limb (like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VertebrateWithExtraLimbs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VertebrateWithExtraLimbs">gibbets</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyLongFingers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyLongFingers">handfishes</a>).
</li><li> Some of the carnivorous circuagodonts are said to occasionally adopt young of prey species and raise them to weaning <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0m1nz');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0m1nz" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0m1nz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which is said to never end well for them as they end up associating with a predator species and are eaten by other packs who don't recognize them</span>but given the different behavioral and dietary requirements of the two species, even if separated by only a few years of evolution, the odds of them sucessfully raising a young herbivore to even that age are pretty nil (not to mention that the rest of the pack are likely to kill the "foreign" youngster viewing it as competition.)
</li><li> Some of the displacements happen too quickly, such as the serezelles dwindling when invasive and unpalatable razorgrass overgrows the plains, and completely becoming extinct when the more-efficient grazing circuagodonts move in. Realistically, with the circuagodonts eating mostly razorgrass and the serezelles feeding on softer grass, the two species can coexist by eating different food (such as antelopes, zebras and wildebeest being able to live in the same environment with minimal competition by favoring different vegetation) with the extinction of one being only imminent if food becomes scarce during a cataclysm.
<ul><li> The carnivorous circuagodonts completely displacing the canitheres is also unlikely. While the two are likely to compete significantly, the difference in their hunting styles and behavior can allow them to occupy different niches and coexist to some extent.
</li><li> This is later revealed to have actually happened, several canithere species managed to survive into the Ultimocene and diverged into new roles to avoid competing with the wheeljaws.
</li></ul></li><li> It's mentioned that most molodonts (rodent-like tribbetheres with special grinding mouthparts) have lost their tongues with only more basal species like omniphages retaining them. There are two problems with this however.
<ul><li> The first is that tongues are necessary for land animals to swallow food, in fact some paleontologists theorize that developing a tongue was what allowed early tetrapods to start colonizing the land.
</li><li> The second is that most molodonts appear to be either omnivores or herbivores which generally have a more acute sense of taste so that they don't accidentally ingest something toxic.
</li></ul></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> One of the new sapients in the Middle Ultimocene is the Gravedigger, a bumblebadger that is aggressive and territorial to members of its own kind and is mostly solitary. However, there would be little motivation for a solitary species to be intelligent, not needing to learn how to communicate, cooperate and empathize with others, with most intelligent species alive today being highly social, such as primates, corvids, elephants and dolphins</span>.
