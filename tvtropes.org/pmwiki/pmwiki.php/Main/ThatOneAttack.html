</p><p>If you have a party, it will almost always target all party members, and it often takes off the majority of your hit points, if not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">worse</a>. It's a staple for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a> to have one of these, possibly more. Occasionally though, even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> have this, making them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Demonic Spiders</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstakillMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstakillMook">Instakill Mooks</a> have these attacks practically by definition.
</p><p>This attack showing up even once is always bad news; if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIRoulette">A.I.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes">No More Heroes</a></em>:
<ul><li> Bad Girl has an attack that instantly kills you. What does she do? She drops to the floor crying. If you hit her, or even get close to her, she instantly beats you to death. At no point is it hinted that this will kill you, and if you play the game without knowledge of this, YOU WILL DIE. To make matters worse, she can sometimes do this in mid combo. Even more aggravating is that sometimes she actually <em>is</em> crying (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she only attacks if she left one hand on the bat</span>), so you can get thrown off easily if you aren't watching.
</li><li> Rank 4, Harvey Volodarskii, the boss has a near undodgeable spinning attack that takes a large chunk of health and can not be blocked.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes2DesperateStruggle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes2DesperateStruggle">No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle</a></em>:
<ul><li> Mimmy has the spinning attack. "YIPEE!"SLAP!SLAP!SLAP!SLAP!SLAP!SLAP!SLAP!SLAP!SLAP!
</li><li> Rank 7, Ryuji, can summon a dragon made of energy. This dragon will follow you <em>very</em> closely, and Travis can't dodge fast enough to escape it. And <em>Ryuji will still attack freely as it's chasing you!</em> The dragon <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">can be blocked, though it eats your battery like candy; it also has a tell: If the sky is dark it's still chasing you, if the sky clears it's gone.</span>
</li><li> Alice Twilight's blade throw move which knocks you down and she recovers from it <em>just</em> as you get up, dooming you into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunLock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunLock">Stun Lock</a> until you get lucky to escape.
</li><li> Jasper Batt Jr:
<ul><li> Halfway through the second phase of the battle, he'll start teleporting around, attacking three times in rapid succession. In a game where you dodge primarily by rolling, this attack comes <em>faster than you can roll.</em> If you manage to get him down to 1/4th HP, he'll start spamming that attack and a series of three whirlwind punches that are equally difficult (read: impossible) to dodge. The worst part? Both attacks knock you back a considerable distance, and can <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">send you out of the arena, one-hit-killing you.</a></em> That said, the teleport punch is avoidable provided you have hair-trigger reflexes and know that the second punch will almost always miss if you dodge the first, leaving you free to dodge the third. The tornado punch? It's easier to just let a prior attack knock down Travis and have him in the floor so the tornado's punches don't herm him at all.
</li><li> His third form has an unavoidable wind attack that not only tears through your battery, but pushes you back the whole way of the stage. As you try fruitlessly to recharge, he'll use it again and probably knock you down. The only real way to avoid this seems to be to stay close to him, but since he's so big, the camera will refuse to show you his close range attacks.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrimeTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrimeTrilogy">Metroid Prime Trilogy</a></em>
<ul><li> The charging tackle Meta Ridley in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em> does when he's on the ground. It's not too hard to avoid at first, but later on, especially in Hard mode, he seems to be able to guess where you'll be. Cue frustration. In fact, physical attacks in general are pretty annoying in <em>Metroid Prime</em> as you may get cornered.
</li><li> The whole reason the Boost Guardian in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime2Echoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime2Echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a></em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a> is because of its fast pinball charge. It does it frequently and it's immune while doing it.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype">[PROTOTYPE]</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Supreme Hunter</span> can use the same tendril barrage you can, and it inflicts a terrifying amount of damage. Furthermore, depending on how chaotic the fight is, noticing the move being prepared can be extremely difficult, and there's no getting out of the way once it's been unleashed on you unless you were on or very near the edge of its effective radius and moving away when it's fired.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Dracula</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IWannaBeTheGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IWannaBeTheGuy">I Wanna Be the Guy</a></em> is already a bone-crackingly difficult <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a>, but he has one attack that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">(even by ''IWBTG'' standards)</a> seems programmed to screw you over. He shoots a single, homing Delicious Fruit at you. It's too slow to accidentally fly off-screen, hangs around long enough that you're gonna have to dodge it, and if he follows up with his fireball attack (which floods the floor with, well, fire), or those purple things are flying around, you're screwed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em>
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaOrderOfEcclesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaOrderOfEcclesia">Castlevania: Order of Ecclessia</a></em>, Dracula throws long streams of bats that bypass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility">Mercy Invincibility</a> and will shred your HP down to nothing in seconds if you get caught off guard. If you can avoid that, then it'll be the bloody soul steals out of nowhere, which do a lot to you and give him a bit more health back. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaPortraitOfRuin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaPortraitOfRuin">Portrait of Ruin</a></em>'s bosses normally have a single attack that is much more difficult to work against than the others too.
</li><li> Being the hardest of all old-school <em>Castlevania</em> games, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaIIIDraculasCurse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaIIIDraculasCurse">Dracula's Curse</a></em> gives Dracula's first form (of <em>three</em>) a fire spell that summons two spires on each side of your character and a larger spire directly targeting you, in which you have barely a microsecond to avoid. Sometimes the side-spires will spawn directly next to you, in which case you are <em><strong>fucked</strong></em> (<a class="urllink" href="http://cinemassacre.com/2009/10/21/castlevania-part-2/">see for yourself<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAngryVideoGameNerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAngryVideoGameNerd">The Angry Video Game Nerd</a>'s review). Note the flame pillars will appear closer to you based on the distance between you and Dracula. So it could be very well a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait">Schmuck Bait</a>.
</li><li> Death is the series' go-to guy for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a> fights, so it stands to reason that he'll usually have one of these in his arsenal. Aside from the constantly spawning mini-scythes, the move that really takes the cake are the giant skulls in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaDawnOfSorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaDawnOfSorrow">Dawn of Sorrow</a></em>, which deal insane amounts of damage, take up most of the screen, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KaizoTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KaizoTrap">are the only projectiles in the game that don't disappear when Death is beaten.</a>
</li><li> Death also has one in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaAriaOfSorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaAriaOfSorrow">Aria of Sorrow</a></em>, where he rolls his scythe along the floor, walls and ceiling at high speeds. It too deals huge amounts of damage, and depending on where the player is standing in the room, it's anywhere from easy to nigh-impossible to dodge.
</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okamiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okamiden">&#332;kamiden</a></em>, Akuro's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> attack. If it hits, not only does it deal out massive damage, but Akuro himself will be healed. The fact that it takes a while to charge isn't particularly comforting, as Akuro's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantHandsOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantHandsOfDoom">Giant Hands of Doom</a> can easily grab you and make you a sitting duck for the attack.

</li><li> Vergil's Helm Breaker in the last mission, specially after he says <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed">"you're going down"</a>. The move consists of him teleporting above you and striking you with his sword four to five times in a row, each from a lower height than the last. He may repeat this 2 or 3 times and since he is with his Devil Trigger on he will be recovering health the whole time.
</li><li> During the final fight, Vergil has a combo that consists of two swings, a upward swing that launches you in the air (and also hits you if you are above him), he then teleports above you, does a Helmet Breaker and finishes with a Stinger. If you are hit by any of his attacks past the very first swing, it's practically impossible to escape from the combo as well. The last two attacks hurt really bad, even on Normal and on higher difficulties can take a quarter of a fully upgraded health bar. He also loves to spam it, so you better learn to avoid it or DIE. He also has the abillity to project purple orbs to damage you, its fairly easy to dodge it in the first and second battle but on the third it becomes almost luck-based.

Basically, it's a leaded cluster of fireballs, followed by a fast fireball. Only problem is, each fireball hits a random spot, and there's no guarantee that you'll survive it. It may have a pattern, but since poor Frogger is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a>, one hit sends him to the first phase.

The only way to prevent this is to quickly swim and jump out of the water back to the platform before he attacks you. However, managing this jump can be really tricky because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameraScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameraScrew">you can't see the platform decently from underwater</a> and the slightest mistake in aiming will cause you to either land back into the water or crashing against the platform and make you stop in your tracks.

The ultimate combo is: moving its resting tentacles (to make Link's capture of the thorns to hurt it more difficult) while it shoots three series of goo drops, attacking with its left upper tentacle, then with the right one, and finally with both.

He can and <em>will</em> hit you with attacks that are almost impossible to dodge, and if he summons his giant copy images, well, best to take cover (but there <em>isn't</em> any!).
</li><li> Yammy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Soul Carnival 2</a></em> has four such attacks:
<ul><li> 1: His support attack, which sucks you in and deals continuous damage
</li><li> 2: His soul-sucking attack, which does the same thing, drains SP and deals damage faster
</li><li> 3: Shooting laser bullets from his fists, which can't be dodged unless you're behind him and can't be broken out of except with a support, unlike the other two attacks. He can shoot up to eight at a time, and it can take off over 50% of your health if you aren't buffed up with defense-boosting accessories and/or Soul Pieces.
</li><li> 4: His Burning Attack, which freezes time and deals over 3,000 damage. If he does this after the laser bullets, you die.
</li><li> Every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook">Giant Mook</a> in the game has at least one, whether it's the Doom Gigants' punching attack that can deal <em>over 10,000</em> damage and send you flying a good distance back, the gigantic Shinigami with a nigh-unavoidable axe attack that hurts like hell, or the turtle Hollows with a splash attack that throws you up into the air.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KoeiTecmo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KoeiTecmo">Koei</a> has quite a few across its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors">three</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiWarriors">signature</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarriorsOrochi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarriorsOrochi">series</a>, most of them handed out by high level characters or officers possessed of a situational super-buff.
<ul><li> Lu Bu, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">at all</a>. His moveset is insanely powerful in just about every game he's been in since 3, but it's the throw from <em>Dynasty Warriors 4</em> that really takes the cake. An unblockable multi hit throw with several officer and infantry mulching swings to tack on damage, followed by an overhead blow that occasionally sends players rocketing across the map, and more often sends their lifeless corpse into the next county, yet when you use it, its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Too slow</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">The damage is too low</a>. This move was taken out in 5...to be replaced with a faster, zero-telegraphing fire element dash that breaks block.
</li><li> Pang Tong's Musou, in 4 and 5. This often involves him standing in one place and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TornadoMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TornadoMove">doing a lot of tornado air bursts around him</a>, which often means he'll tack on at least three and often six good hits, and once again blow people off into the distance.
</li><li> Gan Ning's Musou, 3 through 5. This attack is powerful, comes out fast, and sends Gan Ning racing across the battlefield at ludicrous speed. If he doesn't actually knock the player character down with the attack, the glancing blow that hits still takes off a good chunk of life, and leaves said character in a stunned state.
</li><li> Zhang Jiao's...anything involving his fire element, but his fire based sweeping attack and Musou are fairly obnoxious due to increased damage and leaving players in a 'burned' state for a couple of annoying, vulnerable seconds.
</li><li> Dong Zhuo&#146;s Musou in 2. This entry had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic">Scrappy Mechanic</a> where when an enemy officer is knocked down, they get power-ups or healing. Dong Zhuo&#146;s Musou ended with a belly flop, that the game counted as him being knocked down, so he could effectively use it to get these power-up and healing effects at will.
</li><li> Saika Magoichi's rifle blasts, especially his Musou in <em>Samurai Warriors 1</em>, which was unblockable for most characters (as 'bullet block' was a rather rare skill). Only his slow attack speed kept him from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> status.
</li><li> Ishikawa Goemon's spinning attack with his mace goes on forever, and it's just fast enough that each hit juggles. Thankfully, he doesn't appear too often in normal gameplay.
</li><li> The same can't be said for Maeda Keiji, who gets a block breaking area of effect ground pound <em>and</em> a brutal multi-hit Musou attack, and happens to turn up in quite a few story modes. He also shows up on his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolHorse">Cool Horse</a> Matsukaze most of the time, so there's no running from him.
</li><li> Orochi's moveset, notable his Jumping Fireball that breaks guard, Fire Elemental, and juggles, and anything with relation with Dark Explosion(Air Charge and Charge attack) which is just as broken when you use it yourself, justified as he is the end boss to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassivelyMultiplayerCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassivelyMultiplayerCrossover">Massively Multiplayer Crossover</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedI">Assassin's Creed I</a></em>: Enemy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack">Counter Attacks</a> are impossible to predict and a free hit for the one responsible.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CustomRobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CustomRobo">Custom Robo</a></em> has the Waning Arc and Waxing Arc guns.

Very late in the game is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualBoss">Dual Boss</a> battle that utilizes both of these guns, in a stage with shifting terrain.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bomberman64TheSecondAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bomberman64TheSecondAttack">Bomberman 64: The Second Attack!</a></em>, one of the two possible final bosses (depending on the outcome of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss">Mini-Boss</a> battle earlier in the level) has an attack that essentially blankets the entire battlefield in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam">barrage of laser beams.</a> They come too fast and too rapidly to anticipate and your character moves too slowly to reliably dodge them, meaning you <em>will</em> get hit if you try to do anything. How do you avoid getting hit, then? Against all your gaming intuition you've built up over the years, you will be able to almost always get away scot-free... <em>by standing still.</em>
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SenranKagura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SenranKagura">Senran Kagura</a> Burst</em> Hanzo storyline's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Daid&#333;ji</span>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Sabata's</a> homing spin attack in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Boktai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Boktai">Boktai</a></em>. It's unblockable, unstoppable, and lasts for a <em>really</em> long time. Since Sabata's invincible while using it, the battle just sort of stops while you keep running around praying he doesn't corner you and drain about 3/4 of your health. The worst part of it is it breaks up what is otherwise a <em>really</em> cool idea for a fight: a cat and mouse battle in the dark with an opponent who you would otherwise stand no chance of beating.
</li><li> Hibari in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiverCityGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiverCityGirls">River City Girls</a></em> has an attack she'll start using in her second phase where a needle will trace around the arena multiple times, leaving a trail that will explode when it finishes. Not only are all of Hibari's needles unblockable, but if this one hits you, it'll deal about 80% of your health in damage, the needle itself is impossible to tell where it's going to come from and can easily spawn beneath you (this boss fight is fought on a 2D plane, the only room in the game that is) for an almost-one hit KO. On top of this, Hibari spawns a pair of floating Metroid-looking pin cushions who lazily drift down to you (four of them in the third stage), forcing you to keep an eye on them and the needle at the same time. She starts to use it more frequently during the third stage of her fight.
</li><li> The remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LaMulana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LaMulana">La-Mulana</a></em> has the boss of the Dimensional Corridor, Tiamat, and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> attack. There are three ways to avoid it, or else you're going to lose over half your HP in one go. You can cling to the side of the upper wall and run under the beam, you can try your best to jump over Tiamat, or you can abuse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility">Mercy Invincibility</a> with the caltrops, which also damage Lemeza. Special mention also goes to Bahamut who, while not that hard, will frequently wait in the background while it shoots fireballs. It can't be hit during those cycles, leading to many a player groaning, "Not the cheese-balls <em>again!</em>"

If this thing deals damage to you, you lose your next draw - and if you have no monsters to defend yourself with, there is nothing stopping the opponent from constantly using Yata to lock you out of playing the game. Making matters worse is that Yata also returns to the owner's hand at the end of the turn, making it very hard to destroy since it simply isn't there during your turn. It bears the distinction of being the only monster in the game that's been banned for the <em>entire history</em> of the Forbidden List, ever since it was possible for Konami to ban cards from the game.

Independent Nightingale is still playable, but Starving Venom<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3vtyw');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3vtyw" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3vtyw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">only in the TCG</span> and Neptune were both banned shortly after this combo was figured out.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em>:
<ul><li> "Off Waves", Tabuu's instant-kill red ring attack from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl">Brawl</a></em>. It hits thrice in a row, but once is more than enough if your dodge timing is the tiniest bit off. And that's after it was <em>weakened</em> by Sonic smashing the wings he extends to perform it. In a cutscene beforehand, he was able to OHKO most of the cast at once. To make matters worse, in Boss Battles on Intense if you slip up once on this attack it can send you back to fight all of the other 9 bosses again.
</li><li> The Off Waves are repeated in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate">Ultimate</a></em> in World of Light, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">during the final battle with Galeem</span>, with his attack Lens Flare. Individually the shockwaves are easy to avoid, but as there are two simultaneous shockwaves (4 in Hard Mode) from different points you usually dodge one only to run right into the other. Although unlike Tabuu, this isn't insta-kill if your damage is low enough. Unlike Off-Waves, however, the move lacks consistency, which makes it much harder to read where the other waves will strike. It becomes extremely infuriating on Hard when you have to deal with 4 waves right after puppet fighters are summoned.
</li><li> Out of every Final Smash in <em>Brawl</em>, it's generally agreed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic's</a> Final Smash, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenSuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenSuperMode">Super Sonic</a>, is the best. The developers intended for it to be hard to control, but even a little practice mitigates that disadvantage. In practice, Sonic is invincible, can't be KOed, and deals damage to whatever he touches. Couple that with some truly insane speed, and Super Sonic is an attack that's all but impossible to avoid. It got nerfed in the fourth game, but it still remains a way to rack up a ton of damage. <em>Ultimate</em> then nerfed it further, as Super Sonic is no longer controlled by the player during the Final Smash.
</li><li> Master Hand and Crazy Hand have their hand drill attack which is difficult to avoid and capable of dealing up to 90% damage in <em>Brawl</em>. As well, Master Hand's finger walk was improved in <em>Brawl</em> to have almost no starting lag and move quickly. Woe betide the player that happens to be right next to Master Hand when the attack executes.
</li><li> Quite a few characters have what could be described as Skill Gate Attacks as well. Meta Knight's Tornado and Shuttle Loop, Snake's up tilt, Diddy Kong's bananas, Falco's lasers... all are counterable if you know what you're doing, but they're still quite powerful.
</li><li> Pit's Angel Ring reflects projectiles, tends to draw enemies inward rather than push them back, and has a massive range which sucks in even opponents melee attacking from behind. Worse, it can continue indefinitely. Very few attacks can put a stop to a player spamming Angel Ring. Not helping matters is Pit constantly yelling as he does the move.
</li><li> Good news: Angel Ring was replaced in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU">the fourth game</a>! Bad news: It was replaced by Upperdash Arm (and Dark Pit's Electroshock Arm), which is arguably just as bad. Although very telegraphed and easy to counter/dodge, it's an attack that comes out fast, deals heavy damage, reflects projectiles, <em>and</em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToFlinching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToFlinching">super armor</a> to top it off.
</li><li> Pikachu's Down-B, Thunder, can be dread-inducing if you haven't mastered air dodging (or you're playing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros64">64</a></em>, where you <em>can't</em> air dodge). It does a good deal of damage and knockback, covers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAir">considerable vertical space</a>, and unlike most projectiles, the hitbox starts a good distance <em>away</em> from Pikachu and travels inwards, so it'll hit you even faster if you're already in the air, often sending you just far enough off-screen for an instant KO.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl">The Subspace Emissary</a>, Meta Ridley has an attack where he drops onto the Falcon Flyer, the <em>only</em> solid ground you have while fighting him. It's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit K.O.</a> if you don't have the timing required to dodge it.
</li><li> In the fourth game, Little Mac's KO Uppercut, although requires to charge his Power Meter completely to use, comes out extremely fast and can K.O. opponents at low percentages. This often causes 1-on-1 For Glory matches to get steamrolled sometimes, where Little Mac KOs an opponent normally for the first stock then KO Uppercuts them at around 40% damage for another KO. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szd9f7i1Qo8">Oh, and God help you if you're playing as Wario.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> Little Mac's Slip Counter (Down B), Jolt Haymaker (Side B) and ALL 3 of his Smash Attacks can be this sometimes as they hit very hard and are really fast. Slip Counter is one of the more threatening counter move in the game. Jolt Haymaker is a fast and powerful approach move that can counter projectile attackers (good thing that a lot of inexperienced players will Spam it enough that they will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">throw themselves off the stage in a helpless state sometimes right at the start of a match or multiple times</a>). And his Smash Attacks have Super Armor, and are just as fast and deadly, oh there are 3 variations of his Forward Smash.
</li><li> Lethiniums in Smash Run <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and Master Fortress</span> have only one attack, but it's a doozy. Their one attack is a very long-ranged laser beam that pierces through terrain and stunlocks fighters while the attack deals lots of damage. It doesn't help that Lethiniums tend to spawn far away in hard-to-reach spots, especially in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Master Fortress</span>.
</li><li> Master Hand has a move only in <em>3DS/Wii U</em> where it deals cards onto the ground, which then rise to the upper blast line, knocking out any player standing on them. Getting knocked onto one, or simply not being aware that you're standing on one, can cost you a very quick stock if you don't recover quickly enough. The worst thing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIRoulette">A.I. Roulette</a> can decide to do at this point is to have Crazy Hand grab you and throw you down, because this has the potential to <em>bury</em> you into a card. This attack was removed in <em>Ultimate</em>.
</li><li> In <em>Ultimate</em>, Galeem's Laser Net attack fills the screen with harmless lines that indicate where powerful beams will fire about a second later. While the attack is well-telegraphed, the lasers themselves are in random positions and are unshieldable. On higher difficulties and after he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed">Turns Red</a>, the laser count becomes more dense. Avoiding this attack comes down to either <em>very</em> precise dodging at the moment the lasers will hit or making a mad dash to a gap wide enough to avoid taking damage.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut">Punch-Out!!</a></em>:
<ul><li> Mike Tyson/Mr. Dream in the NES game has an uppercut that is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">one-hit knockdown</a>. For the first ninety seconds of the match, he uses it exclusively, so if you're not good at dodging it, you are completely screwed. On the other hand, if you manage to dodge every single one, he'll never use it again (instead substituting an uppercut that looks the same but doesn't knock you down except on rare occasions).
</li><li> Several boxers have at least one special attack that can be difficult to dodge or counter at first, such as Bald Bull's Bull Charge (also an instant-knockdown attack), Super Macho Man's Super Spin Punch attack (which is another instant-knockdown attack), Mr. Sandman's Dreamland Express, or King Hippo's Twin Smash Combo (which he only does in Title Defense in the Wii version).
</li><li> The Bruiser Brothers in the SNES game have a dangerous attack that paralyzes one of Mac's boxers, preventing him from attacking with that arm during a brief time. Nick Bruiser also has a jump attack that not only takes good reflexes to dodge, but also can knock down the player instantly if it's not dodged.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken">Tekken</a></em>:
<ul><li> Devil's/Angels laser beam in <em>2</em>, as well as Jinpachi's fireball attack in the fifth game. Both can be dodged if you can see it coming, though; Jinpachi's fireball can even be low parried.
</li><li> Jinpachi's "stun palm." He creates a wave that stuns the character for a minimum of 3 seconds. It has priority over every single other action in the game, coming out as fast as a jab. If you're jumping or even just lying on the floor after a knockdown, it will reset you into a standing stunned position. It can only be blocked low with proper timing. Simply put, it makes any match against him purely luck-based, as you can only win if he takes pity on you and decides not to use it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIRoulette">If you're unlucky enough</a>, the aforementioned fireball will follow said stun <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForMassiveDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForMassiveDamage">For Massive Damage</a> (and, potentially, the end of the round).
</li><li> Unknown in <em>Tekken Tag Tournament 2</em> has the Mizuchi Claw move. It involves her summoning a portal from the ground, which traps you in place and causes a large hand to appear from the ground and splat you, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwitchOutMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwitchOutMove">forcing you out of the arena</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne">with a pixel of your health</a> and your partner in. On Solo characters, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixedDamageAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixedDamageAttack">it shaves off 50% health</a>; this can be much worse depending on your skill level because she has an inclination to use this move over and over, which means certain death if you can't sidestep. That's not even taking into account her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss">batshit A.I. and plethora of other cheap moves</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear">Guilty Gear</a></em>:
<ul><li> I-No's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">Megalomania</a> in <em>XX</em> and its follow-ups. If any part of it hits, the whole thing hits. It comes in three patterns, and she can freely Force Roman Cancel between them to throw you off.
</li><li> However, even Megalomania (which was originally a boss-only move but was eventually made playable due to being fairly easy to dodge with the right timing) must bow to Boss-Dizzy's Wings of Light. Like Megalomania, Wings of Light consume the burst gauge instead of the Overdrive gauge, making it available from the start. The difference? Wings of Light has three different effects depending on the distance between you and Dizzy. If you are on the opposite side of the screen (max distance) a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PillarOfLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PillarOfLight">Pillar of Light</a> falls on you, either dealing 3/4th of your health if unblocked, or 1/4th if blocked with Barrier. The second, if you are at an average distance, consist of a giant laser beam which turns around on the screen with Dizzy at its center. Despite appearance, it is <em>just</em> fast enough to be completely undodgeable, and it is either an instant-kill (if unblocked) or deals roughly 1/3-1/2 of your health if perfect blocked. The final effect, if you are close to Dizzy (like, say, you were attacking her when it started, or she dashed into you to put you into a corner), you die. Instantly.
</li><li> Also, <em>Accent Core</em> gives us Boss Order Sol's Flame Distortion. It's basically Sol's Dragon Install except on this one the boosts are so humongous that he can close in from full screen in no time to counter your moves, and he also has infinite charge gauge, as well as auto-tension gain. His moves become so fast and strong that he can take off over 70% of your life in a single attack, because he's fond of his supers' invincibility frames. If he goes for Dragon Install: Sakkai (which he can easily combo into), expect it to kill you.
</li><li> In the first game, Justice was very, <em>very</em> bad about this, all because of two moves. The first, Imperial Ray, is a fast-moving laser beam that sweeps across the screen in a nearly 270&ordm; arc&mdash;making it hard to avoid in addition to its high damage. Unlike later games, where it became an Overdrive, Imperial Ray was <em>a special move</em> that could be used at Justice's leisure. Then there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Gamma Ray</a>. Not only does the attack lack most of the wind-up and heavy Tension Gauge consumption associated with the Overdrive from <em>X</em> onward, <em>GG1</em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a> means that Justice is free to spam it once her health hits the halfway mark or lower. These traits, combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss">her superior power and mobility</a>, make Justice an absolute nightmare to face.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em>:
<ul><li> Three words: Shun Goku Satsu.
<ul><li> Note must go to Shin Akuma's version of the SGS in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV">Super Street Fighter IV</a></em>, particularly its upgraded Wrath of the Raging Demon Ultra. It's a zero-frame grab (i.e. if you're right next to Akuma, you're a goner) which comes out incredibly fast compared to past incarnations and the playable Akuma's version, covers the entire screen, and uses the Ashura Senku for the slide itself, allowing Akuma to <em>phase through</em> moves that would normally cancel the SGS. It also has high priority over nearly everything, including other Ultras&mdash;except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Dan Hibiki's Shisshou Buraiken (Ultra 1)</a> and that's ONLY on the first few frames.
</li></ul></li><li> Final Bison from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha">Street Fighter Alpha</a> 3</em> has a super fast, extremely damaging variant of his usual Psycho Crusher called Final Psycho Crusher. Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">blocking it</a> will shave off a sizable portion of your healthbar, meaning you best bet (if applicable and you're daring enough) is to either a) use the invincibility frames of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shoryuken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shoryuken">DP</a> to pass through it, b) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallJump">Wall Jump</a> over it, or c) teleport/phase through. And unlike the regular Psycho Crusher, the Final Psycho Crusher has no hurtbox, so there's no way to counter it once it's active.
<ul><li> Luckily, there are two tell-tale signs that he's about to use the FPC (in the PS1 port, at least): Once his meter is filled, if he either teleports to one side of the screen or uses his diving attack out of the blue, it's coming next, no questions asked.
</li></ul></li><li> For a while the <em>Street Fighter</em> series was in love with these. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIII">Street Fighter III</a></em>, Gill, has his Seraphic Wing Super Art in <em>3rd Strike</em>. First of all, it's a fullscreen attack. You can interrupt it, but then the meter for using the move isn't consumed, meaning that he can just do it again. And if you <em>don't</em> interrupt it? Say goodbye to around a <em>quarter</em> of your health bar &mdash; and that's if you're <em>blocking</em>. Think you can just parry it? No can do. Not as in it's super hard to, but you <em>literally cannot parry it</em>.
<ul><li> Special mention goes to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealThyself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealThyself">Resurrection</a> technique, even if it's more a passive ability. Take Gill out when he has a full stock, and he'll <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">resurrect</a>, recovering all his health in the process. You <em>can</em> interrupt it, but you are actively pushed away during this, making it incredibly difficult. Not only that, but he cannot be hit at the start of the move, meaning he <em>will</em> recover at least a small amount of health, which can mean the difference between victory and defeat. Thankfully, this comes at the cost of preventing Gill's stock from replenishing for the rest of the round, which not only means that he can't use Resurrection again, he can't use Seraphic Wing or Meteor Strike (which is a pain in the ass itself) either.
</li></ul></li><li> The Hadoken from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII">Street Fighter II</a></em> was close. On harder difficulties, Ryu would happily fire a constant stream to chip you to death, and if you time the jumps poorly, he'd take you out of the air with a Shoryuken when you got close enough.
</li><li> Balrog from <em>Street Fighter II</em> had two of these in his dashing punches. If he spammed them for long enough he could kill you through block damage alone with you having no defense unless you were playing as Ryu or Ken and your dragon punch timing was impeccable.
</li><li> Zangief's Siberian Blizzard Ultra in <em>SSFIV</em>. Like Akuma above, the move out-prioritizes just about anything besides another Siberian Blizzard.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters">The King of Fighters</a></em>' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss">bosses</a> all have at least one of these. Rugal has Genocide Cutter and Gigantic Pressure, Goenitz has his spammable Yonokaze projectile, and Orochi has his screen-filling Marukare super.
<ul><li> Magaki in <em>XI</em> gives us his fireballs. At times they fill the screen, and the blue ones are one-third of your life if they hit. Apparently someone confused <em>The King of Fighters</em> with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">Bullet Hell</a>.
</li><li> Surely we can't just leave Rugal's Genocide Cutter as a passing mention. The move, in <em>'94</em> anyway, has ABSOLUTE INFINITE PRIORITY and does the highest damage of any move in the game. God help you if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">Rugal has a full bar of meter</a>. And on the subject of this series, Igniz's qcf+P whip attack is an infinite. It can be done eternally as needed to empty your lifebar, and what's worse is he can also do it to set up for Brutal God Project, his very fast instant kill (and the epitome of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">"overkill"</a>: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack">SDM</a> is <em>a super inside of <strong>another</strong> super</em>). In fact, he can do this without setting it up and you probably won't be fast enough to block it.
</li><li> Krizalid, the final boss of <em>'99</em> and essentially the "Rugal" of the NESTS Chronicles, has Typhoon Rage, which might possibly be in a league of its own. Not only does the damn thing have a large hitbox, the attack, much like Genocide Cutter, has priority over virtually <em>everything</em>, does ridiculous damage even on block, can juggle easily, and fills up Krizalid's meter absurdly fast (doubly so if you decide to guard against it). It's telling that, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamMatchGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamMatchGame">2002</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Unlimited Match</a></em>, Typhoon Rage makes Krizalid a bigger threat than every other boss in the game&mdash;<em>in a game filled to the brim with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss">SNK Bosses</a>, <strong>including Omega Rugal and Igniz</strong></em>&mdash;barring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposelyOverpowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposelyOverpowered">Nightmare Geese</a>. That's not even getting into his bag of other dirty tricks. One move alone, and he's already the second most broken character in the game.
</li></ul></li><li> Geese Howard's counterthrow in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury">Fatal Fury</a></em>. If you try to hit him with a direct attack, he can throw you. This includes jumping too close to him. There's also his Raging Storm in later games, which is often used <em>the first frame</em> of your forward jump.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries">Soul Series</a></em>:

If you try to cancel this attack, it just becomes stronger and unavoidable. It's also far bigger than Nightmare's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack">full strength version</a>, to the point that it is possible for Night Terror to stand in the middle of the stage you fight him on, use Soul Wave, and <em>Ring Out an opponent standing at the far edge of the arena</em>. Then there's his move where he flies up into the air and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams">fires barely avoidable lasers at you</a>. If he uses his "earthquake" move before that, you're screwed. It'd probably be more accurate to say that nearly every attack of his is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack">That One Attack</a>; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss">he's that overpowered</a>.

It allows the enemy to randomly get Guard Impacts (thereby interrupting your attack and making you vulnerable to a counterattack), even if they do nothing that would merit one. At S-Rank, it happens <em>a lot</em>. Impact Edge hurts you when you get Impacted, and Impact Heal restores health on a successful Guard Impact. Combine them for maximum frustration. It's also worth noting that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">only the computer can have S-Ranked abilities</a>.
</li><li> Nightmare's Critical Edge is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack">That One Attack</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulcaliburV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulcaliburV">Soulcalibur V</a></em>. Unlike many of the Critical Edge attacks, it can outright counter an incoming move instead of interrupting it, so you're going to be eating it unless you were blocking before he released it. Also, unlike most Critical Edge moves, which tend to do 25% or so of the health bar, Nightmare can devour <em>75% of your health</em> with this one attack and go on to use his multiple options for punishing downed characters. However, Dark Reconquista only deals that obscene an amount of damage <em>if</em> the player lets Nightmare remain idle while gathering power (which takes about a full second's worth of time) instead of activating the move's built-in Guard Impact (which can't be triggered by throws or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnblockableAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnblockableAttack">unblockables</a>). If it's a counter and/or a Clean Hit, the Critical Edge stings more on top of that. Potentially, the move can beat out even Algol's alternate CE that requires <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">both bars of meter</a> for the title of strongest attack in the game. Triggering the move off of the counter (usually) does significantly less. One's knowledge of how to dissect Nightmare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">makes all the difference in how effective the attack is</a>.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Elysium</span>'s Critical Edge as well. It's a machine gun that fires invisible bullets. And if it hits you while you're on the floor, it causes you to levitate so you can be hit by their other attacks easier.

The damage isn't that insane &mdash; the problem is that he <em>will</em> use it on you the <em>first frame</em> you are open, and it knocks you flying into the air, totally disrupting your combo and setting him up for one. He can, and will, even pick you off with it between your attacks.

Hayate's &mdash; and by extension <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">Material-D's</a> &mdash; basic attack is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam">spammable energy-ball thing</a> that, once you're in range, can lock down the enemy until you run out of mana.

<ul><li> One of the biggest ones is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">Phoenix's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">"Dark Phoenix"</a> mode, which restores her to full health with a buttload of stronger, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam">projectile-launching</a> attacks and a weakness (her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">constantly-degenerating health bar</a>) that can be compensated for with relative ease. It got to the point where despite having sufficiently less health than the rest of the cast that any standard combo would likely finish her, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Ultimate</a></em> had to knock <em>even more</em> health off her until she had about a third the health of the average cast member and any given Hyper Combo would likely prove fatal, because she simply wasn't dying fast enough. The uptick is that it's a <em>Level 5</em> Super, so you'll know it's coming if your opponent never touches their Super meter (and if you can kill Phoenix before the meter reaches Level 5, you'll never see it).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Sentinel's</a> "Strong" regular attack is a plasma beam the length of the screen. The easiest projectile to use in the game, and therefore the most commonly spammed.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII">Akuma</a> is <em>made</em> of this. Most egregious is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurricaneKick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurricaneKick">Zankukyaku</a>, a ramped up version of Ryu's Tatsumaki Senpukyaku. Note that while both attacks hit multiple times, Akuma's does more damage, which along with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBall">Gohadoken</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shoryuken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shoryuken">Goshoryuken</a>, and the returning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier">Shun Goku Satsu</a>, combine to earn him the reputation as one of the most feared and hated opponents in the game.
</li><li> Galactus, pictured above, has two attacks that qualify.
<ul><li> The pictured attack above has him firing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickingLaserBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickingLaserBeams">Fricking Laser Beams</a> from his eyes and fingers, slowly spreading them out and up the screen. It is literally unavoidable unless you're playing a flying character (and then you gotta avoid when he looks up). It will kill your character if you get hit by it, or nearly kill you from full health if you're playing a tougher character like Thor. If you block it, you can expect about 3/4 of your health taken away. Instead of using the X-Factor to avoid damage altogether, the recommended way to survive is to spam Advanced Guard, which will only take a very small fraction of your life. You'll still take damage, but at least you can use it more than once.
</li><li> He also charges up his Planet Destroyer as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack">Desperation Attack</a>. It takes a long time to charge up, and you can flinch him out of it if you do enough damage while attacking, but if it goes off, it's a guaranteed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> to your current fighter. You don't want to have the rest of your team assisting on screen when it goes off.
</li></ul></li><li> No list of irritatingly potent attacks from <em>MvC3</em> is complete without Doctor Doom's Hidden Missiles assist. When called, Doom will fire missiles he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">likely put there some time ago</a>. The annoying part is that the missiles fire upwards, arc down, and then <em>home in on their target</em>. Oh, what's that, you just started a combo you spent months practicing? Nope, you got hit by a stray missile, then the rest hit you and your opponent has just got you in their own combo, your character is going down.
</li></ul></li><li> Gantenbain's warping kick in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a>: Heat The Soul 6</em>. He warps into melee range and kicks you in the face. This attack has very little warning and is extremely difficult to dodge. Some of Szayel's heavy attacks are similar; he spawns a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook">Giant Mook</a> to attack you, except those moves have even less warning, and one of them can hit twice.

Hope you've mastered homing attacks to dodge it. Worse, it also gives him nearly a full second of total invulnerability in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeLimitBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeLimitBoss">Time-Limit Boss</a> fight.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TatsunokoVsCapcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TatsunokoVsCapcom">Tatsunoko vs. Capcom</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami">Yami</a></span>, has an attack that he uses during his first form where he lets out a red forcefield. It breaks guards <em>and</em> steals a special meter from you, and it's damn near unavoidable if he's in the center of the screen.
</li><li> One cannot bring up Akuma or the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CapcomVs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CapcomVs">Vs.</a></em> series without mention of the sheer nightmare that is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove">Misogi</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CapcomVsSNK2MarkOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CapcomVsSNK2MarkOfTheMillennium">Capcom vs. SNK 2</a></em>. Available only to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalGeneration">that game's version of Shin Akuma</a> (fueled by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters">Orochi power</a>), Misogi is an instantaneous cross-up from above that <em>homes in on the player at absurd speeds</em>. If it connects (and it probably will), <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDFTNRD3rhU">the unlucky party<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">is as good as dead</a>. If they do manage to block, much like Final Bison's Final Psycho Crusher or Gill's Seraphic Wing, you're <em>still</em> screwed due to the litigious amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">chip damage</a> it deals. Worse still, the move can't be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIII">Parried</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GarouMarkOfTheWolves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GarouMarkOfTheWolves">Just Defended</a> in <em>CvS2</em>, and for its encore appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SNKVsCapcomSVCChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SNKVsCapcomSVCChaos">SVC Chaos</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnblockableAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnblockableAttack">it's unblockable</a></em> (because apparently the super's <em>other</em> properties weren't bad enough). You can avoid it with one of the scant few teleport specials or <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ghZxB3oLY">(attempt to) counter it if you're courageous,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> but if not, all you can do is cross your fingers and hope you timed your roll/dodge properly. Even worse, Shin Akuma is <em>still</em> considered the <strong>easier</strong> of the two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Bosses</a>. This is because the alternative is God Rugal (Rugal Bernstein after draining Akuma's power into himself). The Genocide Cutter is <em>even stronger now</em> and God Rugal additionally has the single most damaging Super Combo in the game, fittingly named "<strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">END</a></strong>."
</li><li> Dr. Eggman in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicBattle">Sonic Battle</a></em> has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Taking You with Me</a> type move that is used each time his health bar is depleted. When he says "It can't be!", get ready to lose a life because it is very hard to dodge &mdash; and impossible to block &mdash; the massive explosion that comes after that.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnderNightInBirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnderNightInBirth"> Under Night In-Birth</a></em>: The range, priority and summoning speed of Gordeau's scythe is the core of why he's universally considered the best character in the game, but Grim Reaper deserves special mention. It's a very fast, very safe attack with a massive hitbox that disrupts literally anything you were trying to do, and it leaves you wide open afterwards for his trademark combos. (To get an idea of the vulnerability: Grim Reaper &gt; Grim Reaper &gt; Grim Reaper is a true combo.) Gordeau returns in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueCrossTagBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueCrossTagBattle">BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle</a></em>, and guess what?

Its custom boss or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">miniboss</a> monsters have at least one. Here are several egregious examples:
<ul><li> The Annihilator's homing missiles deal heavy damage, and are really hard to dodge, even in wide-open spaces (especially painful if said areas lack cover).
</li><li> The winged goat demon Azazel's "stunned" state will make him shoot out ground-hugging fireballs that can rip through you, dealing incredible damage in a short amount of time. The fireballs are really fast as well.
</li><li> The Demolisher's BFG cannon can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">outright obliterate you</a> on a direct hit; however, he sometimes fires two shots, with the second one likely to finish you off; on top of that, the twin super gattling guns can shred you twice as fast if you don't hide.
</li><li> Hellsmith's three-way explosive fireballs may as well be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> on a direct hit, since each of said fireballs split into multiple explosions as well.
</li><li> Every single one of Moloch's attacks are brutal, especially the hell grenades (very tough to dodge in tight spaces and deal massive damge) and nail barrage (these blaze through the map and rip through you for pretty large damage, and they rebound too).
</li><li> Scourge's homing missiles can instantly kill you on a direct hit, and they're pretty fast to avoid as well. What's worse? He launches them in three sets of two. There's also that flamethrower attack of his that has a decent range but can quickly empty your health in seconds. Ouch!
</li><li> The Dark Cardinal's homing energy ball nova attack is really annoying considering the mini fireballs home in on you and the attack goes off every time he flinches.
</li><li> The Terminator's plasma grenade attack will total your health and armor on a direct hit, and it does severe damage if you're in the blast radius. It's a nightmare to dodge in tight spaces.
</li><li> The Pyro Demon's teleport explosion attack is not only extremely damaging (splash damage ahoy) and a huge pain in the ass to avoid, he tends to do it pretty frequently sometimes. Mitigated somewhat in that he sometimes does it anyway even if you're not on the same level he is <em>and</em> he can't get down or up from there.
</li><li> Thamuz's hard-to-avoid homing plasma ball can take you out instantly as well if it hits (that's without armor in this case); the ring of fire attack makes him invincible until he finishes the attack by sending the ground-hugging flames out (which only go straight, thankfully)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a></em>
<ul><li> The Charger or The Jockey from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2">Left 4 Dead 2</a></em> when on a level with ledges that kill you. A well placed charge from a charger can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">kill an ENTIRE TEAM</a>.
</li><li> Also, Smokers on a level with holes you go down but can't go back up. Three teammates drop down, and the fourth is snagged before they can follow.
<ul><li> Hunters and Jockeys are also the bane of the slow ponderous player in these situations too. Second chances are rarely given among survivor players and most players who don't "get with the programme" the first time around and fail to jump down the right hole at the same time as the rest of the team are often summarily booted from the game if they get pinned/snared and become unsaveable.
</li><li> Likewise for infected players, it is extremely difficult to pin/snare a survivor player and kill them before their buddies shoot you and rescue them (you are vulnerable to other players when pinning one and cannot move until your pinned target is dead). Therefore pinning/snaring a slow, clueless survivor player who didn't jump down the one-way hole at the same time as the rest of the survivor team is seen as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">Moment of Awesome</a> for the infected side and a benchmark by which to measure a player's skill as an infected.
</li></ul></li><li> Anything from the Tank. On Expert, both of his attacks will incapacitate you in one hit, and he's scarily accurate with the cement throw<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4achh');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4achh" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4achh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">If you are facing against an AI Tank, change directions at soon as he throws and you can usually dodge the rock throw</span>. On any other difficulty, one of his punches sends you flying, which can range from being a minor nuisance to sending you flying off a bridge/rooftop to your instant death, and the developers love putting instant death falls on finale levels, the only place where you're definitely running into a Tank. And you don't respawn during the finale event. Punching cars/debris counts too since it's another instant incap, regardless of difficulty.
</li><li> Any attack in the game that damages also causes flinching, the Common Infected will reduce your speed to nothing if three or more are hitting you at the same time.
</li><li> For anyone playing as the Special Infected, the Survivors' melee attack will stagger you long enough for them to move away and kill you, or they could kill you using just the melee attack if they're feeling sadistic, which most people are in Online Versus.
</li><li> It gets even worse for the Tank: if your Tank dosn't have access to cars or cover to get to the survivors, the survivors will simply shoot the Tank player from a distance. Each shot causes flinching which will slow the Tank; with all four survivors wielding machineguns in a wide open area without any cars to throw, the Tank usually dies in seconds when survivor teams do this.
</li><li> One attack from survivor players annoy the hell out of Tank players: Fire. If they hear a Tank appear, survivor players will use their molotovs as soon as the Tank player is in their sights or shoot nearby gas cans as a substitute. Once caught on fire, the Tank will keep taking damage until it dies, frustrating the infected team to no end. If there's any water nearby, then you're not as screwed.

<ul><li> The Degreaser + Axtinguisher combo. The Degreaser is a flamethrower that allows the user to switch weapons much faster, while the Axtinguisher always deals a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit">Critical Hit</a> if whatever it hits is on fire but deals reduced damage otherwise. Together, this means if you get in the range of a Pyro with this combination, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathRadius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathRadius">you're dead.</a> You will be lit on fire and struck with a 195-damage attack that will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> anything but a Heavy within less than one-and-a-half seconds. Some Pyros use the "Puff &amp; Sting" combination, where they use the compression blast feature to push you into a wall, disorienting you and preventing you from fighting back, and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One Hit Killing</a> you. Fortunately, the Love &amp; War Update changed the Axtinguisher so that attacks from the front only result in a mini-crit, not a normal crit. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note03jmp');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note03jmp" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note03jmp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Mini-crits deal 35% more damage than normal. Critical hits deal <em>200%</em> more damage. That's a big difference.</span> This means Pyros can't just shove you into a wall and kill you as quickly as before. If one sneaks up on you from behind and you don't notice, though, you're fair game: attacks from behind still result in crits.
</li><li> During the Halloween 2013 event, there were several "magic spells" that could be used. The most annoying was the Ball O' Bats. It's a thrown projectile that explodes, throwing whatever it hits into the air and causing bleed (damage over time). The blast radius for this projectile is deceptively large, and whoever gets hit goes <em>flying</em> straight up. If players were being chased, they could just use this, knock their assailant into the troposphere, and escape. It was also a very common spell to obtain. As such, it was a relief that the next year's Halloween event map didn't have them.
</li><li> The Spy's Red-Tape Recorder. It's a sapper that, instead of dealing damage, reverses the construction of the building it's attached to. This happens <em>very</em> quickly, meaning that it takes about 6 seconds of inattention for a building to be set back to level 1. It's horrible at actually <em>destroying</em> buildings (the initial building time is <em>much</em> longer than the upgrade time), but it's very good at wasting Engineers' efforts and time.

<ul><li> The first game has the Roid Rage Psycho's Grenades. The boss seems easy and it's child's play to snipe his overly large head. And then he throws a grenade that will completely destroy your health and shields if it hits, leaving you open for him to kill you. To make it worse, he has a spread mod, so every single grenade will spit up into 6.
</li><li> The Destroyer's shockwave attack. It's not very damaging, oh no. There are two issues: First, it pushes you out of cover, so it can get you with it's other attacks (Plus it's a pain to keep running back to cover) and two, prepare to throw your controller against the screen if you happen to be even remotely close to the edge when he uses it.
</li><li> Wilhelm in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2">the sequel</a> has one. When the fight begins, there's a train car in the area you find him...and he makes his entrance by coming out from underneath that train car and throwing it. If you're standing near it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">you die</a>. You don't go into Fight For Your Life, <em>you die</em>. Fortunately, this only happens once.
</li><li> A Christmas peril so terrible you'll feel nostalgic for your racist uncle and waiting four hours in line to buy presents, Tinder Snowflake's rush attack in the "How Marcus Saved Mercenary Day" DLC is devastating. All of his attacks are nasty due to high damage and accuracy, but the rush attack is much worse: he moves very quickly, hits very hard, and can do it up to four times in a row, and to make matters worse he's immune to all damage while doing it. There are areas where he can't hit you with it, such as the entrance, near the lift...but that's a very confined space, and he takes up most of the entrance, meaning you're easy prey for his devastating but short-ranged frost breath attack. At least the presents are good afterwards (a train with a huge quantity of items will turn up whenever Snowflake goes down). This attack becomes even worse when playing as the Commando, as deploying your sabre turret will cause Snowflake to immediately use it on your turret and instantly destroy it. Without the Mag-Lock upgrade to allow you to safely stick the turret on a wall out of reach, the Commando is stripped of his main source of damage output for the duration of this fight.

For <em>fifteen seconds</em>. In a game where the entire team can be killed in around 5 seconds of combat, that's a massive amount of time you're stuck just sitting there. This skill did get nerfed: Without a specific item it will no longer disable passive abilities. A specific item that was pretty good on Doom even if there aren't important passives to disable... until they nerfed it <em>again</em>. It still qualifies big time though.
</li><li> A decent chunk of heroes have extremely powerful area-of-effect ultimates with gigantic cooldowns, which are commonly referred to as "big teamfight ultimates". Some examples are Tidehunter's "Ravage", Sand King's "Epicenter" and Enigma's "Black Hole". If two or more heroes get caught in one of these, odds are you're going to lose the teamfight and should just minimise losses by running.

It is nearly impossible to dodge, because the timing for when he will slam his hands together after placing them is not the same every time he does it. The only way to tell when he's about to slam them together is that they show a little flash, which comes a fraction of a second before the slam.

The debris is very large and it falls very quickly, while the attack in question lasts for 20 seconds.

Oh, and they also completely ignore guarding and invincibility from things like Stone, Archer and Leaf, meaning that unless you've got ESP's teleport attack (which removes Kirby from the screen entirely), you have to dodge the attack, which is precise and hard to do. The worst part is that it comes after a 30+ minute gauntlet of souped-up versions of all the bosses in the game and you're at half-health <em>at best;</em> this attack coming out of nowhere and insta-killing you can lead to rage and a broken 3DS, and is still tricky even if you know it's coming.

While these attacks aren't That One Attack by themselves &mdash; they're easy to dodge and can be interrupted to daze the girl in question &mdash; it sure would suck if you had to endure all three at the same time. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Oh, wait &mdash; the rematch with all three in "Heroes in Another Dimension" pits you against exactly that at the halfway point. Even worse, the first time this combination is used, they're staggered so getting hit by one launches you right into the next one in succession, and you have a short window to dodge the next one in turn. Do <em>not</em> count on AI allies evading this attack in any capacity. And for the capper, you <strong>will</strong> have to endure this onslaught during the Soul Melter EX version of the Ultimate Choice. If you get hit by Flamberge's incendiary cannon during this gauntlet from Dark Star, kiss your run goodbye.</span>

Capcom acknowledged this by making this attack Zero's Level 3 Hyper Combo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom3">Marvel vs. Capcom 3</a></em>.

His variation of that attack inflicts instant death or close to it, and if you should leave him at low health for too long, he will back into a corner and fire that attack continuously until one of you is dead. Fun.

Like every boss with such a move, he telegraphs it, but that won't help you; the punch he throws is sudden, fast, its hitbox takes up over half the screen, and deals an <em>obscene</em> amount of damage. On Normal and Hard, if you've not bought enough life gauge upgrades, you dodge it or you lose a character. The attack is specifically designed to one-shot Ride Armour, which makes the fight much easier if you managed to maneuver it to his arena, as it allows you to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">continuously pummel him while taking zero damage</a>, until the Armour is inevitably destroyed.

However, there are two attacks that he modified; Avalanche Yeti's attack, which causes gigantic snowflakes that freeze you on contact to rain down, lasts a <em>lot</em> longer, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lumine</span> can still blast you with other attacks while it's in effect. And then Burn Rooster's attack, which engulfs the walls in flames, <em>never wears off</em>. After it hits the field, you can no longer wall-jump.

The attack is nigh-impossible to dodge (you have the best chance if Mega Man and Wily are on the extreme opposite ends of the screen, but it still requires perfect timing), does anywhere from a decent amount of damage to taking out huge chunks of the player's life bar (especially if they get frozen by the blue sphere and can't break free fast enough to escape from Wily's follow-up attack) and is used every time he teleports. You know it's terrible when "Just get hit by one of the yellow spheres because they do less damage" is a perfectly reasonable strategy.

<ul><li> Chronoforce has an attack where he swims into the background, shoots homing icicles at you, then <em>reverses time</em> to make them <em>unexplode</em> and fly back to him. If you didn't memorize where the icicles went you will get hit at least once as they rewind.
</li><li> Another attack of his shoots icicles in roughly a 90-degree arc, with holes in between each icicle. However, on Expert Mode, he shoots off an extra set that goes in between the shots of the first one, making it nigh-unavoidable. Also, because you're playing Expert Mode, Chronoforce will have a permanent Time Bomb active, so all his attacks move twice as fast as they normally would.
</li><li> Queenbee's giant laser beam attack also deserves mention. Unpredictable, nigh-impossible to dodge, and she <em>will</em> use it at least once.

<ul><li> First confrontation with Baron Praxis is rather nasty, but manageable until the third part. There, he starts shooting multiple fiery tornadoes at you at once that move in erratic patterns and are very hard to dodge due to how difficult is to predict their trajectory. Moreover each stage of this boss takes many shots to defeat, which leaves you open at this attack for the final third - it is not uncommon to get hit by another immediately after your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility">Mercy Invincibility</a> expires.

<ul><li> Drek is difficult boss even for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>, mainly because two of his attacks make him harder than needed:

The shots are big, fast and hard to dodge, so you must be moving constantly while he shoots them otherwise you'll meet the same fate as those two islands. The absence of strafing makes it all that harder.
</li><li> During the last section of the health bar, a green missiles start to swarm the arena constantly, while Drek himself is still attacking you and you're supposed to take care of that timer as well. Not easy to not take a hit, which you probably can't afford at this stage of fight.

The ones in <em>Sonic Rush</em> are very well-telegraphed, though: Probably the only hard one to see coming is the one where Eggman (or Nega) rams his giant robot's shoulder spikes into the stage at the end of said battle, mostly because you've never seen it before. The button-mashing on the Sonic vs. Blaze battle would be hard to see coming as well if it weren't for the mini-cutscene and the fact that one boss earlier used an easier version of the button-mashing gimmick.
</li><li> Silver's psychokinesis in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006">Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)</a></em>. He grabs Sonic/Shadow and slams them into a wall or tosses them into the sky. When the attack starts, it cannot be broken out of. If he slams you into a wall that is close by, or tosses you straight up, he WILL catch you with it again immediately before you can start moving again, ignoring mercy invincibility, and proceed to kill you, or, if you manage to repeatedly land on dropped rings, catch you in an infinite loop. And it can lead to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">Game-Breaking Bug</a> if you're in the wrong spot - if there are no buildings where he throws you, you just fly off into space and never land.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ElementalStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ElementalStory">Elemental Story</a></em>, these skills are very dangerous in the Battle Arena:
<ul><li> <em>Any</em> skills that leads other monsters to attack together, especially Arthur's. It guarantees to down at least one member if it activates. Some of them, such as Hel's and Sekmet's , allows <em>downed monsters</em> to join in as well.
</li><li> <em>Any</em> multi-hit skills. This is because they render revival abilities useless and any damage multipliers applies to each of them.
</li><li> <em>Any</em> skills which leaves poison pieces. Unless the party uses monsters with 0 poison damage ability, poison pieces inflict stacked damage when matched and will down monsters with ease, especially if more than one such piece is matched.
</li><li> Nut's 3rd skill attacks all enemies twice, which coupled with awakening ability of first attack power increase, will leave you vulnerable against other monsters if not an outright total party kill. It is so potent that even <em>wood</em> monsters, the element Nut is <em>weak</em> against, can at least down one member with it.
</li><li> Ultimate Artemis's 3rd skill is even worse: Despite being wood elemental, its firepower can down <em>entire team of fire monsters</em>, the element Artemis is <em>weak</em> against with ease.
</li><li> Athena's 3rd skill deals heavy damage on her target on top of putting powerful barriers on surviving monsters. Woe betide parties whose piece switch monsters got hit with it as it is one hit kill on such monsters.
</li><li> Ultimate Athena has the above skill delegated to 2nd skill with damage output reduced while getting another skill which attacks the entire party instead with attack power and defense increase intact, in theory that is. In practice, due to increased stats both skills are powered up.
</li><li> Alamis's 3rd skill weakens all enemy attacks. What makes it this trope is that it overrides attack boost effects instead of mutually cancelling them.

<ul><li> Though several items and weapons in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart">Mario Kart</a></em> series can be jarring and chaotic, both the Spiny Shell and the Thunder have gained notoriety for toughening the races for the players, especially the former for the first-place rider. It's for this same reason why they're considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic">Scrappy Mechanic</a>, though the introduction of the Super Horn in the eighth installment has the ability to nullify the former.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wipeout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wipeout">Wipeout</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Quake, a super-fast wave that can travel the length of any given circuit. And getting hit with it makes you lose control and slow to a crawl.
</li><li> EG-R's super weapon in <em>Fusion</em>, a set of drones that circle a car and fire constantly until either they run out of ammo or you die. Which one comes first depends entirely on whether or not you are at or close to full shield energy.
</li><li> In <em>Wipeout Pure</em>, the Disruption Bolt. It does no damage, but it causes one of many negative effects, ranging from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew">the camera shooting in and out</a> to your airbrakes being disabled. The one good thing about it is that it has a small chance of instead activating the autopilot.

Not only are they difficult to avoid, but two of them are ejected at the same time. Hitting them deals a significant chunk of damage and has you spin out in the process.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakAndDaxter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakAndDaxter">Jak X: Combat Racing</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game gives us the series' staple, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">Peacemaker</a>. Like the Blue Shell from <em>Mario Kart</em>, it locks flawlessly on the leading player and is guaranteed to destroy him/her unless (s)he happens to have a Red Eco shield. It is impossible to get rid of it by using any other red pickup (the standard way of dealing with the missiles), it cannot be outrun, and even if it is fired when you're on a split path or shortcut and somehow it gets ahead of you, <em>it just turns around and hits you anyway</em>. You can, since the targeting crosshair is specific to Peacemaker, slow down and hope someone gets ahead of you and gets destroyed by it anyway, but that isn't guaranteed to work, especially since its Dark Eco powered-up version strikes <em>everyone</em> ahead of the one who pulled the trigger.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">Supernova</a> destroys everyone in front of you and delays them for three or five seconds before respawning them.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Angband" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Angband">Angband</a></em>, Ancient Multi-Hued Dragons and Drolems, and more specifically their poison breath, are notorious for killing players who descend to 2500' without poison resistance. Players without it will take no less than 800 HP of damage from a single breath, which can come from off-screen.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaac">The Binding of Isaac</a></em>:
<ul><li> There are many attacks that are incredibly difficult to dodge, especially if you're playing as a slower character. However, one that stands out is the attack used by the Leapers. They hop around the room like their lesser cousins, Hoppers, until they leap so high they fly off the screen and crash down near your character, sending out a fast blood shot in each cardinal direction. This gets very deadly when there are multiple Leapers in a room. However, far more devastating is the version of the attack used by Peep, where twelve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">urine shots</a> are fired very quickly in a radial pattern, then eight more are fired right after.
</li><li> <em>Rebirth</em> has The Adversary, with a brimstone attack that, at medium to long range, will actively curve to hit you. It's not too hard to dodge this attack against a single Adversary by getting in close, but the final floors may feature two in the same room, making it nigh-impossible to avoid damage if you can't instantly destroy one. Another new boss, The Cage, possesses a leaping attack with completely random and fast moving shockwaves that will hit you if they feel like it.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CryingSuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CryingSuns">Crying Suns</a></em>, every chapter boss has a special ability which goes off at regular intervals. Some of these can royally screw you over:
<ul><li> Pope Zenon's Cryo-Wave freezes your active squadrons for a few seconds, leaving them at the mercy of his guns and squadrons (which get a damage bonus when attacking debuffed units). You can avoid this by ordering your squadrons back to your battleship, but they might not make it in time if they get bogged down in dogfights.
</li><li> Tetsuo's EMP Deluge hits your battleship with tremendous heat buildup. The resulting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubsystemDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubsystemDamage">Subsystem Damage</a> <em>will</em> cripple your battleship if you didn&#146;t invest a ton of Scrap into your Heat Capacitors, and may cause temporary system shutdowns even if you did.
</li><li> Admiral Okonkwo's Golden Veil makes his squadrons and battleship temporarily invincible. When this happens, all you can do is try to hold his forces at bay until the effect wears off.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FTLFasterThanLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FTLFasterThanLight">FTL: Faster Than Light</a></em>, boarding drones are one of the most dangerous things you can encounter. They bypass all shields except Zoltan Shields, never miss, and punch a hull breach into whatever room they enter - and that's all before they start attacking. They have as much health as a Rockman and an immunity to suffocation, so killing them is a major pain. And if you kill one while the enemy's drone control is online, they'll just fire another, which will punch another hole in your ship. Even if you can take the drone control offline, you still have to destroy the drone itself and repair the hull breach. The only good thing is that a Defense Drone can shoot them down, but they tend to fire so rapidly that they'll get by a drone fairly easily.
<ul><li> Missiles are already bad enough as they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack">already pierce all shields</a> except Zoltan Shields. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Rebel Flagship's</a> Triple Missile Launcher fires <em>three</em> in succession. At best, a defense drone of any make can take down two missiles, and while you can cloak to dodge them, this only works every other time due to the longer cloak recharge. These missiles are what usually start "damage cascades" - each missile in the salvo targets a different room on your ship, and they have decent fire and breach chances along with them.
</li><li> The Rebel Flagship's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Drone Swarm</a>. When it happens (and you do, thankfully, get warned well in advance), the Flagship launches a mixture of six anti-ship and beam drones in addition to the two already attacking your ship. If your shields drop for even a second, the beams will slice your ship to ribbons, and if your evasion or shields are already damaged or occupied, say, because your pilot is busy fighting off a boarding drone, your hull will get shredded.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NuclearThrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NuclearThrone">Nuclear Throne</a></em>:
<ul><li> Big Dog <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KaizoTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KaizoTrap">explodes in spectacular fashion when it dies</a>, which deals an immense amount of damage and may <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> you if you don't have the Boiling Veins mutation. It's a <em>much</em> larger explosion than you may expect, and if there are any cars in the area you were fighting it in, those also get blown up.
</li><li> Li'l Hunter also has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Taking You with Me</a> type attack; when he is defeated, his jetpack malfunctions and he goes rocketing in a random direction. Pray he isn't aiming towards you because the resulting explosion hurts as much as Big Dog's.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DarkestDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DarkestDungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a></em>':
<ul><li> "Arterial Pinch" of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantEnemyCrab" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantEnemyCrab">Uca</a> enemies. Deals minuscule damage but inflicts <em>heavy</em> bleeding. Unless you are ready to cure it immediately, it will drop the character to 0 HP in two to three turns, and probably outdo any healers you might have in damage per turn. And heaven help you if it hits the same character more than once before it wears off. Not helped <em>at all</em> by Ucas having high HP and a Protection rating. Made less scary if you always take the Plague Doctor to the Cove, who has a skill that cures bleeding for any character.
</li><li> "Treebranch Smackdown" of the giants. It's the attack they're actually least likely to use, despite always carrying a uprooted tree with them. You'll be thankful for that, because when they get around to swinging it, one hit will do so much damage that an average non-buffed non-tanky character will be instantly dropped to 0 HP. And stunned for good measure. And they may be already poisoned by another of the giant's attacks (which targets multiple characters), meaning they could die before you get a chance to do something about that. And <em>unlike</em> the Uca, nobody has an antidote to being hit in the face with a tree branch except praying for a critical heal.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> has one that he'll only use twice in the battle. Which is good, because it essentially amounts to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"One of your party dies, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSavingThrow">no</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysAccurateAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysAccurateAttack">questions</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnblockableAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnblockableAttack">asked</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice">You choose 'em</a>."</span>

<ul><li> The Balrog has two, but they're really two shades of the same attack: Pillar of Wrath and Scorching Inferno. Both of them hit every member of your party, and both will drain almost all of the AP your characters have.
</li><li> Stomp from the M&ucirc;makil. Hits everybody, and stuns them. Stand Fast makes it mostly worthless (it's still painful), but if it gets it off before Berethor gets a turn... Well, you're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">screwed.</a>
</li><li> The Final Boss, Sauron, has 2. Darkest Fear immobilizes one of your guys and deals damage over time, and Berethor's Immune to Fear Passive ability and Shield of Courage Leadership do not work to stop it, unlike regular Fear. Silence of Light also immobilizes your entire party's Spirit skills. It's a huge pain, since most of your best abilities are Spirit, and you need them to last long enough to kill him.
</li></ul></li><li> Despite being fairly easy overall, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em> has several examples.
<ul><li> <em>The Djinn screws</em>, which put the targeted character's Djinn into recovery mode and thus prevents them from being used for unleash attacks and summons. Dim Dragon Plus' Djinn Burp is too soon to be a threat to the player, but literally every other attack which tampers with the player's Djinn without their consent is a pain in the ass.
<ul><li> Djinn Blast puts all of a single character's Djinn into recovery mode, resetting one by one with each passing turn. The Chaos Chimera from <em>Dark Dawn</em> and the Doom Dragon from <em>Lost Age</em> use this.
</li><li> Djinn Storm is Djinn Blast aimed at the entire party. The Doom Dragon and Dullahan love this one.
</li><li> The Star Magician in <em>Dark Dawn</em> can summon a Ghoul Ball, which eats a single Djinni each turn it's out; any Djinn it eats stay in recovery mode until it is killed, and it can summon multiple. Have fun.
</li></ul></li><li> Cruel Ruin from <em>The Lost Age</em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Doom Dragon</a>. It works like your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic">Summon Magic</a> in that it deals more damage to targets with higher max HP, so no amount of level grinding will save you from it.
</li><li> Valukar has one that would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack">That One Attack</a> if it wasn't for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Artificial Stupidity</a>: he can use your summons against you, but tends to do so when you have only one or two djinn on standby, doing less damage than he would with his own spells. However, he can give you a nasty surprise if you depend on this overmuch.
</li><li> Almost <em>every attack</em> used by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Dullahan</a> counts as That One Attack. Dark Dawn might have been disappointingly easy, but Dullahan somehow got even harder.
<ul><li> It can use Charon, a summon-type attack that works identically to your version: high earth-elemental damage that has a chance to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> its targets.
</li><li> Formina Sage/Fulminous Edge is a physical attack that hits for almost three times its normal damage. Even tougher characters like Garet will have a hard time surviving this.
</li><li> True Collide is a spell that doesn't deal a whole lot of damage compared to the other two, but is still fairly dangerous, hits up to three characters, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain">will restore its health equal to the damage it inflicted.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunDarkDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunDarkDawn">Dark Dawn</a></em>, it can steal your summons and use them against you, forcing your Djinn into recovery mode as if you'd used the summons.
</li></ul></li><li> The Ancient Devil's Demon Sign <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">takes over one of your characters</a>. And they can use your djinn for summons, though they won't always do this. And since he targets the fastest party member with it, you're prevented from using Sveta unless you like suffering.
</li><li> The fangame <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TouhouLabyrinth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TouhouLabyrinth">Touhou Labyrinth</a></em> borrowed Djinn Storm, and it is every bit as annoying (Empties all party members' SP, including the SP of those in reserve).
</li><li> The Chaos Chimera has Retribution, a reasonably strong attack which hits the entire party. It also has a chance of causing instant death. Oh, and the Chaos Chimera always attacks three times in a row. Have fun.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">Cunning Blow</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MagiNation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MagiNation">Magi-Nation</a></em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile">Valkyrie Profile</a></em>, any enemy with the Great Magic spells will have it as its That One Attack, such as Akhetamen's Seraphic Law, Wraith's Gravity Blessing, Barbarossa's Calamity Blast, etc.
<ul><li> Almost every attack <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Bloodbane</a> has qualifies. He will often follow up a damaging claw swipe <em>("I'll crush you!")</em> with Feel My Flame, which deals huge damage to the entire party. Occasionally he will follow this with a magic spell like Sacred Javelin, most likely killing one of your Einherjar. And when taken down to below half HP, he will start spamming the Great Magic Gravity Blessing, which can cause a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">Total Party Kill</a>. Adding insult to injury, he will heal himself to full once his health dropped below 25%, better unleashed whatever you have to take him down quickly.
</li><li> Fenrir in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">A Ending</a> has Frost Bait, which it uses when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed">at low health</a> and deals huge damage with a chance of freezing anyone hit. A special item from the mid-game can stop it from freezing your party members, but it won't do much against the damage. The Fenrir clone in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Seraphic Gate</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Carnage Beast</a>, can use Frost Bait both at full health and low health. Encountering two Carnage Beasts and having them do two Frost Baits in a row is likely to result a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">Total Party Kill</a> unless you have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">the Guts/Auto-Item/Union Plume combo</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Loki</span>, has two: Extension Force, which deals a single devastating blow to each party member; and Dragon Orb, a unique Great Magic that is just as painful as the rest.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRabbit">Hamsters</a> in the Seraphic Gate have Furry One, which tramples the party under a wave of hamsters for ludicrous damage.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigimonWorld3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigimonWorld3">Digimon World 3</a></em>, even some normal attacks are that one attack. Mamemon's normal attack can freeze your Digimon, with a very high chance of blocking it from doing anything. Even better: it blocks you from healing your Digimon. Depending on your luck, you'll just mash X until your Digimon die.
<ul><li> Hi Andromon has Atomic Ray, which has a solid chance of causing death regardless of your defenses.
</li><li> Pharaohmon, the very first boss, has Necro Mist, a move that not only deals high damage, it also has a almost sure chance to poison your Digimon. Wouldn't be so bad if Poison didn't eat 25% of your HP every time you get a turn.
</li><li> Vademon has an attack that has a good chance of putting your Digimon to sleep. Unlike in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em>, sleep makes it impossible to escape and definitely impossible to attack, making your Digimon a sitting duck for Vademon.
</li><li> There's also Persiamon, used by the Game Master, whose special attack, Helter Skelter, <em>dedigivolves</em> your Digimon to its Rookie form, harshly slashing your stats. You can re-digivolve to that form immediately afterward, but good luck getting an attack in before Persiamon uses it again.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigimonWorldDawnDusk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigimonWorldDawnDusk">Digimon World Dawn/Dusk</a></em> has Chrono Destroyer, only useable by the final boss. High Dark damage, plus it can easily put your whole party to sleep. Also, Royal Slash is a Holy attack so strong that, in the more active era of the metagame, any player with more than one digimon with the move would be disqualified.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest">Dragon Quest</a></em>:
<ul><li> You'll be hard-pressed to find a veteran player of the franchise who <em>doesn't</em> hate Disruptive Wave with a passion. Once the enemy uses it, ALL your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff">buffs</a> are gone and there is NO way to block it, leaving you with a huge disadvantage if you spent the last three rounds casting buff spells, which you absolutely <em>need</em> in the endgame (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualBossImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualBossImmunity">Use debuff spells on the enemy, you say? You're adorable.</a>), and need a heal badly. Especially if the enemy can attack more than once in a single turn, which by the second half of the game, most of them can! First turn, Disruptive Wave = Goodbye all defense and power boosts. Second turn, you get hit with an ungodly powerful attack. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Have fun getting around that</a>.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Corvus</a>'s</span> Magic Burst in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX">Dragon Quest IX</a></em>. It converts all his remaining MP (Mana Points) into a blast that hits your entire team for (2*Remaining MP). <em>And he can restore all his MP right after, every time</em>. And with his 255 MP maximum, it can <em>easily</em> oneshot the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a> of your team.
</li><li> And what if there were an attack that could insta-kill your entire party 100% of the time with no need for any softening up. It's generally limited to earlier installments, but the Sacrifice and Kamikazee spells can do this. Once an enemy chooses to cast one of these, it's an instant Game Over. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestII">Dragon Quest II</a></em> even gave these spells to common Mooks, meaning that you could be wiped out because you looked at them funny.

It can easily deal up to 300 to every character (which will most likely kill any character except for Felt and Gray) and once he casts it, it sticks around on the time bar to come up at least four more times <strong>while he keeps pounding you.</strong> And he's lightning fast and his other main attacks hit for even more damage. Luckily, Crimson Moon and Shadow Azoth can only target one character.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms">Wild ARMs</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game has a take on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Bad Breath</a> called "Arc en Ciel" which does some damage along with said status blast. Expect it to be used by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">the aliens</a>.

<ul><li> In every game, Riku has an attack entitled Dark Aura, wherein he'll become invincible and fly in quick dashes at your character. It does heavy damage and is very hard to dodge. It's even more devastating in <em>Chain of Memories</em>, although you do have 0 cards that can break it. It also helps that in Reverse/Rebirth <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">you can use it yourself</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">as</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Riku</a>. Also, Ansem's ultimate attack in Riku's last battle with him will almost certainly be fatal unless you dodge it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Sephiroth's</a> "Heartless Angel" attack, which drains all of your HP and MP in one shot. If you aren't able to interrupt it, you <strong>need</strong> the ability that lets you survive lethal blows with 1 HP (Most people assume it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne">HP to 1</a> attack because they haven't turned Second Chance off since they first got it <em>way</em> back in the beginning), but then you still have no MP to heal with. <em>Ouch.</em>
</li><li> The second game gives Sephiroth an opening move that you have to block with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionCommand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionCommand">Action Command</a>, otherwise you die. At least you don't lose <em>that</em> much progress if you mess up.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway">Xaldin's</a> Wind Dragon in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Kingdom Hearts II</a></em>. Multi-hit so it gets around Second Chance, does high damage, and is nigh-unavoidable. Thankfully, Reflega works perfectly well to shield you from it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsBirthBySleep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsBirthBySleep">Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep</a></em> has the nameless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">optional boss</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegionalBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegionalBonus">that the Japanese didn't get</a>. This boss has Collision Magnet. Basically, the boss hauls you in with a rope and deals damage in mid air. First, it hurts. You need to be at a high level for this attack to not instantly bring you to your final Hit Point. Second, it's very fast and difficult to see coming, and unblockable. Third, it leaves you open for another attack, which can kill you if the rope managed to get you to one HP, without you being able to recover; even if you have Once More, because apparently the next attack, which you don't have enough time to recover for, counts as a separate combo. Your chance of victory is inversely proportional to how many times this boss decides to use this attack. This move was so bad that when the Japanese got their inevitable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">Final Mix</a>, they nerfed this move to allow you enough time to dodge or heal, mainly to make the two <em>new</em> bonus bosses look challenging next to him.
</li><li> The "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Rape Rope</a>." It's telling that the tracking for it is so good that if you use or spam your dash/dodge move (which has invincibility frames and moves you very quickly), the rope will just latch on your character as s/he's dodging <em>continuously for several seconds</em> if you're able to keep it up for that long, so that it grabs you as soon as you run out of invincibility frames.
</li><li> Collision Magnet has jack and shit next to the Doom spell. Doom is when the Unknown throws out a few lines that if they ensnare your hero, you have to mash the X button (Circle in Japan) to break free. Thing is, Doom's countdown isn't consistent. Sometimes, it'll be 5 seconds to death, but on other occasions, it's 2 with a swift timedown cause. Unless you can smash buttons with the best of them, getting snared by that move is a death sentence with no way out of it. Compounding the real issue with Doom is that the move can come out VERY quickly, like after you just hit him with a surge art or when he's recovering and performing another move. Sometimes you just straight up lose if Doom hits you and you physically cannot mash the X button fast enough to break free.
</li><li> A lot of bosses in this game have some kind of inescapable stun-lock combo that in proud or critical difficulty will leave you with little to no health, requiring Second Chance/Once More and some form of healing ready. To make matters worse, HP isn't given by leveling up but instead is based on story events or through the HP up ability, and getting the latter can be a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a>" or require grinding through an optional area. Leveling doesn't really help your survivability because defense is pretty negligible in the higher difficulties and you even get less than the standard or easy difficulty. Some bosses with combos like this: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Terranort, Master Eraqus, Zack Fair, Braig, Vanitas, the Deep Space Boss, etc.</span>
</li><li> The Armor of the Master and No Heart from the final mix of <em>Birth by Sleep</em> each have their own. AotM has a 20 hit combo almost guaranteed to reduce your HP to one normally, but if he's been allowed to enter his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a> by sapping you with his chain, it's a guaranteed kill. No Heart's ultimate attack is basically a dark version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SphereOfDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SphereOfDestruction">Mega Flare</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Shadow Flare? Ultima?</a>), which he starts using late in his battle. It's uninterruptible but can be avoided, but if you either fall into one of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects">slow</a> traps or are right next to him when he rises into the air, you will be hit. Like Sephiroth's Heartless Angel, getting hit by this move means instant death if you don't have Second Chance, and even if you survive, it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaBurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaBurn">burns out your Focus gauge and all your commands</a>. This is also a guaranteed kill if he uses it twice, unless you have an item which you'll likely have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss">used up by then.</a>
</li><li> Ever wonder why everyone hates <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Terranort</span> so much? Because he has a <em>really</em> annoying combo that stun-locks you and takes away most of your health, and even has two non-consecutive blows that can <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">bypass</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastChanceHitPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastChanceHitPoint">Second Chance/Once More</a></em> if your HP was already depleted to one by then. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's the same combo that Terra uses himself when in Dark Impulse mode, but unlike Terra,</span> he can pull this combo off <em>at will</em>, and this makes it <em>very</em> hard to hit him. He also has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ars Solum. How is it different than Terra's version of it? Well,</span> it's unblockable, it is difficult to knock him out of it, and he can use it up to <strong>THREE TIMES IN A ROW</strong>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Of course, when <em>you</em> use it, he just blocks the first hit of it, and Counter Hammers you.</span>
</li><li> In addition, Zack performs Omnislash. You may feel pity for those hordes of enemies you murdered like that. It's used at the start of the battle, and can be used again during the battle. You are given a clue that tells you it's coming, and it's STILL hard to dodge.
</li><li> The optional boss from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts358DaysOver2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts358DaysOver2">Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days</a></em>, the Dust Flier, has an entire arsenal of these. First, there's a shockwave that will deal a random status ailment, a bombardment attack that comes fast and knocks you around like a ragdoll, AND the charge attack. The charge hits like three Mack trucks slamming into you one after the other. Glide makes it much easier to dodge, but you still have to deal with the Flier's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss">ludicrous HP count</a>. If you can bring down this airborne bastard, you've earned the right to trash talk.
</li><li> The Mimic Master's laser attack in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsBirthBySleep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsBirthBySleep">Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep</a></em>. He fires off two lasers, one bright and the other dark. If the dark one hits you, your field of vision is reduced and you lose the ability to lock on (as well as your Shotlock). It's also floor-level, so you need to jump over it and hope the bright laser doesn't catch you (although that just deals damage). Trying to run away from it? Don't bother, it takes up just about the entire field! And the Master is invincible for the duration of the attack.
</li><li> Both Demyx and his dancers fall into this:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash">Demyx</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Kingdom Hearts II</a></em> has a <em>very</em> annoying attack where he says, <em>"Dance, water, dance!"</em> and you have to kill ten water clones of him in ten seconds (fifteen seconds in <em>Final Mix</em>). Fail to do so? Game Over, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver">no explanation as to why</a>. It will probably be the biggest cause of frustration for you when you fight him. Though at least the increased timer in <em>Final Mix</em> makes destroying the clones <em>slightly</em> more manageable.
</li><li> Demyx's Nobodies, the Dancers, have a nasty trick as well. Once they've taken enough damage, they will skate across the ground toward you while orbited by motes of light. It they make contact with you even for a split-second, they'll grab you and hit you with a throw attack that does quite a bit of damage, tosses you pretty far, and also interrupts any combos you're hitting other enemies with. And it can't be guarded against.
</li></ul></li><li> There's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> <em>Kurt Zisa</em> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> and his infamous <em>Silencega</em> technique, which is able to completely lock your magic &mdash; until you destroy the two crystal balls in his hands. His hard-hitting physicals make healing very important &mdash; for which you have nothing but items, which can't be shortcutted in this game. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a> is imminent.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Anti Black Coat Nightmare</span> in <em>Dream Drop Distance</em> has a particularly irritating one: he'll fire out a thin red line along the ground. If it hits you, it will lift you up in the air, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne">suck all but 1 HP out of you</a></em>, and <em>scatter it around the arena as HP orbs!</em> So, basically, you have to pick up all your health, <em>while he's still attacking.</em> Oh, and it's sometimes possible for him to use that attack just after he fires a barrage of weak shots. Immobile and on 1 HP, you have no chance of avoiding death in that situation.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RunawayBrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RunawayBrain">Julius</a> has a pretty big one too: he'll charge himself up with lightning, jump to the top of a tall building, then leap back down and bounce along the ground. It's really hard to avoid because of the AI's uncanny ability to know exactly where you're going to be when he jumps, so he usually ends up landing right on top of you. But that's not the worst thing about the attack. If he hits you, a random one of your commands will become greyed-out and have its reload rate slowed down so massively it's essentially taken out of the battle. Lord help you if he gets all your Curagas this way. Especially annoying is that, 9 times out of 10, the camera will lose your lock-on to Julius when he jumps, so you can easily get stomped simply because you lost track of where he was.
</li><li> The Data versions of the Organization battles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Kingdom Hearts II</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Final Mix+</a></em> all follow a distinct formula, unlocking a very powerful attack (frequently called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">desperation attacks</a> by the fandom) once you damage them enough. The game will force you to deal with this, and sometimes will not let you defeat the boss until you have triumphed over this attack (Demyx's 'defeat 99 water clones in 30 seconds' and Luxord's 'Do you know the rules?' minigame are good examples: do what you like to their HP, but you won't win until you clear those challenges). If you're lucky, the boss in question will only use this desperation attack once (like Demyx and his final water clone challenge). If you're <em>un</em>lucky, which you usually are, it will be added to the boss's pool of moves and reappear as often as the boss wishes. For example, Data Xemnas gets 'Can you spare a heart?', the move he used in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> battle as a one-time scripted event/gameplay element (the one where he drains Sora's health and the player is forced to use Riku), as a desperation attack, that he can use as often as he pleases after his health dips below a certain point. The good news? Since it is no longer a scripted event but a regular attack, it can now be blocked by Reflect, or Limits (as Sora is invulnerable while executing a limit). The bad news? You had <em>damn well better block it</em>, because Xemnas will drain Sora's health so fast this move might as well be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a>
</li><li> Xemnas as he appears as a bonus boss in <em>Kingdom Hearts: Final Mix</em> has an attack where he replaces all of Sora's menu commands with "Shock", which harms Sora, and "Release", which ends the move. Thing is, "Release" hops randomly and rapidly through Sora's commands, making hitting it without missing the timing and getting Shocked very tricky. In addition: the attack continually drains Sora's HP either way until "Release" is selected, Sora can't use magic or items to heal himself during this time. Oh, and Xemnas is still attacking. The move is initiated by a very fast melee attack that has little-to-no telegraphing time.
</li><li> Every single one of the Lingering Will's attacks are these, particularly one which is identical to Xemnas' attack above, as well as a hard to dodge, unblockable, poorly telegraphed move which can either prevent you from using magic (so no healing, no Reflega and no ranged attacks) or <em>attacking at all</em>.
</li><li> The final battle with Master Xehanort in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII">Kingdom Hearts III</a></em> has a particularly brutal desperation attack. Once you get him down to two bars, he'll send you to a room similar to The World That Never Was where 13 shadow-y versions of himself all rush you after he gives the order "Expire". Blocking and dodging is insanely difficult.
<ul><li> Data Master Xehanort's version of this attack has him alternate between replica rushes and his other attacks. The timing is extremely precise, and failing to block or dodge one attack will most likely lead into getting hit by the next.
</li></ul></li><li> Yozora, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> from <em>III</em> has one attack where he is capable of stealing your items. This is very difficult to anticipate and it range from either your HP to recover himself, your Keyblade which leaves you completely incapable of attacking or blocking his attacks, or even worse the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutoRevive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutoRevive">Auto-Revive</a> Kupo Coin where not only he robs you of a potential extra life but when you somehow brought him down, he'll use it to <em>revive himself with half of his health bars along with another layer of armor HP</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RomancingSaGa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RomancingSaGa">Romancing SaGa</a>:</em> Death likes spamming Open the Gate a lot; it kills your characters outright or heavily damages them.
<ul><li> Or even worse: Jewel Blaster, which deals magical damage, not physical, and is Quad elemental. The Jewel Beast even spams it every three turns instead of six when you whittle his HP down. The "Overkill" you frequently see after Jewel Blaster isn't just for show.
</li><li> However the most annoying one is Animate Dead, it's a permanent charm effect until the character loses all HP and dies again.

<ul><li> When fighting Furiae, there's an attack where she sends a dozen swords at you. And you have to dodge every single one, or you take full damage. It is avoidable, if you use homing fire, or the dragon's fully-powered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">you probably wouldn't know that on your first try</a>.
</li><li> Manah in the canon ending is a pain in the butt. She has this annoying attack in the middle of the fight where she summons rings that come from her abdomen, not too bad. However, after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed">taking so much health from her</a>, she decides to summon the rings from all angles... Have fun dodging those.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioRPG">Super Mario RPG</a></em>, the Breaker Beam attack used by Axem Rangers and later Gunyolk. Luckily, it requires charging for a turn or so, so you won't get nailed by it twice in a row. The charge-up also allows you to defend for the next turn so you'll only take half damage.
<ul><li> Some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">instant-death</a> attacks can count as this, especially the completely unblockable ones. The less powerful ones can be blocked by certain accessories, and can also be blocked by proper timing. How well you time your defense is the difference between surviving it with only 1 HP and remaining unscathed.
</li><li> When Smithy is in his wizard form, Sword Rain, Spear Rain, Arrow Rain, Dark Star, and <em>Meteor Swarm</em> count heavily. Also, his chest form uses different status effects on you, and Tank Form has an instant death attack.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Yaridovich</a> and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithWater">Water Blast</a> has downed many a low-level run player.
</li><li> Carni-Kiss is a <em>really</em> powerful attack. It's not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a>, but unless you explicitly do some grinding, it may as well be. And since it's <em>technically</em> a magic-based attack, you can't guard against it. A lot of the already-tough enemies like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestMonster">Chest Monsters</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAnts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAnts">Shogun</a> pack it, which doesn't help matters. Very ironically, by the time you fight the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreTeethThanTheOsmondFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreTeethThanTheOsmondFamily">Chomps</a> that know it, it's not as dangerous.
</li><li> Certain spells such as Petal Blast and Aurora Beam will damage your entire party as well as have a chance of disabling each member. In the worst case, your entire party can be disabled until each one either dies or the RNG decides that you shrug it off. At least Mushrooming lets you recover HP every turn.
</li><li> Bundt's Diamond Saw is powerful for that point in the game, and can potentially KO a character in one hit. This is especially annoying since the second phase of his battle you have to blow out his candles by landing an attack on him, where he re-lights a candle each turn, and if you lose a character this could be difficult. The battle is otherwise pretty easy if he <em>doesn't</em> use Diamond Saw.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Culex</a> and his elemental crystals have nothing but stupid-powerful attacks (like the aforementioned Water Blast), but none of them compete with his one physical attack. He doesn't even move to attack you, all that happens is you instantly hear a slash and one of your characters takes about 150 damage at a respectable level (for comparison, all of your characters are barely below 200 HP, and most of the magic attacks will only deal 50-70 at that point). And because of its unpredictability, it's impossible to block unless you instantly press A as soon as it's his turn to move. Even when you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">put the Lazy Shell on the Princess</a>, which lets her take little to no damage from every attack in the fight, this attack will still deal about 50 to her. There's also his Dark Star special as well, which can pose a serious threat even to a Lazy-Shell-equipped Toadstool. At least it's only single-target.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario">Paper Mario</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario">Paper Mario</a> game</em> has Tubba Blubba's heart attack (Though it can be dodged by using Outta Sight), General Guy's Lightning Bulb Shock (can be stopped by breaking the bulb), Huff n Puff's Lightning Shock (Which makes him immune to most attacks for a few rounds and does massive damage), and the Crystal King's Ice Beam attack (which does light damage, but inflicts the Freeze status effect on you). Finally, Bowser has several attacks, but the most frustrating one is his jump attack, which removes an option to attack from your menu (If you lose the Jump or Item one, you are screwed). Even the Koopa Bros' super attack is painful at the point you fight them. Also, Jr. Troopa when you face him in the Shiver Snowfield, when he uses his magic attack which does about 8 damage (which is powerful for this series).
</li><li> Also, any attack that can damage Mario's partner. In this game, none of Mario's partners have their own HP bar and if any of them are hit with a certain attack for a set amount of damage, then they will be out for that many turns (for example, getting hit by an attack that does 2 damage means they're out for two turns). This can quickly turn a fight one-sided against Mario. Fortunately, there aren't that many moves in this game that does it. The moves that are able to damage Mario's partners as well are Buzzar's whirlwind attack, Tutankoopa's Chomp Spell attack, Big Lantern Ghost's lantern shine attack, the already mentioned General Guy's light bulb attack, and Bowser's Star Rod shine attack. Interestingly, most of these attacks are light-based and Watt, the Lil' Sparky, is immune to these attacks.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a></em>:
<ul><li> Magnus Von Grapple 2.0 has the Audience Cannon, which deals ridiculous amounts of damage if you don't have plenty of Defense buffs active. And just like its name says, it shoots the audience at you, for 3 damage per shot (which adds up to over 20 damage, which is almost always fatal in this game). And the audience is what you get your Star Power (essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a>) from. To a lesser extent, X-Yux has the attack that it uses when it has four mini-X-Yux around it, which deals massive damage and immobilizes; if it gets a chance to use that attack, the player is in serious trouble.
</li><li> The Shadow Queen's hands can use an HP-draining attack that deals 7 damage and heals 7 HP to the Shadow Queen, can be used once per hand, and ignores defense. If you get the timing perfect, however, it can be superguarded.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigi">Mario &amp; Luigi</a></em> series:
<ul><li> The first attack used by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Cackletta during the final battle with her</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiSuperstarSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiSuperstarSaga">Superstar Saga</a></em>. Because if you don't dodge, you will die instantly due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne">both Mario Bros. being reduced to one health point at the start of the battle</a> (beforehand, you get blown up by a time bomb and eaten after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadsIWinTailsYouLose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadsIWinTailsYouLose">Heads I Win, Tails You Lose</a> fight). This is, of course, if your speed is lower than hers. Otherwise, you can heal immediately after the battle starts. The chances of you being faster than her are pretty low, though, since you'd've had to have leveled up to around level 34 and/or really focused on speed when using the level up bonuses and/or be using a badge that increase your speed and/or used speed up stat items.
</li><li> Two of Bowser X's attacks in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiBowsersInsideStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiBowsersInsideStory">Bowser's Inside Story</a></em>. One is where he becomes giant, chases you down, and you have to dodge both fireballs being thrown at you and others you have to jump over while escaping him. If you get hit three times, you get knocked out and he crushes you flat. His Shy Guy attack is also very nasty: it's kind of like a reverse Koopa shell, and if you miss, the brother takes a lot of damage. He also has an attack where he shoots fire, you hit it back, he turns into a fiery shell, drops a ton down from the sky that you have to hammer away, and then falls on you. If you do deflect his fall, he'll then fly off to land on the other brother. And he goes fast.
</li><li> In <em>Bowser's Inside Story</em>, the Junker seems like a fairly standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlunkyBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlunkyBoss">Flunky Boss</a>... until he sucks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Luigi</a> up and sticks him inside one of his flunkies. The attack is unavoidable, unlike nearly every other attack in the game, and requires Mario to keep track of the Junker Can that Luigi is inside. In addition, the Junker Cans have tons of HP, they regularly swap Luigi around, and if Mario gets knocked out, you lose instantly.
</li><li> Dark Star/Dark Star X and its cloning attack. Generates five to seven copies of itself, then charges at each brother. However, the copies turn INVISIBLE a short while before they reach your character, and long enough that you have to guess when to strike too. Miss that attack, and you get hit quite hard, often by another copy following the first one. On the plus side, a successful defense will likely knock out the next clone headed for that brother too. The developers apparently really liked this attack, because it returned in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiPaperJam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiPaperJam">Paper Jam</a></em>, this time used by King Boo.
</li><li> There's also the giant laser/fire breath beam attack used by five bosses in <em>Bowser's Inside Story</em>; Bowser, Dark Star, Dark Star Core, Dark Star X, and Bowser X. It does massive damage to the point of almost being a one hit kill, but is usually easily enough dodged. However, if one brother is knocked out, and the other guy is holding him, then it's quite difficult to catch Starlow and go to the top screen, likely killing whoever's remaining. Oh, and Dark Star does a kamikaze type charge at Mario/Luigi/Starlow if you dodge the beam, so if you forget to drop back down to the floor, it'll likely deal the same amount of damage the beam did.
</li><li> The Elder Shroob Princess' last form in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiPartnersInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiPartnersInTime">Partners in Time</a></em> has an attack where her tentacle legs start spinning around her, forcing you to jump over them. It's not too difficult when she only has two legs, but when she has four legs, it's almost impossible to dodge. Couple that with the brothers flinching for a short time after getting hit so that once you get hit, it's impossible to <em>stop</em> getting hit, and you've got one incredibly annoying attack. Oh, and of <em>course</em> it does a ton of damage.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiDreamTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiDreamTeam">Dream Team</a></em>, there are quite a few attacks like this:
<ul><li> One is Earthwake's flying hammer attack, where the boss turns into a gigantic mallet you have to dodge or smack away... multiple times. In Hard Mode, he even does about 10 of these swipes in one turn, so you can literally go from having full health to being dead just because you couldn't dodge/block a single annoying attack.
</li><li> There's also Pi'illodium's hammer anvil style attack, where he flies off screen and comes down like a hammer on a Bro's head... at about 90 miles per hour. It's entirely trial-and-error-based, since you likely don't have the split-second reaction times to deal with it as it's about to hit, and even when you know, the timing is still rather unfair (and it can also stun the character it hits to stop them moving)
</li><li> There's also two of Antasma's attacks in his final battle: the bat swarm and the rings of death. The former summons a huge flock of bats that fly across the level and have to be dodged (and due to the misleading depth/graphics style, you can't easily tell which ones are heading for you to begin with) or you risk <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamWithinADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamWithinADream">falling asleep</a> and having to escape an endless gauntlet of obstacles, while the latter has him throw rings of exploding orbs at Mario as he runs away, with you having to be in the middle of them and then jump the shockwave to avoid. The latter is arguably better if you fail than win, since being hit by the shockwave actually builds up to more damage than just being blown up to begin with.
</li><li> The giant Mount Pajamaja volcano boss's ramming attack is less an attack than a free ticket for him to take out 1/4 of your health. He only does it once at a time (thank goodness), but if anything, it is even <em>harder</em> than Earthwake's hammer attack to counter. It requires repeated quick strokes on the touchscreen to defend against, and most of the time, these won't even register enough to matter.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Beehoss</a> have a counterattack they use whenever they're hit by something, which is to summon a swarm of bees that's hard to jump over. Counter-counterattack the bees by jumping on them instead of over? They'll hit you with an unavoidable counter-counter-counterattack. (Dear Zeekeeper, it's like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiSuperstarSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiSuperstarSaga">Prince Peasley and Fawful</a> all over again.) Their regular attack works the exact same way, and while the tells are in the background (for the Bro. they target), sometimes they don't show properly and it's up to luck.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dreamy Bowser</span> has a hammer attack of his own. He signals which Bro he will hit and slams the hammer down very quickly, requiring fast reaction times. After it gets hit back by your hammer he will then slam it down, at the same speed, on the other brother. Not only is it powerful it also generates a shockwave.
</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiPaperJam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiPaperJam">Mario &amp; Luigi: Paper Jam</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Paper Sombrero Guys only attack. They throw their hats at the Bros. in quick succession requiring rapid reflexes. There is also a chance the Guy will charge at you after throwing the hat to mess up your timing; there is no way to tell if this will happen.
</li><li> Paper Boomerang Bros. may throw two boomerangs to circle one of the Bros. Countering requires both boomerangs to be hit <em>simultaneously</em> and there is only one point where they will both be in a position to be hit, which has a very small hitbox.
</li><li> Shockwave attacks have become this now there are three characters to control. Dodging them completely now means there is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeDexterityRequired" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeDexterityRequired">Some Dexterity Required</a>.
</li><li> Wiggler's combo of using shockwaves (see above) followed by seeds and ending with chasing one Bro as enemies knock them into Wiggler so he can trample them. Not dodging the last part of the combo will kill the unfortunate brother and the shockwaves and seeds can trip everyone up and may leave the other two hurting, near death or just dead. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">Total Party Kill</a> is very possible with this attack.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em> has several, though the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> eases the pain of some of this:
<ul><li> Masa and Mune's combined form has an attack, signaled by the message "Storing Tornado Energy." and two turns later "Pain...", that does over 100 HP in damage and targets the entire party. At the time you face them, it will most likely knock your characters into the low double-digits and force you to waste a turn healing them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Attack Masa&amp;Mune with Crono's Wind Slash attack (mistranslated as Slash in the SNES version) while he's charging the attack, and it'll dissipate the "Tornado Energy". Good luck figuring this out with the "Wind" Slash/"Tornado" clue removed</span>.
</li><li> Magus risks casting a spell! (Signals that he's about to cast Dark Matter, his most powerful spell; the <em>only</em> consolation here is that he's no longer got a barrier up and can be hit with your strongest elemental attacks). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierChangeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierChangeBoss">Barrier Change</a>: Only Shadow damages! Magus' Barrier Change spells not only make him immune to all magic except the corresponding element, they also hit the entire party <em>hard</em>. And he does them a lot. Shadow is the worst, however, not only for the damage, but also because the only character you have with shadow attacks at that point is Robo, who is somewhat redundant with Frog and whose only shadow magic attacks are relatively weak, multi-target lasers. Even if you do stick him in the party (generally unwise, due to his generally poor performance in this fight), it just means that his fire barrier will mess you up instead, as you won't have anyone with fire attacks. You pretty much <em>have to</em> go in with the Crono/Frog/Lucca lineup to cover all the elemental bases...provided they all know their Lv.2 elemental spells and thus habe access to their Delta Storm <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinationAttack">Triple Tech</a>. Hope you brought a lot of items with you, too, because Frog's healing is rather lacking.
</li><li> Destruction rains from the heavens! (Lavos shoots his Spines of Death at you)
</li><li> Lavos Core's "Grand Stone" attack, guaranteed to reduce you to single HP digits, if not kill you outright (but you can use this against him if you have Frog and/or Ayla in your party) Also Dreamreaver, which is basically the same attack, just a magic variant. Chances are it'll do more damage to your party than Grandstone. On the plus side, his attacks can be predicted. If you pay attention to the shifting background, you'll see his attack corresponds to the time period showing. This way you can at least prepare for the the pain that's to follow.
</li><li> Lavos' Random Status attack also counts. It'll cause your party to suffer from some <em>horrendous</em> random alignments from Lavos, which wouldn't be <em>necessarily</em> bad, expect if it's <em>before</em> either of his ultimate attacks. Otherwise, you're <em>screwed</em>. His punches can also hit <em>hard,</em> from 200 to as high as <em><strong>900</strong></em> damage.
</li><li> Any attack involving both of Giga Gaia's hands. The problem isn't the attacks per se, it's that, on a first run, Giga Gaia is almost guaranteed to go first and act twice in a row, and the Double Handblaster/Dark Plasma combo WILL <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">Total Party Kill</a> you if you aren't prepared (which boils down to having either insanely high resistance or outright immunity to at least one of the two elements he uses).
</li><li> Queen Zeal's Hallation, which also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne">drops the party's health to 1 HP</a>. If that isn't enough, attacking her hands in her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a> form causes them to counter with Hallation <em>and</em> MP Buster. Good luck recovering from <em>that</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Son of Sun's</a> flare and purple laser both take a huge chunk of HP (potentially over 300) out of any character who isn't appropriately equipped. While only Flare targets the entire party, its AI loop places the attacks right after each other. However, he only uses Flare as a counter to hitting the wrong fireball, which can be remedied by using <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Magus's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Black Hole to consume 2-3 of the fireballs.</a></span>
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">DS version</a> adds a couple new ones, such as Scintillation. Thankfully only used by one boss, this attack deals an absurd amount of damage to the whole party - absurd meaning roughly 400 at maximum magic defense and with a Barrier that halves magic damage, in a game where the HP cap is 999. And if you have a character with less than maximum magic defense or remaining HP, better hope the boss doesn't recast it while you revive said character on top of healing your party.
</li></ul></li><li> Then, we got <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross">Chrono Cross</a></em>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Miguel</a> and all of his white magic, but especially HolyDragSwd, which is so tremendously powerful it can almost one-shot anyone who isn't innately white. And he likes comboing it with WeakMinded, a magic-defense debuff. And <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Serge is currently inhabiting Lynx's body, so his innate is Black</span>, which means HolyDragSwd does massive damage to him.
</li><li> Every element used by the Tragediennes. This is the entire point of them; if you can survive their initial volley of elements (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">and had the foresight to bring the right traps</a>), you can acquire stuff like Volcano and BlackHole way ahead of schedule, essentially breaking the game wide open.
</li><li> MegaStarky, otherwise a fairly easy boss, will smack the party with an UltraNova when his health drops far enough.
</li><li> ExhaustGas, used by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">Highwayman</a> in the Dead Sea, blinds the entire party and is <em>very</em> accurate. You'd better have some BlackOut or Purify elements allocated, because you're not winning this fight with everyone blinded.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Dario</a>'s</span> attacks are all crazy powerful, but special mention goes to one in particular. If you use any kind of white element in the battle, he'll counter with ConductaRod, a <em>devastating</em> black tech. Dash&amp;Gash does way less damage than ConductaRod, but does it enough to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> a non-black innate character.
</li><li> The <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dragon God</span> gets access to all the elements in the game, including nasty ones like BlackHole and UltraNova; when you add that to its already staggering magic attack, you've got a recipe for a party wipe. You can stop them with traps, if you know they're coming, but if you don't know about them, it's a <em>long</em> road back to Marbule.
</li><li> ForeverZero, a tech that is insanely powerful and can easily kill white innate characters. Fortunately, it's a tech learned by a playable character. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Unfortunately, it happens to be Serge with Lynx body and Dark Serge (Lynx) <em>also has this tech and will use it against you</em>.</span> FeralCats isn't as painful as ForeverZero, but still hits hard.
</li></ul></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Luther</span>'s Insanity Prelude in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTillTheEndOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTillTheEndOfTime">Star Ocean: Till the End of Time</a></em>, an unblockable red flood that covers most of the battlefield. Assuming you aren't about thirty levels overleveled with equipment you shouldn't even have, its multiple shots will kill your entire party easily - you can only avoid it by standing in certain corners of the battle map - and forget your AI-controlled party members going there, you have to guide them all manually. (Alternatively, you can stun him out of casting it.) Any message board for the game is inevitably hit with 'how do I dodge Insanity Prelude' more than a few times.
</li><li> While several of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> extra bosses have similar moves, the final three of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile">Lenneth, the Ethereal Queen, and Freya</a> are by far the worst. With Lenneth and the Queen, you at least have a slight chance of making it to the edge of the screen to dodge Nibelung Valesti and Celestial Star. Freya, however, will spam Ether Strike again and again without warning and cannot ever be disrupted. You only hope is certain stunning items which buy you a total of three seconds before she's back on the offense.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OdinSphere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OdinSphere">Odin Sphere</a></em>:
<ul><li> Onyx's inferno charge can cross the entire arena (<em>twice</em>) and leaves a field of damaging flames in its wake; in addition, Oswald can't jump high enough to clear it. He also lunges at you if you try to jump to stop you. Heaven help you if Onyx decides to spam it.
</li><li> Brigan's grab attack isn't a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a>, but it may as well be, dealing insane amounts of damage and dizzying you afterwards. Unless you've been chowing down with Gwendolyn to raise her max HP, if he grabs you, it's over.
</li><li> Belial's inhale attack, where he attempts to suck the player in and eat them for a lot of damage. This usually comes after he's filled the arena with junk, so there's lots of things to hit the player as they're trying to run away and knock them backwards (and of course <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> aren't affected, so they're free to further help knock them into Belial's maw). On the plus side, if the player managed to get far enough to get behind him, they can wail on him with impunity.
</li><li> In Leifthrasir, the Phoenix Riders in Volkenon. There's an attack that they do that causes a pillar of lava to shoot out of the floor and send flaming debris everywhere. Since the pillar is almost as tall as the stage itself, expect a lot of rage if you get caught between it and the rider.

<ul><li> Fadroh is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a>. Who is curb-stomping who? That depends entirely on whether or not Fadroh buffs himself with Orb of Magical Offense.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Geldoblame</span>'s Forfeit Your Life, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO">One-Hit KO</a>. And he likes to use another attack called Seal of Evil, which paralyzes a character, meaning they <em>can't defend</em>.
</li><li> The Angel of Darkness also likes paralysis, but couples it with an attack that steals your HP. When he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed">Turns Red</a> and moves twice per turn, it's not uncommon for him to heal faster than you can damage him.
</li><li> Agyo's A-Up Pentagram. Not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a>, but might as well be.
</li><li> The Holoholobird's Wingflail, which knocks the whole party down and breaks any combos you've set up.
</li><li> The Godcraft's hail attack. It hits the entire party for tremendous damage, enough to cut over half their health down. In what might be either a bug, a programming oversight, or just the dev team being sadistic, this attack (and several others used mostly by bosses) are <em>lethal</em> if you have a party member knocked out. Essentially, they're programmed to hit the whole party multiple times, but the targeting is random, i.e. the attack might not even scratch Guillo, but knock Milly out and put Sagi in the red. However, if one of the party members is down, the attack only has two targets, but it still hits the same number of times, meaning the two remaining are in for a world of hurt.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Wiseman</span>'s Cast Off Your Carnal Robes. Doesn't do too much damage, but it knocks the whole party down, destroys any magnus you have equipped, and breaks your combos. Just to add to that, he steals your magnus power with his regular attacks, so you'll be seeing his specials a lot.
</li><li> Magnus of Life, used by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Verus-Wiseman</span>. It hits the entire party, hurts like hell, heals the boss, and inflicts all status ailments. Nothing's better than losing just because everyone's blinded or frozen.
</li><li> The Hearteater, the boss of the Matar Highlands, has a particularly cruel attack called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceFullOfAlienWingWong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceFullOfAlienWingWong">Ovulate</a>. A character hit by it has a timer slapped on them which, when it hits zero, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">kills them instantly</a> and runs down notoriously quick (often before your next character's turn even comes up). This is made even <em>more</em> frustrating by how the Hearteater loves to spam sleep attacks as well. Your only options to deal with it are to burn through Chalice of Freedoms, which drains MP so you can't use your specials, or constantly keep using Cordial of Fates to revive them at low HP.
</li><li> Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss">Giacomo's</a> Thrashinggale will have you pulling your hair out, as at that point in the game the attack alone can drain half to three-quarters the health of any one character, the attack can be chained to a combo for a cheap kill, and it's too early in the game to have any decent recovery magnus aside from a small potion and fate's cordial. In later battles the "Thrashinggale Redux" is much easier to contend with as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainForgotToLevelGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainForgotToLevelGrind">Villain Forgets To Level Grind</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> When you see the eponymous boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo">Diablo</a> II</em> step back, <em>run like hell</em> because he's about to unleash <a class="urllink" href="http://www.infoceptor.net/strategy/diablo2/walkthrough/mission24/shot1.jpg">a brutal stream of red lightning<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> that can sap your health in seconds. This was nerfed in <em>Lord of Destruction</em>, but it's still very damaging: it can still take most of your health in a single second, if not actually kill you. Diablo's ring of fire, his other attack, hits everything in every direction even when he's not on the screen, making it essentially unavoidable.
<ul><li> There are various bugged monsters that can nearly instantly kill you. The hardest two are poison vipers, whose poison javelin is bugged and deals their regular attack damage 25 times per second on top of its poison damage; and gloams, who seem to deal 256 times their intended damage.
</li><li> The main thing that makes Nihlathak so dangerous is his Corpse Explosion, which works more or less exactly like the Necromancer's in that it deals out a percentage of the dead monster's attack as damage, half-fire, half-physical. If you thought the spell was good in your hands when brought against armies of mooks, it's even more harmful when you're the target and the game's infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealthDamageAsymmetry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealthDamageAsymmetry">Health/Damage Asymmetry</a> is <em>not</em> on your side. In the game's max difficulty the damage is nerfed to a fifth of what it should be and it <em>still</em> tends to pack enough of a punch to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> well-built characters.
</li></ul></li><li> Some enemies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em> will use the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> abilities that you use all the time. It's no fun at all being on the receiving end of a Crushing Prison (continuous damage and paralysis), Overwhelm (essentially a physical version of Crushing Prison), Scattershot (ranged mass stun that's almost impossible to resist), or "Curse of Mortality" (negates healing and does continuous damage). That last one is almost guaranteed to result in character death (which is extremely annoying if you're going for the "No Deaths" achievement) unless it's dispelled. Some bosses <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> such as the High Dragons</span> also have grab attacks that can instantly kill any of your party members except for the unique ones like Dog and Shale, which makes those two good choices for fighting against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Flemeth and the High Dragon</span>. You will also quickly hate the Revenant's "Pull" attack when it brings your precious mage or archer within range of that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">BFS</a>.
<ul><li> There is only one thing worse than Pull: <em>Mass</em> Pull. Nothing beats getting <em>all</em> your party members yanked off their feet and into melee range, often interrupting vital spells or talents.
</li><li> BLOOD WOUND. It's like Crushing Prison, only for your whole party at once! Very likely to end your game. Always shoot the blood mage first.
</li></ul></li><li> The evil storyline of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChampionsOfNorrath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChampionsOfNorrath">Champions: Return to Arms</a></em> has Mithaniel Marr as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>. And one of his attack sequences involves throwing you to the ground while dealing immense damage, and then attacking several more times while you can't move. This only applies in single player mode, however, with two or more this attack is a great way to get a shot at his back.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Runescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Runescape">Runescape</a></em>, the final boss of the quest Nomad's Requiem, the eponymous Nomad has an attack in which he freezes you in place, then charges an attack that does damage equal to your maximum health minus one hitpoint. There's no way to avoid it, and unless you have maximum health when it hits, you die, instantly. That was the case until "damage soaking", which made this attack less scary<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12gk9');"><sup>Mechanics&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note12gk9" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12gk9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">When you would be hit for 200+ damage, the part of the damage which is 200+ is reduced by several-severalteen percent, based on your armour. This usually is useless, but against Nomad, which can hit for 750 and for MAXHP-to-One, this actually makes some visible impact</span>.
<ul><li> Most of the Dungeoneering bosses are just normal bosses with One Attack that makes them special. The Luminescent Icefiend is notable - at every 25% HP milestone, it becomes invulnerable, then sends down a painful icicle rain attack<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5vp8g');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5vp8g" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5vp8g');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">that takes just about two seconds to fall down and is fired at a rate of one per 0.6 seconds, which is as often as possible. The attack doesn't deal much damage per hit, but if you get hit by one, you are thrown aside and generally assured to be hit by a dozen more. Luckily, it stops before you die. The only way to avoid it is to keep moving - if you stop for even a second, bang. The fact it targets an area and not a player is especially frustrating - if you're in a large team, then crossing paths with someone can mean being hit by an attack meant to hit him</span>. Night-Gazer Khighorahk has a melee attack that hits everyone around him for heavy damage, too - if you don't run away when you see it charging, you take heavy damage. Saggitare's arrow rain works the same way.
</li><li> Even player-killers have their own That One Attacks, such as Ice Barrage, which freezes the target in place, but can be cast over and over, lengthening the effect. It basically leaves melee fighters helpless.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3">Mother 3</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Porky</span> has an attack that he, thankfully, rarely uses where he "coughs something up." It is the equivalent of using Offense Down AND Defense Down against your entire party <strong>3 TIMES,</strong> and can be dangerous if you don't have enough PP to raise your stats back up.
<ul><li> From <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a>, you have the Kraken's tornadoes. They do huge amounts of damage, hit everyone in the party, and can't be nullified or deflected like his other attacks can. Also, buffs won't help you; the Kraken's only nonoffensive attack neutralizes any buffs or debuffs you might have cast.
</li><li> Also, Diamond Dog's 'glorious light' attack. Anyone without certain equipment will most likely get paralyzed, killed, or confused. You're in trouble if you missed the Sea Pendant at the far end of the Lost Underworld.
</li><li> Also is the "spread some spores" attack that mushroomizes an ally, which causes both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew">Interface Screw</a> outside of combat and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfriendlyFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfriendlyFire">randomly striking your own party</a> or healing the opponent. It is uncurable in battle and can only be cured by visiting a healer: it's a huge pain when facing the ramblin' mushroom enemies, and an even bigger pain when this attack turns what should be an easy fight against Shrooom! into an aggravating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a>.
</li><li> Made even worse when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ness's Nightmare</span> uses it. If Ness has a Night, Sea, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomDrop">Star</a> Pendant, it'll just waste a turn. If you gave that to a weaker party member, then you'll be up against an attack with a good chance of either being a one-shot kill, paralysis, or confusion. Against a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelBoss">Duel Boss</a>, that's a very bad thing.
</li><li> The preferred attack of a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime">Metal Slimes</a> from both games <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(Criminal Caterpillar and Master Criminal Worm from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a>, and the Beanling and Black Beanling from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3">Mother 3</a></em>)</span> is a low-level PK Fire, which hits your entire party for massive damage the first time you can possibly fight them.
</li><li> There are a lot of attacks in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother1">Mother 1</a> that you will hate. Dehydration attacks, which lower your offense <em>and</em> defense at once, are nasty, as are last shot and PK Beam Gamma attacks which can instantly kill someone. Was it mentioned that you have to <em>go back to town</em> to revive a party member? And that the instant-kill attacks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">can be used by enemies</a> <em>before</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">you get your second party member</a>?
</li><li> The Clumsy Robot will waste most of its turns being clumsy. However, it can "fire a missile, making itself dizzy" for devastating damage, and eat a bologne sandwich to <em>fully heal itself</em>. Both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">totally at random</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Actually, the sandwich is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsALyingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsALyingBastard">a lie</a> &mdash; it makes the "HP recovery" noise and says "The Clumsy Robot's HP was maxed out", but it really does nothing at all.

It deals out a fixed 999 damage nine times. It is very hard to survive this (unless you're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">Ultimate Armor X, Absolute Zero</a> or Stealth Mode Axl), and it rarely misses.
<ul><li> You can't mention the Tail clan without talking about Annihilator Hadoken, which deals an insanely high amount of damage (sometimes reaching into the tens of thousands). Also, if it doesn't deal enough damage to instantly kill a party member, it has a high chance of inflicting Crash (at least while fighting Ninetails), which means that they'll still die.
</li><li> Epsilon has Meta Crash. It's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne">HP to 1</a> attack that never misses (unless it targets Stealth Mode Axl). Epsilon <em>will</em> open the fight with this move, and he spams it after he enters his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">Eject form</a>. He likes to follow that up with Nova Thunder, which deals immense Electric damage to everybody.
</li><li> Silver Horn's Liquid Coating doesn't do any damage, but it is a <em>very</em> irritating move. After using it, his defenses skyrocket, and he has a chance to arbitrarily guard any attack, so even Thunder - his weakness, what he's <em>supposed to take more damage from</em> - does minimal damage to him when he blocks. It also allows him to use Pressure Abyss, an Ice attack that is <em>always</em> a Critical Hit and, unlike most critical hit attacks up to that point, doesn't have any accuracy reduction.
</li><li> Atomic Fall, used by the Meltdown. If you can't kill it before it takes three turns, you're looking at a suicide attack that does high 4-digit damage to your entire party.
</li><li> The combo of Break Shield and Double Iron used by the Einhammers in Chapter 2. If the Einhammer is the last enemy alive, it sacrifices its defensive stats and from then on will <em>only</em> use Double Iron, an attack that takes off about 25% of X's health in one strike. The Zwei Hammers later in the game can use this same combo, but it's worse the first time around because at that point X is the only party member you have, whereas later on you have a full party to mitigate the damage of Double Iron.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan">Mega Man</a></em>:

Instead of shooting rolling shiny balls down the rows, this one actually rakes your side of the field several times, is insanely hard to dodge, and the faster he gets, the harder it is to dodge, all the way up to being completely undodgeable. Sure, a single Panel Grab chip will eliminate this, but few people actually bother with it. And in his final forms, every hit deals over a hundred damage, which piles up fast. No matter how high your HP counter is, it's all reserved to tank Buster Rake. He also LOVES to finish off low HP with this. In Battle Network 6, this attack gets buffed even further as it no longer triggers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility">Mercy Invincibility</a>.
</li><li> Shadowman in <em>Battle Network 2</em> has a <em>nasty</em> habit of unleashing Muramasa on the player, an attack that deals damage equal to the amount of lost HP. He only uses it when at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack">low health</a> with little warning, resulting in a nasty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> since it deals over 1000 damage this way.
</li><li> In <em>Battle Network 5</em>, Shademan's attack in Liberations has practically infinite range; it can hit anyone next to a Dark Panel. It doesn't matter if he's still within locked panels or if you're on the opposite side of the map, <em>he can still hit you</em>.
</li><li> Dark Cloud, a field attacked used by Cloudman during a Liberation Mission. The damage it does isn't so bad, but it paralyzes anyone in the attack's range, meaning that you have to wait a phase until they can move again. God help you if you tried to rush Cloudman with all your Navis.
</li><li> Rewinding to <em>Battle Network 3</em>, there's Kingman's Plan B. He uses an Area Grab to reduce your running room, moves his Pawns as close to you as possible, and summons a Knight in your side of the field. Let him live long enough, and he'll do it again, this time using only one Pawn and <em>two Knights</em>, again in your field.
</li><li> Gutsman in <em>Battle Network 3</em> is a tricky step-up from his battles in the previous 2 games, but if left at low HP for too long, he uses his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Program Advance</a>. For several seconds, he turns invincible and begins launching several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketPunch">Rocket Punches</a> at you, each one not triggering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility">Mercy Invincibility</a>, and made harder to dodge if he destroyed your terrain moments before. You have to wait this out, which more or less destroys your S-Rank if you ever see him use this attack.

It's the signature move of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a> Gulcasa which kills off his allies, giving him an exponential boost in power for every unit killed. To make matters worse, this move shatters your meter, preventing you from using any cards to defend yourself with. Finally, if he manages to take out all your characters with this move during a skirmish, your morale takes quite a plunge. And you have to face this guy quite a few times. It's possible to get a character that is effectively immune to Genocide, but the route split happens <em>before</em> you first encounter Gulcasa.

It's the signature move of Ordene, which immediately causes him to win if he is alone and at MAX Rage Rate. Oh, and you can't block it with Shield Barrier. Good luck with that. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">There's a way around it; he won't attack Aegina with it.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> #367's Judgment Zero. In her first form it's barely worth mentioning, but in her second form it is practically guaranteed to do Overkill damage, which is an instant loss for you. Like Jihad, it is unblockable and non-elemental, so if she gets it off you <em>will</em> die. It's a lot more manageable in Blaze and Gloria, where it will only deal Overkill damage if Alanjame or Gariored is alone.
</li><li> Gloria Union has Megiddo. It's basically Crusade with a smaller Morale damage bonus, but its user doesn't have to be alone. Once again, it's non-elemental, and Shield Barrier and the new anti-Skill skill Magic Shield do nothing against it.

<ul><li> Many players have learned to fear Ghost Widow. Her darkness based powers are tough, but manageable. Where she really hits you hard is her signature attack <em>Soul Storm</em>, which is a magnitude <em>100</em> hold that deals continuous damage for several seconds. The average magnitude of a hold (including the player version of Soul Storm) is <em>3</em>. Any character hit with this has a very high chance of dying.
</li><li> A close follow up (also from Ghost Widow, though it's available to custom AVs as well) is Dark Regeneration. Dark Regeneration is a mild AoE attack that grants hitpoints depending on how many foes are successfully hit. On a heavily Melee oriented party, this is bad. On a party with one or more Masterminds, this is <em>very</em> bad. Thug and Demon Summoning Masterminds should be particularly wary, as their signature powers (Gang War and Hell on Earth, respectively) amount to what is basically a full heal if used against a Dark Armor wielding Archvillain.
</li><li> The Dilemma Diabolique trial had several attacks. The Sentinel of Mot had a (thankfully optional) power that created a difficult to see white circle around him. For every person within this circle, it would rapidly regenerate hit points.
</li><li> The Underground trial had several instances of annoying. The War Walkers had targeted abilities that grew in power depending on how many people surrounded the marked player. Don't notice and forget to run? Total wipe. And this part is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission">Escort Mission</a>. Thankfully, most groups left the NPC upstairs. What was even more annoying was the timed battle against the Avatar of Hamidon, which featured an automatic Confuse effect that required <em>multiple</em> applications of Status resist powers to avoid. If someone didn't notice the "confused" tag on their status bar, they could end up murdering the entire raid, or worse: HEALING THE BOSS.
</li></ul></li><li> Thresher maws in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">Mass Effect</a></em> continually burrow into the ground and reappear somewhere else. That "somewhere else" can be <em>directly under you.</em> Instant game over. That isn't even getting into its <em>actual</em> attack, spitting out acid which completely ignores your shields and take off more than half of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolTank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolTank">Mako's</a> hit points (if you're fighting on foot, the acid attack is very likely to insta-kill). The general strategy people recommend for thresher maws is "run the hell away."
<ul><li> Biotic enemies love to spam an ability that knocks Shepard down, leaving him/her completely helpless. Fighting against multiple biotics means that you can be stuck to the floor for quite a while, watching your health whittle away without being able to do anything about it (even <em>pause the game</em>).
</li><li> The rocket drones in the Luna base frequently fire extremely powerful rockets. They're almost guaranteed to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> unless you have high-level Immunity or very high shields.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> there are a <em>lot</em> more examples of this trope. There are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Scions</a>, whose Shockwaves tear your shields to pieces and ignore cover. There are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Praetorians</a>, whose Death Choir attack decimates anyone within blast range and fully recharges their Barrier. There's the Oculi, whose energy beams stagger you and deal massive damage. There's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplePuppets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplePuppets">Harbinger himself</a>, who's fond of using a Singularity attack that knocks you out of cover so he can bombard you with Warp blasts.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>, Banshees have a homing Warp attack that inflicts lingering damage, a Nova-like attack that strips shields but is unlikely to kill, and a claw swipe. These are all annoying, but manageable. They also have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice">melee attack</a>, coupled with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportSpam">generous</a> definition of "melee." Other enemies, like Phantoms, Brutes, and Atlas mechs, have instant-kill attacks, but they can only use theirs as a follow-up to a regular melee attack, while the Banshee can grab you the moment you enter its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathRadius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathRadius">"Instant Death" Radius</a>.
</li><li> It's not unheard of in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a>, either. Deathbringer Saurfang, for example, has an ability called "Mark of the Fallen Champion". Players marked by this ability will take massive damage for the rest of the fight, and if they are killed, he will heal himself for a significant amount. You basically just have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">pray</a> he doesn't target a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a>, or you're screwed.
<ul><li> The bosses of Mount Hyjal seem to have this fairly often. Rage Winterchill, the firt boss, has a Death and Decay that does 15% of each victim's <em>maximum</em> health per tick. Azgalor has an attack that targets a player every 45 seconds and kills them after a 20 second debuff expires. Archimonde can fling players into the air with Air Burst, and they must know how to use the Tears of the Goddess correctly, or they will fall to their deaths.
<ul><li> Because of multiple That One Attacks coupled with his status as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>, Archimonde was considered unfarmable by some servers, even after he was nerfed for <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Toward the end of Wrath, if you mentioned the word "Defile" in trade chat, everyone knew what you were talking about. To those not in the know, Defile is an area of effect attack used by the Lich King. He frequently casts it beneath a random player, and its damage <em>and size</em> increase every time someone stands in it even for one tick. If your 25 player raid group mismanages this ability? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">You're dead</a>. To make matters worse, he has <em>another</em> attack that is handled by <em>stacking close together</em>, and since both attacks are on a slightly different timer, they occasionally come out back-to-back. Defile is the reason that, even at the end of the next expansion, when a single character has ten times more health and can output more damage than an entire raid party used to be able to, it still takes a coordinated effort to defeat the Lich King.
</li><li> Even going as far back as classic, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">C'thun</a> had his infamous Eye Beam attack, which would blast a player for respectable damage before bouncing to another, <em>its damage doubling each time</em>. Many stories were recorded about entire 40 man raid groups entering the room at once and getting slammed by this, the very last victims suffering hits in the <em>hundreds of millions</em>. This attack may qualify in-universe for Memetic Badass status, to the point where people have sat down and thought up strategies to maximize its damage, such as taking 40 hunters with 40 pets and having them drop 40 Snake Traps.
</li><li> Garrosh Hellscream has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Touch of Y'Shaarj</span>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a> effect that he puts on certain players. While afflicted players can be broken out after taking enough damage, they will mainly attempt to put the mind control on other members of the party, and if they get off a cast, the situation will spiral out of control. Once Garrosh gets enough energy, it gets Empowered, resulting in the mind-controlled players having more health and becoming immune to stuns, making it harder to interrupt or free them.
</li><li> On Heroic, Wavebinder Kardris of the Kor'kron Dark Shaman encounter uses Iron Prison, an attack that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">does 100% of your maximum health in damage</a>. You can only survive it by being topped off and using a defensive cooldown, while also avoiding all the rest of the raid-wide damage.
</li><li> While the new version of Karazahn is meant to be brutal from start to finish, Attumen the Huntsman in particular has inspired more healer rage on the forums than all the other bosses combined. Why? A fun little mechanic called "Intangible Presence." It places a ghost on one member of the party, which deals heavy damage over time to everyone. If the healer doesn't dispel it quickly, the party will probably wipe. Every time the healer dispels the wrong person, however, they explode, dealing about a quarter of a typical DPS or healer's health to everyone. The cooldown on dispels also means that cleansing the wrong character guarantees another 8 seconds of the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoT">Do T</a>, meaning the party will probably wipe. Of course, the "obey the mechanic or die" check is pretty standard for high-end dungeons and raids. The real problem is how difficult it is to see the ghost which is, well, rather intangible. This problem is only compounded with certain specs that have graphical effects that make it more difficult to see, like shadow priest and bear druid, to say nothing of certain trinkets whose effects actually look a whole lot like the ghost.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastRemnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastRemnant">The Last Remnant</a></em>, certain enemies have an attack called Curse which, when your party is afflicted by it, has a 50% chance of killing you instantly. While you can also give the status effect to enemies, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">guess which one of you will die from it.</a>
</li><li> Three bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PuzzleQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PuzzleQuest">Puzzle Quest</a> 2</em> have literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO">One-Hit KO</a> moves:
<ul><li> The final boss has "Subjugation", which will cause your character to surrender the battle, no matter how many hit points either of you have left.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> The Yeti has "Crushing Blow", which does 999 damage (which is about five times the HP you'll probably have when you first confront him). The regular boss, Iron Golem, also has it, but doesn't have The Yeti's near-broken red mana gain, so if the Golem gets enough to cast, you were probably just a victim of bad luck.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DotHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DotHack">.hack</a></em> has several. The first game has Skeith's "Judgment", which hits the whole party, is impossible to avoid or block, and hits for roughly 70% of your health. Then there's Macha's attack which inflicts Charm on the whole party... which means they beat each other up until it wears off, and you can't heal it because it hits the <em>entire party</em>. Then there's Tarvos's Cursed Death Play, which only targets one character, but cannot be avoided and is a guarenteed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO">One-Hit KO</a>. All of the Phase bosses are also capable of Data Drain, which only targets one party member but destroys their HP and infects a number of status infections. And it can be spammed.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DotHackGU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DotHackGU">.hack//G.U.</a></em>, there's Azure Kite's "Azure Tiger Claws". It is possible to block this, but it requires some very tricky timing: the attack is timed so that if you do a full combo (which is what most players instinctively do), it will hit you during the lag between attacks. Later, in Redemption, there's "Chaos Gehenna", used by Cubia Beta. Once his HP hits around 20-30%, he simply spews a long stream of Gomoras at you. It's next to impossible to dodge, and harder to destroy all of them without taking damage. Also, since this is an Avatar Battle you cannot heal, and if you lose you must restart the battle from the Cubia Alpha phase. Chaos Gehenna is so bad that it can arguably make Cubia into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Orjugan, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ys">Ys</a> VI: The Ark of Napishtim</em>, has a deadly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> style laser blast, which is difficult to dodge without also getting hit by his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatTentacles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatTentacles">Combat Tentacles</a>, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">can kill you in one hit</a> on Hard and Nightmare difficulties.
</li><li> There are more than one here, but the Megiddo technique from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarIV">Phantasy Star IV</a></em> deserves notice. It was a staple attack-all ever since the second game, and suddenly, the final boss has it like your main character. (In addition to sucking up souls or whatever before performing.) Absolutely devastating when the boss decides to remove your buffs, and man can it spam like there's no tomorrow.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireDragonQuarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireDragonQuarter">Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter</a></em> has Malefactor, used by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dragonized Bosch</span>. It afflicts the party with every status in the game. So unless you're going to unleash everything with Ryu's powers, you're gonna want to have even one person with immunity to bail the others out (if not more).
</li><li> Late in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrialsOfMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrialsOfMana">Trials of Mana</a></em>, many level 3 techs when used by the enemies, such as Split-Image Slice or Vacuum Sword, will hurt everyone in the party for around <em>80-90%</em> of their max HP. These attacks can take a fully healed party to critical, or a party in decent shape to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">dead</a>. If two of these are used on you in a row, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">you're just screwed</a>. And keep in mind, these are attacks done by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">normal enemies</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnchantedArms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnchantedArms">Enchanted Arms</a></em> has bonus boss Omega and his Near Death Edge, which, true to its name, instantly chops the HP of anyone hit by it down to 1... and to rub salt in the wound, it also cancels any and all buffs and barriers on the victim, which makes the usual anti-boss tactic of setting up a 90% damage reduction via Raiga's Tiara Crusade more or less worthless. On the flip side, beating Omega allows you to recruit him... and he still has Near Death Edge, which works on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">absolutely anything in the game</a>. Yes, including the final boss.
</li><li> The spell Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateII">Baldur's Gate II</a></em>. On paper, it does 1-8 damage per level of the caster, half on a successful save...but a mage has to be level 15 to know it, meaning an awful lot of damage is being thrown around. This is somewhat unfair when you are a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a> with less than 40 health and oh sorry just failed your saving throw, time to reload. Especially since unless you were a <em>very</em> dedicated grinder you are still two levels away from being able to cast it yourself (which is, admittedly, very therapeutic).
</li><li> Everything used by Sirius in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManStarForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManStarForce">Mega Man Star Force</a> 3</em>. Satellite Blazer, his signature attack, hits every tile of the field and can't be blocked (or dodged for that matter, unless you have Air Shoes). Another favorite move of his is Wing Formation, in which he detaches his wings, which start shooting elemental lasers. He has four wings, so at least one column of the field will <em>invariably</em> have a double-element attack going on. Again, unblockable and also unavoidable; the only real way to survive this move is to keep getting in columns that don't knock you out of a Noise.
<ul><li> Apollo Flame in the second and third game has an attack where he drops a miniature sun on Mega Man's side of the field. This attack comes out very quickly, it can't be dodged or blocked (unless you knock him out of it first), and it cracks your panels. It also hits multiple times, so not even a Barrier can save you.
</li><li> In linked matches, the Gorgon Eye giga card, which appears in all three games. It does a lot of damage and can pierce through invisibility, and also stuns you. God help you if you're in an electric-type form, in which case it deals quadruple-digit damage.
</li></ul></li><li> The final boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkiesOfArcadia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkiesOfArcadia">Skies of Arcadia</a></em> brings us the Silver Nightmare attack, where he possesses one of your party members and forces them to use one of their special moves against one of their own allies. It has priority over EVERYTHING, even defensive moves like Justice Shield, and is the only damaging move in the game that has this high a priority. And the possessed party member loses their action for that turn, and quite often you will see him turning Vyse's Pirates' Wrath into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> of your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a>, making that two actions in one turn you just lost, and often more because you get to watch your characters uselessly start using their shield moves. Have fun catching back up with the battle flow!
<ul><li> As far as ship battles are concerned, there's Bluheim's Blue Winds attack. While technically by itself it does the least damage out of Bluheim's attacks, it causes the <em>entire next round</em> to be filled with nothing but tiles giving an advantage to Bluheim, which is just as painful as it sounds. The only other attack in the game that does this (Auriga's Hull Ram) is easily avoidable by casting Quika; the best you can do with Blue Winds is use the Guard command...in which case the next round is instead filled with tiles that give Blueheim <em>slightly less</em> of an advantage.
</li></ul></li><li> Flash game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonny">Sonny</a></em> has Baron Brixius' Tick Tock debuff, which deals damage equal to 10% of the victim's maximum HP... and continues to do this for 10 turns. It also cuts any healing they receive in half, can be cast on multiple characters at once, and can't be removed by status-removing spells. Note that this game has no multi-target healing and no way to revive dead allies. Note also that Baron Brixius would be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss">Marathon Boss</a> <em>without</em> this attack. With it, he becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>. The only saving grace is he likes to use it on <em>himself</em> if you last long enough.
<ul><li> Almost every class has an ability that reverses damage and healing, seemingly for little reason other then to make this one fight easier. In fact, in one portion of the fight, he will begin spamming an ability that heals a third of his health, this is when you stop inverting damage on yourself, and instead concentrating all the love on him.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EtrianOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EtrianOdyssey">Etrian Odyssey</a></em> games are liberally sprinkled with these, as you'd expect from a game this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a>. In general, almost no enemy's basic attack will seriously endanger anyone so long as you have a healer, but even common enemies have abilities such as giving the entire party status effects or doing enough damage to one-or-two shot even the hardiest Protector. The fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects">Standard Status Effects</a> can entirely <em>prevent</em> these moves from being performed is what keeps them from being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell">Useless Useful Spells</a>.
<ul><li> Shin fron <em>The Drowned City</em> has a nasty one called 'Demon's Kiss'. It hits various random party members multiple (from two to <em>nine</em>) times, for various amounts of damage, and then heals the boss.
</li><li> Enemy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinationAttack">Combination Attacks</a> (signaled by the text "(enemy) stands ready!") can be stopped by killing or disabling the enemy who will perform the attack, but failure to do so and they will do something seriously nasty to your party, such as status effects to all units or just killing at least half of them with massive damage.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TricksterOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TricksterOnline">Trickster Online</a> brings us Suicide, Banish, and Berserker:
<ul><li> Suicide is exactly that - a monster that is threatened will explode, taking you with it. Of course, there are some cases where a monster will Suicide while not actually having taken damage already...
</li><li> Banish is the bane of Freebie Newbies - If you're inside the banish ring after three seconds, you get instantly teleported to The Hub. Most bosses have this as an anti-Tank measure, and one set of boss trials have an entire room dedicated to not getting hit by Banish (while still getting hit by skills that keep you from moving at all)
</li><li> Berserker significantly increases the user's attack power (AP). When a player uses Berserker, they also lose control of their character until the effect ends, and the game selects nearby enemies at random (read: if you use Berserker while in the middle of a crowd, you will do nothing for the first five seconds), it blocks you from using skills, it reduces your health as long as it is active, it lasts for 20 seconds, and you can only start it once every 30 seconds. When a monster uses Berserker, it lasts for 30 seconds, the cooldown is 20 seconds, they can use skills, and they start moving faster. Heaven help you if you come across a monster with both Berserker and Guard Break.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade">Xenoblade</a></em>:
<ul><li> Jade Face/<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gadolt</span>'s Laser Bullet does an absolutely massive amount of ether damage that can easily OHKO party members with lower max HP values, has a huge hit radius that makes it almost guaranteed to hit everybody, and leaves them dazed if they do survive. If you lack the few means of mitigating ether damage effectively and/or aren't of a significantly higher level then him, it can make winning extremely difficult.
<ul><li> Another attack that is very similar are the Dragon's fire breath attacks where they fly out of attack range and do a lot of damage as well as Blaze. However <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Avalanche Abaasy's is far worse then the other's. It also inflicts Paralysis and because of Avalanche Abaasy's huge 3,200 Ether power this does even more damage for the entire party if it connects</span>. What will kill you in this fight is most likely the Blaze damage or the attack itself if you don't have a Level 10 Monado Armour which is almost needed for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Super bosses.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> There's also Titan Stamp from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Magestic Modred and Mischevious Naberius</span>. This attack hits all of your party with a large radius and does a very large amount of damage having an Arts Multiplier of 4.0. Not only that but Monado Speed only works on one person and you won't likely have <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Monado Armour</span> by then which works on everyone.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Avalanche Abaasy</span> also has its Talent Art which can do lots of damage due to how much high its Level is and its Art Multiplier is a 5.5. Just like Titan Stamp it has a large attack radius and hits all of your party members. It can even instantly kill at times if it gets the max multiplier.

<ul><li> In <em>Epic Battle Fantasy III</em>, there's Doomsday, used by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMooksClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMooksClothing">Cosmic Monolith</a>. It deals huge dark-elemental damage to everything on the field - but Cosmic Monolith actually absorbs dark, meaning it can bring your whole party to near death while healing itself. The attack is used every three turns, so if you can't outdamage the healing (taking into account that you also have to recover your health in meantime), you're screwed. An optional fight with two Cosmic Monoliths is actually harder than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>.
</li><li> <em>Epic Battle Fantasy 4</em> has a few, but one of the worst is used by the Clay Idols (which are otherwise a pushover mook). They have an attack that drains a character's MP. What makes it so nasty is that the amount it drains is completely ridiculous; a single hit can steal roughly 90% of a character's MP total, essentially forcing that character into backup so that their MP can (slowly) regenerate and making them practically useless for the rest of the battle, or else forcing you to run away and restore your MP out of battle. For this reason, it's generally recommended to take out Clay Idols on sight, before even buffing (which you would normally spend most of the first turn doing).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Dark Lance</a> is generally considered the toughest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> in <em>IV</em> due to one attack: Unload. In the player's hands, Unload is nothing special, since it's a physical attack on a mainly magical-attacking character, and it debuffs the user's attack afterwards to prevent it from being even remotely spammable. In the enemy's hands, though? Not only does Dark Lance have a sky-high physical attack, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRulesAreNotYourRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRulesAreNotYourRules">Unload does ''nothing'' to his attack stat</a> - he can, and <em>will</em>, use it multiple rounds in a row. And it can hit multiple targets in a single action, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">which your version of Unload cannot do.</a> Like your version, it hits 6 times, and if Dark Lance has previously buffed his Attack stat (and bear in mind that Dark Lance is <em>resistant to dispel</em>), it can easily 2HKO or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">OHKO</a> with just a single one of those shots.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em> has quite a few. Chaos Witch Quelaag has a devastating area of effect explosion attack; even with high fire resistance, it's likely to stagger you and take off quite a chunk of health. It's telegraphed well in advance<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note79ykj');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note79ykj" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note79ykj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">When Quelaag hugs the spider, <em>run</em></span>, but if you don't get your shield up or get away, you'll get your face blasted off.
<ul><li> Grappling attacks are unblockable and will usually take off at least three quarters of your health bar every time you're grabbed. Sure, they're telegraphed, but if you're focusing on finishing off another monster or overestimate your dodging ability, it's very easy to get an amateur tracheotomy courtesy of an Infested Ghoul's teeth, or pecked to death by a Crow Demon, or chewed on by the Gaping Dragon, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManyDeathsOfYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManyDeathsOfYou">or stabbed through the chest by a Wailing Ghost, or smashed into the ground by the Iron Golem</a>...
</li><li> The Basilisk's attack, which spews a gray cloud of fog that causes curse. Curse is easily the deadliest status ailment in the game, and extremely hard to remove.
</li><li> The basic Hollow, the weakest enemy in the game, has an attack where it frantically swings its weapon while dashing forward. Normally even this attack isn't all that strong... unless that Hollow happens to be holding a torch instead of a broken sword, in which case the attack can break pretty much any amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToFlinching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToFlinching">Poise</a> and evaporate your health bar as you are helplessly stunlocked.

<ul><li> Holy Knight Hodrick's ripostes. When Hodrick invades you, he's a faintly absurd parry god who can block your attack, then one-shot you with a riposte to the face.
</li><li> Aldrich, Devourer of Gods, has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gwyndolin's</span> magic arrow bombardment. In his first phase, it draws a straight line that is fairly easy to avoid. In his second, it <em>hunts you down</em>, can stunlock you to death, and lasts for fifteen seconds, which, in the heat of battle, can feel like a week - especially since he doesn't have to do anything to sustain it once it's going, and thus can cast more spells or hit you in the face.
</li><li> The King of the Storm/Nameless King fight is just plain annoying, but the blast attacks are the worst thing about its first phase: the downwards fire breath creates a spreading, fast-growing pulse of fire about the size of Kansas, while the lightning spear shockwave is a devastating blast that's hard to dodge accurately.
</li><li> The Consumed King's charge has a messy hitbox and a wind-up time that is only perceptible to mayflies.
</li><li> In the Twin Princes fight, there's Lorian's teleporting dive attack, which has a wind-up of about a nanosecond. Overextend even a little and he blinks out of existence, then reappears right above you and slams his sword into the top of your head.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> has a bunch of fun attacks. In his first phase, he has some very powerful spells in his sorcery mode, including the ability to put up a proximity-activated soulmass <em>while</em> firing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> that will disintegrate you if you get caught in the blast. In his second, he has a devastating multi-hit combo that's then followed up with a hugely powerful AOE. Get caught by the first and the second will vaporise you.
</li><li> Sword-wielding Ringed Knights have a five-hit sequence that is almost impossible to interrupt. When you see one's sword catch fire, either beat him down before he starts the attack, or <em>get away</em>.
</li><li> Judicator Giants can summon multiple annoying ghosts to attack you, but if the Ruin archers are turning up, <em>hide behind something</em>. They put out agonising volleys of staggered shots that can stunlock you into oblivion.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> Darkeater Midir from the <em>Ringed City</em> DLC gets you coming <em>and</em> going. Sticking close to him in order to hit the head? Get an inch too far underneath and he'll use a downward fire breath attack, that covers a ridiculous amount of ground. Standing back to punish him with arrows or ranged lightning miracles? His Godzilla laser breath draws a line in the ground that deals massive damage...then he whips it around sideways, also dealing massive damage and moving insanely quickly, so you get disintegrated before you can do anything.

This causes the status effect "Cunctitus", which makes you procrastinate. Which is to say, a good 80% of the time you try to make a move in combat, you get the message "You decide to [perform this action] later." This is usually followed by the message, "You lose."
<ul><li> The Protagonist from the preceding area (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Penultimate Fantasy Airship</a>) can cause the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">"Temporary Amnesia"</a> effect, which disables <em>all</em> your skills. Mildly annoying if you're a Muscle or Moxie class which can just spam their default attack to win, deadly if you're a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Mysticality class</a> who relies on spells to fight.
</li><li> To fully qualify, those (along with a high chance of getting poisoned in multiple ways from multiple sources during the next major quest) are the most memorable attacks any non-boss will use against a brand new player, and are nastier than any boss attack up to that point as well. They fit this page because <em>every</em> player at some point was a brand new player and very few will have been ready with appropriate counters to all of those. The game universe as a whole features numerous examples of devastating and truly unfair enemy attacks, but the nature of the game is such that experienced players usually have so many effective fighting styles and metaphorical "I win buttons" ready that it's hard to single anything out as a threat to <em>everyone</em>.

Note that says "damage" and not "drain." "Drained" attributes will go back to normal once the spell wears off. "Damaged" attributes will stick with you until you heal them with a temple blessing or potion.

The rest of his attacks are water-elemenntal, and there is no way to mitigate that at this point the game.
</li><li> Castor has <em>Maelstrom</em>, a single-target attack that deals damage and inflicts slow, berserk, chaos and petrification. If you don't have a way to block at least one of these effects, you'll be spending more of your time recovering from Maelstrom than actually fighting Castor as he pounds you into the floor over and over again.

<ul><li> The Bloodless Prince, a gigantic three-faced golem, is actually relatively easy as long as you stay up close, due to massive telegraphing of his attacks despite their area of effect. Again, if you stay up close. If you don't, the Prince will decide to close the distance by way of flopping onto you from afar, which causes a massive quake that, due to ridiculous, arena-encompassing area of effect, is essentially impossible to properly dodge unless you're at the very edge of the arena.

The only way to avoid this attack is to either be far away so only a few bits reach you, or to be right under her so the fire goes past your head. If you're at medium distance, and don't have an excellent shield up <em>that exact second</em> you are dead, no questions asked. While her other attacks are horribly damaging you can at least survive them with some last-second dodging, but if you're in the impact zone for this one not even the best roll timing will save you.

</li><li> All of the Anubis fights have "I've memorized it!", a stacking general buff. They combine this with Iai Slash, a very strong party attack that just gets even stronger as the fight drags on. Whether you're able to win these fights at all is dependent on how quickly you're able buff your party before they get too powerful.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BetrayalAtKrondor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BetrayalAtKrondor">Betrayal at Krondor</a></em>, the spell "Grief of 1000 Nights" freezes a character for a number of rounds. This is nice when used by one of your mages; however, if enemy mages use it on your party it is far deadlier, as when all of your characters are frozen the game treats it as a Game Over, even if their hit points are still high enough to survive more attacks before the spell wears off. It gets worse in combats with multiple enemy mages, especially if your party screws up a surprise attack and goes last, as sometimes you'll get frozen up so quickly you may not even get a turn.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmoryAndMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmoryAndMachine">Armory &amp; Machine</a></em>:
<ul><li> This trope is invoked with the various rat enemies and Rat King boss in the Badlands, the second area of the game. All of them have rather weak basic attacks, and they also have one attack that has a slower cast time but deals a <em>whopping</em> 300 or 400 HP damage at a point where you have 600 max HP ("Bite" for the Sad Rats and Mad Rats, "Gnaw" for the Dust Crawlers, "Radioactive Bite" for the Glowing Rats, and "Royal Decree" for the Rat King), pretty much guaranteeing a defeat if it hits you. The trick here is to use the Stun ability, which causes their prepared attack to fail and do nothing. Out of the four, the Dust Crawler's Gnaw is especially bad, as it has a much shorter casting/interruption time than the rest of the enemies' dangerous moves.
</li><li> The Vacuous Bats in the Cliffs area will usually use a move called "Fly", which does nothing. However, their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIRoulette">A.I. Roulette</a> will randomly use "Swift Bite", which deals 300 damage to your 600 HP when you first encounter them. If they use this twice before you can beat them, you're toast. You can use Stun to stop it, but that takes up a precious skill slot and will hamper your potential DPS.
</li><li> The Ninja Frogs in the Cliffs are similar to the bats, using several fake-out moves that do nothing, but after their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIRoulette">A.I. Roulette</a> uses "It's Coming", it has a high chance to use "Shuriken" to deal 300 damage, and unlike Swift Bite Shuriken has a far shorter casting time making it harder to anticipate and interrupt. The only good news is that sometimes it might user Honorable Healing instead of Shuriken, which heals you for 100.
</li><li> "Chip Swarm" by the Pebble Swarm. It hits for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">very weak damage but is used extremely rapidly</a>, which will immediately interrupt any of your more powerful attacks that have a cast time, and this also means that it cannot be interrupted since you can only disrupt one of the hits. Furthermore, this attack can last for a huge period of time, eating away at your shields and health. The Rock Golem boss also uses a similar move, but it doesn't last as long as the Pebble Swarm's.
</li><li> Of all <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Original Machine's</a></span> attacks, we have "Target Laser". Its other attacks hit harder at 1000+ damage or so but can be interrupted in the cast period to prevent damage entirely. Target Laser deals only 250 damage but the boss <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpamAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpamAttack">uses it 7 times in a row</a> followed by an 80 damage shot. This would normally seem easy to chain-interrupt as Target Laser's first cast starts slow, but each subsequent casting time is lowered regardless of cast success. You only have four moves that can reliably interrupt them, and they take 10-20 seconds cooldown. This means that unlike all its other moves, you will not be able to interrupt all of it and will take at least 1-3 hits plus another 80 damage at the end.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmoryAndMachine2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmoryAndMachine2">Armory &amp; Machine 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Snake and the JrBot have "Paralyze", which permanently stuns you until they kill you with their attacks. The good news is that it has a long charge time to interrupt and is a great opportunity for you to use Bomb on them. The Wild Snake's version of Paralyze fortunately only stuns you for 8 seconds, but it's still a good way for it to deal heavy damage on you.
</li><li> "Crab Toxin" and "Poison", used by the Giant Crabs and Toxic Slimes respectively in the Wilderness. Unlike the regular Crab's Crab Poison which merely lowers the damage of your next attack by 5, these two inflict an <em>actual</em> poison status that lasts 30 seconds and lingers even after the battle ends, halves all your damage dealt, and deals 2 damage to you every few seconds which will interrupt your casting time attacks. Players who assume that they can simply take this Poison as lightly as Crab Poison will be in for a <em>very</em> rude awakening.
</li><li> The Zombie's "Bite". It isn't a very painful move but the Zombie can spam it if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIRoulette">A.I. Roulette</a> chooses to, and if the attack connects (due to overwhelming your interruption move cooldowns) it will heal the Zombie for 50 of its already-high 200 HP, effectively wasting 1/4 of your efforts in killing it.
</li><li> The Forest Nymph's "Protect". It has an extremely fast cast time, tends to be used almost every alternate turn, and if not interrupted it will provide a damage shield to the Nymph. Said damage shield makes them regenerate health from Blast- and Explosion- type moves (pretty much your entire arsenal for the first 4 areas of the game) and lasts 10 long seconds, meaning that if they manage to pull this off <em>once</em>, you're as good as dead if you lack any physical or elemental attacks.
</li><li> The Angry Orc and the Sleepy Guardian Orc have "Club Smash", which deals a huge 40 damage where you have only 100 max HP. It's the first long-casting attack in both games that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToFlinching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToFlinching">cannot be interrupted</a></em>. This enforces you to have both a healing move and a way to increase your dodge or defense, and if it's used multiple times in succession to overrun your Regen use, you're out of luck. It's one of the reasons why the Sleepy Guardian Orc is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">toughest of the five bosses in the Wilderness</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranblueFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranblueFantasy">Granblue Fantasy</a></em>, having as many raid bosses as it does, has its fair share of these.
<ul><li> Colossus Omega's Dimensional Cleave, which has a damage output so high that not even Phalanx III is strong enough to stop its target from getting killed, even if you're using a Water team. This attack is what makes this raid a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss">Wake-Up Call Boss</a> for some newer players, as mitigating it can be a challenge.
</li><li> Conjunction, used by both versions of Grand Order. It's a party-wide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne">HP to 1</a> attack, and on the easier version of the raid, it also <em>randomizes the cooldown length</em> of all your skills. If it happens to shut you out of your healing skills for several turns... well, hopefully you have a spare Full Elixir to get back into the fight.
</li><li> Proto Bahamut (both the regular and Impossible versions) has Skyfall, which deals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixedDamageAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixedDamageAttack">ten million</a> dark damage to the entire party. This <em>will</em> kill you unless you're able to get a full damage cut for the party. And the regular version is guaranteed to use it twice during the fight.
</li><li> While the Impossible version of Proto Bahamut isn't guaranteed to use Skyfall, it <em>is</em> guaranteed to use the way nastier Supernova, which deals 95% of each party member's maximum HP as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonElemental" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonElemental">plain damage</a>. While it does less damage than Skyfall, it is <em>much</em> harder to guard against, as plain damage ignores most defensive buffs; the only way to survive it is to make sure you're as diligent as possible with healing.
</li><li> Any attack that can fully remove buffs from the party can be this depending on what the boss can follow up with, but special mentions go to the following:
<ul><li> Luminiera Omega's Blade of Light, which randomly hits for big damage five times, fully dispels the party, and as the cherry on top, it paralyzes a random party member. If you're unlucky, this can come right after Aegis Unmerge, making her attacks much stronger and potentially wiping the party.
</li><li> Anubis's Ophois, which hits the whole party, removes all buffs, and has a chance to lower multiattack rate and debuff resistance and/or, even worse, inflict Zombie on them. What makes this one so bad is that Anubis is guaranteed to use it at least five times during the fight, and it gets progressively stronger the lower its health gets, to the point of needing some heavy damage cuts to tank it near the end.
</li><li> Europa's Floral Prison doesn't do damage and only dispels one character as opposed to your whole party, but it makes up for this with the two status effects it also inflicts on the unlucky target; Azure Spike and Held Under. The former makes any attacks from the character <em>heal Europa</em> (and there's no way to stop them from attacking unless a status effect prevents it), while the latter prevents any healing on them, lowers their accuracy, and makes them take heavy damage each turn.
</li></ul></li><li> Avatar has Archenemy, which is Skyfall taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> &mdash; <em>one hundred million</em> dark damage to all allies. Fortunately, it only uses it once.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LISA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LISA">LISA: The Painful</a></em>, "Neck Break", "Heart Squeeze", "Fatal Chomp", and "Decapitate". These are the only four moves in the game that can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath">permakill</a> your party members, even if they're at full health. The worst part is that, while most bosses are obviously capable of using these moves, many random <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mooks</a> are also able to use these to completely wreck your party composition at a moment's notice.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowHeartsFromTheNewWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowHeartsFromTheNewWorld">Shadow Hearts: From the New World</a></em> both strongest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> have a move called Lost Progress. True to its name, it debuffs any buff that was just applied to any member of your party. Yes, even if boss did not have a turn it just skips and debuffs you right away, so even Entrance is not usable. However, since developers felt this was not awful enough, after this boss gets <em>an extra turn</em>. This essentially means fighting entire battle without any buffs.

Unfortunately, said attack resembles something from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">Bullet Hell</a>: it generates a minefield of indestructible red mines that absorb your shots. Made worse is the fact that you have a large collision box.

<ul><li> <em>III</em> has The Fool's final attack pattern, in which he jumps from one side of the cage to your side, swiping you in the process. To prevent his swipe from hitting you, you must hit his remaining claw 6 times in what little time you have. Now, your gun has 6 shells. If you miss even ONE of those shots, you <em>will</em> fail because it takes too much time to reload. Oh, and did you bring a second player with you? Well, now you must hit him <strong>12</strong> times, or 6 shots from each player. Which means if the other player is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Noob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Noob">not very good</a>, or is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Scrub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Scrub">some dumb kid who is fooling around</a>, you are royally fucked. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">Even if all of your shots are spot-on.</a></em>
</li><li> The Magician from the first and second games switches from fireballs to hard to counter melee attacks in the second and fourth phases of the battle. It's hard enough to shoot his weak spots, but it's worse when he attacks so quickly.
</li><li> <em>The Typing of the Dead</em>'s version of the Magician, like other bosses in the game, has a gimmick. His gimmick is particularly brutal: Type out phrases before he attacks you as usual, but if you so much as make a single typo against his melee attacks, he will damage you. (This mimics the difficulty of tracking his blurringly fast circle-strafing preceding them.) Hope you can touch-type without letting your fingers slip!
</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hellsinker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hellsinker">Hellsinker</a></em> we have Perpetual Calendars "Lunatic Phantom". It's a blue flame that flies around the stage in a semi-random pattern at high speed. It also cannot be suppressed meaning that if it catches up to you, you will either lose a life or burn an auto reject.
<ul><li> In the Shrine of Farewell we have Million Lives' "Innocent Clockwork", which spews out cogs that <em>block non-piercing attacks.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChimeraBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChimeraBeast">Chimera Beast</a></em> has a move where it uses its horns to fire electric balls offscreen. Seconds later, the screen gets filled with damaging, hard-to-avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PillarOfLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PillarOfLight">pillars of lightning</a>, which strikes a number of times depending on how many electric balls got fired off. If all the boss' horns are still alive, it becomes extremely hard to avoid.
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleGaregga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleGaregga">Battle Garegga</a></em>, Black Heart's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureMove">signature</a> machinegun spread. If it doesn't rotate, you live. If it <em>does</em>, prepare for some <em>very</em> precise moves, as the sweep may change direction up to two times. Black Heart mk2 also boasts this and makes even more back-and-forth sweeps that will kill any player who is not fully focused.

Even players who can dodge the rest of Hibachi's attacks without difficulty have extreme problems with this attack.
</li><li> <em>Aliens Armageddon</em> has the penultimate attack used by the giant winged Xenomorph <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> once it takes to the air. You need to shoot 5-7 weak points that are spread out on its head and wings in a <em>very</em> limited amount of time. If you fail to do so, it will fly into and destroy the escape craft, which causes you to fail the mission (aka you have to go through the entire level and boss again). There is <em>no indication</em> that failing to prevent this causes a mission failure, as another similar-looking attack pattern simply damages you if not prevented. Tellingly, the game even takes pity on you if you failed to prevent the attack and reached this point again, since you only have to shoot down 3 rather closely-spaced weakpoints on its head and wings instead of 5-7 that are spread out.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Dark Mantle's</a> lightning attack in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KikiKaiKai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KikiKaiKai">Pocky &amp; Rocky</a></em> for the SNES. It's not difficult to <em>avoid</em>, but it chases you around the arena for a very long time and you can't effectively attack until it's over. It's basically the video game equivalent to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Youtube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Youtube">Youtube advert</a> in that it effectively just halts the battle for a period of time and there's nothing you can really do about it until it's over.

That means MORE characters that get affected by it! It doesn't help that Hitsugaya has to be in Bankai when he uses it, so you'll take even more damage that isn't connected to that attack (In Bankai, anyone within a two-space radius of Hitsugaya takes damage and can be potentially frozen, lowering accuracy and evasion.)
</li><li> It's not an attack, but Absolute Defense is too horrible of a move to not mention it. A character with this will randomly (much more often than not) take single-digit damage from ANY attack. Yes, even Co-Op attacks. A lot of bosses in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Kisuke's Tower</a> have it, and it is <em>extremely</em> frustrating.

Having that uber-powerful character with ultimate weapons isn't so nice when he's <em>killing your team</em>. Worse is that Berserk's success rate is based on the target's Resistance stat, which most physical fighters tend to lack.

</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The Titan Dweevil's Monster Pump in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin2">Pikmin 2</a></em>. It shoots balls of water everywhere and has incredible reach. If you're not paying attention to both of your pilots you could potentially end up with your entire army drowning.
</li><li> Stun grenades from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JaggedAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JaggedAlliance">Jagged Alliance</a> 2</em>. Everyone within the area of effect, which is quite large, has their stamina bar take a <em>huge</em> hit that will almost certainly render them unable to perform any action during their next turn. And if you're lucky, some of them will have recovered by the turn after that. You can mitigate the worst effects of this one whilst outdoors by not letting your team get bunched up, but heaven help you if you run across a Mook with one of these whilst trying to fight your way through a narrow corridor.
</li><li> The online Bleach game <em>Soul Arena</em> has balance patches released for it every so often, so abilities that fit this description are usually nerfed after a little while. However, there's one particular attack that stands out as particularly nasty, in the form of Bankai Gin's "Kill, Shinsou". It deals damage each turn, starting at 5 (out of 100 HP) and <em>doubling</em> every turn. And there's no way to get rid of the effects unless you are able to negate it before it starts, so your character will inevitably die if they are targeted by this skill.
</li><li> Baal's Ultimate Force/T.O. Force evility from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea4APromiseUnforgotten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea4APromiseUnforgotten">Disgaea 4: A Promise Unforgotten</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisgaeaDimension2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisgaeaDimension2">Disgaea Dimension 2</a></em>, which allows Baal to perform his normal attack from any distance as soon as one of the player's units enters the battlefield. When coupled with his ridiculous stats, Baal can easily take out the player's entire party before the player can even make a move (<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryx7i0gCM6M&amp;t=2m38s">as shown here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IronMarines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IronMarines">Iron Marines</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Overseer's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">Macross Missile Massacre</a>. Not only can it be used from a long distance when it takes to the air and retreats from your units, it deals a <em>massive</em> amount of damage to troops and heroes. Unlike the Fell Bishop's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpit">Super Spit</a> attack which is an avoidable splash damage projectile, this is pretty much unavoidable thanks to being homing missiles. The Overseer's other attack is a claw slam which is only used when it's grounded and is far less painful. Thankfully, the missile storm isn't an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack">Armor-Piercing Attack</a> and thus can be easily tanked by an armored <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Brawler</a>, but if another unit happens to be somewhat near the Brawler it will also get targeted too for big damage.
</li><li> One of Nexus' hand attacks, specifically the one where he turns blue, can be a lot more dangerous than the others. He'll fire a load of meteors into the air that will hit certain spots around your Tortugon, and each is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> &mdash; if you fail to move the slow-moving Tortugon out of there, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCannotGoOnWithoutYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCannotGoOnWithoutYou">you lose</a>. Even if you did manage to dodge it, they'll leave behind obstacles that block the Tortugon's way and must be targeted if you wish to to destroy them. Since you will most likely be targeting Nexus, the purple devices he drops, or his hands, this makes the meteors quite frustrating to remove, and worse still, the meteor attack can sometimes land in a way such that your Tortugon cannot avoid it causing an instant defeat. Thankfully, you can disrupt this attack by targeting his hand and hitting it enough.
</li><li> Nexus' other nasty attack occurs in his final phase where he drops 3-6 (depending on difficulty) purple devices with a timer countdown around your Tortugon. Firstly, you need to target them in order to destroy them before they activate, and you can only target one at a time. Secondly, this attack <em>cannot be disrupted</em> unlike Nexus' single-hand attacks. Third, if you fail to destroy any of them before time's up, it turns into a large, slow-moving, lingering purple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SphereOfDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SphereOfDestruction">Sphere of Destruction</a> that deals high continuous damage on contact with your units then explodes for even bigger damage after a long while, and each ball will be aimed directly at your Tortugon. This, along with the Tortugon's incredibly slow speed as well as the fact that you lose if the Tortugon is destroyed, makes it a very frustrating attack.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NintendoWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NintendoWars">Nintendo Wars</a></em> has a few <em>savage</em> CO Powers that you'll have to contend with through the games:
<ul><li> Prepare to cry when Eagle uses Lightning Strike, which allows all his non-infantry units to move a second time that turn. As he's already a difficult opponent to face due to the already devastatingly powerful air units being even stronger under his command, him using this power can easily take you from dominating him to being so crippled that you can't possibly win the battle any longer and the only real defense against it is hoping you're lucky enough to survive the onslaught, especially since it actually weakens the defense of his air units in <em>Advance Wars 1</em>.
</li><li> Kindle's Urban Blight in <em>Advance Wars: Dual Strike</em> not only gives her 180% attack on urban properties but also damages any of your own units on urban properties by 3 HP. Note that an urban property is a city, factory, port, airport, or even your own HQ, so this means further damaging units you were trying to repair, forcing you to spend funds repairing a ton of units, impeding any units attempting to capture properties, and of course rendering you weak for a devastating high-power attack from her. Worse is that Urban Blight is only her regular CO Power, not her super, and that she only needs three stars to use it: she will use it <em>very</em> often.
</li><li> Colin's <strong>Power Of Money</strong> is <em>the</em> reason he's considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">so thoroughly broken</a>. It gives him a 3.33% firepower boost for every $1000 of money he has, which can lead to absurd things like infantry shooting down <em>neotanks</em>. Worse, is that he builds units cheaper than others so he'll always have money on hand, his regular CO power increases his funds, and in <em>Dual Strike</em> pairing him with Sasha and using their Tag Power allows her to boost their funds and <em>then</em> attack with Colin's overpowered units. Yikes.
</li><li> Rachel's Covering Fire, also from <em>Dual Strike</em> is absurdly powerful as it launches <em>three silo missiles</em>: the first one will target the largest group of foot soldiers and prioritize hitting foot soldiers that are capturing properties while the subsequent two missiles try to cause as much monetary damage as possible. Be thankful that you only fight her in Money Survival and Vs. Mode.
</li><li> The alterations made to how CO powers charge in <em>Dual Strike</em> make it very difficult to rout Sensei due to how fast they charge. His regular CO power, Copter Command, will deploy infantry in every city that he owns if they don't have a unit waiting there while his Super CO power, Airborne Assault, deploys Mechs in all of his cities if said cities are not occupied by other units. Both powers also deploy those troops with 9 HP and they can move immediately.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em>: each of the game's ranked multiplayer modes has at least one type of special that can be utterly <em>devastating</em>. Fortunately there's nothing stopping you from turning the tables by using them yourself:
<ul><li> The Ink Strike in Splat Zone mode. It can be launched from anywhere on the map and clears the zone out quite easily.
</li><li> The Killer Wail in Tower Control: There's literally no way to maintain control of the tower when the attack is launched; either you jump off to avoid the attack, or get splatted.
</li><li> The Kraken in Rainmaker Mode: The Kraken's invincibility and mobility mean that the player holding the Rainmaker has pretty much no way of countering it.
</li></ul></li><li> The Edged Weapons Experts in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpecOpsTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpecOpsTheLine">Spec Ops: The Line</a></em> sprint towards the player (often haphazardly running between cover elements) with very little warning to come in with a powerful stab attack (which gets upgraded to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> on the hardest difficulty). There is actually an achievement for killing one that is extremely close to you.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JetForceGemini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JetForceGemini">Jet Force Gemini</a></em>'s second fight with Mizar has the infamous "electric jump rope", which does extremely high damage and the speed at which it moves is random; it'll be incredibly quick in one case and then move at a snail's pace in the next. The awkward camera angles depending on where Mizar is make things even trickier. Worse, since Mizar has no set pattern to his attacks, it's entirely possible to encounter this move multiple times in a row. It's probably 80% of the reason the Mizar rematch is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">hair-pullingly tough to fight.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe">Warframe</a></em> has a few.
<ul><li> Grineer Bombards' primary means of attack is a homing rocket that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunctuatedForEmphasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunctuatedForEmphasis">never. Stops. Chasing you.</a> The only ways to avoid getting hit are to shoot it down or trick it into colliding with an obstacle, but you'll have to notice the rocket in all the mayhem first, and you can still get hurt by the explosion if you're close enough.
</li><li> Grineer Manics are frustrating to fight in the first place, but woe betide you if one manages to tackle you from behind. You'll be pinned to the floor helplessly while it dishes out heavy damage. Unless one of your teammates is nearby to shoot it off, you're almost certainly going to die. Fortunately, Manics are fairly rare in the first place, and they don't often use this attack.
</li><li> Grineer Commanders (sensing a theme here?) have their own version of Loki's Switch Teleport power, swapping places with a clueless player. The teleport leaves its victim stunned for a couple seconds, during which time enemies (including the Commander itself) are free to attack with no repercussions. Unfortunately, Commanders tend to blend in with other Grineer troops, and the teleport is incredibly difficult to interrupt; it's entirely possible to kill the Commander during the animation, only for the teleport to go off anyways.
</li><li> Sapping Ospreys drop small mines that project a large damaging field. If you're foolish enough to step into the field, your health will be drained rapidly, ensuring death if you stick around for very long. There are just a couple issues. First, while the visual effects appear to be a flat circle, the field is actually spherical, so trying to leap over them doesn't help. Second, you almost never have a single Sapping Osprey to worry about, and each Osprey fires off mines fairly often, which means they can turn entire rooms into uninhabitable death zones. And Sapping Ospreys can be incredibly difficult to tell apart from their relatively-harmless Shield Osprey cousins.
</li><li> Ancient Disruptors have a chance to inflict Magnetic procs with each melee attack, scrambling your HUD and draining your shields and energy while preventing you from regaining either for a short while. They also project an aura that lets their allies drain your energy with each attack, making them high-priority targets.
</li><li> The Infested Juggernaut and its big brother, the Juggernaut Behemoth, have a nasty attack that launches a shotgun-style blast of spines at their foes. The spines are fast, basically invisible, and more than capable of shredding any Warframe without special damage mitigation, so you'll rarely have time to react before you get mysteriously one-shot. Technically speaking, the attack is telegraphed, but the Juggernauts' animations are so ambiguous that you might not realize what's happening, and the telegraph in question happens to be revealing one of the only spots where the Juggernaut can be damaged, so you'll probably be more focused on trying to bring the thing down instead.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder14');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tower Defense&nbsp;</div><div id="folder14" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlantsVsZombies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlantsVsZombies">Plants vs. Zombies</a></em> has Dr Zomboss' desperation attack, in which he drops a caravan onto six of your plants, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">instantly squashing them</a>. Unlike most of his other moves, this one cannot be avoided. Thankfully, it is predictable (he only uses it once he is below half health, immediately after he gets back up from attacking). It gets used much more frequently in the "Revenge of Dr. Zomboss" minigame, where it becomes exponentially more aggravating.
<ul><li> The sequel introduces the Gargantuar Prime, who acts like a Gargantuar with an extra attack &mdash; sweeping <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams">Eye Beams</a> that deal huge damage to up to two plants in your back rows, usually frying the plants unfortunate enough to be hit. They can easily devastate a garden if they get to use it one too many times, and God help you if they randomly targeted an expensive, powerful plant like Winter Melon.
</li><li> If laser eye beam tech was bad enough, the Wizard Zombie's magic is <em>worse</em>. While these guys <em>can</em> eat (rarely seen, only used if Infi-nut's barrier is in the way) their main ability zaps a plant in front of them (or on other lanes) with a ray, turning the affected plant into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph">completely useless sheep</a> that can't even be removed. And they can do it multiple times if not killed in time, turning your whole field into sheep. The only way to turn them back is to kill the wizard that did it.
</li><li> Similar to the Wizard Zombie, we also have the Octo Zombie. While they will attempt to eat lily pads, their other attack is <em>even worse</em> than the Wizard's transformation ray &mdash; they throw an octopus which binds your plant up to make them useless, and can bind up all your plants in octopi if not killed in time. Unlike the sheep ray, the octopus must be killed to restore the plant, and said octopus is pretty tough to remove without instants.
</li><li> MC Zom-B's microphone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinAttack">Spin Attack</a> that he only uses during the Rap Jam. It deals an incredible amount of damage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathRadius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathRadius">in a 3x3 area around him</a> by spinning his mic, enough to one-shot any non-defensive plant and two-shot wall-nuts. Even worse, he shares a favoured Jam with the Breakdancer Zombie, whose Rap Jam ability kicks other zombies forwards. This includes MC Zom-B, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinationAttack">then proceeds to wipe your plants out with his mic</a>.
</li><li> Hair Metal Gargantuar's sonic blast, available while his Metal Jam plays, will destroy plants in the same row and travels the whole length of the lawn. The only defenses are Infi-Nuts, where the projector will survive the effect and block it indefinitely, and Primal Wall-Nuts, which can survive three blasts.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">The Destroyer</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MiniRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MiniRobotWars">Mini Robot Wars</a></em> merges two of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlantsVsZombies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlantsVsZombies">Dr Zomboss</a>' attacks and cranks it up to eleven. Its deadliest move has it open its mouth and fire out a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> at two of your rows. Sure, you can move a few of your minirobots out of the way, but this attack will most likely destroy any non-defensive unit in the area of effect. Worst of all, this attack comes out <em>without warning</em>, unlike Dr Zomboss' caravan!

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria">Terraria</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Moon Lord's Phantasmal Deathray, where his middle-eye will open up and fire a beam that sweeps from left to right. The beam deals insane amounts of damage (150 on the default difficulty, and in this game the absolute maximum health one can have is 600), has good reach, and because the Moon Lord aggressively follows the player around, getting over or away from the attack is easier said than done. This must also be dealt with while he's firing other attacks at the same time. In 1.3, the Deathray could be guarded against by a ceiling of solid blocks, but 1.4 buffed him so that his laser pierces through any blocks between it and the player. Dodging it can be done much more easily with the Rod of Discord, but it takes a great amount of patience and/or luck to get that thing in the first place.
</li><li> The Eye of Cthulhu's Expert and Master-exclusive dash attack. Once its health gets low enough, it will start dashing five times in quick succession while making a higher-pitched version of its roar, likely ramming unsuspecting players. The lower its health gets, the more often it does this, until it's doing it almost all the time when it's nearly dead. Since the Eye of Cthulhu is generally the "first" or "second" boss of the game, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss">it also doubles as an early clue that bosses do not play around on Expert.</a>

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder16');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-Video Games&nbsp;</div><div id="folder16" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7-10_split#7.E2.80.9310_split">7-10 split<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in bowling. Trying to turn one into a spare? GOOD LUCK. The U.S. Bowling Congress used to give out an award for any confirmed 7-10 conversion in an amateur league.
</li><li> The 'Greek Church', leaving the 4, 6, 7, 10, and either the 8 or the 9 pins up. The 7-10 is more notorious because it's the furthest distance laterally between any two pins, and one of the two appears to need to be knocked over sideways to get to the other, <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note868bw');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note868bw" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note868bw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">However, one can bounce a pin off of the back wall (which isn't clearly visible from the bowler's point of view) to get it to the other one. Granted, something like that still requires a lot of power, though a little less precision than getting it to slide straight sideways.</span> and thus is perceived as the most difficult.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck">Homestuck</a></em>, the bearer of the queens' rings or the kings' scepters are granted a number of powers:
<ul><li> The most commonly dangerous one is Red Miles, which is the Black Queen's signature attack. When used, the Miles will hunt down <em>anyone or everyone on a planet</em> and stab them through with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a>. If this is done to a Genesis Frog from outside the universe it embodies by an especially powerfully prototyped ring, it can <em>kill off that universe after impaling everyone and everything in it</em>. The only way to escape is to either flee the universe or to be travelling so fast that the miles can't track you. This attack is why it is imperative not to allow the Black Queen's ring to fall into the hands of any of her agents.
</li><li> In the Trolls' session, Feferi prototypes her sprite (and thus all the monarchs) with a city-sized <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> whose psychic scream can kill off <em>every member of her species in the galaxy</em> except for her and the Empress she's in line to replace. Unfortunately, the Black King of their session gains this ability, requiring a truly stupendous number of alternate timeline clones of her group's strongest psychic to nullify.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>:
<ul><li> If you're not prepared for it, the spell Harm can qualify. A successful shot will reduce you to 1d4 HP <em>regardless of how many you have</em>. (Granted, it can be resisted, saved against, interrupted, countered, etc.) And there's the arguably-more-annoying reverse spell, Heal, that can restore a boss to full health from whatever it happens to be at. This is precisely why Harm and Heal were capped to 150 points of damage or healing in 3.5 Edition.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">The developers of 3.5</a> consider any attack which results in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelDrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelDrain">level loss</a> to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFateWorseThanDeath">A Fate Worse Than Death</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> because losing one level is literally the worst that can happen as a result of a character dying due to the resurrection spells</span>, and grounds for immediately rolling a new character.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Adamantine Horror</a> gets <em>Mordenkainen's Disjunction</em> as a spell-like ability, to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons">destroy all your buffs and magic stuff</a>, many levels below when anything else does.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SentinelsOfTheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SentinelsOfTheMultiverse">Sentinels of the Multiverse</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Chairman's Prison Break card can basically undo multiple turns of effort by getting all his underbosses back from the discard pile, allowing the underbosses to bring minions back from the same pile.
</li><li> Grand Warlord Voss's Forced Deployment also brings back his minions, which can mean he wins the game at the start of his turn if it brings back too many. Additionally, if you destroy it, that just means it triggers early; this lets you whittle down his horde before it triggers his instant-win, but it's still a pain in the neck.
</li><li> Omnitron's Technological Singularity, which destroys all equipment and deals damage to its users for every item destroyed, can devastate equipment-heavy parties. For bonus points, there are turns where both versions of Omnitron can play two cards in a turn, meaning that you can have Technological Singularity and Sedative Flechettes (which deals damage to all heroes and destroys their ongoings) come out on the same turn and completely reset your field.
</li><li> Citizen Dawn doesn't even need to play two cards to reset your field; Devastating Aurora will erase your entire board presence except for targets <em>immediately</em>.
</li><li> Kaargra Warfang's Fickle Fans card can shift the Favour balance in her fight from a close engagement to a doomed failure instantly.
</li><li> Wager Master's Ongoing "What Do You Really Know?", which shuffles hero cards into his deck and deals damage to a hero when their cards show up on top, has a high damage output, screws with the heroes by shuffling away potentially useful cards, basically shuts down another win condition where you have to empty Wager Master's deck to win, and just as the cherry on top cannot even be removed by any means.
</li><li> An early Strength of the Grave or relic can make Gloomweaver obnoxiously harmful by either enhancing his zombies or just plain trashing your hand, field or health.
</li><li> OblivAeon has Tear Through Reality and Global Devastation. In his first form, OblivAeon gets a large damage bonus, which combines with both of those cards' multiple stages of damage to wreak utter havoc, and since Tear Through Reality moves <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OblivAeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OblivAeon">Obliv Aeon</a> to the largest group of heroes and Global Devastation hits everyone everywhere, you can't even avoid them by running away like you could with some of his other attacks. For bonus points, these will destroy Aeon Men, meaning that if there's an Aeon Locus out (and there are six in the Aeon Deck) <em>he gets another play</em>.
