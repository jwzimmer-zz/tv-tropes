If they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero's</a> trusted friend in the novel, the film adaptation should convey that as well, but wait &mdash; why is the hero's trusted friend from the novel, suddenly giving him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofAlly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofAlly">the cold shoulder</a> in the motion picture? Why is the faithful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> from the manga two-timing him in the anime? And the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableRogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableRogue">Lovable Rogue</a>, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustLikeRobinhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustLikeRobinhood">gives to the poor</a> in the television series, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">only cares about lining his own pockets</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie">Made-for-TV Movie</a>. They weren't like that before, so what happened?
</p><p>The answer is: the character has suffered from Adaptational Jerkassery, the narrative equivalent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass">Taking a Level in Jerkass.</a>
</p><p>Whatever the reasons, the writer(s) has seen fit to change the character's original positive portrayal, to make them more of a jerk. Perhaps the character was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a> in the original work, but the adaptation failed to convey the "heart of gold" aspect. Thus, turning them into a total jerk. Or it could be due the adaptation being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> than the original, and the character's portrayal was changed accordingly.

</p><p>Because of the nature of the trope, it's obviously related to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass">Took a Level in Jerkass</a> and by extension contrasts with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInKindness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInKindness">Took a Level in Kindness</a>.

</li><li> In the anime adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano">Bokurano</a></em>, Machi loses her temper during a discussion with Anko and Komo, briefly accusing the other two girls of being the uncontracted pilot (i.e. the one who doesn't have to take a turn fighting for the planet, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which will inevitably result in their death</span>), for no apparent reason other than <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">possibly to prevent them from suspecting that <em>she's</em> the uncontracted pilot</span>. Apart from that, the adaptation mostly sticks to her characterization as a fairly nice person who cares for Kana and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">regrets getting the kids signed up to fight in the first place</span>.
</li><li> Leon MacNicol in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis">Bubblegum Crisis</a></em> OVA was supportive of the Knight Sabers. Leon in the Tokyo 2040 remake considers the team vigilantes and a blight on the AD Police.
</li><li> When Nelvana dubbed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em> into English and rebranded it into <em>Cardcaptors,</em> they gave much of the characters, including Sakura herself, more of a jerkish attitude.

But in the manga <em>Corpse Party: Musume</em>, he's on another level, as he himself admits, he only cares about Ayumi (and even then he isn't exactly nice to her either as he tries to grope her), and for him, the rest of the survivors can get by themselves.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DDFistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DDFistOfTheNorthStar">DD Fist of the North Star</a></em> has Toki, who does have jerkass tendencies in comparison to his original counterpart who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KungFuJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KungFuJesus">Kung-Fu Jesus</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a>. <em>DD</em> has Toki attempting get a job as a part-timer in Ryuken's store, and will use any means to get the job, such as having Raoh arrested for murdering Jyuza.
</li><li> Ryo Asuka is subjected to this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DevilmanCrybaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DevilmanCrybaby">DEVILMAN crybaby</a></em>. Even before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he's revealed to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a></span>, he wasn't exactly a pleasant guy in the manga, and had a ruthless streak within him, but said ruthlessness is amped up considerably in the anime, with an extreme willingness to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog">Shoot the Dog</a> that would come off as outright sociopathic if it wasn't for the humanizing interactions he has with Akira.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, Goku invites Gohan to participate in the tournament against Universe 6, but Gohan has to decline because of an academic conference scheduled on the same day. In the anime, we see the conversation happen (Gohan was excited at the prospect, but then remembered the conference) and Goku is disappointed but understands how important Gohan's job is to him; in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBallSuper">manga adaptation</a> Goku tells us this after the fact while dismissively calling Gohan a bookworm.
</li><li> Louise Fran&ccedil;oise le Blanc de la Valli&egrave;re from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero">The Familiar of Zero</a></em>. In the novels, she's still overly violent, but she has more good moments and development and actually <em>does</em> get called out on her abuse of Saito when, instead of using her normal whip to "Punish" Saito, she uses an actual <em>bullwhip</em> to knock out an already battle-weary Saito from the night before. As of her anime incarnation, well... It's understandable why many people have been turned off by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> as a whole due to characters like her, and why many fans of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> archetype are <em>very</em> put off by her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FateKaleidLinerPrismaIllya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FateKaleidLinerPrismaIllya">Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA&#9734;ILLYA</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sella, one of Illya's maids, was merely suspicious and critical towards Shiro but did at least treat him fairly. That was all thrown out the window in this spin-off she becomes outright abusive towards him. To wit, she once viciously beat him up all because <em>his cooking was making her gain weight.</em>
</li><li> The same applies to Rin Tohsaka, who is all but willing to call a small child her slave, and then force said child to fight against corrupted spirits against her will. She thankfully <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInKindness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInKindness">eases up</a> once she recognizes the stress she's causing.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>:
<ul><li> Solf J Kimblee gets hit with this in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">first anime adaptation</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>. While the manga version of Kimblee was undoubtedly insane, he could be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">quite charming</a> and had genuine respect for people with strong integrity and convictions. The anime version of Kimblee, on the other hand, treats everyone around him with naked comtempt.
</li><li> The townspeople of Xenotime in the anime's two-parter "The Other Brothers Elric." In the original Light Novel <em>The Land of Sand</em> that the episodes are based on while they believed that Russell and Fletcher Tringham are "the real Elric brothers" and initially treat the real Ed and Al coldy, they come to realize that the two are genuine alchemists who could still help them, with one person suggesting that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame">they do share similar names, but just aren't the famed "Elric Brothers"</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SureLetsGoWithThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SureLetsGoWithThat">(which Ed decides to go along with rather than cause a fuss)</a> and ultimately treat the brothers nicely for most of the book. In the tv episodes, they simply believe the real Ed and Al to be con artists stealing their identities, completely ignoring that Ed still showed alchemic talent in front of them, and treat the two harshly throughout 2-parter.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostStories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostStories">Ghost Stories</a></em>: Given the nature of the anime's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagDub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagDub">Gag Dub</a> just about everyone could be in this trope. The most notable example is Momoko Koigakubo, the kind-hearted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">Team Mom</a> of the main group. In the dub, she was turned into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist">The Fundamentalist</a> who says a lot of offensive things about Jews, gays, and other non-Christians.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer">Girls und Panzer</a></em> has a few examples from the manga adaptation:
<ul><li> An odd example comes with Anchovy, since the manga was released before the anime showed her match with Oarai. In the anime, Anchovy's competitive but fairly good-spirited, and after losing, invites the Oarai crew to eat with her and the people who set up the match. In the manga, she starts off by accusing Miho of having a "weak" way of tankery, and at the end, accuses Miho of costing her old school the championship by abandoning the flag tank.

In the manga, between the semifinals and the finals, Erika flies over to Oarai, confronts Miho, and angrily accuses her of not just costing them the victory, but abandoning them in their time of crisis, and vaguely insinuates that Miho traded her vice-captaincy of her old school for captaincy of her of her new school. She's significantly more vicious and angry in that scene from the manga, and leaves Miho in tears at the end of it.

Pryce is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a> who is cold towards Pokemon due to a misunderstanding with his Piloswine long ago, although he <em>does</em> get better when the Piloswine is found and the situation explained. In particular in the games, Pryce is a perfectly pleasant and decent man, Erika is a laidback <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ojou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ojou">Ojou</a>, Skyla is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl">Nice Girl</a>, and Lt.

All of them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatEqualsFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatEqualsFriendship">make friends with the heroes</a> in the end.
</li><li> Misty downplays this more than the others, as her anime counterpart is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">tsundere</a> with a temper (though she calms down once Togepi enters the picture) while her game counterpart doesn't seem to be that way (though later games made the odd nod to this characterisation). The English dub also toned down her narcissism compared to the Japanese version.
</li><li> Iris in the games is an energetic young prodigy. Despite her prowess as a trainer she's a humble character who is quite friendly, to the point where she volunteers to be Bianca's bodyguard despite barely knowing her. However in the anime, while heroic, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">Catch Phrase</a> is telling Ash that he is "just a kid" due to his immaturity (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">despite being the same age as him</a>). Iris in the anime is much more brattier than in the games, although she does improve by the end of the show, and since she is not a Gym Leader of Opelucid City yet in the anime, it's arguable that her anime characterization is <em>meant</em> to take place before her game characterization, allowing for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Her final scene with her adoptive grandfather and mentor Drayden says that she will one day take his place at the Opelucid Gym as leader.</span>

He says that he wishes he had a Squirtle starter instead of a Pikachu starter and runs off. Even though Ash in the Kanto arc could be stubborn and a little bratty, he would never say such things about his Pok&eacute;mon. A downplayed example, as the rest of the film doesn't show him like this; and he does apologize for it in a later scene.
</li><li> Another Gym Leader who went through this is Sabrina, a creepy girl with a permanent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathGlare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathGlare">Death Glare</a> and a sadistic childishness who spent almost her whole childhood developing her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a> and nothing else. Any trainer unfortunate enough to lose to her must play with her. And by play with her, we mean she shinks them into the size of a doll so that they can be her personal playthings for who knows how long. And if they are <em>very</em> unfortunate, she turns them into literal dolls, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">putting them in a state where they can't even move at all</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She even did this to her mother no less</span>.

</li><li> The anime does this to Pok&eacute;mon in general by showing that some change personalties upon evolving, most frequently being more stubborn and aggressive. This is loosely based on how in the games Pok&eacute;mon will disobey their trainers if they don't have enough gym badges. The anime presents this as a normal part of Pok&eacute;mon development, while the games do not. This also gives a convenient excuse for why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAllowedToGrowUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAllowedToGrowUp">some Pok&eacute;mon refuse to evolve</a>.

The anime version is generally portrayed as more consistently hot-tempered and quick to start shouting at Ranma or get grumpy. But the manga version goes to far nastier extremes in terms of anger at and distrust for Ranma &mdash; for example, believing Ranma will try to rape her when they are home alone together during the Hypnotic Mushrooms story, or accusing Ranma of trying to rape Hinako Ninomiya in her introductory story, both of which are things the anime version of Akane would <em>never</em> do.

Rei is very prone to insulting Usagi, much more than the other way round and in many cases without provocation or reason other than teasing Usagi. Despite their bickering, they're still the closest of the senshi (in the manga Rei is closer with Minako than Usagi). The Dic dub takes this a step further. Rei, or rather Rayne, is made even meaner to Usagi, or rather Serena, losing almost every little hint of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends">strong companionship</a> they have in the original version.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanReturns">Batman Returns</a></em>, the normally-classy Penguin is a foul-mouthed perverted psychopath intent on killing all of Gotham's first born sons and later on, destroying Gotham itself. The comic book Penguin is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> of Batman's villains and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">would be horrified</a> by <em>Returns</em>!Penguin's actions.

<ul><li> While in the animated film the villagers seemed amused by Belle's quirks, here they are much more hostile towards her and see her as a genuine threat to the status-quo, becoming outraged when Belle commits the crime of teaching a girl how to read.
</li><li> In the animated movie the Bimbettes were just silly airheads without any real malice towards anyone, but in this version they act more snobbish, disdainful, and actively dislike Belle. When Gaston has Belle locked up alongside her father, they actually laugh at her expense.
</li><li> In the animated movie, the Beast was troubled, angry, violent and hostile, but he wasn't completely without remorse, as mentioned in the animated movies example above. In the live action film, he's much more uncaring and has no second thoughts about imprisoning Belle in a tower.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCatInTheHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCatInTheHat">The Cat in the Hat</a></em>: In stark contrast to the mischievous but friendly and well-meaning Cat in the Hat of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCatInTheHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCatInTheHat">original novel</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCatInTheHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCatInTheHat">animated special</a>, Mike Myers' version of the Cat is a wisecracking, foul-mouthed, perverted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoctorZhivago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoctorZhivago">Doctor Zhivago</a></em> has Commissar Strelnikov. In both the novel and film he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> who burns down innocent villages <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeAnExampleOfThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeAnExampleOfThem">just to make a point</a>. However, the novel version is quite personable when Yuri meets him, and gets humanizing moments like making sure that a wounded POW gets medical care and privately wishing he could sneak off from the war even for a little while to see his family. In David Lean's film, Strelnikov is cold and hostile in person, claims "the private life is dead in Russia" with regards to his family, and the hints at his humanity are so subtle that it's easy to perceive him as being genuinely dead inside.
</li><li> In the book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ADogsPurpose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ADogsPurpose">A Dog's Purpose</a></em>, Ethan's dad is a distant father who is implied to have a bad relationship with his wife <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which ends in divorce</span>. Other than Bailey mentioning that Mom and Dad sometimes yell at each other, there aren't too many red flags about him. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ADogsPurpose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ADogsPurpose">film adaptation</a> exaggerates him into a more noticeably abusive character.
</li><li> In Jane Austen's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Emma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Emma">Emma</a></em>, Emma's sister Isabella Knightley is a very sweet, affectionate woman who is very concerned about her children and their well-being, especially their health. She's easily distressed and a bit nervous but she's an indulgent mother whose children are happy. She's also absolutely devoted to her husband. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Emma2020" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Emma2020">Emma.</a></em> (the 2020 adaptation), she's turned into a shrew who constantly fusses at the slightest hint about her children's discomfort, makes a huge deal out of minor things and repeatedly makes her baby cry. She never once talks kindly to her husband and always snaps at him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticFour2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticFour2015">Fantastic Four (2015)</a></em>:
<ul><li> Johnny comes across as a cocky, spiteful, and combative individual &mdash; and unlike his comic counterpart, he doesn't get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">to show his devotion to his friends and family</a>. Even his quip toward Ben (calling him "the Thing nobody wanted") comes across as mean-spirited instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">playful teasing</a> (which is made worse by the fact that Ben in this movie was scarred by bullying growing up). The only justification he has is that he suffers a bit from perceiving himself as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">"Well Done, Son!" Guy</a>, but even then, he doesn't make an effort to learn anything that his father tries to teach him.
</li><li> While arrogant, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorDoom">Doctor Doom</a> of the comics is at the best of times a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a>. In the film, he's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniac</a>, intent on wiping out all life on Earth.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> Dumbledore is a frequent offender of this trope. A particularly infamous example happens during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a></em>. Just after Harry is chosen to compete in a dangerous tournament he is too young to participate in, Dumbledore asks him whether or not he entered said contest voluntarily. The book explicitly mentions Dumbledore asking this calmly. In the movie, he physically shakes Harry while angrily yelling said question. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a></em>, his overall demeanor seems to be more gruff and uncaring compared to his book counterpart. When divination professor Trelawney is sacked by Umbridge in front of a large number of students, Book Dumbledore takes charge of the situation, stays calm and gleefully acts like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer">Rules Lawyer</a>, telling Umbridge she has no right to banish sacked teachers from the Hogwarts premises. In the movie, he states the rules with a raised voice and then vents his frustration on the onlooking students, angrily asking them if they don't have any studying to do, instead of looking at Trelawney being sacked. He also acts like a jerk towards Harry, just after Harry saw Ron's father Arthur being attacked by Voldemort's snake. In the book, he sends Harry, along with the Weasley children, to his godfather Sirius, in order to get them away from Umbridge. In the movie, immediately after receiving the vision, Dumbledore sends the emotionally shaken and confused Harry to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher">Sadist Teacher</a> Snape to teach him how to block his mind from Voldemort.
</li><li> A minor case of this happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a></em> when Harry's illegal studygroup Dumbledore's Army is discovered by Umbridge. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">the book</a>, Dumbledore's Army is willingly revealed by the best friend of Harry's love interest Cho, followed by Harry and Cho having a fight about this in which both sides actually have a point. When Umbridge discovers Dumbledore's Army in the movie, the group is unwillingly revealed by Cho, who has been obviously forced to show its location, as she was dragged along by Malfoy, yet Harry seems to treat it as if Cho willingly did so and alienates her like the rest of the school does, making him look like a bit of a jerk to her. He only realizes his mistake when Snape later outright confirms what he should have figured out from the start.
</li><li> In the book of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a></em>, the Hufflepuffs shun Harry when they believe he put his name in the Goblet, thus stealing glory from the other Hogwarts Champion Cedric Diggory; in the film, they outright taunt him.
</li><li> The film of <em>Order of the Phoenix</em> somehow manages to do this with Umbridge. Her film version introduces and enforces much more petty rules the students have to follow during her reign at Hogwarts.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Joker2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Joker2019">Joker (2019)</a></em> sees Thomas Wayne as more elitist and callous than most other depictions, and while he wants to help, he displays <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CondescendingCompassion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CondescendingCompassion">Condescending Compassion</a>. Related to this, Alfred Pennyworth is rather mean and taunts Arthur about his mother, though this behavior was likely caused by fear for Bruce.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheJungleBook2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheJungleBook2016">The Jungle Book (2016)</a></em>: Baloo. While he keeps the animated version's laid-back personality in this film, he also gets a selfish, cunning side, such as tricking Mowgli into getting honey for him, unlike his animated counterpart who never takes advantage of Mowgli.
</li><li> Sokka from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a> </em> is a bit of a sexist jerk to his sister, Katara, pre-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> but it&#146;s always portrayed as nothing outside a normal sibling relationship. He never does anything worse than smart off at her and she gives as good as he does. In the movie adaptation ,<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastAirbender">The Last Airbender</a> </em>, it&#146;s implied that he&#146;s hit her in the past due to the way she cowers when he raises his arm. He also treats her a lot worse in general than he did in the show.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MarsAttacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MarsAttacks">Mars Attacks!</a></em>: Minor case. In the cards, the reason the Martians were attacking Earth was that Mars was going to explode from air pressure and they needed a new planet, whereas here they are doing it For the Evulz. Also, not all Martians were evil in the cards. The warlike Martians were called Gnards and the peaceful, intellectual ones were called Paecs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy">Guardians of the Galaxy</a></em>: In the comics, Star-Lord was a seasoned cosmic superhero long before joining the Guardians. In the movies, he starts off as a self-serving outlaw and a bit of an asshole, although he eventually chooses to step up for true blue unselfish heroism - with a side of whatever (and whoever) he can get his hands on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxyVol2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxyVol2">Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</a></em>: Although he's a villain in the comics as well, the film's version of Ego <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> plans to wipe out all life in the universe and replace it with himself, and commits very personal atrocities such as killing his own lover and Peter's mother Meredith with an artificial brain tumor.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManHomecoming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManHomecoming">Spider-Man: Homecoming</a></em>, Flash Thompson is a good deal less sympathetic than his comic counterpart, who, at the very least, had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> for his bullying, and also greatly admired Spider-Man, qualities that <em>Homecoming</em>'s Flash lacks. Additionally, in one scene where he and his classmates are trapped in an elevator, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">he prioritizes saving himself and a trophy he didn't even earn</a>. That said, the sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManFarFromHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManFarFromHome">Spider-Man: Far From Home</a></em> restores him to his regular levels of jerkassery; a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> is now implied and he gets to show that he <em>does</em> respect Spider-Man, with Flash himself commenting that he's trying to improve.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Thanos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Thanos">Thanos</a> zigzags this, as while his comic counterpart put <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Gamora" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Gamora">Gamora</a> through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a>, he does have some fondness for her and some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a> moments her, like saving her as her species was wiped out and seeking revenge against her attackers after she was raped. Film!Thanos abducted her just because he could, though he does say he considers her his "favorite daughter," and is angry with Ronan when he finds out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Gamora has defected and joined the good guys</span>. However, the relationship with Nebula is better, given in the film, she's one of his "daughters" and in the comics, he turned her into a corpse-like vegetable just for claiming to be his granddaughter. Then the sequel plays it straight when Nebula reveals that Thanos made her and Gamora fight, and would forcibly replace part of the loser's body with cybernetics supposedly to make her stronger. Nebula always lost, hence her unquenchable hatred for Thanos in the films (and to a lesser extent her hatred for Gamora).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PowerRangers2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PowerRangers2017">Power Rangers (2017)</a></em>:
<ul><li> Almost all of the good characters are hit with this trope compared to their original versions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</a></em>. The original Rangers were all idealized portrayals of teenagers, who could do no wrong, get top grades at school and do at least five volunteer jobs each. In this film, the Rangers are a far cry from their goody two shoes counterparts, as they meet each other in detention, which they received for legitimately screwing things up. Their allies Zordon and Alpha were the surrogate father figure and childlike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotBuddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotBuddy">Robot Buddy</a> respectively. In the film, Alpha is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a>, while Zordon openly admits he has no confidence in the Rangers <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and it is even revealed he only bothered with them as a means to revive himself.</span>
</li><li> Rita Replusa is far more serious, as this version is depicted as a murderer and even engaging in torture.
</li></ul></li><li> The cartoon versions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDoo">Scooby-Doo</a> and his friends are generally friendly and nice people. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScoobyDoo">2002 live action film adaptation</a>, meanwhile, gives them a lot more Jerkass traits for laughs. Fred, Daphne and Velma spend much of the film arguing, Scooby punches Fred in the face, Shaggy suggests after Fred and Velma are captured by monsters that he, Scooby and Daphne let them get eaten (the cartoon version of Shaggy is a coward, but he's not the kind of person that would abandon his friends), and a flashback shows them abandoning Scrappy - Scooby's nephew - in the middle of the desert. In addition, Scrappy gets some heavy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy">Adaptational Villainy</a>, becoming the film's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em>: Zig-Zagged with the cast. Rorschach is more hostile and angry than his comic counterpart with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackieEarleHaley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackieEarleHaley">Jackie Earle Haley</a> intentionally portraying him like rabid dog. However, Rorschach's craziness and misogyny seemed downplayed. Likewise, while Ozymandias is colder, he seems to feel more remorse for his more heinous actions.
</li><li> In the comics, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Quicksilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Quicksilver">Quicksilver</a> may be a world-class asshole and suffer from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor">Heel&#150;Face Revolving Door</a>, but he is well-meaning at the core and can be counted on to do the right thing. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenDaysOfFuturePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenDaysOfFuturePast">X-Men: Days of Future Past</a></em>, he's just a bored teenager with a kleptomaniac streak who doesn't really care about being a productive member of society and who has to have the breakout sold to him as an opportunity to raise hell, as it's clear that he probably wouldn't have done it of his own volition otherwise. However, he does grow out of it in later films.

When Francis Francis talks about them firing him, there is no mention of him being lactose intolerant like in the film. Apparently they just fired him without any stated reason.
</li><li> Jonathan Harker, of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula">Dracula</a></em>, gets hit with this <em>hard</em>. In the original, he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> who went through a lot, but still cares deeply for his wife, and was even willing to become a vampire so she wouldn't suffer undeath alone.

</li><li> Princess Odette in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SwanLake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SwanLake">Swan Lake</a></em> is usually portrayed as sweet, gentle and kind (she is the white swan, after all).

</li><li> Dante Ramon was close to his brother Cisco in the comics, while here they don't get along at all.
</li><li> In the comics, Ralph Dibny, the Elongated Man, is a slightly goofy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">thoroughly devoted husband</a>.

In the show, she's antagonistic towards her lover's older brother who refuses to participate her revenge against the Lannisters <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and she even kills him personally</span>.
</li><li> In the books, Brienne is unfailingly kind and stubbornly idealistic, recoiling at the thought of killing and treating everyone around her with an unfailing fairness. In the series, possibly thanks to the writers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeLift">age lifting</a> her by close to a decade, she's considerably more bitter and cynical, harboring no delusions as to the state of Westeros, and projects a much colder exterior as a result &mdash; particularly when it comes to Davos and Melisandre, who she openly regards as opportunistic traitors. That being said, she's still bullheadedly honorable and rarely crosses over into being openly <em>unkind</em> &mdash; even when it comes to Podrick, whom she initially treats <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty">a mite harshly</a> but ultimately takes under her wing after bonding with him and apologizing for her behavior. However she still takes obvious pleasure in killing enemies, even if it's a wounded man who can't fight back, and gloating about it, while in the books Brienne has only ever killed in self-defense, and even though they were utterly vile people she never takes pleasure in it. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note06o0p');"><sup>From the Books&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note06o0p" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note06o0p');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Brienne's fixation for vengeance for Stannis is not apparent in her POV in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AFeastForCrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AFeastForCrows">A Feast for Crows</a></em>. She notes privately on meeting Gendry and recognizing him as a bastard of King Robert, "They are not his sons. Stannis told it true, that day he met with Renly. Joffrey and Tommen were never Robert's sons" which hints that she's accepted that Stannis had a better claim than Renly</span>
</li><li> Robett Glover is a loyal Stark bannerman who helped Wyman Manderly in his plot to overthrow the Boltons and bring House Stark back to Winterfell, and - so far as we know - isn't bigoted against the Wildlings. In the show, he refuses to help Jon Snow and Sansa Stark in retaking Winterfell not only because Jon's army had Wildings in them but because he lost his trust on his brother Robb after the Red Wedding and he rudely told Sansa that House Stark is dead. Fortunately, after Jon and Sansa successfully retook Winterfell, he realizes his mistake and apologizes to them.
</li><li> Yara Greyjoy (the show's counterpart to Asha Greyjoy) is rather rude to her brother Theon as she comes off as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTrickster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTrickster">Karmic Trickster</a> in terms of her baiting him.
</li><li> Robb Stark breaking his oath to marry one of Walder Frey's daughters happens in both the books and the show, but the reasoning behind it is changed in a manner that makes him appear somewhat more selfish. In the book, Robb is wounded in battle, receives news of his two younger brothers' apparent deaths at the hands of his former friend Theon Greyjoy, drinks himself into a stupor, and, in a moment of weakness, beds the woman nursing him. When he sobers up the next day, he realizes he has done her a great disservice by taking her virginity out of marriage, and takes her as his wife to restore her honor at the cost of breaking his own word to the Freys. In the show, Robb simply falls for a random woman and decides to take her as his wife, even though doing so will alienate the Freys. While he breaks his word in both versions (and his ultimate fate was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Disproportionate Retribution</a> either way) in the books, he did it to protect someone else, whereas in the show he's just putting his own happiness above keeping his word.

While she does apologize once the Penguin reveals himself to be alive, again, she still sleeps with Barbara behind Jim's back.

Darkonda from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace">Power Rangers in Space</a></em> has the same underhanded personality, but goes a step further by actually gloating about his underhandedness.

This version of Dundee clearly hates Christmas and sees it merely as an opportunity to make money. When another employee wishes him Merry Christmas, he pointedly says "Good night." As he leaves his store on Christmas Eve, he even kicks a tree. Most significantly, this Dundee is a racist. He comments that it would not surprise him in the least if Henderson, an African-American security guard, helped Henry Corwin to sneak the allegedly stolen merchandise out of his store. His expression and Henderson's reaction make it clear that it was intended as a racist remark.
</li><li> The incarnation of Wonder Woman in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WonderWoman2011Pilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WonderWoman2011Pilot">stillborn 2011 series</a> has none of the positive qualities typically associated with the character. She tortures suspects for information instead of using her Lasso of Truth, accuses rivals of criminal acts even when she has no proof, brutally slaughters security guards who are just doing their job, and outright intimidates law enforcement into looking the other way. It's no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">wonder</a> that the series never got past the pilot.

In addition to being more brutal and willing to break bones during interrogations, he's frequently cold, barely emotes, and frequently wants deals with his problems alone (to the point, he never becomes a team player and his paranoia <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">leads him to putting Tim in a cell in <em>Knight</em></span>). While we don't know his reason for doing so at the time, there's also the little matter of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bruce having Tim replace Jason even before Jason is "confirmed" dead, as opposed to a reluctant Bruce letting Tim replace Jason (putting aside the whole "Jason coming back from the dead as the new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedHood">Red Hood</a>" bit) some time after Bruce saw and buried Jason's body.</span>

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em>, Ferris Boyle, the guy who turned Victor Fries into Mr. Freeze was a greedy jerk who didn't care if he ended a life just to save money, and him turning Victor into Freeze was a reaction to Victor pulling a gun on him. In "Cold, Cold, Heart" DLC, he asked Victor to build cold based weapons in exchange for helping his wife, only to renege on the deal. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Later he was willing to kill Batman and Freeze so he could leave no witnesses, and was preparing to kill Nora in front of Freeze out of spite.</span>
</li><li> Calendar Man. In the comics, he was a petty criminal whose holiday-themed crimes rarely involved murder. In the Arkham series, he's portrayed as a sadistic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> who crimes revolve solely around murder.
</li><li> The Scarecrow himself, while very much a villain, occasionally has sympathetic moments in the comics, generally relating to his backstory as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosLaughingNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosLaughingNow">bully victim</a> and severe abuse from his family (great-grandmother pre-Crisis, father in the New 52). In the game, he lacks any sympathetic qualities and is even more monstrous than his comics incarnation, easily one of the most vile characters in the series. Background material suggests that this version of Jonathan Crane isn't even mentally ill, just pure evil.
</li><li> Much like in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanReturns">Batman Returns</a></em>, the Penguin was shown to be quite psychopathic, sadistic, and brutal.

</li><li> While most incarnations of the Riddler are fairly narcissistic, they are, at the least, humble enough to respect Batman as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a> and are on good terms with the rest of Gotham's villains.

However, the localization version for some reason, added a "...finally" line and in a condescending tone too which gives the impression that Goku isn't really proud of his son at all and once again, gives the impression of another "Goku is a bad father" moment.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIIRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIIRemake">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a></em> have few characters become bigger jerks compare to the original.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Cloud Strife</a>: In the original game, Cloud wasn't out to screw with things unless the others dragged him into it or Sephiroth was involved, and he barely cared all that much about Avalanche overall. But here, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Johnny</a> gets captured by Shinra security for questioning and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooseLips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooseLips">rats out Jessie</a>, which could jeopardize the whole group, Cloud immediately jumps to wanting to kill Johnny - which horrifies Tifa and causes her to plead for him to back down. Notably, unlike in the original where Barret rehires Cloud for the next mission, Cloud's bad attitude leads Barret to choose not to rehire him for the Sector 5 mako reactor job, forcing the Arbiters of Fate to intercede, and the people who hire him for side-quests often berate his lack of altruism.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Sephiroth</a>: Despite his more pronounced affability to Cloud in this version, Sephiroth does something in the remake that he didn't originally: he personally murdered Cloud's mother and uses it to torment him, telling him about how she begged him to spare her son and how he killed her with his own blade. In the original, she was another casualty of his burning of Nibelheim, and her death wasn't brought up again. He also mocks Cloud every time he fails to reinforce Cloud's frustration at the world over having no control over the direction of his own life to motivate Cloud into accomplishing his goals.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCracker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCracker">Mayor Domino</a>: Downplayed. Mayor Domino in the original game was a bitter and snarky, but kooky and helpful man. In this game, he is quite proud of his position as Mayor of Midgar, which he declares the greatest city in the world, and only helps the party specifically because he wants them to stick it to President Shinra. He quite clearly has no qualms with the terrible things Shinra has done, just with how they've marginalized his authority.

People familiar with Link's other portrayals will probably be surprised that in the cartoon that came after the NES games, he's the complete opposite. This Link was lazy, self-centered, whiny, and is only motivated by getting Zelda to kiss him.
</li><li> Zelda herself isn't any better. Most incarnations of her are kind, regal, and wise. This version of Zelda is extremely arrogant, dismissive, snarky, and refuses to give Link the time of day no matter how many times he saves her and her kingdom. She is, after all, the whole reason why the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellExcuseMePrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellExcuseMePrincess">Well, Excuse Me, Princess!</a> trope exists.
</li></ul></li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a> has always been a bit irritable, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse2013">Mickey Mouse (2013)</a></em> portrays him as rather assholish and more prone to being inconsiderate and insensitive toward his friends.
</li><li> Though Little Miss Somersault of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MrMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MrMen">Mr. Men</a> fame is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl">Nice Girl</a> in the books if not a bit of a showoff, the 90s cartoon turns her into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock">Jerk Jock</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoreLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoreLoser">acts like a bitch</a> about losing a race to Little Miss Wise (Who, mind you, didn't intentionally take part) and calls Little Miss Splendid, Little Miss Greedy and Mr. Lazy "hopeless" for not being able to somersault as well as she can.
</li><li> An unusual example is Snufkin in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SkyOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SkyOne">Sky1</a>'s <em>Moominvalley</em>. His actual behaviour hasn't changed, but the way it's <em>presented</em> has. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoomins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoomins">the books</a>, his wanderlust and enjoyment of solitude are positive traits; in the series he's a selfish borderline misanthrope who must learn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> about how Moomintroll is affected by the continual disappearance of his supposed best friend. As part of this, the plot of "The Spring Tune" becomes less "Snufkin finds himself bothered by a creature who won't take a hint" and more "Snufkin is rude to a creature that just wants to chat". "Snufkin and the Park-Keeper" treats his dislike of authority similarly; in <em>Moominsummer Madness</em>, Moomintroll and Snork Maiden being arrested for burning the prohibitionary notices is entirely the fault of the unreasonable and inflexible authority figure, while the episode has it as Snufkin's fault for not thinking of the consequences when he tore them down. Even the song "All Small Beasts Should Have Bows in Their Tails" has been rewritten to make the point, going from a celebration of a world without punishments to a cautionary tale about facing up to your responsibilities.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RottenRalph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RottenRalph">Rotten Ralph</a></em> animated special <em>Not-So-Rotten Ralph</em> and the television series give this treatment to Ralph's more polite cousin Percy. While the books simply used Percy as a foil to his ruder and more unscrupulous cousin, the animated special and series depicts Percy's politeness as being less sincere in addition to him relishing getting Ralph in trouble and talking down to him for not being as well-mannered as he is.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo">Scooby-Doo</a></em> franchise:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated">Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated</a></em> Scooby is more of a jerk, which adds to the attempt in developing the characters. In particular, he spends much of the show feuding with Velma (who ALSO got this treatment - see below) for Shaggy's attention. This is especially rather jarring if you remember that in previous <em>Scooby-Doo</em> productions like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/APupNamedScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/APupNamedScoobyDoo">A Pup Named Scooby-Doo</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooInWheresMyMummy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooInWheresMyMummy">Scooby-Doo! in Where's My Mummy?</a></em>, Velma is all but stated to be Scooby's second best friend. He gets better, of course.
</li><li> Velma in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated">Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated</a></em> is more cynical, self-centered, vain, and sarcastic, similar to the titular protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em>. Most of these changes however, are to do with her being written a lot more like an actual teenager would act.
</li><li> Fred has become this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeCoolScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeCoolScoobyDoo">Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!</a></em>, rendering him into a dimwitted, control freak and an unmasking hog.
</li></ul></li><li> Mary Jane Watson's Aunt Anna in the comics was a sweet-natured woman who even showed gratitude for Spider-Man saving her life. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries">Spider-Man: The Animated Series</a></em>, she's an ill-tempered crone who treats Peter Parker like dirt in spite of how nice he is to her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>:
<ul><li> Despite her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism">Adaptational Heroism</a>, Terra still has shades of this. In the comics her being evil is largely an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">Informed Attribute</a> as she's never <em>shown</em> doing anything particularly evil in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJudasContract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJudasContract">The Judas Contract</a></em> arc. In the cartoon, under Slade's orders Terra does a lot more damage. She wrecks a city and it's implied she killed people.
</li><li> Mento of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoomPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoomPatrol">Doom Patrol</a>, as virtue of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter">elements of the Chief fused into him</a>, is more obsessive and unforgiving. That said, even in the comics, Mento was always a jackass, as he was a pompous asshole didn't get along with the majority of the Doom Patrol in the '60s and was temperamental <em>at best</em> during the '80s and '90s.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>, the Titans are straight-laced heroes. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">Teen Titans Go!</a></em>, they regularly display <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> behavior, are often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">Vitriolic Best Buds</a>, and are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicComedicSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicComedicSociopath">Heroic Comedic Sociopaths</a>. Here's the individual examples of the Titans:
<ul><li> Robin really distances from his usual heroic characterization and is portrayed as a selfish, narcissistic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound">Glory Hound</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">beats up villains for the fun of it</a> or to get hero-cred, while caring very little about the safety of others.
</li><li> Raven has more anger management issues. She is prone to violent outbursts and has a habit of attacking the other Titans if annoyed, especially Beast Boy.
</li><li> While Beast Boy was always depicted as a rebel, this Beast Boy is noticeably more of a jerk than his former incarnation, and is often devoid of remorse and regret over his actions. Instead of feeling guilty for his pranks, he will often laugh and fail to comprehend he has done anything wrong.
</li><li> Like the other Titans, this version of Cyborg is much less mature and heroic and here he's just a selfish and immature jerkass. He's also not above sinking to lows to achieve a selfish goal.
</li><li> While she's nicer than the rest of the Titans, Starfire can engage in jerkass behavior like them from time to time. One example is in the "TTG vs PPG" special where she along with Robin and Raven endlessly mock <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls2016">the Powerpuff Girls</a> for being babies.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003)</a></em>: Michelangelo is a lot slower to show the warm, emotional side that characterizes most of his other versions. In the other continuities, Mikey is an unquestioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a>, but he's more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a> in this adaptation due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">egocentric attitude</a> as well as his frequent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive">Innocently Insensitive</a> moments and role as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly">The Gadfly</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2012">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012)</a></em>: Splinter is a minor example. Make no mistake, he does love his sons dearly. But, at the same time, he's not above <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly">messing with their heads for his own amusement</a>, can be something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">hypocrite</a>, overreacts to an extreme degree towards some of the mistakes they make when fighting above ground, and, at times, he can be borderline physically abusive. The reason why the Turtles fear disturbing him is because his default reaction to their fighting or being disruptive tends to be <em>beating the shit out of them</em> with a flurry of advanced ninjitsu techniques. It certainly keeps them in line, and is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughLove">Tough Love</a>, but at the same time, most of his previous counterparts would have never lifted a hand to the Turtles in anger.
<ul><li> April gets a special, but subtle mention. She would sometimes be prone to be mean towards the turtles if they do anything to upset or disappoint her. When her father was accidentally mutated into a bat and Mikey confessed they released the Mutagen canisters from a Kraang ship, which led to said mutation, she instantly accused them of mutating him on purpose, and swore to never see them again, and even refusing to believe their claims that the whole incident was an accident. Fortunately, she eventually forgives them when Casey told her his story about how he lost a friend of his on an incident, remarking that some things can't be controlled.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine">Thomas the Tank Engine</a></em>:
<ul><li> Gordon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventureBegins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventureBegins">The Adventure Begins</a></em> comes off as far more antagonistic and rude to Thomas than he was in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheRailwaySeriesB2ThomasTheTankEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheRailwaySeriesB2ThomasTheTankEngine">original book</a> and the first episode of the TV series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/ThomasTheTankEngineS1E1ThomasAndGordon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/ThomasTheTankEngineS1E1ThomasAndGordon">"Thomas and Gordon"</a>. His trick dragging him along with the express is similarly revenge for Thomas heckling him earlier, however this itself was only in retaliation for Gordon belittling him a fair deal beforehand.
</li><li> The Flying Scotsman seemed relatively humble and respectful in his few speaking roles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRailwaySeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRailwaySeries">The Railway Series</a></em>, but in his first appearance in the special <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasAndFriendsTheGreatRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasAndFriendsTheGreatRace">The Great Race</a></em>, he's much more pompous and arrogant, has a low opinion on Sodor's engines, and often makes remarks to rile up Gordon, his brother.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDramaRama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDramaRama">Total DramaRama</a></em>, Beth, Leshawna, and Gwen are all hit by this. Beth goes from being a socially awkward but very friendly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl">Nice Girl</a> to being an extremely selfish and thoughtless narcissist; Leshawna is changed from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a> who stood up for others against bullies and cared deeply for her friends to a bossy and egotistical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a>; and Gwen goes from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerkyGoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerkyGoth">Perky Goth</a> with a heart of gold under her icy attitude to a gloomy and sociopathic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">Creepy Child</a> who enjoys scaring the other kids and seeing them get hurt.
</li><li> As opposed to other versions of the character, the Blurr of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersRescueBots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersRescueBots">Transformers: Rescue Bots</a></em>, while he does get better, started off a self-serving, cowardly, selfish jackass.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WatershipDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WatershipDown">Watership Down</a> (2018)</em>: Bigwig from the original book and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WatershipDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WatershipDown">movie</a> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a>, being quite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty">Drill Sergeant Nasty</a> yet still very loyal to Hazel and having a kinder side. The 2018 Netflix series really amps up the "Jerk" part of him, pretty much running on angry and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommanderContrarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommanderContrarian">confronting Hazel on every decision he makes</a>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH">W.I.T.C.H.</a></em> cartoon, Cornelia is presented as more of a straight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableAlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableAlphaBitch">Lovable Alpha Bitch</a> she is in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WITCH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WITCH">W.I.T.C.H.</a></em> comics. She's ruder and generally more aggressive. In the comics she is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyHunter">Bully Hunter</a> but in the cartoon, prior to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully">The Bully</a> herself.
</li><li> The revival of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em> sees <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cyborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cyborg">Cyborg</a>'s father Slias Stone get this treatment. While the character always had his flaws, including being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Workaholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Workaholic">workaholic</a> who put his work above his son, the show sees him so out of touch with Vic's life that he tells Vic to get his grades up&mdash;even though Vic's already got a 4.0 GPA.
