<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseballEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseballEpisode">Baseball Episode</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BNABrandNewAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BNABrandNewAnimal">BNA: Brand New Animal</a></em>, the baseball team that Michiru joins turns out to have been rigged to lose every game as part of a gambling scheme by the mob because this brings in lots of money with people betting against them. In reality, that would wind up costing the bookie running the operation money since he'd have to pay out every time as people bet against them (as the team was extremely unpopular and had no fans before Michiru joined it and started winning games with her shapeshifting ability).
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullMetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullMetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, where one of the three laws all alchemists must follow is to not transmute gold, even though it is a simple transmutation in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse">The 'Verse</a>, in order to keep the economy from destabilizing. This law, is, of course, broken by Ed (albeit to defraud a corrupt official; he changes it back later), and transmuting elements <em>will</em> signify you're in possession of something you really shouldn't have.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PantyAndStockingWithGarterbelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PantyAndStockingWithGarterbelt">Panty &amp; Stocking with Garterbelt</a></em>, episode "The Stripping." Scanty and Kneesocks open a casino in a scheme to drive the world's economy to a halt. How? They take the money that people lose gambling to feed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a>, in an effort to bankrupt the world by robbing it of all its hard cash. They never once consider there are other units of measuring assets, which include stocks, bonds, certificates of deposit, precious metals, gems, and real estate.
</li><li> The entire ingredients-based economy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Toriko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Toriko">Toriko</a></em> should have failed plenty of times over. Food, while very important, isn't the most important thing when building a civilization with a monetary system. Not to mention that the main character &mdash; who eats more than an entire continent's worth of people &mdash; can cash things on a "gold card" that has no limit and apparently he never has to pay. Toriko has a huge income from selling the things he hunts and does not eat, even given that that's a minority of what he catches. He regularly comes to the market with extremely expensive rare ingredients.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> with the Paradise Group's scheme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OnePunchMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OnePunchMan">One-Punch Man</a></em>. They want to make a world wherein people only have to work if they want to, and those who don't work are fully financially supported. They don't seem to know that this is not at all how economics work, but then again they really aren't all that smart.
</li><li> In the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ThePrincessAndThePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ThePrincessAndThePilot">The Princess and the Pilot</a></em>, the main character is given gold dust in payment for escorting the princess, who, of course, has fallen in love with him over the journey. He is told that it's more gold <em>than he could spend in a lifetime</em>. But he can't have the princess, who, of course, is off to an arranged marriage with a prince she doesn't love. So as a romantic gesture, the pilot gets back in his plane and <em>throws all the gold dust into the air</em> around the ship that's taking the princess away. The value of the gold in the economy? Into the sea. The gold itself as raw material, for decorative <em>or</em> practical purposes? Into the sea. Economics majors will cry, but not for the reasons the writers wanted.

One villain figured out Batman's identity just by looking at the people rich enough to afford all those nifty crimefighting gadgets.
</li><li> "Damn the Expenses" is the flaw in most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck">Cut Lex Luthor a Check</a> scenarios, as the cost of the gadgetry to commit crimes typically outweighs the potential monetary benefit of using it for larceny.
</li><li> Spanish comic-book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superlopez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superlopez">Superl&oacute;pez</a></em> features the country of Tontecarlo (portmanteau of "tonto", meaning dumb, and Montecarlo). Citizens of Tontecarlo do not have jobs: They instead gamble and play state-owned lotteries anywhere &#151; eg., the customs officers play shell games for money with any incoming tourists. The main characters, visiting tourists, notice that money flow cannot continue; however, <em>tourism brings more money to Tontecarlo.</em>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a> used this and 'damn the expenses' as a plot point in 2005's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretWar">Secret War</a>: after a rash of super-suit robberies, SHIELD noticed that criminals with multi-million dollar suits were cashing in tens of thousands, and immediately deduced somebody was funding them.
</li><li> Invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupermanRedSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupermanRedSon">Superman: Red Son</a></em> where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a> solves the budget deficit problem by... scribbling a formula on a piece of paper, if only to get Jimmy Olsen to stop bothering him. It doesn't work. Later, Superman's Soviet Russia drives America to ruin via embargo - being Superman, breaking said embargo is not healthy for one's life.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Valerian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Valerian">Val&eacute;rian</a></em> there is a creature called the Grumpy Converter from Bluxte, which feeds on powerful energy sources (anything from a power socket to nuclear material), but also ingests small<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0hm8y');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0hm8y" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0hm8y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It's about the size of a rat</span> objects which it then duplicates by excreting more of them, converting energy into matter. Everyone in the comic treats it as a way to produce some quick cash for running expenses by duplicating blutoks and eebeb pearls, which are the main legal currencies of the galaxy. They also copy rare objects considered valuable for their history, at times.
</li><li> Depending on the writer, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse">Scrooge McDuck</a> would sometimes attempt to make money through undertakings that cost more in the execution than any expected profit margin could cover and has on certain occasions resorted to outright baldfaced crime.
<ul><li> On one occasion, he attempted to swindle an inheritance from Donald, despite the clear paper trail establishing Donald as the rightful one, and even brought along Donald as hired help!
</li><li> One story has Scrooge (for some inexplicable, out-of-character reason) worry that he was making money faster than he could spend, and took Donald and the nephews along for a lengthy, extravagant trip where they wasted tons of money on cars and food. When they returned home, Scrooge had made even more money because, everything they bought having come from his own businesses, the money spent failed to deduct from his fortune while his regular business interests continued to generate money.
</li><li> More generally, some have tried to argue that Scrooge was a living danger to world economics since he's getting richer everyday while he doesn't send back much money in the outside world (given how stingy he is), so in a very small time he would possess all the money in the world which would then become worthless since it would be concentrated into one person. The writers, however, managed to avoid this issue in three ways. First, it has been long-established that Scrooge <em>doesn't care</em> if his money is worthless, since he never spends any (what he enjoys with having money is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyFetish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyFetish">contemplating the coins and swimming in them</a>). And second, it is also established that there are at least two other characters who do as much money as Scrooge at approximately the same rate: Flintheart Glomgold and John D. Rockerduck. Then, even if most of the world's money is probably concentrated in the three duck's pockets, they hate each other so much that none of the three would accept to leave money to the two others, keeping economics to be ruled by one undisputed leader (technically, Scrooge's the richest of the three, but only because he owns a few more inches of old string, so it counts for the Guiness World Records but doesn't matter at the Stock Exchange). And, last, Scrooge once was placed in a situation where winning in one day three times his current fortune would cause the death of the city of Duckburg. Scrooge, being kind-hearted under his tough exteriors, burnt the document which allowed him to ask the city this amount of money.
</li><li> Altogether averted in an old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlBarks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlBarks">Carl Barks</a> story, "A Financial Fable", where a freak hurricane blasts Scrooge's fortune across the countryside, but he remains uncharacteristically calm and jovial, and settles down to tend a farm. Meanwhile everybody in miles' vicinity, including Donald, gets millions deposited right on their laps. Subsequently everyone decides that they are rich and no longer need to work, instead trying to go see the world and spend their money on luxuries, only to realise that no-one is selling anything and all industry is going to a standstill due to everybody being "rich". Soon enough they all are forced to buy their food and basic commodities from the only person who kept working all this time, Scrooge McDuck, himself, who naturally charges by the present rated value, several million dollars for a modest meal, and soon enough all the cash has flown back to his pockets, restoring the financial equilibrium.
</li><li> In one comic, Scrooge attempts to make a common quarter worth billions by making it rare. He does this by buying up all the coins from the same year, then dumping them into the ocean. This would amount to illegal destruction of money, since the coins are effectively taken out of circulation. Further, the coin is valued at some fantastical amount, which is the price Scrooge expects to get for it. This is not how such valuation works. Basically, like with every collectible, it is only worth as much as anyone is willing to pay for it, which would be higher than the original 25 cents, but far short of the millions that it is stated as being worth. If no one wants to buy it, it is effectively only worth it's normal valuation (which seems likely after the annoying ad campaign Scrooge ran for his scheme).
</li></ul></li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpyKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpyKids">Spy Kids</a></em> comic in one issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/DisneyAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/DisneyAdventures">Disney Adventures</a></em> had the evil organization F.A.N.G. (Fear, ANger, Greed) plan to destroy all the cereal in the world so that everyone would be forced to buy "Fang Flakes" for a million dollars each. Yeah, have fun having no business at all with those prices. Lampshaded when it turned out F.A.N.G. didn't even know <em>how</em> they were going to destroy all the cereal in the world.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Web of Spider-Man</a></em> episode titled "Gold Rush!" the Beyonder innocently turns a whole building into gold in the middle of the night; the U.S. government however decides to keep it a secret and pay the Kingpin to forever keep the gold out of reach (i.e. secretly throw it into the ocean's depth) since its discovery by the public would supposedly destroy the world's economy. But in reality, that would no more destroy the world economy than would a major gold strike in the mining industry. It would depress gold prices for a while, but since no one uses the gold standard anymore, it would have very little effect beyond that. Doesn't stop Spidey from swiping one item, a gold notepad, though; he just uses it to help pay off Aunt May's home to prevent it from being repossessed.
</li><li> Subverted in a <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Spirou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Spirou">Spirou</a></em> comic, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> fires one of his best agents after his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a> which scares stockholders into selling their stocks and his competitor ends up buying his whole company in an improbable domino effect. The truth is that the competitor has been waiting for any spark of doubt such as this and influenced the market accordingly to make it look like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> was going under for years. It's still done in a day though which is too fast.

When she is caught, she is told that she will be expected to pay it back <em>or else</em>, and that she will have to work for a long time to do so. Thirty thousand yen is only about $250 (US) or &pound;120 &mdash; not exactly pocket change, but hardly the staggering sum the fanfic suggests. Given that she has a full-time job waitressing, Kitsune should be able to pay it off in a matter of weeks.
</li><li> Discussed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">James</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/CommonSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/CommonSense">Common Sense</a></em> when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakeOilSalesman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakeOilSalesman">Magikarp salesman</a> gives his pitch about how Magikarp lays one thousand eggs at a time. He instantly sees through the ruse, because if it's really such a fast multiplier, basic laws of supply and demand state that its real value would be nowhere near what the salesman claims.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/IfIOnlyHadAHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/IfIOnlyHadAHeart">If I Only Had A Heart</a>: Izuku gets paid 600,000 yen to license his miracle material. That's roughly 5,000 dollars, which should be only a bit more than his mother makes in a month. Yet everyone acts like this is a an incredible amount of money. Even if it was 600,000 dollars, it would be a pitance, considering the material can stand Bakugo's explosions, yet was made by borderline poor Izuku using what materials he could afford/scrounge. He also gets 2% royalties, which makes more sense.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EuroTrip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EuroTrip">Euro Trip</a></em>, the exchange rate in Slovakia is taken to parodic levels. It seems that having less than two dollars in American money makes them part of the wealthy ruling class, including a stay at a five-star hotel and access to an exclusive nightclub. Scott flips one of the servants an American nickel, who promptly quits and tells his manager that he will open his own hotel.
</li><li> The Russian fantasy film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sadko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sadko">Sadko</a></em> (known to <em>MST3K</em> fans as <em>The Magic Voyage of Sinbad</em>,) has the main hero try to help out his home town by forcing its merchants to redistribute their wealth among the poor. It doesn't work so well since there doesn't seem to be enough to go around. (That, and the hero ends up giving away all the money he was going to use for his quest.) The original story had him trying to buy all the goods in the city and monopolize the trade. Turned out the external trade scale was quite out of his league.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CanadianBacon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CanadianBacon">Canadian Bacon</a></em>, the president wanted to start some international problems so he'd have an excuse to reopen the recently closed munitions factories given the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. Then again, his primary goal was really just to stir up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrioticFervor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrioticFervor">Patriotic Fervor</a> and boost his popularity. Also, in the film, the relative weakness of the Canadian dollar in the 1980s and 1990s was played up to hilarious levels, with a fine either being $1000 Canadian, or $10 US.
</li><li> The Mexican satirical film <em>Un Mundo Maravilloso</em> portrays an alternate Mexico which simultaneously has economic growth and stability <em>and</em> rampant poverty, widespread unemployment and plunging stock markets at the same time..
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFifthElement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFifthElement">The Fifth Element</a></em>, Zorg espouses the "Destruction Equals Employment" mentality, and demonstrates it by destroying a glass and explaining how the machines that clean the glass shards away employ so many people manufacturing them. However, Zorg doesn't mention that only companies like his, which profits off of war, stand to benefit, rather than society as a whole. It's a version of the Parable of the Broken Window, which is explained in more detail at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0myzi');"><sup>short version&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0myzi" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0myzi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Destroying something only benefits those companies that can replace that destruction and nothing else. The theory that a windowmaker hiring someone to go around breaking windows may benefit the windowmaker (in the short term), but does nothing for society as a whole, as money spent replacing windows is money that cannot be spent elsewhere, and is spent simply restoring the status quo. Likewise, disasters are not profitable, as money is spent restoring a status quo that could have been spent on improvements elsewhere absent the disaster in question. War is also a useless expense, as money is spent on bullets that fire and bombs that explode that destroy buildings and machines that money has been spent to create. Money spent on war and the military and the industries that support them are by definition a necessary sunk cost, as a state-sponsored military cannot generate profit or become self-sustaining (relying on continuous infusions of taxpayer money to function) and, at its most basic level, their function is to blow shit up and kill people, neither of which have an inherit economic benefit. This is not to say that war cannot in the long term create conditions where future economic expansion can flourish, but that is outside the scope of this theory.</span>.
</li><li> In <em>Wisdom</em>, a film starring Emilio Estevez and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DemiMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DemiMoore">Demi Moore</a>, the titular character, John Wisdom, goes on a bank-robbing spree, but not to steal money. Instead, he and his girlfriend destroy bank property records to help farmers. The film was released in 1986, a time when American farmers were having problems keeping their farms. The banks were seen to be the bad guys because they were the ones foreclosing when the farmers couldn't make the payments on the loans. In the film, John Wisdom is seen as a modern-day <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/RobinHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/RobinHood">Robin Hood</a> because he saves the farmers from foreclosure. Apparently, in the movie, the banks that are hit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup">only have one copy</a> of the records and when Wisdom destroys these records, there are no ill effects on the local economies.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em>, Bison pays his underlings with "Bison Dollars", which are technically worthless due to having no economic backing, but Bison plans to force the Bank of England to value them at five pounds per Bison dollar, by kidnapping their Queen. Brilliant plan. Even if they did agree to the plan, he'd have to hold her indefinitely since people would just exchange their B$ for <em>real</em> money (you know, with financial backing and stability) as quick as possible before the bank either collapsed or reneged on the deal when they got the Queen back. And that's assuming everyone involved would accept financial ruin just to save figurehead nobility. Then again, while a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a>, Bison is <em>utterly insane</em>, and the smarter of his accomplices reject the currency as worthless.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OtherPeoplesMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OtherPeoplesMoney">Other People's Money</a></em>: Both Jorgy and Larry in their big speeches. Jorgy talks about how the wire and cable industry will recover when the dollar is a little stronger and the yen is a little weaker; actually, that would just mean that an American company like his would get priced out of the market by its Japanese competitors. On the other hand, Larry says that the fastest way to go broke is to have an increasing share of a shrinking market; that's true if <em>and only if</em> the market shrinks away to nothing, which is unlikely to happen for products like wire and cable. Otherwise, having an increasing share of a <em>any</em> market, shrinking or otherwise is a way to become spectacularly profitable, since it eliminates all your competitors.
</li><li> The Mayflowers' plan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HudsonHawk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HudsonHawk">Hudson Hawk</a></em> is to find Leonardo da Vinci's machine for turning lead into gold, and using it to turn gold into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessYellowRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessYellowRocks">Worthless Yellow Rocks</a> and crash the world currency market. This is in fact good economics&mdash;in a world where currency is still backed by gold. However, the film was released in the early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">1990s</a>, at which point the only major currency linked to gold was the Swiss franc. While that would be enough to make for some nasty economic problems, it wouldn't be nearly sufficient to hold the world economy hostage. On the other hand, the Mayflowers are cartoonish villains in a slapstick comedy. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra">It doesn't have to make sense</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InTime">In Time</a></em> is set <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InAWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InAWorld">In a World...</a> where they've "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless">turned off the aging gene</a>", and lifespan has become currency to combat overpopulation. That actually could work rather well... except that the elites of this society seem more concerned with preventing overpopulation than maintaining a working economy; they've hiked the prices of goods and lowered wages so much that entire communities have less lifespan to their name than hours in the day - go to work every day or die. Added to that, there is the problem that they are using as currency something with a large intrinsic value of its own: time. The whole point of money is that it's a medium of exchange; ideally, it should have no value of its own. As a parable of rich people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillThePoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillThePoor">annihilating the people they deem worthless</a> it makes more sense.
</li><li> Gordon Gekko in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WallStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WallStreet">Wall Street</a></em>: A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> use of the trope, as the way Gekko makes money is indeed a zero sum game. While absolute wealth and value can be increased, <em>relative</em> wealth is pretty much constant. If you embrace the concept of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_good">the positional good<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (as Gekko seems to), then you only advance by getting ahead of others. Only so many people can be in the 1%, only one guy can be the richest. If wealth is a measuring stick for status and control, you don't want "enough", you want more than everyone else. Whether the economics are flawed or not depends on whether you accept that concept or not.
</li><li> John Nash in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ABeautifulMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ABeautifulMind">A Beautiful Mind</a></em> erroneously defines a Nash Equilibrium. A beautiful blonde woman walks into a bar with her (supposedly) less attractive friends. He suggests that if they all target her, she will turn them all down and her less-attractive friends will spurn them because nobody likes being second-choice. However, a Nash equilibrium <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_Equilibrium">is defined<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> as a set of strategies for each player where no player has an incentive to unilaterally change his choice of action, holding all other players' actions as given &mdash; in the example, every individual has an incentive to unilaterally deviate by adjusting his strategy and hitting on the blonde.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises">The Dark Knight Rises</a></em>:
<ul><li> Bruce Wayne is bankrupted after Bane and his minions break into the stock exchange, hold everyone there at gunpoint, and make fake trades in Bruce's name using his (stolen) fingerprints. In reality, there are strict regulations imposed on volume trading in basically every stock market, such as public announcements being necessary when the offering exceeds the average daily trading value, making the idea of Bruce Wayne buying massive amounts of stock or selling his own Wayne Corp. stock ludicrous. Major stock exchanges also have the ability to quickly cancel trades if necessary, and Bruce Wayne would have been easily able to get off the hook for those fraudulent trades. This is acknowledged in the movie a couple of scenes later when Lucius Fox tells Bruce that they'll be able to prove fraud but that in the immediate short term, Bruce is bankrupted. This also assumes that the computer program wasn't somehow inserting backdated trades into the system. Though that would presumably leave a trace, it would certainly take much longer to disentangle. The whole situation is played similarly to a robbery or large-scale embezzlement. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by people on the floor. Although... considering the ridiculous speeds at which the regulating body can close down a Stock Exchange (for example the flawed shut-down system for China's stock exchange in early 2016), Bane and his henchmen wouldn't get close to a computer before the system was shut-down.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Broker:</strong> This is a stock exchange, not a bank. There's no money for you to steal!
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Bane:</strong> Really? Then why are you people here?
</div><ul><li> It should also be noted that wealth doesn't work that way, since the Wayne family definitely has some money in a personal bank account somewhere. No billionaires keep all their money in company stock, otherwise they wouldn't even be able to buy themselves a $1 burger, much less an entire restaurant or a fancy new sports car.
</li><li> Utilities don't get shut down days after someone goes bankrupt, or gets behind on their payments, as that could endanger lives. Imagine a minor screw-up at a hospital and it coming to light the following day, when all the life support patients are dead.
</li></ul></li><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BabettesFeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BabettesFeast">Babette's Feast</a></em>, Babette reveals that she spent all her lottery winnings, 10,000 Francs, on the eponymous feast, as that was the price of dinner for twelve at the Cafe Anglais. Of course, that would be the price on the bill at the end of the meal, but that price would have to cover many other expenses beyond the cost of ingredients: the restaurant's rent (in Paris, no less, with its very high rents), the wages of the waiters, busboys, and all the kitchen staff (including Babette's), and, not least, profits for the owners. None of that would have been a factor in the meal Babette prepared in the film. Justified, in this case, in that this was really just an excuse by Babette not to leave the sisters and their village.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePurge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePurge">The Purge</a></em> is guilty of a double failure: first in not understanding what is a feasible way to improve the economy radically, and second in what are the signs of a booming economy:
<ul><li> The government institutes the titular Purge, which is an annual 12-hour period during which nearly all crime is allowed. This is all but confirmed to have been instated as a means of killing off homeless people and other "leeches of society" types. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillThePoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillThePoor">Kill the Poor</a> does not work as a method to improve the economy. Those people still buy things to sustain themselves, so you are destroying a good portion of consumers, as well as destroying a source of cheap labor.
</li><li> The film states that unemployment is nearly nonexistent at one percent. This actually would mean the economy is in a poor state. You still have demand for workers, from things such as someone trying to start their own business or an existing business taking on a big project which requires more manpower. However, the supply of workers is low, which drives wages up as employers are competing for them, which in turn means they have to raise the prices of their products.
</li><li> Furthermore, with all the looting and burning, there would be an eternal recession going on. The Detroit riots of '67 left the city in shambles and it took months, if not years, for the wages to go back up for anyone around. Now, imagine a situation where there aren't any emergency services to put out fires or contain the arsonists. Property damages alone would be astronomical, not to mention the impact of having no stores (all looted except perhaps a few very big ones who can afford the private armies necessary to protect their goods), having to rebuild every year and having to spend money to get everything back on track after the yearly mayhem. Everyone would be eating horses and boiling boots in less than a year.
</li><li> For what it's worth, it's implied here and there that the "thriving economy" claims are just propaganda put out by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">the New</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DayOfTheJackboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DayOfTheJackboot">Founding Fathers</a>. And sure enough, the follow-up films explore things further and showcase that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">1) the Purge doesn't really work as advertised (only the real psychos are out there doing the killing, everybody else locks their doors. The NFF actually have to send out mercenaries to bolster the casualty figures) and 2) the NFF party is full of <em>utterly freaking insane</em> "one-percenters" who took over the country just so they could make their idea of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillThePoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillThePoor">Kill the Poor</a> Thanksgiving (literally, with them even having a twisted version of saying grace) a legal reality.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JackRyanShadowRecruit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JackRyanShadowRecruit">Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit</a></em>, the evil Russian plot is to simultaneously launch a massive terrorist attack on New York while dumping a huge number of American dollars on global currency markets, crashing the US economy. While a major terrorist attack certainly would cause some short term economic harm, and dumping dollars would cause the dollar to weaken, the two events would hardly cause a "second Great Depression." First of all, devaluing the dollar, while causing harm in many respects, would make American exports much more competitive in global markets and would also protect the American domestic market from foreign competition. The Great Depression was a <em>deflationary</em> crisis, where economic contraction was the result of the dollar's being too valuable. Second, dumping dollars is only a good prospect for crashing a market <em>if</em> no one else is willing to buy: it undermines faith in the currency when someone sell the currency at ludicrously low prices and there's still no one willing to pay that amount, but if someone <em>does</em> pay that amount, all you've done is lost money on your deal (and given the fact that the US dollar is <em>still</em> one of the most stable currencies in the world, there is <em>always</em> someone willing to buy, <em>especially</em> at the discount necessary for the dumping scheme; in effect, the villain is just making someone quite a lot of money).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goldfinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goldfinger">Goldfinger</a></em>:
<ul><li> A piece of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Exposition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Exposition">exposition</a> from a Bank of England rep has him explain to M and Bond that Britain (and its allies such as the United States) keep gold reserves to "estimate the true value of the dollar and the pound". <a class="urllink" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/commodities/11330611/How-the-Bank-of-England-abandoned-the-gold-standard.html">The UK abandoned the gold standard for fiat money in the 1930s<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, although the US didn't fully drop it until the Nixon administration.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted">Subverted</a> in the main plot. Bond figures out Goldfinger is lying to his mob backers when he stops to think about his "plan" and realizes that carting all the gold out of Fort Knox is not only incredibly difficult, but would also massively devalue the currency against him. Goldfinger than reveals his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">defiance</a> of the trope: he intends to set off a dirty bomb in the vault, inducing scarcity and thus making his existing stock more valuable. It should be noted that this is a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation">Adaptation Distillation</a>: in the original novel, Goldfinger was actually going to steal all the gold. The makers of the film realized that the plan made no sense, so they changed it.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnnyMnemonic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnnyMnemonic">Johnny Mnemonic</a></em>, an evil <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Mega-Corp</a> intends to suppress the cure for a deadly disease which half the world's population suffers from, their logic being that "treating the disease would be more profitable than curing it." However, their treatment medicines cost far more than most people could afford, especially over any duration. This business strategy would likely see diminishing returns over time, as increasing numbers of people living on low and middle-class incomes struggle to pay the company's exorbitantly high prices and many more sick people die off amidst the global pandemic. In these circumstances, one could expect that their working cure would ultimately yield greater profits because it could be cheaper (especially if consumers only need a one-time dose or prescription), would have a greater public demand (especially if such a desired product is depicted in the movie as something people would go as far as to start <em>riots</em> over), and would help the global population remain healthy, thrive, and build an even more prosperous and sustainable world economy in the long term.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LethalWeapon2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LethalWeapon2">Lethal Weapon 2</a></em>, when Riggs and Murtaugh discover the bad guys' stash of drug money, Murtaugh exclaims: "These are thousand-dollar bills!" The Federal Reserve stopped printing large-denomination notes in 1945, and such currency was removed from circulation in 1969. While still considered legal tender, it's extremely unlikely that an entire shipping container of these bills would be available twenty years later.

Setting aside the environmental factors that probably sink this plan from the start<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note164c0');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note164c0" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note164c0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the fact that the "new West Coast" would be a series of unstable cliffs and landslides (surrounding a fallout zone) for decades, at a minimum.</span>, the US government could probably seize the disaster zone via Eminent Domain immediately on national security/emergency factors. In the unlikely scenario that they don't, it will probably be decades before investors will be willing to develop on a coastline that wasn't there years before. Luthor may not live long enough to recoup a single penny, let alone see the riches he seemed to be predicting. Not to mention the fact that he has taken no steps whatsoever to hide his responsibility for the disaster&#151;using a company named after himself to buy the real estate, for instance&#151;and will undoubtedly be prosecuted.
</li><li> Luthor's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">Serial Escalation</a> plan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanReturns">Superman Returns</a></em> of creating a new continent in the Atlantic that will demolish the East Coast while making his own new land valuable is a hell of a lot worse. At least the plan of the first film didn't have <em>wiping out two-thirds of the United States</em> (at <em>least</em> &mdash; there are also the possibilities of other ecological side-effects that may happen from a whole new continent appearing that are impossible to calculate) as collateral damage. The economical impact of <em>that</em> would be equally apocalyptic.

<ul><li> The Imperial Order is an incredibly large empire with a massive standing army capable of sending millions of people hundreds of miles away to conquer the world, while operating under an economic system so ridiculous it should be incapable of supporting a single city, much less an army. Essentially, it combines all the motivation problems of communist economics with a culture that actively despises hard work. To put it succinctly, on the surface, the Order's economy is a communist-like "from each according to their ability, to each according to their need" system that wants to uplift humanity by putting everyone on a level playing field without the elites or the privileged calling the shots. In practice, this has led to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallPoppySyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallPoppySyndrome">Tall Poppy Syndrome</a> becoming institutionalized. Anyone, even those who are shown to work harder than others or have a talent in a trade, are hammered down. Those who have a need, or can show a disadvantage, have first dibs on things like collective housing and food, in order to help the less fortunate and put them on even footing with their more fortunate neighbors. This has led to a culture-wide race to the bottom where work, ambition, and effort is actively punished and claiming hardship or disability is the best way to get goods on the dole. The Order's capital city is shown to be a festering mire where buildings decay for want of people to build and fix them and the population queue to food lines or plead their misfortunes to committees for welfare charity, stewing in their own misery because they've been taught to believe that there is nothing they can (or even should) do to improve their station or their lot in life. Which brings us back to the question of how in such a system could they possibly support a professional army of millions, feeding them, clothing them, arming them, and transporting them to war?
<ul><li> The trope is averted by means of hypocrisy at one point. During his time in the capital, Richard learns to take advantage of this system by finding Order officials who have been directed to complete work on a new palace for the Emperor, but are very well aware that their hired labor will just claim disability and put in only as much effort as they can get away with. Richard cuts through the red tape and offers to get them the supplies they need through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfDeals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfDeals">Chain of Deals</a>. The officials know full well that such behavior is against their tenets, but excuses on delay of the construction won't be tolerated, so when Richard offers to get them what they need, they basically pay him under the table while looking the other way. Deals begat deals, and by the time it's said and done, Richard, by sheer dint of being the only source willing and able to provide on demand, has a monopoly on the ironworks trade in the city, becomes immensely wealthy, and has singlehandedly pushed forward construction of the palace months ahead of schedule. He even uses the system against itself; he technically has an assigned job as an ironmonger, where his delivery business is more or less just a side hustle, but he has all the time he needs by basically calling in sick from his day job for days at a time. His boss doesn't complain, because he owns all the iron that Richard is selling in back alleys for immense profit. He eventually gets caught up by the Order's priesthood and thrown in prison where his recitation of ideological cant doesn't get him out of trouble, but that's neither here nor there.

However, each Hall (a type of Crafting guild, 10 in all) and each Hold (over 20 worldwide) has their own special and specific source stamp. The value of these marks has been shown, in canon, to vary on the cultural popularity of the Hall or Hold they hail from. In the first novel of the series HarperCraft marks were worthless, as Harpers were seen as trifling entertainers instead of educators. So in a way, it's not so different from global currencies today, but it's very badly defined, as any individual can refuse coinage from a source they just don't happen to like at the time, and completely up in the air as to what values can be ascribed to anything (when 1 mark can buy 1/8th of a cow, 192 hand-sized pies, or 1 whetstone, whereas musical instruments and riding horses start at 2 and 9 (and custom tack is 12) marks respectively, something is off).
<ul><li> The theory here is sound (a "mark" represents a promise of X amount of goods or services from the issuer), and is similar to many historic and modern "private currencies". The problem lies entirely in the books' descriptions.
</li><li> Some of the price discrepancies may be due to the relative scarcity of goods on Pern. Until the Southern Continent was reopened in the books, wood was a lot more rare, since the Northern Continent is mostly rocky and mountainous. This was especially the case up until the long Interval that ended during the first book, since the Dragonriders kept a very tight control on the amount of greenery they had to protect before then. Even in later books, wooden furniture is considered a luxury item; most people make do with stone. Metal of all kinds have always been very rare on Pern, that's one of the reasons it appealed to the back-to-nature colonists who wanted to set up Pern as an agrarian society. That's probably why marks are made of wood; metal's too valuable to waste on coinage.

Since the amount of taxes that needed to be paid were determined by the amount you spent per transaction, people did their shopping by buying one item at a time. The resulting lines and traffic are horrendous, and the governor loses his job over it.

In the novel, it works. However, this ignores that the total worldwide gold supply still <em>has</em> increased quite significantly by the end of it and that all favorable psychological factors aside, it'd still be silly to expect millions of people to trade in one form of money for another just so they can then <em>sit</em> on the latter while still being out of the former.

This of course creates a massive problem of inflation where several forests are required to buy a single peanut. In order to try and revalue the leaf they start burning down all of the forests in the area.
</li><li> There's also mention of several completly useless currencies. The Flanian Pobble Bead, which is only exchangeable for other Flanian Pobble Beads, and the Ningi which is a triangular coin 6800 miles on a side and thus far to large to be useable as a currency.

Though to be fair, its strongly implied that both sides were reaching the limits of how long they could keep this up, and even if Geary hadn't managed to win the war, it would have ended within a decade as both economies collapsed. It's also mentioned that there have been occasional brief ceasefires that somehow never quite manage to turn into true peace talks, and that the whole war very nearly did grind to a halt because both sides were about to go bankrupt, but a sudden breakthrough in the development of the technology behind the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalNetwork">hypernet gates</a> revitalised their economies (both sides naturally claim the other side stole the tech from them) and enabled the war to continue. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfTemporalWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfTemporalWater">Captain Geary</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">immediately points out</a> that the timing was awfully convenient... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's not a coincidence.

</li><li> The concept of Municipal Darwinism presented in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MortalEngines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MortalEngines">Mortal Engines</a></em> really doesn't make a lot of sense: you move a literally <em>city-sized</em> mass of people, buildings, and machinery around on wheels, burning god knows how much fuel per second, dealing with what must be staggering maintenance costs and trying to absorb unimaginable initial investments... All so you can steal some pitiful resources from smaller, <em>less successful</em> cities trying to do the same thing (a labor-intensive process that involves tearing apart lots of valuable infrastructure in the target city).

Even after robbing it, they never seem to recirculate the wealth. So the real source of the wealth is unknown, most notably as no country seems to have industry of any kind. As a result, she concludes that their economy must be sustained by "tourists" coming from our world.

Luke's speeder got 2,000 credits at a used car lot (for a maximum of 1 credit to $10 US equivalent). An inhabitable planet is worth $16 billion? Even for one under imperial interdiction, that means Bill Gates could purchase 3 planets! The estimated price of Earth is 10 QUADRILLION. This is also ignoring the fact that Han started the novel with an amount of money that is unspecified, but certainly no more than the cost of his Millennium Falcon, so assuming he leveraged that at a starting bid, he went from owning 100k-1M credits to nearly 2B credits. What luck to increase your net worth by 3-10 orders of magnitude in one night. Still, it's possible that the price is relatively low as A) its full of Force witches, making "ownership" useless and B) in Warlord Zsinj's territory, so you couldn't do anything with it even without them being there. Really though, Han should have realized it was off.
<ul><li> There's also an issue of supply to consider. We in the real world have only one planet. It costs as much as all of our combined value put together because it's literally the only place we can keep our stuff. A long time ago in a galaxy far far away, there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions of inhabitable (if not necessarily inhabit<em>ed</em>) worlds, where a good-sized fortune probably could buy you your own celestial body if you're not too picky about location or what condition it's in. True, the population of the Star Wars universe is spread over most of the known galaxy, meaning more demand for real estate, but the fact that there is more than one inhabitable planet means that buying one will cost less than the relative equivalent of all the wealth in existence.

This would never work, for the simple reason that the Queens are the majority stockholders in the company, so Oliver can remove her as CEO, and will likely have the support of the rest of the stockholders once it becomes obvious that she's ruining the company. Also, the only way to render all the Queens' stock worthless would be to so badly manage the company that it became valueless, which she can't do without both getting removed as CEO very quickly <em>and</em> ruining her reputation in the business world, which at that time she still valued, to say nothing of devaluing all the stock she herself had bought. On top of all of that, it is extremely unlikely that the Queens would have no other assets other than their stock in the company. At the very least, it is likely that they would own their palatial mansion outright.

In reality, all Hodgins would have had to do was call up his bank and say, "I did not authorize those transfers, put my money back." If need be, he could have gone in person to prove he was him.

</li><li> And yet they thought it was believable enough to not only make it, but <em>re</em>make it for the later MI series. The plot in one episode of the original series, where a banker was plotting on flooding an African country with well-made forgeries and a lot of them, makes more sense, both from the money and economic standpoint. Another one had a man making enough high-grade forgeries of a nation's currency to purchase the entire gold reserve of a nation that was presumably on the gold standard, which makes sense so long as the world can honestly believe that a nation on the gold standard would have enough currency in open circulation that one person could plausibly accumulate enough of it to do this without there being an obvious shortage of said currency everywhere else in the world.

</li><li> This franchise and its descendants promised Gene Roddenberry's fantasy utopian future, which stated that money no longer existed. Unfortunately, that raised a whole <em>slew</em> of unanswerable questions. Like, without money or coercion, how do you get enough people to do necessary but thoroughly disagreeable jobs (although there are some very sophisticated robots). Heck, it becomes impossible to justify enough people deciding to wait tables. The biggest fail, though, is that without <em>some</em> means of exchange, how can members of the Federation deal with issues of resource management? Though it's supposed to be a post-scarcity economy, it still ignores that some things simply cannot be replicated at will, like a particular house in a particular location, seats at a particular show on a particular night, and are still going to be scarce (i.e.: not enough to satisfy wants). Not that this is necessarily that big of a problem. Apparently, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a> economics work much the same as its teleporters and warp drives do &mdash; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BellisariosMaxim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BellisariosMaxim">"Just fine, thank you very much for asking!"</a>.
</li><li> From what we saw, the Federation is a communist state that works <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief">if the show's presuppositions are to be believed</a>, due to technological inventions such as replicators, extremely cheap and plentiful sources of energy, combined with humanity being more noble than it is today. In <em>First Contact</em>, a local 21st century woman was told that humanity evolved from wanting more into perfecting oneself. Therefore, having a big ass apartment with a view of the Eiffel Tower is not as big a deal as it is for us. For them, becoming a respected chef is more important than acquiring whatever goods are still scarce in their utopia. Life became about finding your place in the universe, not about material things. So a person waits tables because it can be enjoyable, and maybe he can learn how to run a restaurant and then move up to doing that. Technically it is a post-scarcity economy much like Banks' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCulture">The Culture</a></em> novels. People work for lots of reasons, they just tend to be higher up Maslow's hierarchy of needs than modern economies. For example, even being a lowly ensign redshirt aboard the Enterprise gives you the chance to go where no one has gone before (and get killed before the first commercial).
</li><li> Credits existed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">The Original Series</a>, though seemingly only on the fringes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">The Federation</a>. After Roddenberry passed away, the galactic monetary standard of gold-pressed latinum (Latinum being a mineral that is very difficult to replicate, which prevents anyone with a replicator from running a mass counterfeiting operation) was introduced. These helped a little. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Deep Space Nine</a></em> introduced the idea that the post-scarcity economy only existed on certain planets&mdash; Earth and Risa are two shown&mdash; and virtually every other planet had some form of currency, with the interplanetary exchange being gold-plated latinum. And Starfleet personnel get a stipend, at least if they're stationed on the station, as the crew never seem to be lacking for latinum to spend at Quark's bar.
</li><li> And in seventh-season <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> episode "Treachery, Faith, and the Great River", Nog describes a key facet of Ferengi philosophy that proves that his species truly are the greatest businessmen in the galaxy: The "<a class="urllink" href="http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/Great_Material_Continuum">Great Material Continuum<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>".
<div class="indent"><strong>Nog</strong>: <em>There are millions upon millions of worlds in the universe, each one filled with too much of one thing, and not enough of another. And the Great Continuum flows through them all like a mighty river, from "have" to "want" and back again! And if we navigate the Continuum with skill and grace, our ship will be filled with everything our hearts desire!</em>
</div></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>, they never quite explain how Sisko's father was running a restaurant on Earth. Even assuming his food is superior to whatever his customers can get out of a replicator, how do they pay him for it, and what does he do with the money? Is it more of a hobby, like the Picard family's wine, and he just gives finished meals away to people who would enjoy them?
<ul><li> One episode shows Capt. Sisko in the alley behind the restaurant shucking clams. This would imply that they're real clams (or else why didn't his dad replicate clams that were already shucked?), which raises even more questions. While it's possible that Sisko's father prefers real clams to replicated ones, who did he get the clams from, and how was that person compensated for their efforts?
</li></ul></li><li> Various additional sources tend to indicate that replicated food doesn't taste as good as food actually farmed/raised. That would indicate a very real want for a restaurant, as people would prefer tastier food. Also, the creativeness necessary in making a new dish needs a real brain behind it. In addition, part of the dining experience is the atmosphere, which you can't always get at home. It can be assumed that chain franchise restaurants probably don't exist any more.
<ul><li> However, that brings back the subject of scarcity. Since replicated food is the norm, it's likely farm raised fruits and vegetables are rare and hard to get. How does he ensure he gets his "fair share" of "real" food? The likely conclusion, then, is that in order to ensure he gets his "fair share", there must be some sort of authoritarian mechanism (likely automated) that allots supply based on demand. As more people come to his restaurant ordering shucked clams, the mechanism allots him more clams. Since scarcity is a non-issue (reasonable for an extraplanetary society with numerous planets to farm and the ability to teleport matter at least globally) theoretically speaking he'll never run into supply problems.
</li><li> It's actually explicitly stated that he grows his own food, and we even see shots of his garden in one episode. Exactly how he grows enough vegetables to support a restaurant in what appears to be about 10 square feet of soil in an alley is left unexplained.

To keep the system fair, the Mallrats also fix the price in tokens of each commodity. The system may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> as the Mallrats are a bunch of kids with only the vaguest understanding of how economies work, but the fundamental premise seems to be that if you start out with a fixed amount of money, and just move it back and forth all day, at some point, it will magically reproduce.
<ul><li> If the Mallrats have invented the concepts of lending and debt as well as profit, then money sort of DOES magically reproduce. Say someone who only has nine tokens at the end of the day borrows a token from someone with eleven tokens on the promise that he will pay the other person back the next day. This second system of "private loans" would exist outside the "normal" system in what is effectively an early form of "reserve banking", thus increasing the total money supply.

Despite the McDuckian piles of cash in their hut, having a lot of money doesn't mean a lot for seven people stuck in a dire situation. Even believing that the Howells would repay them once they got back to civilization would wear thin eventually. Usually, it's the Skipper who tries to get them to work, but the scene often ends on a joke, with no lessons learned. Arguably, it could be that the Howells are too old and never worked a day in their lives so they wouldn't know how, but it isn't until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeEpisode">Broke Episode</a> that everyone tries to teach them.

<ul><li> Tabletop role playing games in general are extremely vulnerable to this due to economics outside the party usually not being the focus of the game design and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinatorialExplosion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinatorialExplosion">Combinatorial Explosion</a> setting in: Since there's no engine limitation on what the PCs can or can't do, any imbalance in the economic system can be exploited. The usual result is a gentlemen's agreement about not abusing the most blatantly illogical parts.
<ul><li> Older games justify this with the player characters not being professional merchants (or being too busy with the adventure to use more than the most basic of merchant skills) and the prices and variation in the manual being what a customer can expect for small-volume purchases and transactions.
</li><li> Newer games written with the trope in mind tend to be Aversions by enforcing the above mechanically. If you're just buying a widget, look up widgets in table "Widget prices". If you're attempting to make a profit off of buying and selling widgets, your actions have an actual impact on the market, so instead roll against your "day trading" skill and look up how much profit you're making per day. Still a simplification, but one that addresses the usual specific complaint.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GaryGygax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GaryGygax">Gary Gygax</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> that the economic system of 1st Edition <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Advanced Dungeons and Dragons</a></em> didn't work, particularly with all the gold and jewels being taken into or out of the economy at different times, but it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>: namely, it was just plain more impressive for the players to obtain large amounts of gold than copper. Not that this prevented many player characters from going after the copper and silver coins too...
<ul><li> Later editions still have quirks. Famously, in 3.5 edition, a 10 foot ladder is cheaper than 2 10 foot poles. In fact, it's perfectly profitable for players to employ laborers (whose daily salary is less than the profit made on a single ladder-to-poles conversion) to do this all day. Similarly, a spiked chain is cheaper than the same length of normal chain. Players could generate as much money as they needed just by being in the business of hiring laborers to craft these items all day long... except that also ignores economic truths about the supply exceeding the demand and driving the profit margin down, which a sensible Dungeon Master will quickly slap down to rule that Player Characters cannot abuse the fixed item values that way.
</li><li> Labor seems to also be slightly out of proportion to physical goods and food, as typical manual labor costs are 2 silver a day, barely enough to feed the people and give them a spot on the floor of the worst slum in town. Apparently, all labor consists of malnourished beggars.
</li><li> An article in an early-90s issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Dragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Dragon">Dragon</a></em> discussed how to make a more realistic-looking (<em>looking</em>, mind, which even the author admitted to) economic situation by exploring real historic currencies, including making silver the dominant high-value coinage instead of gold. Platinum was thrown out of consideration entirely as it was not considered a precious metal (or even particularly well known) before the 1700s.
</li><li> The "15 million gold per day trick", where a mage creates a huge block of iron, turns that block into daggers, and sells them for the price marked in the gamebook.
</li></ul></li><li> The steel-based currency in D&amp;D <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em> doesn't really make sense - you can end up with situations where a steel sword, if melted and forged into coins, would be worth more than its original cost (i.e. say the sword cost 10 coins. By melting it down you could get enough steel to forge 15 coins). Beyond that, currency typically uses items that <em>don't</em> have practical value. A world where steel is more valuable would be <em>less</em> likely to use steel for coins, not more. Steel currency would be more appropriate in a setting where war ended and a plethora of existing weapons and armor meant that the best purpose for steel would be to melt it down and make money out of it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a>,</em> derived from Dungeons and Dragons 3rd edition, did fix some of the most blatant economic issues present, notably adjusting the price of ladders and 10-foot poles, and specifying that the iron created from a <em>Wall of Iron</em> spell would simply crumble and rust apart and couldn't be reforged. It still has some issues, very notably with the price adjustments for certain rare materials used in crafting, like mithril and adamantium. Specifically, the price modification for an adamantium weapon was a flat +3,000gp increase to cost, no matter if it was a dagger or a greatsword. Barring some GM handwavery, you could get an adamantium greatsword, melt it down (or reshape with magic) into adamantium daggers, and sell for massive profits.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rolemaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rolemaster">Rolemaster</a></em>'s coinage hierarchy used to place tin coins below copper. If you assume an earth-type world, tin is rare and expensive - it's the fraction that makes bronze so much more expensive than iron/steel.
<ul><li> And to add insult to injury, Bronze Pieces are worth <em>more</em> than Copper Pieces in the same coinage hierarchy.
</li></ul></li><li> In a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness">World of Darkness</a></em> manual, the author describes in great length how the extremely long-term strategic planning of centuries-old vampiric masterminds make US and European companies competitive against Japanese ones. Whether it's an economic Fail or not is dependent on how <em>rigid</em> that long-term plan is, and a key thing to remember is that a business run by immortals is likely to be more patient about returns than one held by mortals. In theory, there should be less emphasis on small short-term gains at the expense of larger long-term ones.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LegendOfTheFiveRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LegendOfTheFiveRings">Legend of the Five Rings</a></em>, being based on feudal Japan and China, has a rice-based economy where one gold (koku) is the equivalent to the amount of rice one man will eat in a year. Or possibly what one family will eat in a year. There's some confusion as to which. Also, the exchange rate between gold, silver and copper coins means that even the smallest denomination of money in Rokugan is a fairly vast fortune. The handwave given is that it is beneath a samurai's station to be concerned with money, and that there is a sizable merchant class to deal with such matters. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> in later editions is that the value of currency has significantly inflated in the past few centuries, and it now takes somewhere from 12 to 15 koku to feed a man for a year. This dramatically cheapens raw gold, but it brings the price of food in line with the price of everything else.
</li><li> Da Orks of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> universe actually use their teeth as money. Disgusting, and also guarantees high inflation since they keep growing back their teeth like sharks, although the teeth do degrade with time (meaning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirate">Freebootaz</a> who hide chests of teef on deserted asteroids are going to be very disappointed if they ever get back to them). The Bad Moonz clan are among the richest of orks because they have a mutation that causes their teeth to grow faster. They also have a barter economy in weaponry and "shiny fingz" (which can be traded for each other) and squigs (weird fungus-animal hybrids that can serve as pets, ammo, hair plugs and everything in between, orks never get why humans aren't interested in trading for them). Not to mention perpetual war that guarantees consumption too high to leave any surplus for investment.
</li><li> Avalon Hill's <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1830:_The_Game_of_Railroads_and_Robber_Barons">1830<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>:
<ul><li> The way the game worked was that, when a railroad had its initial public offering, or float, the first share sold was the President's share and was worth two regular shares, and the player who bought it controlled the company. The company did not go into business, however, until a majority of the shares had been sold, all of which had to be sold at the initially offered value. Once the company had started operating, its share price could fluctuate, meaning that if the price went up, you could realize an immediate gain by buying leftover IPO shares at the initial value, even though they would immediately have the floating value. Obviously that makes no sense, since why would the company sell shares for less than their publicly traded value? Also, that's just not how IPO's work. In real life, obviously, there is no such thing as a President's share. Moreover, all issued shares will typically be sold in an IPO. If the shares do not all sell at their initial price, the price will fall until all issued shares have been sold.
</li><li> The other big problem in the game was that a railroad's stock price was almost solely a function of its dividend policy. If it issued a dividend, the price went up, but if it retained its earnings, the stock price went down. That generally meant that it was impossible to continue expanding a railroad once its start-up capital was exhausted, at least not without killing the stock price. Needless to say, investors are not, as a class, that short-sighted. Corporations regularly retain earnings in order to expand, and investors generally like that, since it means that dividends will be higher later. Some investors are short-term players, but plenty are not. Expansion does not generally hurt a company's stock price; taking losses does. What stockholders do not like, aside from losses, obviously, is when a corporation sits on a lot of cash without either investing it in expansion or paying it out as dividends. That can often lead to a strike suit.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Starfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Starfinder">Starfinder</a></em> neatly deals with the issue by making crafting a matter of convenience than a money saver.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AtopTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AtopTheFourthWall">Linkara</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/LeeAndDena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/LeeAndDena">Lee from Still Gaming</a> love pointing out the illogic of "collector's editions" of both comics and collectible cards, respectively. In short, people have a tendency to collect "first edition" or "collector's/limited edition" versions of certain items, believing that the label would automatically translate to "rare" and, thus, appreciate in value over time. This is also known as "Baseball Card Tuition Syndrome", as an infamous example (described by Lee) involved people gathering up baseball cards in the 70's and 80's, believing that they'd be able to pay for their kids' tuition in 20 years with them. The problem is a lack of understanding of supply and demand; most of the more expensive comics and cards out there were made in a day where it wasn't common to print them in the quantities they print them out, nowadays (hundreds of copies instead of hundred thousands), would not have very many copies in good condition still in existence, and are usually the first ever issues of world-famous characters (like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a>). Sadly, the companies also know this and deliberately hype up the label of "collector's edition" to get more buyers. This kind of market eventually backfired with serious consequences. Once people realized they were buying worthless piles of paper, they stopped buying comics and comic companies suddenly had stockpiles of hundreds of thousands of comics they couldn't sell. This led to a huge comic book crash which the industry never fully recovered from. Another notable thing about why first editions of Action Comics #1 (the first appearance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> ever) comic sell for millions is that many of them were destroyed in paper drives in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, which meant only a handful survived in any readable condition at all.

This makes even less sense the more context you get. The inquisitor is pissed because now that the players have brought the black market out into the open, the city will have to crack down on it, since they can't pretend to not notice anymore. That would mean the city didn't get any income from the market, since they couldn't officially acknowledge its existence. If the city didn't take any taxes, it couldn't have been the lifeblood, because the state would literally earn nothing from it. It would actually lose money, since the money that could have gone to a regular market, and then on to becoming tax money, instead went to the black market.

It initially sounds plausible, since hydrocarbons are a valuable resource and Titan has an abundance of them. However, the energy needed to ship them over interplanetary distances would be far greater than the energy needed to just synthesize them: hydrocarbons can be synthesized using the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer%C2%96Tropsch_process">Fischer-Tropsch process<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, which was invented in <em>1925</em>.

</div></li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987">Scrooge McDuck</a> gets it right more often than not, there's one especially confusing episode showing an alternate future where the triplets ally with Magica DeSpell after Uncle Scrooge goes missing due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a>. The entire economy was reversed, with employees paying the business they worked at. This could mean two things: since Magica was involved, we could just say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">A Witch Did It</a>; or taxes have been raised so high, such as "The Privilege of Working for Magica McDuck Enterprises Tax," that getting a paycheck is practically a moot point since all your money gets taken out. Honestly, it makes even less sense than other works on this page... where do the people get the money to have to pay her, let alone the money they, well, need for life? The only reasonable conclusion is that it's all just an overly complicated form of slavery.
<ul><li> They are paid for consuming goods, presumably. If the system is reversed 100-% then it would work the same way real life works; just having money would mean you are poor and being one billion dollars in debt means that you are very rich.
</li><li> Actually, there is a fairly simple explanation that could account for this: the boys never QUITE gained enough political clout to end minimum wage laws, but they did manage to legalize kickbacks as a loophole to get around them.
</li><li> Another episode has the boys take over the company while Scrooge is out of commission, and running the company into the ground. Then, they find out that child labor laws make it illegal for them to run a company, and so they reverse all the transactions they made. This includes people returning cars they'd bought, being refunded, and then disassembled into parts. What happened to the money paid for the labor to make the cars, and then disassemble them, is anyone's guess.
</li><li> In another <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987">DuckTales (1987)</a></em> episode, young Scrooge creates diamonds by having elephants stampede over coal. (This is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics">Artistic License &#150; Physics</a>, but if comic-book physics allowed diamonds to be created so easily they would be worthless).
<ul><li> Diamonds already can be synthesized fairly easily, but the DeBeers cartel has spent considerable money on claims that synthetic diamonds are inferior to their overpriced natural ones. However synthetic diamonds are widely used in industrial tools because they're not only cheaper but easily proven to be harder than natural diamonds with impurities.
</li></ul></li><li> One episode featured a duplication machine Gyro Gearloose made, which the triplets used to duplicate a coin. However, every time a bell rang, both the original and the copy would spontaneously duplicate again. Predictably, Duckburg is soon overflowing with duplicated coins, which are treated both as garbage and heavily inflated but legal tender. Eventually the protagonists discover that the copied objects will reach a breaking point and explode, so they trick the Beagle Boys into stealing all the copied money and putting it in a copied Money Bin where it can explode safely. (Well, safely for everybody but the Beagle Boys.) However, no further mention is made of the massive inflation on the local currency; the copied coins are identical to real ones, so the inflation would have affected normal money too. Even just a few days of hyperinflation would have caused untold changes.
</li></ul></li><li> The "America The Bankrupt" fallacy is parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> episode where Lisa becomes president. Not only does it have China (amongst other countries) demanding repayment, but Bart (who's grown up to be a deadbeat-not surprisingly) is able to use his own money-mooching skills to deflect them ("I totally remember mailing a check to you.")
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HouseOfMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HouseOfMouse">House of Mouse</a></em> involves Professor von Drake inventing a special credit card that could "end poverty" by giving everyone in the world an effectively unlimited cash supply. It seems to exist solely so that the villain could steal the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup">only one</a> and... well, use it to do exactly what it was created for. None of the characters question the logic, despite the fact that such an "invention" would render the entire economy obsolete almost immediately.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RankinBassProductions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RankinBassProductions">Rankin Bass</a> Christmas special <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RankinBassJackFrost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RankinBassJackFrost">Jack Frost</a></em> has a village that is completely penniless all year except for the winter, because they take the icicles and carve them into coins and thrive that season. This is... to say the least, not at all how anything works ever.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>: Gemstones. Most of the time, they are treated as worthless beyond their decorative purposes, as Rarity uses sometimes cartloads for her dresses, while dragons and the Diamond Dogs collect them for their beauty, and Spike <em>eats</em> them like candy. Then comes "Just For Sidekicks", when Spike convinces the Mane Six to pay him for petsitting while they're gone. You could assume they're just giving him worthless rocks they found, but then the second part requires him to give the gems away for various reasons (paying the Cutie Mark Crusaders to watch the pet for him, paying a 'boon' to Zecora, buying train tickets...) and suddenly gems are legal tender - the CMC even spends the thumbnail-sized gem Spike got from Rarity on an industrial-sized pet drier almost as large as their clubhouse! And yes, this is the gem that was in payment for watching a fussy cat for the day, and which he intended to bake into a cake. What makes this even stranger is that there is <em>already</em> an established currency in Equestria: gold coins, or "bits."
<ul><li> Although, bits aside, this economic model CAN work if you factor in dragons and their hoards. A first season plot centers around a dragon moving into a cave near Ponyville, and subsequent episodes have made it clear that dragons aren't exactly an endangered species. It would be safe to assume that dragons unwittingly serve as enforcers of scarcity by hoarding/eating gemstones.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">''Web of Spider-Man''</a> episode titled "Gold Rush!" the Beyonder innocently turns a whole building into gold in the middle of the night; the U.S. government however decides to keep it a secret and pay the Kingpin to forever keep the gold out of reach (i.e. secretly throw it into the ocean's depth) since its discovery by the public would supposedly destroy the world's economy. In reality, that would no more destroy the world economy than would a major gold strike in the mining industry. It would depress gold prices for a while, but since no one uses the gold standard anymore, it would have very little effect beyond that. Doesn't stop Spidey from swiping one item, a gold notepad, though; he just uses it to help pay off Aunt May's home to prevent it from being repossessed.
<ul><li> Similarly, an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em> had the turtles visiting the home world of an alien race of sentient turtles who planned to move to Earth to escape a monster menacing them. One of the reasons the Turtles seek to prevent them from doing this (by dealing with the monster themselves) is the fact that the alien turtles can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics">manufacture gold and use it as a construction material</a>; thus if they moved to Earth, the global economy would be "ruined"; again, gold prices would be depressed, but that's all.
</li></ul></li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget">Inspector Gadget</a></em> had MAD seeking a formula that could turn lead to gold, which Penny feared would destroy the world's economy. As mentioned numerous times above, most of the world doesn't use gold-backed currencies, so this wouldn't actually happen. Though given the enormous amount of lead that Doctor Claw had been stockpiling in anticipation of his plan succeeding, if the formula had actually worked (All it really did was make the outside of a lead bar gold-colored), he would have ended up with enough gold to significantly distort its market value if sold all at once.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball">The Amazing World of Gumball</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in one episode where Larry goes on strike.

<ul><li> The Manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagiLabyrinthOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagiLabyrinthOfMagic">Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic</a></em> not only averts this &mdash; it's also made a cause in one of the Arc! The King of Balbadd adopted the Kou Empire's Currency system, which used paper money as opposed to their coin one, without having the market prepped for the introduction of this new currency &mdash; resulting in inflation rates that not only left a majority of the citizens destitute, but also fuels animosity towards the royal family and higher class (who ended up benefiting from this) to the point that the bad guys are able to incite a violent revolution against them. And what's worse &mdash; the King and the other nobles became so addicted to the currency and the lavish lifestyle that came with it that the King agreed to marry the Empire's Princess and was willing to sign a contract that used the citizens as collateral via <em>slavery</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">just to get more money</a>!
</li><li> An apparently similar scenario appears in the segment of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KatsuhiroOtomo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KatsuhiroOtomo">Katsuhiro Otomo</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Memories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Memories">Memories</a></em> entitled <em>Cannon Fodder</em>, which depicts a day in the life of a city devoted entirely to firing countless cannons at the unseen, possibly fictional "Moving Cities" of an unknown enemy, with the populace kept in line by an authoritarian government utilizing ubiquitous propaganda.
<ul><li> There's at least one <em>real</em> Moving City, the one protagonists live in, and we are shown only a small portion of its works. It is entirely possible for the City to have a functional, if really imbalanced, "garrison economy"; the point of the episode was more about the futility of war in general.
</li></ul></li><li> The manga/anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> does pretty well when it comes to economics of the villages: the villages all get clients which pay for the services of the ninja inside, and they're ranked from easiest to most difficult and given to shinobi who fit each job. For example, babysitting, hiring a ninja for dog walking, landscaping, even trash pickup or pet finding are considered 'D-Rank' missions, while escorting people or being a bodyguard is chosen by the threats the ninja'd face (C-Rank is for the biggest threat being common bandits, B-Rank is for ninja enemies) and the most difficult jobs are A and S rank, which gives a lot of money to the people who perform them each time. Jiraiya is in fact the richest ninja we've seen in the manga not only due to his best selling books: he had completed <em>138 S-Rank</em> missions, which means he eared 138,000,000 ryo on that ALONE (each S-Rank mission earns 1,000,000 ryo each), with <em>1,839 missions done total</em>. Also, the entire Sand / Sound invasion from Part I was sparked due to an economic depression the former Wind Daimyo had inflicted on Sunagakure by taking all of their business and giving it to Konohagakure instead of his country's own village.
</li><li> Crocodile's plan from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> is a more well-thought out version of the H.A.W.X Example. He plans to use his mercenary organization, Baroque Works, to stage a coup on the country of Alabasta. However, this is only the first part of his plan, the second part was to use the revolution as a cover to sneak into the palace and find the blueprints for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">superweapon Pluton.</a>
<ul><li> Not as well-thought out, however, is the Arlong Pirates' money-making scheme. They take over Nami's home island, by and large cutting it off from the rest of the world, and demand a monthly tax from its residents in order for them to keep their lives. On their first sweep of Nami's village alone, they get roughly 25 million berries, which would indicate that, during the eight years leading up to the story's present, that one little village paid over <em>two billion</em> berries, an incredibly staggering sum. Given that the island is a small backwater fishing and farming community instead of a bustling port, one has to wonder where on earth that one little village procured all that money from, to say nothing of the other villages spread across the island.
<ul><li> Part of the problem with that is that the relative value of Berries to any real world currency. 25 million from a village would not be so strange on Yen values, but would likely be insane on something like the dollar or the pound sterling. Given that monetary values in the series are often only portrayed for very-high-value things like Bounties, Aristocrat slave auctions, or the sale of large amounts of treasure, the basics of the One Piece economy are in general hard to derive.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PumpkinScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PumpkinScissors">Pumpkin Scissors</a></em>, we see the sad state of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a> after the war they've had, in which there was barely any post-war relief efforts done until the formation of Section 3, and their jobs are difficult (one of the characters even find that his superiors were intentionally keeping the cost of commodities up by purchasing them from a province where it is more expensive, and the main character suffers something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> when the difference between her own lifestyle and those of the people she helps is brought to her attention). Let's not even get to all the effort and resources they've put into the Invisible 9, and you could infer them to having a "Destruction Equals Employment" policy going on by the amount of resources the military gets.
<ul><li> The show's main message seems to be that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil">Aristocrats Are Evil</a> (Alice herself notwithstanding), and the Empire's economic hardships were largely an illustration to that thesis.

First, the Prime Minister is inspired to give everyone one of Komori's blankets, so they feel optimistic and will spend stimulus money, and this is shown as working well and helping Japan's economy. However, someone points out that Nozomu has no financial worries because he's a civil servant, and so the P.M. gets the idea that since civil servants are economically secure, it would be great to make <em>everyone</em> a civil servant. This completely crashes the economy.
</li><li> In a chapter of one spinoff manga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo">Tenchi Muyo!</a></em>, the group tried solving a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeEpisode">Broke Episode</a> by having Princess Ayeka ask her father for some money, and he immediately gives them a massive shipful of gold. They either send back or just sit on most of it rather than living like kings, noting that he had given them enough to destabilize the Earth's economy. In contrast, in the original OVA they didn't really suffer from money problems to begin with.
<ul><li> In another chapter Ryoko complains about Galaxy Policy officer Mihoshi's destructive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainCrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainCrash">Captain Crash</a> tendencies only for Noboyuki (in a rare moment of anger) to point out that unlike the rest of the freeloading girls Mihoshi not only has a job, but donates part of her paycheck to pay for rent and damages. There is some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> though in exactly how much Mihoshi is paid and if she's being paid enough to cover the cost of her damages, but at least the currency exchange can be explained away with Earth being secretly aligned with the planet Jurai (that or the entire galaxy uses the yen).

</p><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse">Disney Ducks Comic Universe</a></em>:
<ul><li> In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonRosa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonRosa">Don Rosa</a> Scrooge McDuck story, <em>The Quest for Kalevala</em>, Scrooge briefly gets his hand on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSampo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSampo">The Sampo</a>, a mythic handmill that can produce infinite amounts of gold. Normally business-savvy Scrooge gets struck by a severe case of gold fever, and starts rolling out tons of gold. In a boat. In the middle of a storming sea. The economic implications were left unstudied, since immediate survival quickly becomes a more important matter. Knowing Scrooge, he probably wanted more gold <em>just</em> to swim in.
</li><li> An Italian Scrooge McDuck comic has him trying to hunt down a second-rate philosopher's stone &mdash; it can turn any metal into silver &mdash; because he owns a majority of the world's silver mines, and its existence would make silver worth much less (presumably, anyone who gets the stone can duplicate it). The Beagle Boys, on the other hand, are merely thrilled at the idea of making silver out of common junk and getting rich selling it, and try to steal it from him.
</li><li> Donald gets into the world of numismatics after he discovers how precious rare coins can be, and cons Scrooge into exchanging modern money for old (from the depths of his hoard) to subsequently sell the old pieces for a profit. Scrooge gets wind of it, and cons Donald back by selling him a whole bag of old coins... only the collector to whom Donald sold his coins won't buy them anymore as the market is already saturated.
</li><li> After learning about numismatics from Donald (presumably no relation to the above case) and realizing how coins are more valuable the rarer they are, he induces an artificial scarcity by buying up every coin of a certain mintage, and dumping all but one into the deepest part of the ocean, making the remaining one priceless. (It promptly has a run-in with a steamroller, necessitating the main plot of them diving into the ocean to find a replacement, fighting Atlanteans in the process.) In the end, he has the coin valued and starts looking for a buyer... only to be told that the only one rich enough to afford it is <em>Scrooge himself</em>.

In an early chapter with Harry in Gringotts, he notes how the Muggle and Wizardry economies must completely be detached from each other because of the ability to bring in one's own gold/silver/bronze, and then being able to convert between Galleons, Snickles, and Knuts. Using a conversion scheme by buying any of these three metals while it is low, and then converting it into a higher priced metal which he could sell, would allow Harry to utterly break the wizard economy (and become VERY wealthy) "in a week."

Since the value ratio between silver and gold was roughly 5:1 to 10:1 in Japan and 15:1 to 18:1 everywhere else, currency speculators went to Japan with five pounds of silver, bought one pound of gold with it, and then went home and bought fifteen pounds of silver with the gold, netting a 150-200% profit less traveling expenses. It nearly destroyed Japan's economy before the government forcibly changed their exchange ratio to match everyone else's.

</li><li> The movie <em>Harrowhouse 11</em> focuses on a complex plot to rob a stockpile of diamonds from a company that has a near-monopoly over the trade, and is withholding the diamonds to keep the market price up. At the end of the movie after a successful heist, the protagonist is fully aware that if they put everything they stole into circulation, it would cause the value of diamonds to plummet. He ends up burying most of the diamonds in concrete, and keeping only a fraction.

They kept tariffs low to cut costs to themselves, then didn't have enough money to fund their military. When a war broke out, they had to raise tariffs and get war loans to pay to increase their militia to a size that might have enabled them to avoid the war in the first place, and the moment the war ended, they immediately cut tariffs again to restore their profits, forgetting that the government now had more expenses (Paying off the war loans). These decisions based on short term personal financial gain bankrupted their country, which cost them their independence, demonstrating a failure to understand both economics and politics in one go. As a bonus, they were also completely incapable of realizing that just because a product is expensive, it doesn't necessarily mean that the person who makes it is rich. Thus they put high taxes on goods that were expensive to buy because they were expensive to make, thus putting many of the producers of one of their key exports out of business.

<ul><li> In the early novels, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplesRepublicOfTyranny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplesRepublicOfTyranny">People's Republic of Haven</a> has an economic model where anyone who wants to can live somewhat tolerably on welfare for their entire adult life. As a result of this having been practiced for generations, the vast majority of their citizens didn't see any point in working, so the employment rate was somewhere around 10%, at most. This resulted in low productivity, which meant that the government had a small tax base, which resulted in their slowly going bankrupt. The only thing they could think of to prop up their budget was to conquer their neighbors and loot their economies, something that only provided a short-term relief, as they introduced their flawed systems to their conquered planets, resulting in millions of more unproductive Dolists (people who spend their entire lives on the dole) draining away their budget. <br>Of course, the leaders <em>knew</em> that their system had failed, but they couldn't see a way to solve the problem, as the only places they could cut the budget enough to make a difference were the BLS (Basic Living Stipend, the permanent welfare program), which would cause the Dolists to revolt, or the Navy, which would result in attacks from neighboring planets that were at the top of the "to be conquered" list and revolts on recently conquered planets. The one nice thing you can say about the people who murdered the Legislaturists and took over was that while they may have been just as monstrous in their own ways, they <em>did</em> manage to fix their country's economy &#151; by finding a propaganda spin that made the Dolists <em>volunteer</em> to actually work, by going to war with Manticore. This also, incidentally, led to they themselves being overthrown in the end and the original Haven Constitution being restored.
</li><li> The reason why the Legislaturalists' Government feared the Dolists' revolt was that they were kinda squeamish about the means they'd have to employ should it break out. When the much more ruthless Committee of Public Safety introduced their wartime measures (which included the sharp BLS cut) revolt did promptly break out, and was mercilessly put down by orbital bombardment (earning one of the characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">the in-universe nickname of</a> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Citizen Admiral Clusterbomb</a>"). There was actually very little actual volunteering, the government <em>forced</em> everyone to start working, as the new BLS was essentially a starvation budget, and they already had conscription for the military.

Meaning that EVERYONE from King Jack on down had an excellent motive. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And then it turns out that the culprit was the one person who had no motive: the castle cook, while drunk, had mistaken it for another goose and wrung its neck with intent to roast it for dinner.</span>
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchSeries">Night Watch (Series)</a></em> book explains why that series averts this. It is said that transmutation is relatively simple magic, which could allow the Others (and specifically the Watches) to manufacture money (or any other resource). It is said that most non-Watch Others would be severely limited in the degree to which they could do this, whereas the Watches themselves assign minor Others to the task of managing their business holdings to fund themselves. It's explained that they do this because they don't want to ruin the local economies (which, considering that the books are set in Russia, are bad enough as they are).
</li><li> Three oppressive Dystopias operate with perpetual war economies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour">Nineteen Eighty Four</a></em>, with it being explicitly stated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceOfPower">even two on one, none of them can win the war</a>. This is done to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">destroy surplus wealth and keep people's standards of living from getting better</a>. The goal isn't to support their economies, but to keep them down. Using war to deliberately destroy wealth may be insane, but it works. It also theorizes that people could be forced to make very large monuments to use up wealth and keep the standard of living low, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrioticFervor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrioticFervor">war stirs more passion in citizens</a>, and ultimately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherIsWatching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherIsWatching">more love for their leader</a>. There's also speculation - both in-universe and in the real world - that the "eternal war" was actually just part of the all-encompassing governmental propaganda.
<ul><li> A similar problem to <em>Brave New World</em> arises, though such a model requires infinite resources, unless incredibly efficient recycling methods have been developed. The book handwaves this by saying that even the leaders behind the scheme realize eventually their standard of living will get worse over time as well&mdash; they don't mind as long as they are sufficiently ahead of the proletarians.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSalvationWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSalvationWar">The Salvation War</a></em> makes mentions the economy of the Earth and the USA during the war. Or, as one character says, "What economy Sir? We don&#146;t have one any more, we've got a train wreck instead." The books show just how bad such a total focus on militarization is for the world economy, and the mess that is left in its wake. And then you consider the fact that Earth had just conquered Heaven - where the capital city has gold and jewels apparently collected from a hundred planets or so.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SpiceAndWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SpiceAndWolf">Spice and Wolf</a></em> not only averts this trope, but it's based entirely on Economics, so it would be a disaster if this trope was played straight.

</li></ul><hr><ul><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> dictates that the economy of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em> universe should have collapsed a long time ago, they did avert this on one occasion.

He does this by convincing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">smart customers</a> that the Magikarp will make them rich by having the Magikarp have children, and then the next generation will have more children, and soon one will have an infinite amount of Magikarp and an infinite amount of money. However, it is made very clear that the only one making any money off this scheme is the Magikarp salesman. Granted it's more of a con than economics (he sells one fish that mates and tells you it'll just multiply).
</li><li> The submarine adventure simulation <em>SubCulture</em> has a quite well-rounded economy. You can gather several raw materials (like, metal, thorium, or nicotine) in the ocean and sell them at the various cities, or buy wares from one city and sell it for a profit to another. Buying raises prices, selling lowers them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> deserves some credit for its depiction of post-industrial economies. Unlike many other sci-fi franchises such as <em>Star Wars</em>, which abide by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillUseManualLaborInTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillUseManualLaborInTheFuture">We Will Use Manual Labor in the Future</a>, the vast majority of jobs still held by humans (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAliens">and aliens</a>) in <em>Mass Effect</em> are dependent on either intellectual capital (e.g. engineers, software developers, programmers, pilots), entertainment (actors, writers, directors, video game designers, artists, etc.), or are otherwise service-based (clerks, waiters, barbers, lawyers, doctors, salesmen, nurses, living assistants, etc.). Technology has progressed enough that employing humans in direct goods-producing roles instead of using advanced machines is obsolete. At one point you can ask a store clerk why she even has a job when all the sales can be done online (and often are), and she responds that customers like a personal touch in their purchases and to have a real person there to answer questions. This accurately depicts the economic concept of mass personalization brought on by automation.
<ul><li> Also, despite how different the species are in biology, government, culture, and so on, nearly every economy is clearly a free market capitalist one with wage labor, private property rights enforced by the state, corporate competition (enforced by the state if necessary), private capital accumulation, and market-determined prices, because this is (as current science understands) the most quantitatively superior method of distributing scarce resources. It stands to reason that all civilizations would develop it for the same reason that all civilizations developed, say, the wheel, or firearms. The exact <em>strain</em> of free market capitalism varies, from the borderline anarcho-capitalist society of Illium to the liberal capitalist Nordic-style economy of Thessia to the authoritarian capitalist Chinese-style economy of Palaven, but all the civilizations agree on those key points. The species who <em>don't</em> have these measures in place like the krogan, batarians, and quarians are clearly depicted as economic basket cases for it (among other reasons).
</li><li> Even the angara in <em>Andromeda</em> maintain a capitalist market economy despite being in a post-apocalyptic situation, albeit an accurately-depicted state capitalist one with a large safety net. They avert this trope in another way with an accurate depiction of a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy">gift economy<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, which there's ample evidence that early civilizations utilized as opposed to the more common view of them using barter economies. It's never called that in game, but it's clearly described as one: within tight-knit groups where currency isn't being used, individual members freely trade goods and services and keep track of their mental debts with the expectation of being paid back later in kind, with the value of the good or service informally determined depending on the persons' needs.

Except that she got this aluminium by going back to the human world and buying aluminium <em>foil</em>, which she then sold in the magical world. Given how easy it is to buy aluminium foil in the human world, and how little X cares about economics, it doesn't take long for the whole situation to go downhill.
</li><li> According to some throwaway comments in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Roommates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Roommates">Roommates</a></em> the wish and favor based "economy" of the magical people (at least partially) owes its existence to the older ones realizing that messing with the mortal monetary systems is more trouble than it's worth (like giving away large quantities of gold/money can cause inflation, and exchange rates are a pain).

The Pretties (read: 16-2x year olds) could have nearly anything they want just by asking for it.

The system has its problems to a careful reader - one would imagine that people would cry foul when major parts of the formerly working class populace get free lunch without doing anything, while others continue to toil at least until someone in their ranks manages to mechanize that particular industry, as well. Still, the people who have jobs that can't be automatized are depicted as the lucky ones, since permanent vacation isn't all that it's cut out to be, and as a result adult education flourishes.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesStross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesStross">Charles Stross</a> enjoys working with post-scarcity societies; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Accelerando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Accelerando">Accelerando</a></em> chronicles the creation of one straight through the singularity. Protagonist Manfred Macx is one of the first people on Earth to realize that in such a world the best way to get truly rich is to help <em>other</em> people achieve great goals and become rich. In <em>Singularity Sky</em> and <em>Iron Sunrise</em> the most valuable resource in the universe are the entangled quantum dots that enable faster-than-light communication and which have to be transported slower than light. After that the most valuable things are information and creativity.
<ul><li> There are particularly odd things such as the market for reputation in Accelerando... exactly what a valuable reputation is was not explicitly defined in the novel, but Manfred was kind of the template for how it might work. In short: as physical production becomes easier, there is less value in (easily-automated) labor and more in creativity/novelty and initiative. A person with a valuable reputation is someone worth investing in - their work will give you back valuable ideas, access to valuable resources, or simple entertainment. It's like an elaborate amalgam of a stock market, venture capitalism, and one's social media followers.
</li><li> Accelerando also mentions "Economics 2.0", the foundation of the society of the post-scarcity transhuman intelligences formed by modified uploaded humans and AI. It apparently isn't possible to understand nor engage in Economics 2.0 without your conscious mind being altered to the point where you are quite clearly no longer human, which also handily avoids the need for the author to explain what such godlike beings might trade in, or why. It's somewhat implied that the superintelligences are trading in lesser intelligences for control of creativity and novelty, but the characters observe from indirect contact with the remnants of other post-Singularity societies that they end up autocannibalizing as the superintelligences use (and use up) one another in their ever-more-complex economic interactions.

That gave them all kinds of trouble with the authorities, as <em>their</em> take on what communism should look like (decentralized, technology focused) was radically different from the party line. Similar elements were actually common with most Soviet Sci-Fi (indeed, it was actually <em>required</em> that writers depict the future as being communist, because the government thought it would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatPoliticsMessUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatPoliticsMessUp">"inevitably"</a> be the case) but they fleshed it out to such an extent that it unnerved censors.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanislawLem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanislawLem">Stanis&#322;aw Lem</a>'s <em>Observation on the Spot</em> one of the countries <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Ijon Tichy</a> visits on Entia is Lusania &mdash; a thorough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">deconstruction</a> of post-scarcity utopia, where everything is done by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanomachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanomachines">nanomachines</a> and people cannot hurt each other, but because of that hardly anything has any real value anymore. Many Lusanians long for the "simpler life" others have.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EclipsePhase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EclipsePhase">Eclipse Phase</a></em> habitats operating under a "New" economy don't use money, instead most items are produced by public nanofabricators that are supplied with raw materials by robot miners, and everyone who contributes a few hours of "community service" each week is allotted enough resources to feed six people each day. Anything that can't be nanofabbed or requires more resources than a person is allotted (services, implants, spaceships, earth relics...) are either bartered for or obtained as favors from one's social network, which assign "rep" scores to people based on their actions. The Titanian Commonwealth has a variant where the government quantifies people's economic output as "kroners" that are invested in microcorps which do anything that nanofabs can't and give their employees rep.
<ul><li> There are also habitats with "Old" economies that ban nanofabricators and "Transitional" economies that have money and public nanofabricators which can only be used to produce goods without electronics or rare elements.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ToTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ToTheStars">To the Stars</a></em> has this with Earth, with replicators being commonplace, although there are 'allocs' for luxury items like non-synthesized restaurant food or berths on space-going vessels. Averted, however, on the other planets in humanity's empire, which still use a capitalist system. The main character, from Earth, is therefore quite confused when deployed to one of these planets and is bombarded by things called 'advertisements'.
<ul><li> To the fanfic's credit, it's mentioned that the twenty-year-and-still going war is causing resources to be drained faster, resulting in an economic shift back towards a capitalist model. Professions which used to be performed for free pre-war are beginning to ask for donations, and students are re-thinking their career choices when they could previously chase whatever dream they wanted regardless of productivity. This is understandably troubling for many Earthborn who are unused to the idea of scarcity, especially for the basics.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstructed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstructed">Reconstructed</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOrville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOrville">The Orville</a></em>. The Planetary Union has a post-scarcity economy for the same reasons as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> (being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Homage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Homage">homage</a> to the series), namely cheap, clean energy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatterReplicator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatterReplicator">matter replicators</a>. However, Kelly explains in the penultimate episode of season one that, even though material resources are plentiful, people with skills and the will and connections to use them are not<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3ntm6');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3ntm6" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3ntm6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">in the pilot, Ed mentions that the Union Fleet is having trouble finding crews to keep its ships running</span>, so the Planetary Union economy largely runs on people's reputations: <em>things</em> no longer have value, but <em>people</em> do, in a non-slavery way. Status is earned by what you do, but you can fully dedicate yourself to a practice and be the best you can be, which in turn <em>is</em> your economic value. The other side of this is explored somewhat obliquely in the second season: Lieutenant Gordon, known as an ace pilot, decides he wants to be more than just that and applies for command responsibilities. While Commander Greyson's initial reaction could be considered a "wait, <em>you</em> in command?" reaction, there's the implication that if he goes for command and doesn't do well, it will devalue his personal reputation because he will be going from a "Great Pilot" to a "Below Average Commander".
</li><li> Zig-zagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SchlockMercenary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SchlockMercenary">Schlock Mercenary</a></em>; they still use money, but the resources with the biggest retrictions are PTU's (post-transuranic elements) to make ship hulls, and Annie plants (made of neutronium) to power them (and even then, the size is the limiting factor). The cast meets a race that had the capacity to <em>easily</em> produce PTU's, and unintentionally ended up with a "planet sized debt" from selling off some of their ships. In a more humorous note, Schlock gets transferred from one ship to another, and complains... because the previous ship could make cookies any time he wanted.
