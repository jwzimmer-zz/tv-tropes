<ul><li> This eventually happened to Cutter John in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BloomCounty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BloomCounty">Bloom County</a></em>. Though he didn't disappear like the scores of other characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">who were dropped</a> from the comic, his role was dramatically reduced by the strip's end (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> being that wheelchairs are difficult to draw within the confines of a comic strip panel).
</li><li> After the 9/11 attacks, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TheBoondocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TheBoondocks">The Boondocks</a></em> became less of a slice-of-life comedy strip and commented more on world news. It takes few to commentate, so the strip neglected everyone except Huey, Riley, Granddad, Caesar, and Tom. Eventually a few characters were brought back, though Jazmine was mad that Huey wasn't worried about her while she was gone.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jazmine:</strong> I guess you were too busy sitting here and making mean-spirited comments about the world to realize we hadn't <strong>seen each other for two years!!</strong> <br><strong>Huey:</strong> By the way, did you hear that "Meth And Red" got canc- <br><strong>Jazmine:</strong> <strong>AARRRGH!!</strong>
</div></li><li> The London <em>Evening Standard</em> used to run a cartoon called <em>Clive</em> about a boy of 17-18 and his various escapades. However, the strip began focusing less on him and more on his ten-year-old sister Augusta, until he was such a minor character that the strip was renamed <em>Augusta</em>. It was recognisably the same strip, especially since it still had all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gags</a> of its previous incarnation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert">Dilbert</a></em> 's transition from slice of life absurdism to office satire meant the more fantastical characters were marginalized (Ratbert, Bob the Dinosaur, Phil the Prince of Insufficient Light) if not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">eliminated altogether</a> (Zimbu the Monkey, Dawn and Rex). There's also Mordac the Preventer of Information Services, who went from a regular recurring villain to appearing infrequently.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/OnTheFastrack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/OnTheFastrack">On the Fastrack</a></em> used to star Bob Shirt, but compared to the other characters, he was boring. For many years now, he has appeared almost exclusively in ensembles &mdash; the only exception being him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">complaining about his reduced role at Fastrack</a>. Another Bill Holbrook comic, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/SafeHavens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/SafeHavens">Safe Havens</a></em>, used to star Matt Havens. He hasn't appeared <em>at all</em> in the last decade.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Luann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Luann">Luann</a></em> was initially a comic largely about the titular character and her classmates and family. Once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">Brad</a>, her brother, started becoming more and more important to the strip, gaining his <em>own</em> storylines, most of the teenage cast was downgraded significantly. Even Luann's best friends Bernice and Delta rarely appeared, to say nothing of poor Knute and Crystal, themselves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteCharacter">Satellite Characters</a> of others.
<ul><li> Things moved to a pattern: Brad and Luann would alternate focus each week. Luann's storylines tended to alternate between using her parents and using her friends. Every other month we usually get a week focusing on Gunther and Knute.
</li><li> The transition to college has oddly seen Brad and Toni move to the background (often barely appearing at all), with Luann, Gunther, Bernice, Quill and Tiffany being the major characters. Crystal and Knute now almost never appear, and Delta has moved away and disappeared. Then after breaking up with Luann, Quill disappeared altogether as well. The storylines now alternate between Luann (with Bernice), Gunther, and Tiffany.
</li></ul></li><li> This happens all the time in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewspaperComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewspaperComics">Newspaper Comics</a> &mdash; the long-running American strip <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Nancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Nancy">Nancy</a></em> was initially based around the title character's aunt Fritzi (the original title was <em>Fritzi Ritz</em>).
</li><li> Harry the Head was originally a major character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Oink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Oink">Oink!</a></em>, with his strip occupying a full page each issue, and having a number of multi-part adventures. In later editions, his strip had been reduced to an occasional three-frame gag.
</li><li> This happened to a number of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts">Peanuts</a></em> characters: Shermy, Patty, Violet, Freida, Pig-Pen. For example, in the 1980's and 1990's, Patty (not to be confused with the more prominent <em>Peppermint</em> Patty) appeared in a total of <em>three</em> comic strips. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> said Patty and Violet got the shaft because Lucy worked better as a female bully character, so it would be too redundant to have all three of them featured prominently.
<ul><li> In the latter half of the 1990s this had happened to nearly the <em>entire cast</em>. By the end of the strip's run, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">the focus had boiled down to four major storylines</a>: the misadventures of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">Rerun</a> (with Snoopy or Lucy acting as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan">Straight Man</a> depending on the plot), the day-to-day life of Snoopy's desert-dwelling brother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Spike</a>, the travels of Snoopy's other brothers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys">Andy and Olaf</a>, and Charlie Brown and Franklin (who had essentially replaced Linus) talking about life while leaning on a brick wall. Charlie Brown's sister Sally would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">occasionally get her own Sunday strip</a>, but the other characters (particularly Schroeder, Peppermint Patty, Marcie, and the already-mentioned Linus) rarely appeared.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Retail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Retail">Retail</a></em> had a shake up in 2012 where Stuart, the store manager, was promoted to district manager, with his assistant Marla taking over his old spot. While Stuart still shows up, he doesn't appear as frequently these days. Since 2015, however, Stuart began making more frequent appearances, either by talking to Marla by phone, or through his store visits.
</li><li> Once upon a time, back in 1919, there was a comic called "Take Barney Google f'rinstance". The titular character was a diminutive gambler with a gigantic angry wife. The wife was written out, and Barney got himself a horse named Spark plug, and the strip was renamed "Barney Google and Spark Plug". In 1934, Barney found himself deep in the Appalachians, where he met a hill-billy named "Snuffy Smith". And the strip was renamed, again, "Barney Google and Snuffy Smith". Here Barney would live for 20 years, until he left in 1954... But the comic stayed with Snuffy, and Barney became a rare guest in the comic carrying his name, usually several years going by without the originating character appearing in the strip.

In the books, Bambi and his cousins meet often as fawns and spend a lot of time together (especially after their mothers start distancing themselves from their children after being weaned). In the film, Faline and Bambi meet once and don't meet again until they're adults. Faline and Bambi's courtship is also given more depth in the books, as is the process of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bambi distancing himself from Faline</span> which was left out of the film.

</li><li> Fun fact for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013">Frozen</a></em> fans. The lead characters from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSnowQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSnowQueen">The Snow Queen</a></em> were named Gerda and Kai. So where are they in the movie? Why, they're servants to Anna and Elsa, of course! Though they don't really resemble the original characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly">in any way except for their names</a>. Their actual roles in the story were given to Elsa and Anna (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter">who also double as the Snow Queen and - to a lesser extent - the Princess respectively</a>).

Akela in particular: easily one of the most important characters in the book, here he appears for only a single scene and winds up being incredibly forgettable (he also gets a key appearance in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JungleCubs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JungleCubs">Jungle Cubs</a></em> however).
</li><li> Bagheera in the sequel.

Justified in that his character arc was mostly done with by the end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPanda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPanda">first movie</a> and <em>someone</em> had to watch the Jade Palace. Thankfully averted with the Furious Five, who appear much more this time around, and all of them actively help Po out throughout the film.

Unikitty, Benny and Metalbeard are now tertiary characters at best, President Business appears just at the beginning and end (though it's kind of justified by him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being based on Finn's father, who doesn't appear at all this time</span>), but Vitruvius and Bad Cop have it even worse: both have been reduced to silent cameos that last a couple of seconds.

This is mostly due to the expansion of the present-day story about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Ascended Extra</a> boy Ted, who is listening to the Once-ler's tale.

After the entire plot plays out and things go back to normal, the original Twilight only crosses over to the human world in the film's last moments.
</li><li> Flash Sentry has been pushed further into the background as the movies have progressed, most likely due to the backlash he garnered as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteLoveInterest">Satellite Love Interest</a>.
</li><li> Snips and Snails, who had a major role in the first film and a comedy role in the second, and Trixie, who had a notable cameo in the first film and a major role in the second, have no lines in Friendship Games and only briefly appear in the background.

Although, Apple Bloom was credited as she could briefly be heard in the pony choir during the song "We Got This Together". Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo were not credited at all. They all three had minor roles in this movie.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePeanutsMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePeanutsMovie">The Peanuts Movie</a>,</em> Linus' role as Charlie Brown's best friend and confidant is largely taken over by Snoopy, who's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInKindness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInKindness">more supportive</a> than in most adaptations.

He appears in the first scene of the movie, then doesn't get any more real screen time until very late. Justified in that he was presumed dead for most of the movie as a plot point, is revealed to be a cloaked figure in the middle of the film, and resumed an important role towards the end.
</li><li> A few other characters suffered this worse, namely Chief Powhattan, Nakoma, and Grandmother Willow, as they only appeared in the beginning before Pocahontas left for England. In fact, Grandmother Willow only appears in one scene in the entire movie for about a minute.

She instead of Aaron is with Moses in the staffs-to-snakes scene.

Faramir also crops up at the end. In a non-speaking moment with no explanation as to who he is. In order to give &Eacute;owyn a happy ending.

</li><li> One notorious example is Ms. Brisby in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSecretOfNIMH2TimmyToTheRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSecretOfNIMH2TimmyToTheRescue">The Secret of NIMH 2: Timmy to the Rescue</a></em>. While Brisby was the main protagonist of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSecretOfNIMH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSecretOfNIMH">the first film</a>, not only does the sequel avoid giving any mention of what she accomplished, let any role in the plot, she is on-screen for a grand total of 25 seconds, and only has two or three lines of dialogue.
</li><li> Talia al Ghul is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of <em>Batman and Son</em> in the comics, but her movie role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonOfBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonOfBatman">Son of Batman</a></em> is quite smaller. Much of her original role is given to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deathstroke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deathstroke">Deathstroke</a> in the film.
</li><li> Any character from the show who isn't SpongeBob, Patrick and Plankton in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpongeBobSquarePantsMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpongeBobSquarePantsMovie">The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie</a></em>. Squidward and Sandy only show up a few times, and Mr. Krabs spends the movie frozen. Fortunately, the characters' appearances in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpongeBobMovieSpongeOutOfWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpongeBobMovieSpongeOutOfWater">the second movie</a> are much more prominent.

</li><li> While not exactly "extras," you can argue that Mikey and Don are supporting characters while Leo and Raph are the main characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TMNT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TMNT">TMNT</a></em>.

Bluestreak, Sunstreaker, Huffer, Thundercracker, Skywarp, and Bombshell appear in cameos with no lines, Shockwave appears in two scenes and is implied to die, Shrapnel and Kickback are reduced to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt Monkeys</a> and then rebuilt, Mixmaster, Scavenger and Long Haul do not speak, Blitzwing gets one scene for himself, Ironhide, Wheeljack, Brawn, Prowl, Ratchet and Windcharger are killed off and Sludge, despite being a major character, has no lines. Spike and the three major Autobots who survive the movie (Bumblebee, Jazz, and Cliffjumper) have more minor roles. Perceptor and the four other Dinobots (Snarl mysteriously receiving this treatment) are the only pre-movie characters to do much of anything in the post-Autobot City scenes. Even Optimus Prime is only around for the first half of the movie. Plus, some characters don't appear in the movie at all, leaving their fates uncertain.
</li><li> Dogmatix (Idefix), while one of the main characters in the books, only makes a few brief appearances in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTwelveTasksOfAsterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTwelveTasksOfAsterix">The Twelve Tasks of Asterix</a></em>.
</li><li> Given the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">huge cast</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WakkosWish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WakkosWish">Wakko's Wish</a></em>, it's not unreasonable. A notable example is Minerva Mink; other than some solo lines at the beginning, she isn't exactly a featured member of the cast, even though she pops up here and there during the musical numbers. (Then again, it's not as if she was a big part of the original show to begin with due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, but still.)
</li><li> Christopher Robin was originally the star of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WinnieThePooh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WinnieThePooh">Winnie-the-Pooh</a></em> books; in the poetry books he appears often and has several poems dedicated to him (as opposed to Pooh, who only appears in one poem in <em>When We Were Very Young</em> and only appears occasionally in <em>Now We Are Six</em>), and while he was moved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> for the Pooh stories he remained a central character. In the first Disney featurettes he was also a major character, but in later productions he got smaller and smaller roles, quite often being left out entirely.
<ul><li> This <em>is</em> sort of explained in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheManyAdventuresOfWinnieThePooh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheManyAdventuresOfWinnieThePooh">The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh</a></em> (and elaborated upon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PoohsGrandAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PoohsGrandAdventure">Pooh's Grand Adventure</a></em>): He's started school. While the Disney version doesn't seem to be attending boarding school the way his book counterpart is implied to be, it's still reasonable to presume that he isn't around as much because he's busy with schoolwork.
</li><li> The out of universe reason is that Christopher Robin was a real person, and he had never been fond of the way he was portrayed in his father's books, even when he was a child. Up until his death, the real Christopher Robin was very picky about his portrayal in Disney's animated works.

It was generous to credit her as a band member to begin with considering that she didn't play on every song and didn't appear with the band in interviews and photo shoots.
<ul><li> David Fridmann gradually phased himself out of the band, first declining to tour with them from 1995 onwards and then quitting as bass player before 2005's <em>The Secret Migration</em> while continuing to produce the band's albums. This was the result of his growing profile as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecordProducer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecordProducer">Record Producer</a>, particularly for fellow studio perfectionists <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFlamingLips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFlamingLips">The Flaming Lips</a>, which as a result forced him to put his participation in Mercury Rev on the backburner. However, he remained credited as the band's bass player while still a studio player, making this case an aversion.

Their next album, <em>The Final Cut</em>, lacked him altogether. David Gilmour brought him back, but still as an extra on the first Waters-less album <em>A Momentary Lapse of Reason</em>. Then <em>The Division Bell</em> (the final album of the band) credited Wright as a band member again.
<ul><li> Before that, the band did this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SydBarrett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SydBarrett">Syd Barrett</a>, due to his drug use causing increasingly erratic behavior. He only appears on a few tracks on their second album.

When Francis broke the band up in 1993, he didn't even bother telling Deal personally, instead breaking the news to her through a fax.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">The Rolling Stones</a>:
<ul><li> Keyboardist Ian Stewart was an original member, but when they began recording in 1963 their manager, Andrew "Loog" Oldham, had him officially demoted to road manager, mainly because his straitlaced, short-haired look didn't fit the image Oldham was trying to cultivate for the band. Because the band still liked him, Stewart did continue to appear on the Stones' recordings, though, and occasionally performed with them on stage until his death and was inducted with the rest of the band into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989. He - by any meaningful measure - was still a full member of the band, so his demotion really only was relevant in promotional material.
</li><li> Less dramatically, this is more or less what happened to Brian Jones as the '60s progressed. Originally the Stones' leader, Jones was relegated to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">increasingly secondary role</a> in the group, due to the emergence of the Jagger-Richards partnership (Jones didn't write any songs and wasn't a big creative force in the band) and his own personal problems. His last album, <em>Let It Bleed</em>, features him on just two tracks (congas on Midnight Rambler and autoharp on You Got the Silver).
</li></ul></li><li> This happened more and more to Alex Lifeson of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rush">Rush</a> as the 80s progressed, his guitars taking a back seat to Geddy Lee's synths.

<ul><li> Sato Sumire used to be a solid member of the Undergirls in the elections, but her rank has dropped each year, and now she ranks in Future Girls.

</li><li> David Palmer, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteelyDan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteelyDan">Steely Dan</a>'s "original" lead singer (he only sang on three tracks on the first album, as well as in concerts) was bumped down to one of several backing vocalists for <em>Countdown to Ecstasy</em>. No surprise that he's gone by <em>Pretzel Logic</em>, since the band had abandoned touring and particularly because band leader Donald Fagen had grown dissatisfied with the way Palmer sang his songs.
</li><li> Ron Asheton of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheStooges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheStooges">The Stooges</a>' was bumped to bass on <em>Raw Power</em>.
</li><li> In spite of their popularity and influence, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/UriahHeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/UriahHeep">Uriah Heep</a> is less well remembered than other early metal groups, though they probably have more recognition in prog rock circles.

</li><li> A factor in guitarist/keyboadist David Gregory's departure from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/XTC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/XTC">XTC</a>. Andy Partridge bought a synthesizer that allowed him to create string arrangements, something Gregory had done in the past.
</li><li> This happened to Dusty and Frank of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ZZTop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ZZTop">ZZ Top</a> on <em>Eliminator</em>: despite them being credited on the album sleeve, Dusty's bass being replaced by keyboards<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4l2jn');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4l2jn" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4l2jn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"Thug" and its keyboard slap bass that sounds like it escaped from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em> theme being the more obvious one</span> and Frank by drum machines. For all intents and purposes, <em>Eliminator</em> is a Billy solo album (excepting Dusty's lead vocals on "I Got The Six" and "Bad Girl") with contributions by pre-production engineer Linden Hudson, who contributed drum machine programming and keyboard sequencing, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliminator_(album)">and was alleged to have co-written most of the material, to the point that the band got into a legal conflict that was settled with him being granted the copyright to "Thug"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Hudson had also showed Billy some research he'd done previously that most popular rock songs used the tempo of 120 beats per minute, which influenced Billy to write most of the album's songs at that tempo. And when the combination of blues guitar and incongruously synthesised backing tracks sent the album to diamond status, the formula was repeated on <em>Afterburner</em> and <em>Recycler</em>, and even led to the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNotRemix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNotRemix">rereleases of the band's past albums that replaced Frank's drums with drum machines</a>. While the band continued using electronic loops and synth elements, Dusty's bass and Frank's actual drums returned to prominence starting with <em>Antenna</em> and <em>Rhythmeen</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blues">Blues</a> helped to create <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockAndRoll">Rock &amp; Roll</a> and yet never sees much in the way of thanks or tribute from any of the sub-genres that sprouted from its existence. Blues, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumbleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumbleHero">being characteristically not particularly glory-seeking</a> is probably okay with this.
<ul><li> A lot of early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockAndRoll">Rock &amp; Roll</a> and classic rock hits, especially from the British Invasion, were covers of old Blues songs. The similarities are so close, Sam Phillips famously said "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockAndRoll">Rock &amp; Roll</a> is just the Blues sped up."
</li></ul></li><li> Hip-Hop DJs; while still prominent on tours and the mix-tape circuit they have all but disappeared from mainstream media. In fact a cynic could say the same thing about all of the other "pillars of hip-hop".
</li><li> A common occurrence when a music group has a breakout star who leaves the group for a solo career. The other members of the group usually fade into the background, until the star decides to feature them during a special segment on tour, or record a song with them, just to remind the fans of the star's origins. For example: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Beyonce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Beyonce">Beyonc&eacute;</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DestinysChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DestinysChild">Destiny's Child</a> fame, sometimes reunites with some of her old group members to do songs while on tour. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a> was also known for reuniting with his brothers to reform the Jackson 5 at times.

<ul><li> After the untimely deaths of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimHenson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimHenson">Jim Henson</a> and Richard Hunt, most of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMuppets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMuppets">The Muppets</a> they once played were handed down to new performers, starting with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMuppetChristmasCarol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMuppetChristmasCarol">The Muppet Christmas Carol</a></em>. However, Henson's Rowlf and Dr. Teeth and Hunt's Janice and Scooter, all formerly major characters with sizable roles in previous Muppet productions, would be reduced to non-speaking background appearances or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">not appear at all</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMuppets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMuppets">The Muppets</a></em> reversed this, as all four characters were as prominent as ever in the various trailers and the film itself. Since the departure of Mupppet performer Steve Whitmire in 2016, Rizzo the Rat has suffered a similar fate to what Henson's and Hunt's character previously went through.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMuppets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMuppets">The Muppets</a></em>:

</li><li> Dave Goelz's characters (Gonzo, Bunsen Honeydew, Zoot, Beauregard) get very little to do here. At first this seems a bit bizarre, since Dave is one of the only puppeteers from <em>The Muppet Show</em> era still performing his characters consistently but when one realizes Goelz had shoulder surgery just before filming began, his characters' reduced roles makes sense.

<ul><li> Susan (Loretta Long) was part of the series' original human cast and remained a major character for almost 30 years, until around the late 90s when she was gradually phased out. By the 2010s, she only appeared in one episode per season; she made no new appearances in season 43, and in the 44th and 45th seasons she was reduced to just a background extra.
</li><li> Many of the other human cast members have suffered similar fates in recent years including Bob, Luis, Maria, Gordon and Gina.
</li><li> Jim Henson and Richard Hunt's deaths also resulted in most of their minor characters being phased out from <em>Sesame Street</em>. In recent years, a handful such as Henson's Guy Smiley have been recast to new performers and make sporadic new appearances.
</li><li> This also often happens to human characters to gradually phase them out of the show so that viewers don't notice their absence too much when the actors eventually leave. Other times characters are demoted because the actors may only be available to film a few episodes in each season.
</li><li> For those of you who haven't noticed, the only puppet characters remaining from as early as the first season are Grover, Cookie Monster, Big Bird, Bert, Ernie, Oscar and Kermit. In fact, even Kermit's role have been reduced incredibly compared to the early days, almost to where they don't appear much at all. (This is at least partly now because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyOwnsThisTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyOwnsThisTrope">Disney Owns This Frog</a>; they can use old Kermit scenes but new ones are more complicated.) Interestingly, back in the second season, there were plans to phase Kermit out, as a commercial character, in favour of Sesame-exclusive characters like Herbert Birdsfoot. (Who? Exactly.)
</li><li> In recent years, a decision to downsize the number of principal characters has led to other Muppets, including Baby Bear, Bert and Ernie, Count von Count, Prairie Dawn, Snuffy, and Telly Monster, taking a noticeable backseat.

Of course, before Woody can use R.C., Buzz notices the remote control to R.C. that Woody has, and then, Woody accidentally makes the lamp fall, which causes Buzz to fall out of the window.

Likewise, Davy Jones, villain of the second and third movies, is given a single mist screen that he eventually has to share with Blackbeard, villain of the fourth movie.

<ul><li> The Poopsmith's demotion is, if possible, even more evident than Pom Pom's, as the Halloween cartoons just might be the only time he's seen <em>at all</em> anymore (evidently a result of the two characters being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVoiceless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVoiceless">silent</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnintelligible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnintelligible">bubbly-voiced</a>).

After that, she gets shuffled around from the Red team to the Blue team and finally to just bumming around with Doc, by which time she's barely seen.

It got its own spin off, <em>Solar System: The Dwarf Planets Saga</em>. Much earlier, Ceres became the newest member of <em>the Solar System</em>, but, an influx of other similar characters (Pallas, Juno, Vesta) led for them all to be dropped. Ceres, luckily, got a role in <em>the Dwarf Planets Saga</em> alongside Pluto.
</li><li> After a company merger with AOL, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TedTurner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TedTurner">Ted Turner</a> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs">given a figurehead desk job</a> with no real power in the company's decision making.
</li><li> <em>Almost</em> every US President ever after their term. In office, they're the most well known person in America but once their term is up, they sink to the background except for a few public appearances here and there. The one exception was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamHowardTaft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamHowardTaft">William Howard Taft</a>, who after leaving office was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, an extremely powerful position in its own right.
<ul><li> The same could be said for any nation's leaders. They're the most important person while they're in power, but then disappear into the background after they lose power. It's pretty rare for a former leader to zig-zag between this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Ascended Extra</a>, though for nations that lack strict term limits the possibility always exists. (Australia is probably one of the few countries where examples of this exist, with three Prime Ministers having done this during their lives in parliament.)
</li><li> Cabinet-level positions occasionally avert this. Usually a party will be in power for a given period, be replaced by their rivals, then come back to power a decade or so later. When that happens, ministers / secretaries who served in government the first time sometimes come back when their party returns to office.
</li></ul></li><li> Kaiser Wilhelm II was the most important political leader in the Continent between the 1890s to 1918. He loomed large as a villainous figure in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> propaganda. Then 1917-1918 comes around, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober">Red October</a> unleashes a revolution in Germany, the Kaiser abdicates and almost overnight, the Kaiser goes from center stage to minor footnote, passing the rest of his life in anonymity with hints of his later life known only to specialists interested in tying up loose ends.
</li><li> Happened to dinosaurs: for a hundred millions years, they were the dominant animals on land. Now that mammals and humans in particular have taken over, what remains of them? Birds... Although it hasn't been too bad for them since there are about 10,000 bird species compared to only about 4,000 species of mammals.
<ul><li> Reptiles, as a whole, exemplify this trope even if they still play a big role in our ecosystem. Long ago, they ruled the Earth for more than 185 million years during the Mesozoic Era (compare the Cenozoic Era, which is barely a third in length) and were <em>very</em> diverse in their respective area. Some scientists believe that if the K-T extinction event never happened, the smaller theropods might have achieved an intelligence similar to <em>humans</em>.
</li><li> The same might be said about synapsids (or "mammal like" reptiles that preceded dinosaurs as dominant terrestrial vertebrates. After Permian-Triassic mass extinctions, the only traces left of their descendants were tiny rat-like creatures that slithered in the shadows, while the ancestral archosaurs (ancestors of dinosaurs, among other things) became dominant.
</li></ul></li><li> In a manner of speaking, when a company, government entity or school district purchases new vehicles, the new vehicles are the ones used on the primary routes and/or long trips. The older vehicles are demoted to shorter routes, while the oldest vehicles in the fleet are parked in the yard and used as spare vehicles (such as when one of the newer vehicles is unavailable or in the shop for repairs). Eventually, it is the oldest vehicles that are sold off and replaced by the new vehicles, and the cycle continues.
<ul><li> An illustration: A school district in a rural school district covering 200 square miles purchases five new buses. The new buses are placed on the high-mileage routes and used for athletic trips. The buses they replace are then put on shorter routes, perhaps in-town. The oldest buses still on regular routes are then parked at the bus garage, used only when one of the newer buses is being repaired or otherwise unavailable. To mean &#150; as a bus gets older, they begin fitting the trope more and more as the newer buses fit the spotlight.
</li><li> The same thing happens on the railways, especially with passenger engines. The railway gets a new passenger engine, the fastest thing on the rails, and it pulls the big expresses for about ten or fifteen years. Then it gets an even newer engine, and the original one gets put on the second-string trains. Finally, after thirty or forty years in service, the former "star" engine is clanking around on branch lines or commuter routes before it gets scrapped or donated to a museum. Ditto for airlines.
</li><li> And also for cruise ships &mdash; the newest ships get the most prominent (often longer) routes, while the older ones run less popular or shorter routes, and the oldest ships doing 3-day runs to the Bahamas<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6w29n');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6w29n" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6w29n');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Florida" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Florida">Florida</a> or other US East Coast ports)</span> until they are sold off or scrapped.
</li></ul></li><li> In the West, advances in agriculture that made meat more widely available did this to vegetables. In Western cuisine, meat is considered the "main dish" with vegetables as "sides". Due to the health problems excessive meat consumption can cause, many experts are recommending that meat should be Demoted To Extra.
</li><li> Mergers in general. As the big boys get bigger and bigger, even the moderately-sized regional companies in the same market are either shunted aside or gobbled up by the bigs. Wal-Mart and Target v. K-Mart is a good example.
</li><li> Most of the world's remaining monarchies are now constitutional monarchies within a parliamentary system. In such cases, the real power resides in the Parliament (and in the person of the Prime Minister.) The monarch's position becomes largely ceremonial. Even in cases where the constitutional monarch has considerable residual or theoretical power (e.g., <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfWindsor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfWindsor">Great Britain</a>), the power is seldom <em>exercised</em>.
<ul><li> Speaking of Parliament, the institution itself was originally a threefold system with the 'King-in-Parliament', the House of Lords to represent the aristocracy, and the House of Commons to represent the wealthy middle classes (the idea that poor people might actually have a right to representation didn't have any traction at this point). From the Civil War onwards, the monarch was gradually removed from this arrangement, leaving the Lords as the main centre of power. However, from the early 19th century onwards they too began to lose power, and its aristocratic nature was also reduced. Now the Commons holds supreme power and the House of Lords is just a technocratic advisory body.
</li></ul></li><li> This even happens to some countries in the course of history.
<ul><li> Mesopotamia and the Fertile Crescent, once known as the "Cradle of Civilization" for being home to some of the world's oldest cities. Its early inhabitants were on the cutting edge of technology in their day, being among the first to adopt such significant milestones in human development as irrigation, writing, and mathematics. Even after losing its political preeminence, the region remained a premier center for culture, science, and religion for centuries. The region is now largely divided up among the modern states of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Israel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Israel">Israel</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Lebanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Lebanon">Lebanon</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Syria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Syria">Syria</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Iraq" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Iraq">Iraq</a>, which in the modern era have been secondary players on the global stage at best and utterly marginal clusterfucks at worst.
</li><li> Italy was a global hegemon back when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire">Rome had an empire</a>. After the end of the Empire, the Peninsula became isolated city states that never had any real political unity until the 19th Century. Local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudingFamilies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudingFamilies">Feuding Families</a> as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope">The Pope</a> had major Continental and global influence but the center of power shifted away from Italy, from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic. Post-Empire, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll">it's had a far bigger role in art, philosophy, music, culture, science, cuisine, fashion and business</a> than in military and political affairs, and the notable exceptions of its exterior military and political influence, Mussolini, Fascism and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">The Mafia</a>, is not something Italians look upon with pride. For this reason, Italy's subtle and overt soft power has it dubbed "the least of the great powers".
</li><li> Iran (known in the West as Persia) was regarded as the first global empire (under the Achaemenid Dynasty), when it conquered most of what was then called the "civilized world". It remained a major power even after the Arab conquest until declining as a regional hegemon in favor of the Ottomans, and a puppet monarch. Today it's a theocratic regime that survives by playing off rival geopolitical enemies to its advantage rather than set any agenda.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Greece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Greece">Greece</a> was the cradle of democracy, science, drama, poetry, philosophy and architecture and under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat">Alexander the Great</a>, it expanded its domain eastward forming one of the greatest empires. Upon Alexander's defeat, it fell to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a> that eventually led it to becoming subsumed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire">The Roman Empire</a> and then as the Eastern Roman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ByzantineEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ByzantineEmpire">Byzantine Empire</a>, which was a major player in global politics in the Middle Ages. Then a few sacks of Constantinople (first by the Crusaders, then by the Turks who kept the city), a bloody war of independence in the 19th Century and hard struggle in the 20th Century against various dictatorships and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">Those Wacky Nazis</a>, Greece is a small nation with unstable economy and political struggles, bullied by the more powerful European Union. Even Orthodox Christianity which was native to the Byzantine Empire has more practitioners and influence in Russia and other nations than in the land of its origin.
</li><li> America's status as the world's hyperpower has the inclination that post-Soviet Russia became this trope, but developments in the 2010s ensure that Russia and its neighbor China will make their interests known to America 24/7.
</li><li> The Age of Discovery and Exploration began in Portugal, and then Spain. The former were the first European powers to participate in the Atlantic Slave Trade, and the latter were the first European colonizers and settlers of the New World and with far greater territorial expansion than the English, French and the Dutch. Their naval prowess were surpassed by the English and the French, Spain went from being the richest and most influential continental monarchy to becoming second fiddle to France, and the late 18th and early 19th Century saw their Empires fade as ex-colonies liberated themselves. Today there are more Spanish and Portuguese speakers outside Spain and Portugal in their former colonies than there are in the metropoles.
</li><li> The Dutch used to be a world power, an early investor in the financial and banking revolutions and the cradle of the European Middle Class and a major player in the Atlantic Slave Trade until surpassed by England. Then a tulip crisis, military setbacks, and the rise of England as a commercial and naval power, as well as the more numerous foreign powers surrounded Holland, led to its power and influence fading in the 18th Century. Even in the arts, Holland was once the center of painting in the Dutch Golden Age, but modern art has seen the center move to France and America. The most famous Dutch painter of modern times is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VincentVanGogh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VincentVanGogh">Vincent van Gogh</a> who painted most of his works, and lived most of his life in France.
</li><li> Ottoman Empire; it seized half of the middle east and some eastern European countries but after WWI, Ottoman Empire fell and modern Turkey was born. With Turkey's desperate attempts in becoming an EU member, it's obviously lost its relevancy.
</li><li> Germany and Japan used to be major world military powers in the first half of the 20th century. America used to think that they would conquer the world <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapanTakesOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapanTakesOverTheWorld">by buying it.</a> Later they just follow their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome">much more powerful allies</a>. This has also happened to Japan culturally and economically during the "Lost Decade" since its neighbors, China and South Korea, took over in electronics production. K-Pop has also garnered a worldwide following while J-pop languishes, though Anime still has a cult following. On the other hand Germany remains the most powerful economy of Europe, with the biggest population of any Western European nation and these days a model for a liberal constitutional Europe.
<ul><li> In general, the division of Germany and new constitution of Japan that denounced militarism after World War II was an attempt by the allies to invoke this trope on purpose as the USSR and USA became the undisputed hegemons. A reunified Germany was met with some resistance from French and British leaders who feared becoming this trope in Europe after decades of trying to overshadow Germany.
</li></ul></li><li> In the 19th Century, the sun never set on the British Empire. From <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, the U.K. lost nearly all of its colonies. It became second fiddle to the United States of America as a naval and economic power (formerly their backyard). Even the English Language is no longer their sole property since some of the best poets, novelists and dramatists of the 20th Century Anglophone were American and Irish (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TSEliot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TSEliot">T. S. Eliot</a>, W. B. Yeats, Hart Crane, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesJoyce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesJoyce">James Joyce</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamuelBeckett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamuelBeckett">Samuel Beckett</a>, G. B. Shaw), and one of England's biggest cultural contributions came from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishInvasion">British musicians</a> influenced by <em>American rock and roll</em>. England also became more and more marginal in the Continent and with Brexit, it looks like the U.K. will be demoted even further on the world stage.
</li><li> Next to the British Empire, the largest empire ever was the Mongol Empire. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan">Genghis Khan</a> conquered more land than anyone in history. The last of it dissolved in 1687. Nowadays, Mongolia is nowhere near a world power, and even set a record for the least densely populated country on Earth.
</li></ul></li><li> Your colleagues from school/high school/college or university/work/volunteering. While it's likely a few of them will remain lifelong friends, the others will, at best, be reduced to an occasional chat when you meet them by accident on the street. Even with the advent of social networking sites it's unlikely you'll spend any significant amount of time talking to most of them.
<ul><li> Your parents. When you're a kid, they are the most important people in your life. However, as you get older and have a spouse, children, friends, co-workers, employers, and the like, your parents eventually become secondary or even tertiary people in your life. This varies by culture; there are some where even after the child grows up and gets married, his or her parents remain very much a big part of their lives (and are culturally expected to remain so), <em>especially</em> when they live close by.
</li><li> Also your ex-girlfriends/boyfriends/husbands/wives/friends. Even if you remain on friendly terms, chances are you won't see them nearly as often after the break-up. There are a few cases where former lovers become best friends, but they are rare.
</li><li> With the advent of Social Media, unfriending, unfollowing and, the biggest demotion, blocking. Definitely counts as a "demotion".
<ul><li> You also "grow out of" forums/other social media services and go from spending an entire weekend on somewhere to forgetting it exists or simply, only posting rarely...Both going from extremes of frequency to infrequent or nothing.
</li><li> Back in the days when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/MySpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/MySpace">MySpace</a> was the dominant social media site, the choices for your Top 8 Friends (prior to the expansion into however many you wished to list) showed just who had been demoted (in their own minds, at least).
</li></ul></li><li> Also happens when you have a fight/fall out with a friend or just stop getting messages/calls from someone. Moving away is another example...
</li></ul></li><li> Many works that either discuss or depict <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a> largely ignore the South Vietnamese forces commonly referred to as the ARVN in favor of the American and Australian historical accounts of the war. The ARVN are considered to be the war's forgotten army. The films <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreenBerets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreenBerets">The Green Berets</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeavenAndEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeavenAndEarth">Heaven &amp; Earth</a></em> are the two exceptions.

</li><li> Satsuki from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime">Tsukihime</a></em> is the center of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">the meme</a> "Isn't it Sad, Sacchin". What makes Satsuki's lucklessness worth a section here, is that it even extends <em>here,</em> on TV Tropes. This trope was originally named "Isn't It Sad", after the meme in question. With the wiki's shift to less esoteric titles, Sacchin was&mdash;you guessed it&mdash;demoted in importance once again. She has since been demoted <em>again</em>; for a while, she was still the page's image, but she's since been replaced. Really, the only reason this page isn't a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDemonstratingArticle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDemonstratingArticle">Self-Demonstrating Article</a> is because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">putting it on the appropriate index</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">would be a Promotion FROM Extra</a>.
</li><li> When a character-named trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RenamedTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RenamedTropes">has its name changed</a> here on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes">This Very Wiki</a>, it can end up demoting that character from star to being just another example. For instance, Spike is now just one more instance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay">Badass Decay</a> instead of being the defining instance of "Spikeification".
