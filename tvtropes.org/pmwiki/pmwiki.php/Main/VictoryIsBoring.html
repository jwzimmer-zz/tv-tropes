My Goddess</a></em> the Queen Sayoko arc has Sayoko enter a demonic contract that grants her mind control powers so she can finally defeat Belldandy. At the climax of the arc, Sayoko has reduced Belldandy to an obedient slave only to abruptly cancel the contract. As she explains to Mara, a victory achieved through somebody else's power meant nothing compared to personally crushing her rival.

Because of this, he rarely attends any training sessions with his teammates and even feels like having a team is pointless as, quoted from himself, he'll win each and every time. However, what's funny that Free himself stated that although he does get bored of blading sometimes due to his strength, he feels like winning is the only thing that makes him happy. However, character development does kick in when he bonds with Valt whom he sees as someone with potential to give him a good match. Free's first on-screen loss was to fellow Big 5 member Lui Shirosagi where Free, upset at the loss at first, was still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">happy to have found someone that was on his level</a>.

In fact, when Trunks returns to challenge them after the defeat of Cell in the main timeline and Future 18 decides to kill him to blow off steam, Future 17 gives her the okay but nonetheless points out that they'll be throwing away "weeks worth of fun" if she does.

In one story, Lupin sits in jail for an entire year awaiting his execution. Zenigata spends the year getting more and more depressed and dreading the execution day even more than Lupin.

<ul><li> Done subtly in regards to the world's greatest swordsman, Dracule Mihawk. While what he was like when he was younger is a mystery, as an adult he seems to have no secondary goals and has become bored with nothing to accomplish, and jaded because so few people can give him a challenge. As a result, he tries to pass the time by doing things such as wiping out Don Krieg's fleet and chasing the survivors halfway across the world (though only because they disturbed his nap). Which seems to do nothing at all to alleviate his boredom. When he meets the main crew's swordsman Zoro, who's aiming for his title, he's impressed by the younger man's determination and encourages him to surpass him.
</li><li> This is also why Gold Roger turned himself in to the World Government in the first place. He had seen everything, done everything, and had nothing left to do. Seeing as he was dying from an incurable disease anyway, he figured he would turn himself in and do one final thing: tell everyone, right before they executed him, that he had hidden all his wealth somewhere, and that whoever claimed it would be rich beyond their wildest dreams - so long as they could find it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffinTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffinTitle">And so it began...</a>

However, this strength has made him completely apathetic, always disappointed when the next big challenge ends up going down the same way. Throughout the series, he's <em>never</em> had to fight seriously, because he's just too strong.

<ul><li> But in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmperorJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmperorJoker">Emperor Joker</a></em>, it's revealed that he literally cannot imagine a world without Batman... no matter how hard he tries, despite having gained cosmic power and ruler of reality.
</li><li> In the <em>Going Sane</em> storyline, Joker actually regains his sanity and settles down to live a normal life when he thinks he's killed Batman; after he's beaten Batman, there's no point in being the Joker anymore.
</li><li> There is evidence that Batman himself could succumb to this if he would ever "win" his war on crime. He's somewhat uninterested in actually <em>keeping</em> villains put away, when someone with his intelligence and vast fiscal resources probably could, simply preferring to let others (who really <em>suck</em> at it) do that for him. Them breaking out defines his purpose and justifies putting on the cape and cowl every night (which is why he has been accused of being as insane as the people he fights).

<ul><li> Another comic (but not <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DuckTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DuckTales">DuckTales</a></em>) has Magica venting over her inability to steal Scrooge's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberOneDime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberOneDime">#1 Dime</a>. When her familiar asks if she really needed Scrooge's dime for her Midas Touch amulet, Magica realizes that <em>no, she doesn't.</em> She still has the <em>other</em> dime Scrooge gave her in her first appearance when she was collecting the dimes touched by the world's richest. (She originally wanted Scrooge's Number One for extra power.) Making the amulet, Magica gains the Midas Touch and becomes supremely wealthy - but is still upset because she never did beat Scrooge. Even flaunting her new fortune doesn't work, as Scrooge is just happy to know she won't bother him anymore. When she destroys his money bin by turning it to gold (making it too soft to contain his cash), he logically decides to <em>sell the gold</em> to pay for a new one, and then some. This is the last straw, and Magica destroys her amulet, thereby turning the transformed gold back, before Scrooge could do just that.

However, upon ruling it, he became extremely bored and allowed a few Freedom Fighters to exist&mdash;despite knowing their location already&mdash;so as to keep himself entertained. Eventually, dark Knuckles, better known as Enerjak, decided to look for other worlds to conquer three decades after this all had transpired, and in turn, sealed his fate.

I felt like it was game over. It was the same thing as beating the final boss in a video game and seeing the end cut scenes. It was not satisfying once the task was actually completed. Was the hunt truly over? I wanted to win, but did it have to be so quickly? I was hoping to play a tad longer.

<ul><li> This is the impetus for the book <em>The Last Hero</em>: Cohen the Barbarian is bored stiff as the Emperor of the Agatean Empire.

He and his Silver Horde (of seven other veteran barbarian warriors, all septuagenarians at the youngest) go out to destroy the gods for allowing this to happen.

Cohen observes that it's no wonder, since one's all dried up, and you can't get a decent beer in the other. The minstrel they've captured (long story) tells Cohen the line "and Carelinus wept, for there were no more worlds to conquer." He explains that seeing Cohen looking down at the Disc ("bin there... bin there too... bin there twice, I think... bin everywhere I can see") reminds him of this. Cohen appreciates the comparison: "Yeah, maybe a bit like him. 'cept without the sissy crying, of course..." At another point, it's inverted to reflect the actual quote (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> below)&mdash;that some scholar told Carelinus that every star out there might be another world, and he cried because he realized he couldn't conquer them all in one lifetime.

<ul><li> Probably the most ancient example: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Beowulf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Beowulf">Beowulf</a></em> as an old king rides out against a dragon, even knowing he can't survive, simply from a desire to die fighting. There's a bit of logic here: according to Norse beliefs, if you died of old age, you'd be denied entrance to Valhalla, in which only heroes who die in battle are welcome.
</li><li> A lot of ancient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology">Greek</a> heroes seem to have this. Most of the time, it translates into hubris. Bellerophon, for example, wasn't satisfied with getting everything he wanted, defeating every monster he fought, and being hero-worshipped and having a freakin' flying horse. Nope. He decided he wanted to be a god. That didn't end well for him.
<ul><li> With others, like Achilles, it's not so much Victory is Boring as Having the Perfect Life is Boring. They could refrain from heroics or fighting and be the happiest man in the world, but it would mean that their name would not go down in history. And Greek heroes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlorySeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlorySeeker">would rather die than let that happen</a>. Though he does consider it seriously after Patroclus' death. Before realising that going back now means he wouldn't be able to avenge himself on Hector.
</li><li> Then there's Zeus, king of the gods himself. He has to resort to trickery to get his sister Hera to marry him; then after their wedding, he quickly tires of her nagging dislike of him and goes out to trick a gazillion mortal girls into sleeping with him.

Bill Belichick and Tom Brady have cemented their places as Hall of Famers and contenders for the titles of the greatest coach and greatest quarterback, respectively, in NFL history. While the team has formed a dynasty of historic proportions that will likely never be equaled, it's safe to say that NFL fans have become numb to their perennial excellence, as their most recent appearance, Super Bowl LIII, had the lowest ratings of any Super Bowl in a decade. Not only was it their third straight appearance, but it was also their fourth in five years. At this point, the Patriots missing the playoffs would be an infinitely bigger story than them winning another Super Bowl.

This didn't go well to put it lightly, and he came back to basketball, where he picked up right where he left off, leading his team to 3 more NBA titles and MVP awards. The good news was that these championship victories were harder to earn, so Jordan was no longer bored in earning them.

<ul><li> The main reason Chaos will never truly win is that none of the four gods really <em>want</em> to win, as this would mean nothing left to do for all eternity (and if one of them ever appears on the verge of ultimate victory, two will put aside their hatred of each other and distaste for the third and gang up on the current leader). Tzeentch's plans, in particular, are famously prone to backfiring (to his followers' dismay) because it would prevent another plan from working, while Khorne's followers are just as happy to kill their enemies, their allies or <em>themselves</em> if it means more Skulls for the Skull Throne.

</li><li> Jaghatai Khan, Primarch of the White Scars, firmly believed in a version of this, believing that peace would cause him and his brothers to grow fat and weak from not having any enemies to fight. It says something that he was totally unbothered by the fact that, after conquering his homeworld and uniting all the tribes of Chogoris, those same tribes went back to fighting each other after he left. It actually hinted that he <em>counted</em> on this happening, so that Chogoris would produce strong candidates for his legion.

<ul><li> Sideshow Bob spares Bart at the end of the episode "The Great Louse Detective" because he feels he'll end up this way if he kills him, as he explains by singing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSong">"The Very Reason That I Live"</a>.
</li><li> The same thing happens again in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS27E5TreehouseOfHorrorXXVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS27E5TreehouseOfHorrorXXVI">Treehouse of Horror XXVI</a></em> segment "Wanted: Dead, Then Alive", when Bob finally kills Bart, but then quickly realizes that life is boring without Bart around and that the only thing that brought joy into his life was killing his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a>. Bob then creates a Reanimator machine that brings his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>, then proceeds to start killing him and bringing him back to life over and over again.
</li><li> Similar to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess">Recess</a></em> example above, Lisa and Bart build a fort out of packages and end up in a huge, <em>Lord of the Rings</em> style war against the delivery men. Upon winning the war, they get bored and wonder what to do now. They choose to use a hose to soak the fort into a pile of mushy cardboard.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>:
<ul><li> Turns out in the episode "Smug Alert" that without Kyle to rip on, Cartman gets pretty bored.
</li><li> Averted in "Cartmanland," however. When Cartman gets what he's always wanted his whole life, a theme park all to himself, Kyle figures Cartman will bore of it before long. Kyle turns out to be wrong, however, as Cartman's ecstatic joy never ever slows down, though in part because he knows he succeeded where Kyle did not, and he derives literally endless joy in feeling that way.
</li></ul></li><li> In the series finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated">Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated</a></em>, after the gang <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">solves the mystery of Crystal Cove and cause the whole town to reset, turning it into a peaceful community where everyone is happy and the tragedies they suffered never happened</span>, they quickly find themselves bored with no more mysteries to solve. Luckily for them, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues">they are given a chance to travel the country solving more mysteries along the way</a>.
</li><li> In the episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAnnoyingOrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAnnoyingOrange">The Annoying Orange</a></em> where Orange and Pear go to England and (predictably) meet an expy of Sherlock Holmes, the culprit turns out to be Watson all along. He was trying to help Holmes relive the thrill of the chase by pretending to be a criminal. The world of Annoying Orange being what it is, both Holmes and Watson become supervillains by the end of the episode and promptly begin to turn London into a smoldering wasteland using a death ray.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory">Dexter's Laboratory</a></em> episode "Dee Dee and the Man," Dexter finally gets Dee Dee out of his lab for good by firing her in her role as his sister. However, without Dee Dee sneaking into his lab anymore and causing havoc for him to stop, Dexter quickly finds himself growing from elated and happy to depressed and bored, and by the end of the episode, Dee Dee has her rightful place restored.
