</li><li> Also, in-between those he told him: "Believe in yourself, who believes in me."

<ul><li> Hell, Kamina's entire relationship with Simon is a crowning achievement of this trope. Throughout the show, he is constantly singing Simon's praises and telling him that he's better than how he portrays himself.

Once that actually gets through his head, Shizuo starts gradually learning how to restrain himself and channel his violent impulses in more heroic (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestructiveSavior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestructiveSavior">if still destructive</a>) ways.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>. When Usopp is going through an emotional crisis because he sees himself as the weakest Straw Hat, Sanji, who is known not to hand out compliments to the male crewmates, is quick to point out that everyone has something that only they can do and things they cannot do. When Usopp shoots Spandam, giving Robin a chance to escape, Sanji shouts out, "Look! Our sharpshooter rules!"
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, Jackie Chun, having been revealed to be a disguised Master Roshi, gives one of these speeches to Tenshinhan during their fight in the series' second world martial arts tournament.

<ul><li> Aoi felt a bit less of an important member of the Demon Slayer Corps because while she did take the selection exam to fight demons and passed, Aoi sees it as pure luck, explaining she is too scared to actually fight demons, going to volunteer as a medical and training assistant in the Butterfly Estate, away from immediate danger; Tanjiro doesn't agree with Aoi thinking she is less of a hunter because of that, Tanjiro reassured Aoi is an important part of all hunters that came to the Butterfly Estate seeking for medical assistance and training, this takes Aoi back a little, being shown gratitude to this extent.
</li><li> The driving force on the arduous path to make Zenitsu grow up, the boy has abysmal self-esteem thus he thinks nothing will ever come out of him putting any effort in doing anything by himself, that&#146;s where people who expect something out of Zenitsu come into place to give him that much-needed confidence boost, his master Jigoro was the first to see something underneath Zenitsu&#146;s layer of cowardice and laziness, Tanjiro was the second; in the moments Zenitsu realizes there are people out there who believe in him, those are the events where he shows what he can really do, and he does not disappoint when things get going.

In his climactic duel with Medaka in the student election battles, he reveals what he believes to be the most sure-fire way for him to actually win; "Book Maker", a skill that brings his opponent down to his emotional level, essentially turning a "Plus" into a "Minus". He figures that Medaka will simply give up the fight upon being hit by "Book Maker"... but while she is brought down to his level by it, she not only keeps fighting but points out that Misogi is clearly not as weak and despicable as he thinks he is. Things like this happen from that point onward, all a message that the main thing maintaining Misogi's unnatural losing streak is his own self-perception.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnaniMasterKurosawa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnaniMasterKurosawa">Onani Master Kurosawa</a>.</em> Kurosawa attempts to convince Kitahara that she's strong enough to fight through her troubles on the train home from their school trip. He's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">not exactly correct</a>, but then again, he's not exactly <em>wrong,</em> either. She just needs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotAlone">a little help</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TigerAndBunny">Tiger &amp; Bunny</a></em>, an early episode is about a young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifferentlyPoweredIndividual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifferentlyPoweredIndividual">NEXT</a> boy who used his powers to go on a rampage, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer">his classmates</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon">bullied him</a>.

It ends up working, just as it did on Kotetsu himself when he was around the boy's age, and his childhood hero, Mr. Legend, encouraged him to be a hero.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> When Ichigo and his friends are defeated by Yammy because Ichigo's too afraid of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide">inner Hollow</a> taking control of him to fight properly, he is inconsolable. Rukia forces him to fight a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mook</a> Hollow and lectures him to overcome his fear by getting stronger. When she declares her belief in his ability to become strong enough to protect his friends, and also himself from his inner demons, he regains his resolve. Soon after (partially forced by Rukia), he apologizes to Orihime and vows to get stronger.
</li><li> Rukia being able to fix Ichigo's resolve breaks Orihime's confidence. As the person who ended up most badly damaged, she is unable to ease Ichigo's guilt and feels completely useless when Rukia succeeds. Feeling mortified by her own jealousy, especially because she likes Rukia, she finally caves to pressure from Rangiku and confesses how she's feeling. Rangiku resolves the situation by explaining that she's wrong because Ichigo needs both her and Rukia equally, but in different ways; Rukia herself comforts Orihime as well, telling her how valorous she is and thanking her for the role she had in her rescue.

<ul><li> Here's an interesting take on it: After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorOctopus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorOctopus">Doctor Octopus</a> severely injured the Black Cat, Spider-Man gives the villain the beating of his life. Doc Ock loses his confidence as a result, becoming a cowardly shell of his former self, unable to fight, with a bad case of arachnophobia. Eventually, Octopus tries to kill his foe indirectly, sabotaging a nuclear reactor &mdash; which would kill everyone in New York, unfortunately. But after his out-of-control tentacles let him defeat the hero &mdash; by accident &mdash; Spidey convinces him to shut the reactor down so that there'd be witnesses to know of his "great triumph". And it works. Ock gains his confidence back, thinking he is letting the hero live with the humiliation by sparing him. (To Spider-Man, pride isn't an issue when the whole city is at stake.)
</li><li> Years later, Doc Ock would do the reverse to Spidey in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan">Superior Spider-Man</a></em>. Earlier, he had convinced <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the remains of Peter's "spirit"</span> that he was unsuited to be Spider-Man for endangering a child. Sometime later, thanks to the Goblin King, Ock encountered that same child and was ready to abandon her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">before the spirit came roaring back</span>, forcing Otto to save her, telling him that when there's trouble, you don't plan, you just do the thing you think is right. Otto comes to realize that the real Superior Spider-Man really was Peter Parker because, while Otto was an arrogant man who overcompensated for his failings, Peter was a man who sabotaged himself because he never felt worthy of the greatness he could have deserved. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He then erases his memories and personality from Peter's mind, giving him control once more and asking him to save the woman he fell in love with.</span>

As a young man, before he joined the Nazis, the Skull was a miserable loner who had failed at everything he tried and felt completely worthless, to the point of considering suicide. But then he met Hitler, who saw in him a "man of worth" and persuaded him that the new Germany he was building needed men like him. It was the great turning point in his life.

Not only does she easily get most normal criminals to turn themselves in just by talking to them she's also reformed several super-villains just by letting them know their worries are not foolish but are unfounded and they are loved and special. This is part of why her rogues gallery is less known; people don't often stay in it too long.

Although picking her was morally grey at best, it was still the option with the most acceptable outcome, and he <em>did</em> go through with killing Susan.)</span> However, Harry is still a better man than he thinks, and he isn't about to turn into a mustache-twirling villain any second.

To take one memorable example: halfway through season three, Eve, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsDrama">rape victim</a>, comes into the clinic and insists that House be her physician. Discussing the matter with his team, House avers that he's "useless at this sort of thing." Without missing a beat, Cameron responds "No, you're not." And while House looks confused, and even a bit scared, to hear that, he looks more than a little angry when Chase disagrees. Incidentally, Cameron's right: the episode ends with Eve opening up to House about the rape, which she had earlier refused to talk about even to a trained psychiatrist.

His reasoning is that Sam is smarter than he is and more capable of having a normal life, so he's the one who should get away from everything and survive, and that will make Dean happy.

Thor himself has to drain a drinking mug, lift a cat, and wrestle an old woman, but he is only able to slightly lower the capacity of the cup, only manages to lift the cat's paw, and cannot defeat the old woman. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty">Having been humbled</a>, Thor and his companions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredHospitality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredHospitality">are treated as honored guests</a>, but the next morning, before they leave, Utgard-Loki tells Thor that while he had <em>wanted</em> to utterly humiliate him, he had actually done <em>much</em> better than he had thought. (The giant lord had used illusions in each contest to fool them; Pj&aacute;lfi had been racing against the personification of Thought, and Loki had been competing against Fire; the cup that Thor tried to drink from was actually the sea, the cat was actually the Midgard Serpent, and the old woman was Old Age personified. Utgard-Loki admits that the fact that Thor and his companions did as well as they did scare the hell out of him and his court.)
</li><li> A core tenant of Christianity is that there is no sin so terrible that God will cease to love you. Jesus' parable of the Prodigal Son likens this to a son who leaves home with his inheritance prior to his father's death and squanders half the family fortune. When he hits rock bottom, he returns and begs for his father's forgiveness. His father is so overjoyed just to have the wayward son back home, he throws a massive welcome home party.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Judaism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Judaism">Judaism</a> believes that anyone has the potential to be as righteous as Moses or as evil as Haman. The entire idea of teshuva revolves around the notion that one can always make an effort to overcome their negative traits and become better people. Furthermore, the Torah considers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionRejection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionRejection">the willful refusal to overcome one's negative personality traits</a> to be the only possible reason God may ever have not to forgive someone for their transgressions.

</li><li> Garrus is another example. When he lets his quest for revenge begin to get in the way of his morals, Shepard continuously tries to pull him back, even standing in between Garrus' sniper scope and his target, essentially implying that he'll have to shoot him/her in order to get his revenge.
</li><li> In the third game, Paragon Shepard invokes this about the geth's decision to ally with the <em>Reapers</em> and go to war with the Quarians.
<div class="indent"><strong>Shepard:</strong> How did we get here? The geth are better than this. <br><strong>Legion:</strong> No. Based on empirical evidence, they are not. <br><strong>Shepard:</strong> <em>[sighs]</em> Yeah.

This ends up working so well that Tweek <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">gets caught up in the act and unintentionally makes Craig look like a manipulative cheater</a>. He later admits that Craig made him believe in himself like he never had before.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "Rose's Scabbard", Pearl expresses to Steven that if Rose could see her, she would be disappointed in Pearl for how lost and broken she is in the wake of Rose's death, even nearly letting Steven fall to his death while chasing after her. Steven responds with a brief but powerful one for Pearl, driving her to tears.
<div class="indent"><strong>Pearl:</strong> Everything I ever did, I did for her. Now she's gone, but I'm still here. Sometimes, I think she can see me through your eyes. What would she think of me now?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Steven:</strong> (giving Pearl a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolDownHug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolDownHug">Cool Down Hug</a>) Well, I think you're pretty great.
</div></li><li> In "On the Run", it comes to light that Amethyst views herself as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmAMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmAMonster">a mistake and a parasite</a>, due to where and why she was created. After a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalBackspace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalBackspace">Verbal Backspace</a> or two, Pearl is eventually able to get through to her (see the quotes page).
</li><li> In "Sworn to the Sword", Connie begins to display the view that as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreAsMayflies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreAsMayflies">an ordinary human</a>, she's nothing compared to Steven's legacy and power (a byproduct of learning from Pearl, who unwittingly projects her own self-esteem issues onto Connie). Steven shuts that down right away, reminding her how they work best as a team, and how much he admires her.
</li><li> In "Friend Ship", Pearl breaks down and admits to Garnet that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingEmotionalCrutch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingEmotionalCrutch">she depends on her for strength</a> and that, being "just a pearl", she feels useless without someone else telling her what do. Garnet responds with this:
<div class="indent"><strong>Garnet:</strong> It's not easy being in control. I have weaknesses too. But I choose not to let them consume me. I struggle to stay strong because I know the impact I have on everyone. <em>Please</em> understand, Pearl. You have an impact too. There are times when I look up to you for strength. <em>You are your own gem.</em> You control your destiny. Not me, not Rose, not Steven. But you must choose to be strong, so we can move forward.
</div></li><li> In "Too Short To Ride", Amethyst reassures Peridot after the other gem is shown to be insecure about herself and her lack of Gem abilities, saying that they like Peridot for who she is. It's nice because Amethyst's had to deal with the same sort of self-esteem issues herself, and now she's helping others with them.
<div class="indent"><strong>Amethyst:</strong> <em>(to Peridot)</em> This whole time we&#146;ve been here you&#146;ve just been focusing on what you can&#146;t do, of course you&#146;re not having any fun. You think that all you are is what you could be. But we don&#146;t hang out with you because of who you COULD be! We like YOU.
</div></li><li> This is a major element of Steven's relationship with Bismuth. When Bismuth first appears, she helps Steven feel better about his worries of measuring up to Rose Quartz. When things turn bad and Steven is forced to fight her, Bismuth acknowledges Steven as better than Rose for promising to tell the Crystal Gems the truth about what happened between them, when Rose had originally bubbled her and hid her away. In a later episode, Bismuth refers to Steven as the leader of the Crystal Gems since he's the one who has kept them together and believing in the future while they have been reeling from learning a shocking truth about Rose.''
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries">Superman: The Animated Series</a></em>, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SupermanTheAnimatedSeriesS3E8SupermansPal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SupermanTheAnimatedSeriesS3E8SupermansPal">Superman's Pal</a>", Clark Kent does this to Jimmy Olsen while the latter is suffering from an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeSpecial">inferiority complex</a>. At the end of the episode, he does it again as Superman.
<div class="indent"><strong>Clark</strong>: You're selling yourself short.
</div></li><li> Octus gives this to Kimmy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan">Sym-Bionic Titan</a></em> after she has tried the entire time to seduce him to get him to do her work for her. She eventually breaks down and claims that since she is a cheerleader and popular she cannot be "smart". Octus flat out tells her that if she put the same kind of energy in her studies that she does in her cheer-leading she can do anything. With that, she finally gets the confidences and passes it on her own skills. And because of this Kimmy starts to date Octus.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Thundercats2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Thundercats2011">ThunderCats (2011)</a></em> episode "Omens Part One" has a nice little moment between Lion-O and Jaga.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Lion-O</strong>: It's official, they think I'm a failure. And they always will unless I can prove I'm not chasing a childish dream... But how can I do that when even Grune said there wasn't tech out there?! <br><strong>Jaga</strong>: Don't let what Grune failed to see stand in the way of what you believe.

</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen">X-Men</a></em> episode "The Lotus and the Steel" opens with Wolverine struggling with his anger. A teenager cut him off in traffic and, in a rage, Wolverine nearly sliced him up and backhanded Jubilee for trying to stop him. Shaken, he returns to Japan and a monk he knows, Oku, to get his bearings, but Silver Samurai is threatening the locals. Wolverine resists the urge to fight because of his desire to let go of his anger and attain inner peace, but Oku reminds him that fighting to protect others is a worthy purpose that provides such peace. Oku theorizes Wolverine doesn't see himself as well as others see him and suggests he look at himself with new eyes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesBack">He's Back</a> ensues.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em> episode "Satisfaction", Ollie is crushed with guilt after a harrowing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheMentor">Rage Against the Mentor</a> tirade from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the original Roy Harper</span>. He thinks that he utterly failed at being a mentor for all three of his sidekicks: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">original Roy who was kidnapped, cloned, maimed, and kept on ice for years, clone Roy who fell into depression over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues">Cloning Blues</a>, and Artemis who was "killed".</span> Red Arrow reassures Ollie that he wasn't a terrible mentor. Especially poignant since Red Arrow spent most of the series resenting Ollie for one reason or another.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GreenLanternTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GreenLanternTheAnimatedSeries">Green Lantern: The Animated Series</a></em>, "Steam Lantern", the titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk">Steampunk</a> hero feels he's a fraud and not a hero, despite all the work he's doing against the local tyrant. Hal Jordan sets him straight during the brief time he's visiting, and this is reinforced when the Steam Lantern publically confesses the truth of his greatest "accomplishment" being fraud (not entirely through his own fault), but the people still love him because, despite that, he is very much a champion of the people. If anything, they love him <em>more</em> because he was willing to be honest.
<div class="indent"><strong>Hal</strong>: You're doing better than you think you are.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder19');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real Life&nbsp;</div><div id="folder19" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> You. Oh sure, you faced all of yesterday just to get to today, and tomorrow probably won't be any better. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropesWillRuinYourLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropesWillRuinYourLife">And all you have to do is browse TV Tropes at 3 AM</a>. But you're here because you want to know and learn and share. And aren't those things worthwhile too?
</li><li> As noted in the laconic version of this trope, the statement "you are better than you think you are" is backed up with an explanation or motivation <em>why</em> the person making this speech believes this (something which isn't reflected in the Superman picture atop this page and some entries). To borrow the example with the disabled person, this motivation would come in pointing out that while he or she might never walk again (in case of wheelchair-bound people), they have gotten amazing victories in chess, are very talented in singing, drawing, writing inspirational speeches, or what-have-you. They can't walk, but they're <em>not</em> worthless. Without this sort of motivation, "yes you can" or "you are better than you think you are" falls flat and can come over insulting or condescending. Or give the impulse to look at the first entry of this page's Real Life examples and ask "<em>why?</em>".
<ul><li> <em>But</em> it's also important to remember, as some forget, that a person with a disability is (generally) capable of things that people don't realize they're capable of - that sometimes the person themselves doesn't realize they could do. There are countless examples of people with disabilities breaking through barriers, starting with the Special Olympics and including a Down's Syndrome woman graduating from college, an Autistic teenager writing a book about her experiences, and a kid born without arms growing up to become a motivational speaker. Having a disability <em>usually</em> doesn't mean you can't leave a mark on the world and <em>definitely</em> doesn't mean you're worthless.
</li></ul></li><li> People often start physical training and the like vastly underestimating their own abilities, especially if their lifestyle doesn't really involve strenuous work. A part of the trainer's job isn't just building them up physically, but showing their client just how strong they are when they're pushed.
</li><li> Herb Brooks's speech to his US hockey team right before the famed "Miracle on Ice" game, when the amateur squad beat the four-time defending champs from the USSR in the 1980 Olympic semifinals, arguably the greatest sports upset ever:
<div class="indent"><em>One game; if we played them ten times, they might win nine. But not this game, not tonight. Tonight, we skate with them. Tonight we stay with them, and we shut them down because we can. Tonight, we are the greatest hockey team in the world.</em>
</div></li><li> In psychology, "impostor syndrome" is a feeling where talent outstrips confidence. The so-called "impostor" is somebody who's actually pretty good at what they do but believes that they aren't really that good. When faced with proof of their success, they protest that it was a fluke, that they got lucky, or even insist that it wasn't them. This causes people who could do better to not seek promotions, pay raises, etc. because they believe that they aren't deserving of such things. In extreme cases, they live in fear that someone will realize they've been "faking it" and fire/leave/abandon them. These kinds of fears are almost never true and can hold people back from achieving their full potential. A big part of getting through impostor syndrome is being told and shown that "you're better than you think you are" repeatedly, both through concrete proof of accomplishment and positive reinforcement.
<ul><li> Children are not immune to impostor syndrome, especially if they've been raised with abusive discipline and punishment. While the conventional wisdom is that kids create an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImaginaryFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImaginaryFriend">Imaginary Friend</a> to blame misbehavior on, children have also been known to ascribe good deeds, successes, and achievements to such non-existent companions.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a> famously tells the story of meeting another Neil at a convention for people who had done assorted awesome stuff. Neil was feeling like quite the impostor when the other Neil mentioned that he felt like an impostor since he never really did anything special. Gaiman was shocked because he looked up to Neil #2, <em>the first human being to set foot on the Moon.</em> Neil Armstrong downplayed his achievement as no big deal.
