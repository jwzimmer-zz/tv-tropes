<div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Many adult viewers and writers are upset about kids being harmed. Kid viewers aren't, but then, kids aren't the ones doing the writing, are they? As a result, many characters on TV Wouldn't Hurt a Child.
</p><p>This is often done simply by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourChildren">not showing kids at all in action and suspense shows</a>, but sometimes it's rather conspicuous when characters seemingly go out of their way to not hurt kids, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableInfantSurvival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableInfantSurvival">or circumstances happen to conveniently align themselves</a> so that kids don't get hurt. For example, a slasher movie where the slasher just happens to not encounter children in hiding, or the kids manage to be rescued just in time, while the adults and teens get killed. It's also pretty common that when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">Even Evil Has Standards</a>, not harming children is one of them.
</p><p>This does not mean that the act cannot be referred to in the story. You'll hear characters in plenty of films and TV shows talking about the antagonist harming or killing children. <em>That is much different from actually showing it on-screen.</em>
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>In fact, when this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">does get averted and children do get harmed</a>, it can often be shocking for the audience.
</p><p>See Also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldntHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldntHitAGirl">Wouldn't Hit a Girl</a> for the female-specific version of this trope. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllChildren">Friend to All Children</a> for those adults who not only don't hurt kids, but will actively protect them (even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">if the adults in question are clearly evil</a>). For video games, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourChildren">Hide Your Children</a>, where children aren't even portrayed so as to avoid the implications that they could be hurt. For a more specific form of Wouldn't Hurt a Child, in which very young children are shielded from danger by the plot due to society's squeamishness about hurting babies, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableInfantSurvival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableInfantSurvival">Improbable Infant Survival</a>.
</p><p>A common subversion is when a character who goes by this motto has to face a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">Creepy Child</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">Child Soldier</a>, or worse an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible">Enfant Terrible</a>.

</p><p>Oddly enough, it's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> as many gangs, such as the Mexican Mafia, brutally murder their members that hurt children. This even extends to prison, where inmates, or even prison-based gangs, that welcome robbers and murderers into their fold will not tolerate someone who hurts a kid. In fact, killing one of these people often results in being well liked by the other inmates (people imprisoned for child molestation are often put into solitary confinement, not as punishment, but <em>for their own protection</em>, due to a combination of this trope and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil">Rape Is a Special Kind of Evil</a>). Of course, this can also be seen as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia">Moral Myopia</a>, as there have been criminal gangs (especially Mexican drug cartels) and terrorist organizations (such as ISIS and Al-Qaeda) that use children for prostitution, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mexico-drug-gangs-using-more-children-as-mules/">drug trafficking<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenForcedToKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenForcedToKill">assassinations</a>, and other criminal activities, mainly because children are the <em>least</em> likely people who would commit criminal acts, thus catching other criminal gangs, military, and police forces <a class="urllink" href="http://www.insightcrime.org/news-analysis/why-children-are-low-risk-labor-for-latin-americas-drug-gangs">off-guard<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</p><p>Can overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy">Pragmatic Villainy</a>, as while a villain may have no personal qualms with harming a child, they are well aware most of the world does. Harming a child would only complicate their plans by creating more enemies than they may be equipped to handle, and/or alienate potential and current allies.

</li></ul></li><li> There's been at least some censorship to not show kids getting hurt. An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> was censored in the US release to cut out a brief bit of animation where Gohan was punched by a villain, instead merely implying the punch. Take notice that this was when Gohan was a helpless 4 year old who'd never had a fighting lesson in his life. He gets punched plenty on camera after he learns to punch back.
<ul><li> Hercule deliberately threw his "fight" against Trunks. He didn't know he was going to get punched clear out of the ring by a tiny superhuman, but that doesn't change his intent.

Note, however, this was mainly pragmatism on his part and he figured, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">at the time</a>, that killing Goku wouldn't be beneficial to him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">He was wrong</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>:
<ul><li> Humorously invoked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">Really 700 Years Old</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleMissBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleMissBadass">Little Miss Badass</a> Vita in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS</a></em>, complaining about having to arrest Lutecia:
<div class="indent"><strong>Vita:</strong> I don't like this. It's like I'm picking on a little kid.
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaVivid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaVivid">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha ViVid</a></em>, Subaru complains about Nove fighting harshly against a small girl (Ingvalt/Einhart) the previous night, but Nove counters that she also got beaten up fairly badly.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX">Sonic X</a></em> dub (like many of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment">4Kids Entertainment</a> dub jobs) is famous for the editing out of at least three instances of violence inflicted upon children: The first instance being that of Maria (who not only had an immune disorder in the original, but was shot and killed by a GUN soldier who showed considerable angst about it for <em>decades</em> afterwards- while in the dub she was merely "taken away"). This was closely followed by Christopher Thorndyke in a rather infamous scene which was cut apart repeatedly to edit out the fact that Shadow was throwing-and-smashing-him-into-walls (this resulting in the kid apparently passing out for no reason much to the confusion of a seven year old audience), and finally with the death of a teenage revolutionary making a suicide run into the Metarex fleet (this time 4kids actually edited out a gravestone in one image).
<ul><li> 4Kids starts to get the hint after a while, but Chris still gets <em>another</em> instance of this in the final series whereas Metarex slashes him during an escape attempt. The single drop of blood was cut in order to further the illusion that he'd been knocked out - not stabbed.
</li><li> Eggman also never wanted to hurt Chris, and in fact, when one of his robots went haywire and actually was about to <em>kill</em> him, Eggman aided Sonic in shutting it down because the thought of having a child's blood on his hand was too horrific even for him.
</li></ul></li><li> Gamma Akutabi, of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZombiePowder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZombiePowder">Zombie Powder</a></em>, is led to believe he is fighting a child, and so only uses his left hand. He's likely about to lose until he finds out it's actually an old man who just looks like a child. He holds back like this specifically because he has a soft spot for women and children.
</li><li> This might be the reason why, in the anime adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade">Chrono Crusade</a></em>, Azmaria is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the only member of the main cast to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">survive to the end of the series</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Besides the villain</a>, at least, and Joshua&mdash;but he suffers extreme mental damage in the process</span>. That being said, it <em>does</em> show the deaths of another group of children because of their powers (who are minor enough to not have individual names).
</li><li> King Hamdo, the mad tyrant in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NowAndThenHereAndThere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NowAndThenHereAndThere">Now and Then, Here and There</a></em>, uses this trope to his advantage; he employs an army of children so his enemies will be hesitant to fight back. Unfortunately, he also utilizes the child soldiers as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">war fodder</a>. This was based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> examples like the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ukitake. When battling Lilinette he kept doing things like playing keep-away with her sword when it was fairly obvious that he could have just killed her without the slightest effort.
</li><li> On the other hand, although Kyoraku also saw Lilinette &mdash; who claimed Arrancar don't age &mdash; as a child, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">attacks Wonderweiss without hesitation when he sees him stab Ukitake.</span>
</li><li> Rangiku is fairly hesitant to fight the child-like Wonderweiss, although it could be more due to his playing with a dragonfly in the middle of a battle instead of fighting (at first)
</li><li> Speaking of Wonderweiss, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yamamoto probably wouldn't have hesitated to fight him, but he did state he was glad Wonderweiss used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">his release form</a> so he was fighting a bizarre monster instead of a kid</span>.

Once, when he thought he was responsible for the death of a small child, he had a gun to his head and was ready to pull the trigger when he saw evidence that convinced him that he could not possibly have done it. Another time, he had a clear shot at a teenage hood who had just won parole from juvenile hall, but upon seeing him do something charitable (confirming what the parole officer had told the judge) he changed his mind and let him live. <em>However</em>, if you're a gang banger or a child soldier and you start shooting at him, his reflexes are going to take over and he's not going to ask for your ID before returning fire.

Evil Deadpool is out to prove he's infinitely worse than Deadpool, and Deadpool is trying to figure out what Evil Deadpool's next move is going to be so he can head him off. The problem is that he's approaching it from the wrong direction by looking at it from only his perspective. Then one of his head voices quietly tells him to stop trying to think of something he would do, and to instead try to think of something he <em>wouldn't</em> do. There's a pause, then the horrified expression that comes over Deadpool reveals that he's figured it out: Evil Deadpool is going to <em>kill a child.</em>
</li><li> Deadpool once accepted a pro bono job where he went after a psychiatrist who'd taken advantage of a young girl who was a patient of his, psychologically manipulating her to be vulnerable to his advances and having sex with her multiple times. The girl ended up killing herself, and Deadpool was completely serious throughout the entire story arc, with none of his joking or breaking-the-fourth-wall antics. He psychologically toyed with the psychiatrist, showing up pretending to be seeking help but subtly always turning the session towards topics that made the psychiatrist <em>very</em> uncomfortable. Begging for his life didn't help. If you're going to harm a child, you'd better <em>pray</em> Deadpool doesn't find out about it.

A predator would kill a child soldier in self-defense in a blink, but if it tried to hunt one and collect the skull as a trophy the other predators would punish him.
<ul><li> This is exemplified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Predator2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Predator2">Predator 2</a></em> when he refrains from killing a pregnant cop and a child who was pointing a toy gun at him.

</li><li> In another comic, a predator kills Nazis who were about to kill a child (after having massacred his whole town), then cuts the ropes tying the boy's hands.
</li><li> And in yet another comic, a predator kills a man who physically abused his son and forced him to go hunting to the woods with him, and after blood from his father's body splatters on the boy, the predator gently wipes off the blood from the boy's face before returning to deal with the father's corpse.

<div class="indent"> [...] It struck Loor as almost comical that he could see Vorru's desire to strike at a school as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">evil</a></em>, yet his desire to hit Rogue Squadron was nothing more than duty. The difference, ultimately, was that the strike at Rogue Squadron would advance the cause of the Empire, while the strike at the school would only strengthen Vorru's position. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">We are not as far apart as I would like to think</a>, but neither are we as close as Vorru thinks.</em>

</li><li> Largely averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GalaxyOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GalaxyOfFear">Galaxy of Fear</a></em>, when just about anyone is willing to directly or indirectly hurt Tash and Zak Arranda, who start the series as thirteen and twelve years old, respectively. But played straight(ish) with Captain Thrawn. When Tash is insultingly rude to him, his bodyguards bristle but he tells them to stand down, and says that since she's a child he won't take offense. He also takes the time to explain himself to them, a little, though he doesn't go out of his way any to help them.

<ul><li> After subverting this in its first half-hour, the series later justifies it in that the Cylons want Baby Hera alive, and did their best to take care of her, despite having no prior experience in childcare and in general being lousy at it. Also, Leoben's psychological torture of Kara Thrace on New Caprica included leaving her alone with a child she believed was a half-Cylon hybrid. When Kara locked herself in a room to avoid the kid, the kid hurt herself and Kara's instincts as a human being overcame her hatred for the Cylons and she came to the kid's aid. No, Kara's not the villain, but then again BSG doesn't really have villains. Also, Cylons don't have kids: the toddler was a human girl they'd kidnapped.

Apollo, despite having seen proof that the gangsters are very connected, dangerous, and might be able to get away with killing him, nonetheless confronts the head of the black market and says that he understands the need for a black market on certain goods, but that children are off limits.

</li><li> After seeing what happened to the Targaryen children during Robert's Rebellion, Ned does not want to see history repeat itself. While warning Cersei to take the children and run might have been the noble thing to do, it wasn't the <em>smartest</em> thing to do. Ironically, this action alone did not result in his death: Cersei never intended to kill him, merely send him to the Night's Watch. He was finally killed on the whim of a boy-king, the very person he had intended to spare. The reason for him holding to this belief is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his fear for the safety of his nephew Jon Snow, whom he raised as his own child. Robert Baratheon wanted to kill all of Rhaegar's offspring, which - if the truth were revealed - would include Jon as well, as he is the hidden son of Lyanna Stark (Ned's sister) and Rhaegar Targaryen. Ned internalized this to protect all children in danger from the crown: Daenerys and also Cersei's kids</span>.

A hitman on death row tells the FBI a story about how he murdered a young child, but the evidence doesn't support it. As he stubbornly sticks to his story, Colby wonders whether the hitman was unable to kill the child and hid him away somewhere instead. They eventually find that the memory was so horrible that he had repressed it, fabricating a memory in its place. When he finally remembers what really happened, it's a less pleasant revelation: the hitman was, in fact, unable to make himself kill a child, so his client ended up doing it himself. The fabricated memory was an attempt to create a reality in which the child's last moments were less horrific, even though the false memory put the hitman himself in a worse position.

<ul><li> When forced to choose between giving Elias information or watching a child freeze to death, Reese chose to save the child. Elias knew Reese would make that choice, which is the only reason he engineered the situation.
</li><li> In an early episode, they zig-zag the effects of this trope: a hitman was hired to kill a family, but it turns out he only killed the parents and adult child but let the younger kid live (threatening to kill them anyway if anyone found out). A couple years later, the hitman "defended his honor" in prison when people started claiming that he killed the kid &mdash; no way, he doesn't kill kids.

<ul><li> Ganondorf himself seems to take up this belief in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>.</em> In this incarnation, Link is, at the oldest, twelve, and even after knocking the boy unconscious and stealing his Triforce of Courage, the sorcerer promises not to kill him. Similarly, Ganondorf spends the first half of the game searching for the newest incarnation of Princess Zelda, and kidnaps at least three small girls to find her; they're locked in a cell, true, but they seem to be well cared for during their imprisonment. When Ganondorf does find Zelda, he kidnaps her, but even though he could easily kill her and permanently obtain the Triforce of Wisdom for himself, he won't do it. A late-game monologue reveals Ganondorf's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">motivation for his actions</a>: as a boy, he witnessed countless women and children die in his home country, and has spent much of his life looking for a place where simply existing <em>won't</em> kill people.

</li></ul></li><li> Seems to be a formal rule in the Van Der Linde gang from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption2">Red Dead Redemption II</a></em>. The only time you can really find kids outside in the world (Jack Marston can always be found at camp) is some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetUrchin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetUrchin">street kids</a> in the New Orleans equivalent, Saint Denis. One of them steals your bag in a cutscene and when you chase after him, you can&#146;t shoot him. Nor can you hurt any of the other kids either inside or outside the mission. When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jack gets kidnapped</span>, the whole gang goes on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> and burns someone&#146;s house down over it.

However, the "Staff Rules" poster in Lunesta's office states that "harming children is FORBIDDEN".

<ul><li> Applies to Jackie's niece Jade all the time. For example, when a statue of Lo Pei (the warrior who originally defeated Shendu) is animated by the Rat Talisman, the Dark Hand mooks pose as mystical priests in an attempt to sway him to their side. However, as soon as they try to hurt Jade, Lo Pei sees through the ruse.
</li><li> Most telling in an episode where the heroes are fighting evil clones of themselves, and the adults are handily thrashed by the clone of Paco, a child. When they pull off Paco-clone's "mask" to reveal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">two eyes on an otherwise blank face</a>, the tables suddenly turn and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonCute">they're allowed to punch him with impunity</a>.

Do we look like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PedophilePriest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PedophilePriest">priests</a>?" Considering that convicted child molesters tend to be disproportionately targeted, this is hardly surprising.

<ul><li> Pa and Ma, the late convenience store owners in "The Inconveniencing", wouldn't dare harm anyone under the age of thirteen. Teenagers, however, are fair game.
</li><li> In "Fight Fighters", despite all the threats Robbie made towards Dipper, at the end of the episode Robbie can't bring himself to hurt Dipper, even after the latter had accidentally sicced a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeeFromTVLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeeFromTVLand">living fighting game character</a> on him.

One of his mooks asks why they would bother sparing him. Another mook says that ever since Meliac's son died in a cave-in, Meliac cannot bear to see any child be harmed.

However, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPanAndThePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPanAndThePirates">Peter Pan &amp; the Pirates</a></em>, he compromises in one episode where he is able to manipulate a magical text that gives him an overwhelming advantage over Peter. As he's about to kill Peter, Wendy asks that Toodles be allowed to leave, so he can be spared seeing it. (Toodles is only a toddler.) Hook actually honors this request, and tells his men to bring Toodles below deck. (In this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> continuity, Hook has often stated that he is "a gentleman" who is not unreasonable.) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Unfortunately for him, this was actually part of a plan thought up by Peter to escape by appealing to Hook's pride, and it worked.</span>

In one story arc the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates">Space Pirate</a>, Hondo Ohnaka, attacked a Jedi ship which was carrying six younglings in an attempt to steal their lightsaber crystals, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">and told his men to do whatever was necessary to get them</a>. But two episodes later he tells the Padawan chaperoning the younglings, Ahsoka, that he doesn't like taking children into battle. When she mentions the earlier incident, he waves it off as a change of heart. The character's voice actor said in an interview that Hondo really doesn't like hurting kids; he was hoping to retrieve the crystals with minimum fuss and would have let them go home unharmed.
</li><li> Hunter Gathers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em> has two rules: never kill women or children.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Hunter</strong>: It's what separates us from the bad guys.

She helps Ashley behind their backs, instead of leaving her to die.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Trollhunters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Trollhunters">Trollhunters</a></em>: It is stated that humans kidnapped and replaced with changelings must remain unharmed so that their disguises would hold. Because of this, the various babies that were kidnapped are being cared for and are in no danger.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>: in "Bart the Fink," Bart accidentally exposes Krusty for tax fraud, causing him to lose everything. He tries to cheer his hero up, but when he fails, he gives Krusty permission to punch him in the face. An enraged Krusty is then shown with his fist cocked, but even at his lowest point, he can't bring himself to do it.

<ul><li> In LeVeyan Satanism, you are not permitted to harm children. However, it should be pointed out that LeVayan Satanism is hedonistic, and not outright evil.
</li><li> In the National Geographic Documentary, <em>Russia's Toughest Prisons</em>, an inmate at Black Dolphin explained about his life as a mobster, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">which has its own rules</a> regarding children. Since they're viewed as defenseless, he wasn't allowed to harm them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldntHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldntHitAGirl">The same rules applied to women</a>.
</li><li> Many prison documentary series, such as MSNBC's <em>Lockup</em> and National Geographic's <em>Lockdown</em>, it has been explained that even prisoners have their limits when it comes to children and those convicted of harming them, especially sex offenders, which are viewed as low, even by prisoners' standards.
</li><li> Many countries, like Russia and China, have laws that ban school officials from using corporal punishment on students, which can lead to job dismissal. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporal_punishment_in_the_home">Sweden was the first to go one step further and ban all form, including domestic<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
<ul><li> United States was among the countries that signed the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx">Convention on the Rights of the Child<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, a human rights treaty that handles rights for those under 18, but failed to have it ratified due to each state have different laws regarding children and a partial blame on political and religious conservatives of certain varieties to blocking the measure. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a> is aware of this and admits he'll have this reviewed since he considered the failure to ratify as an embarrassment.
</li><li> However, many countries, including United States, have made illegal for anyone under 18 to be executed for a crime, including murder. Instead, the harshest allowed is life for those who committed homicidal acts in the first-degree, while amendments for non-homicidal crimes have been considered since they can be viewed as cruel and punishments.
</li></ul></li><li> During the trial for the kidnapping and murder of Charles Lindbergh's infant son, it was argued that the kidnapper must have been foreign, because "no American gangster ever sank to the level of killing babies." Interestingly, the true kidnapper might have had similar standards, since the baby's death was likely accidental.
</li><li> Even in the animal kingdom, certain species meet this standard. Not among predators, who usually attack the weakest first (sick, injured, elderly, children) or pack animals with an alpha (who will usually kill off the children of the previous alpha), but among social animals. A common way to end a fight among primates is for one fighter to pick up an infant and hold it.
</li><li> During the 2011 Norway terrorist attacks, Anders Behring Breivik, the perpetrator, spared a 11-year old boy whom he judged "too young to die", despite killing a 14-year old.
