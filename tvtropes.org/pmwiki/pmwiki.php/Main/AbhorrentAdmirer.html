Perhaps she's not even hideous to begin with; she could in fact be a very gorgeous woman, but in cases like those, what <em>will</em> be unattractive about her is her personality. Either way, the protagonist realizes this person is attracted to them and is profoundly uncomfortable with the whole idea, but the female character either doesn't realize he's not interested or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadLove">is undeterred</a>. Yet the character is not just uncomfortable; he's shocked, horrified, or disgusted. Even a wave and a smile from her will be treated as a fate worse than death for the recipient. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>.
</p><p>In some cases, the point of the joke is that the protagonist is too nice to say anything, thus allowing the situation to come up repeatedly. In others, just portraying the protagonist's reaction &mdash; which may be closer to mortal terror than awkwardness &mdash; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexualKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexualKarma">is considered enough of a punchline on its own.</a> Or the admirer may become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfProclaimedLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfProclaimedLoveInterest">Self-Proclaimed Love Interest</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The Abhorrent Admirer differs from more sympathetic characters in one key respect: the audience is expected to find her both unattractive and extremely unsympathetic, and is supposed to feel <em>sorry</em> for the protagonist because she has him in her sights and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">just won't take a hint</a> or proves resistant to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveObliviousness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveObliviousness">clue-by-four</a>.
</p><p>These characters tend strongly to be female rather than male, as a result of a few different gender stereotypes. For one thing, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGuyWantsToBeChased" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGuyWantsToBeChased">No Guy Wants to Be Chased</a> means the mere fact that a woman takes the initiative in courting a man is often portrayed as evidence that she must have something wrong with her; for another, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnMale">double standard rape</a> means that sexually aggressive women are viewed as less threatening, and therefore more comical, than men who impose their attentions on obviously unwilling women. However, in recent years the male "undesirable suitor" has become more common in comedies.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>This trope is at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanPrint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanPrint">Older Than Print</a>; an early version is the medieval legend of the "loathly lady", which is the basis of "The Wife of Bath's Tale" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCanterburyTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCanterburyTales">The Canterbury Tales</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffreyChaucer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffreyChaucer">Geoffrey Chaucer</a>. Loathly ladies also figure in several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChildBallads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChildBallads">Child Ballads</a>; they are usually under a curse, and may actually have been transformed into monsters. When the curse is broken, perhaps by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueLove">True Love</a>, they revert to their true form, as beautiful on the outside as on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueBeautyIsOnTheInside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueBeautyIsOnTheInside">inside</a>. In fact, the trope may be as old as the realization that someone can be attracted to someone who doesn&#146;t love them back; a variant of sorts appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEpicOfGilgamesh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEpicOfGilgamesh">The Epic of Gilgamesh</a></em>, which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt">Older Than Dirt</a>, when the goddess Ishtar offers the hero marriage but is rejected &mdash; though not because of her looks, but because bad things tend to happen to her lovers.

An attractive woman takes a whiff of him, emergency stops the elevator, and has sex with him off-camera. She gets off the elevator and then the commercial has three different endings. In one of them, another attractive woman gets on eluding to a repeat scenario. In another, an elderly shrivelled-up woman gets on and wants him. She smiles at him and gets ready to strip.

Lisa's brother thinks he's flirting with his sister, saying she's hot and being an abhorrent admirer. He asks Jim what is wrong with him, but Jim continues to comment on how hot is meal is. Lisa catches on that he is talking about his Hot Pocket and not her, tosses her keys in a sexual way, and approaches Jim as if she is about to jump his bones. She flirtingly takes a bite out of his Hot Pocket and says "Mmmm that is hot!" Jim finally notices Lisa.

</li><li> Shinobu has one too: Soban of Busumetsu High, who besides being the boss of a delinquent gang, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook">Giant Mook</a>-sized and a most extreme <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk">Gonk</a> even by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RumikoTakahashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RumikoTakahashi">Rumiko Takahashi</a> standards. A running gag is how much he has trouble acting like a human being and not an animal (toss him a ball, he'll play with it like a tamed seal). He does little beyond charge at Shinobu yelling: "Shinobu-saaaan! SUKI DAAAA!!!!" Thankfully, Shinobu is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaifFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaifFu">even stronger</a> than Soban and usually sends him flying.

She would have been unwanted anyway, so maybe they figured they'd make her unattractive just to underscore it, or perhaps they deliberately went with an ugly girl because it's one thing for him to say he's not interested in women (no other girl tries to so much as ask him out except under extraordinary circumstances), but if he turns down a hot one routinely he must be gay.
<ul><li> Subverted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveActionAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveActionAdaptation">Live-Action Adaptation</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ArchieToRiverdaleAndBackAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ArchieToRiverdaleAndBackAgain">Return to Riverdale</a></em>. Set at and around the cast's 15th high school reunion, it reveals that Ethel was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautifulAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautifulAllAlong">Beautiful All Along</a> and is now a world-famous supermodel.
</li><li> Archie Comics have also downplayed this aspect of Ethel in later years. While she was as ugly as they come in her first appearances and used solely to torture Jughead, Ethel has since had some of her more distorted features toned down. She's still really tall with buck teeth and a big nose, but she's drawn much more normally &mdash; even pretty &mdash; and given trendier clothing. As well, she's more of a regular character now (being good friends with Betty), instead of a one-dimensional plot device.
</li><li> Subverted again in that Archie took her out on a casual date to a comedy club and museum and ended up preferring the fact that unlike Betty and Veronica, Ethel made no demands of him. He asked her out again after taking her home.
</li><li> Inverted in an issue where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Cheryl Blossom</a> tries to seduce Jughead, just to prove she can. She fails but then sees Jughead trying to impress Ethel (who unbeknownst to Cheryl had a picnic basket full of food). Later on another character decides to practice some lines for a play, and Cheryl walks in on him apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike">declaring his love for Ethel</a>. The issue ends with Cheryl taking a photo of Ethel into a beauty parlor and demanding to be made to look "like this exotic creature".
</li></ul></li><li> Mark, the protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Invincible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Invincible">Invincible</a></em> was once almost forced to marry the princess of Atlantis (in this version of Atlantis, merpeople are half-fish all over their bodies, like a Lovecraftian horror). Subverted in that the princess would rather marry one of her race and with a cunning plan, Mark escapes to the surface and she happily marries a more suitable groom.
</li><li> The Mexican comic <em>Simon Simonazo</em> used this trope in a rather strange manner; the Admirer in question had a comically horrid face, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButterFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButterFace">her body on the other hand...</a>
</li><li> In issue #30 of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtlesMirage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtlesMirage">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em> series, during the story Sky Highway, Raphael gained one with a German mutated human called Hildagaard Rail. In a dimension where there is an actual highway in the sky, Raph fell in the passenger side of her car. She wore sunglasses, had her hair wrapped up in a scarf tied behind her chin, and a black dress that showed off her ample bosom. Hildagaard had long legs and the body of a supermodel, but her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagLips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagLips">lips were so enormous</a> they went from ear to ear and almost from chin to forehead taking up most of the space on her face. She openly flirted with her "dollink" turtle telling him "You're the most sexy shade of green I've ever seen." When Raphael was about to leave her car he told her "It's been funfffh!" The ninja's words were cut short because Hildagaard grabbed him by the tails of his bandanna and said: "Shut up and kiss me, you dumkoff!" With his head tilted all the way to the side she pulled him close to her and gave him a big passionate kiss that covered his entire beak. When he finally got away from Hilda she called out, "Auf Wiedersehen, loverboy!" Raph referred to it as the biggest indignity he ever had to face as a hero. The turtle wiped off the giant lipstick imprint off of his face which wasn't sideways, but on straight making it seem like they locked lips for a while. At least long enough for Raph's head to tilt.

It's really the fact that she comes on <em>very</em> strongly, and that she makes it blatantly clear that she is only interested in him physically and could not care less about his feelings.

For a change, Scrooge has no problem with her personality, and it's hinted the only reason she's this trope is that he's still in love with "Glittering" Goldie O'Gilt.
<ul><li> Princess Oona is this to Donald Duck. During a trip to the Stone Age in Gyro Gearloose's time machine, Gyro and Donald Duck first meet the incredibly strong cave-duck Oona. On the journey back to the future she stows away in the time machine and has remained in Duckburg ever since. She falls madly in love with Donald and uses her enormous strength to hug him and kiss him against her will. She knows he dates Daisy, but she doesn't care.
</li><li> A story titled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSanctuaryTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSanctuaryTree">The Sanctuary Tree</a></em> ("Love is in the Air" and "The Potion of Love" in foreign translations) begins with Donald being chased by a tall, fat, strong, angry and ugly female redheaded officer... because Donald was fishing in a forbidden area. Donald manages to escape her, not without insulting her first but is late for a date with Daisy. Furious, Daisy ends the relationship. Then Donald buys a love potion that causes the victim to fall in love with the first person she sees in front of her. A series of incidents culminates in Donald and Daisy ending up in the same lake at the beginning of the story, with the same fat female officer taking the potion and falling madly in love with Donald. She immediately and tightly embraces Donald, kissing him nonstop, to his horror and disgust. Daisy sees everything and believes they are lovers. She leaves screaming that she never wants to see Donald again, leaving the couple continuing to kiss. Donald finally manages to break free of the woman's embrace, and the story ends with him hiding in a tree while the female officer waits for him on the ground, making promises of love.

He discovers that one of the inhabitants will be forced to marry the princess of the kingdom, otherwise a curse will fall on the other inhabitants. Since the princess is arrogant, spoiled, and cruel, Mickey tries to help the chosen man seduce her by creating a beautiful speech for him to recite to her.

She eventually met and married the equally grotesque B.O. Plenty, though B.O. was never used as an Abhorrent Admirer, just as a side villain and then a comic-relief hillbilly. Naturally B.O. and Gertie's daughter, Sparkle, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUglyGuysHotDaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUglyGuysHotDaughter">is a stunner</a>.

Wimpy wasn't attracted to her but he would have make-out sessions with her if it meant free food. She could use magic to make herself look more attractive, but unless she was feeding Wimpy he couldn't care less. In a comic book that depicted Popeye and Olive Oyl's wedding written decades later by Peter David, the Sea Hag caught the bouquet at the ceremony. When she turned to Wimpy so they could be the next to marry, he ran for the hills. She chased after him.

She even appeared in one episode of the Ruby-Spears cartoon. Crazy Shirley hasn't appeared in the comic strip for several years now.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Zits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Zits">Zits</a></em>, Jeremy gets one of these in the form of Amber, a girl who obsesses about him for a week or so before she breaks up with him (via the Posse) and disappears. In a rare case, she is somewhat sympathetic and not the butt of the joke (one strip had Hector pondering why of all people she'd obsess over <em>Jeremy</em>).

It's not so much that she's unattractive, as he already has a girlfriend. It all comes to an end after she winds up going to prom with Peter's friend Steve and both hit it off very well.
</li><li> Morton Goldthwait is a fairly straight example. He's a short, zit-faced, coke-bottle-lenses wearing nerd who obsesses over Paige and won't be dissuaded no matter how violently she reacts to his advances. Although in one storyline he does move on and find someone who returns his advances. Paige even asks him if he forgot about her and all the times he kept hitting on her, and he replies: "The truth is, I remembered."

The character was so popular that the tradition caught on in real life, and outlived the strip character's fame entirely in the form of Sadie Hawkins dances. Also, the Sadie Hawkins strips always featured an abundance of abhorrent admirers, chasing their prospective husbands.

Interestingly, she's actually a decent person and not at all unattractive; he's just thoroughly uninterested and she keeps throwing herself at him. The various women his mother tries to pair him with are also this. None of them show up long enough to get a personality, but most of them look inhuman enough to qualify.

However, as befits the usual gendering of this trope, Chris Elliott's character already has an attractive, entirely subservient wife who does things like spontaneously bake him cookies and give him blowjobs while he watches football. ("Keep your head down, honey!")
</li><li> In the Rudy Ray Moore film <em>Petey Wheatstraw, the Devil's Son-in-Law</em>, the title character dies and is given a chance to come back to life by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a>. The catch: he has to marry the Devil's daughter. Who was described by one reviewer as "having fallen out of the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down". Needless to say, Petey goes out of his way to try to weasel out of his end of the bargain.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShallowHal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShallowHal">Shallow Hal</a></em>, in which the title character has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypnoFool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypnoFool">hypnotized</a> into seeing the "inner beauty" of an obese woman.

Tracy Turnblad's crush on Link, the hot male lead of The Corny Collins Show, is not only reciprocated, she also quickly becomes the show's most popular dancer.

<ul><li> Once a young man went to visit his pastor. He was very depressed because he was overweight. In particular, he felt doomed to never marry because he was so unattractive due to being overweight. The pastor listened, and then told the young man he would take care of it. The next morning, the young man awoke to a knock on the door. There was this gorgeous single woman from the congregation. She said: "I don't know what this means, but the pastor told me to tell you that if you can catch me you can keep me," and then took off running. The young man ran after her, but could not catch her. This happened every morning for several months. The young man came closer and closer each day. Boy was he motivated. Then the day came, he knew he would catch her today. But when the knock came at his door, there was Lena Hyena. "I don't know what this means," she said, "but the pastor said that if I can catch you, I get to keep you." Immediately the young man began running. Boy was he motivated.
<ul><li> Another version replaces the pastor with a gym trainer, and the woman with an attractive gym buddy and sexual favors... and also replaces Lena Hyena with a very large man, who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedyRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedyRape">very intent on rape</a>.
<ul><li> And the French version of <em>that</em> version makes their first name rhyme with the sex act to boot.
</li></ul></li><li> The Indian version replaces the pastor with a weight loss program. It also goes into some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">Adaptation Expansion</a>: The program provides three packages: Lose weight in six months, three months, three weeks or: bonus special package: in <strong>ONE DAY</strong>. The young man orders the three-month package, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadTurningBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadTurningBeauty">beautiful woman</a> appears on the first week to be chased. He orders the second package right away to see what happens and gets a <em>really</em> hot chick on the second week. Catching on to the pattern, he orders the third package on the third week and gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexGoddess">Sex Goddess</a>. He trains with her for three weeks, becomes a pretty fast runner, and almost catches her. Excited, he orders the Special Package, ready and warmed up to catch the hottest chick of them all. The doorbell rings, and when he answers he finds a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">she-gorilla</a> dropped off at his doorstep.

</li></ul></li><li> This joke is best told to a group of close friends that are okay with a little good-natured ribbing.

(Feel free to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flip</a> the roles to suit the genders/sexual preferences of your friends) You tell these beloved friends of yours that one day, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">Aaron, Bob, and Charles</a> died and went to Hell. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">The Devil</a> walks up to Aaron and says: "Aaron! Welcome to Hell. I'd like you to meet your new wife!". At this, a door opens and out walks the most hideous woman either of them has ever seen. She grabs the helpless Aaron and drags him away screaming to her boudoir for an eternity of violent lovemaking. Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">The Devil</a> walks up to Bob and says: "Bob! Welcome to Hell. I'd like you to meet YOUR new wife!". Another door opens and out walks an even MORE hideous woman than the first one. She grabs the helpless Bob and drags him away screaming to her boudoir for an eternity of violent lovemaking. Charlie is terrified, but then a door opens up and out steps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AngelinaJolie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AngelinaJolie">Angelina Jolie</a>. Charlie can't believe his eyes, and she's even more gorgeous in person than on film. As Charlie is fumbling for something to say, The Devil says: "Angelina! Welcome to Hell. I'd like you to meet your new husband!".
<ul><li> There's a similar joke about 3 women going to Heaven, and being warned not to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">step on the ducks</a>. The first two women do so and get paired up with ugly men, while the last woman goes months without doing so, and gets a very handsome man paired up with her. When asked if he's her reward for doing well, he comments that "I have no clue - all I know is that I just stepped on a duck."

The man looked at the whore, looked at the executioner, looked at the whore, then again looked at the executioner, and said, "Let's hang, master".

Subverted in that Jerin has <em>reason</em> to be terrified&mdash;he lives in a matriarchal society in which female rapists seem to exist in much higher numbers than in the real world, and since the sisters will have an advantage in numbers, trying to fight back would be futile.

She has a crush on him, to the point of touching his arse on the sly and getting jealous when he chats up an attractive customer around his age.

<ul><li> The aging, overweight Hepzibah Smith is this to Tom Riddle, future <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, in a flashback in <em>Half-Blood Prince</em>. Tom plays up to this by flirting with her just enough to stay in her good graces until he can get what he wants. Then he poisons her. Unlike most of the other examples, we aren't supposed to sympathize with Tom. Also, the whole thing is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama">Played for Drama</a>, unlike most other examples.
</li><li> Along with Riddle, each of the main trio has one. Though none of them are physically unattractive; it is mainly their personalities. Harry has Romilda Vane, who stalks Harry and at one point gave him cauldron cakes laced with love potion, which Ron ate with tragic results. Ron, in a slight subversion, has an Abhorrent Admirer in his <em>girlfriend</em>. At first he returns her affection, but soon finds that he's becoming more and more frightened of her, and her displays of affection get more and more crazy. Hermione has the incredibly attractive and talented, but slightly deranged and QUITE egotistical Cormac McLaggen following her. Being a nerd, she isn't really blinded by his attractiveness and sees him as the horrible, arrogant person he is.
</li><li> There's also Merope Gaunt. While we're meant to sympathize with her instead of the elder Tom Riddle, she otherwise fits the bill. She's a very ugly woman due to generations of incestuous inbreeding, mentally unstable, and obsessive over the attractive young man who catches her eye. She even feeds him love potions to win him, since he won't have a thing to do with her otherwise.
</li><li> James Potter was this to Lily Evans in their first six years at Hogwarts. Although James was a talented Quidditch player and well-liked by most, Lily considered him an arrogant bully and treated him with contempt. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> but not only until their seventh year, when James matured, lost some of his arrogance, and stopped hexing other people just for fun, did Lily agree to date him, eventually falling in love with and marrying him.
</li><li> Ron to Fleur Delacour at first. To hear Ron tell it, when he asked her out to the Yule Ball after getting charmed by her Veela magic when he was unfortunate enough to be near her attempting to charm Cedric, she looked at him like he was just a sea slug. Ron still nurses a crush even after she becomes engaged to his older brother Bill, but she is far more patient yet still annoyed with his antics.

More prominently, there's Rei's unabashedly confessing her love and affection to her constantly in spite of their world's <em>very</em> strict social norms and niceties; Rei's <em>intentional</em> trolling of her for Rei's own amusement; and how Rei considers her rebukes and punishments <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooKinkyToTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooKinkyToTorture">rewards in and of themselves.</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She eventually reverses her stance.</span>

Prince Dolph finds himself engaged to two women, the beautiful Nada Naga, whom he loves, and the more ordinary Electra, who loves him. Nada considers Dolph to be this trope, as he is far too young and immature for her. Dolph thinks this of Electra, as while she is not unattractive, she can in no way compete with the knockout Nada. To compound matters, Dolph must marry Nada to ensure an alliance between two kingdoms, and he must marry Electra or she will die from a magical curse. Despite this, the three are friends, and eventually decide to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">Screw Destiny</a> by having Dolph marry Electra, divorce her the next day, marry Nada, and fix the love triangle with the use of Love/Anti-Love potions. Then it gets double subverted when during their one night of marriage Dolph discovers he truly <em>does</em> love Electra, and they remain married. (In case you were wondering, the Nada thing is sorted when Dolph performs her wedding ceremony to another guy, as "to marry someone" also means "to perform their wedding vows".)

In their society, friendly intermingling of felis and lepus is perfectly fine, but the reactions of others to a romance between the two highlights the still-somewhat-strained relationship between Japanese people and Koreans. In the first step, Nabi flees Doki's attentions more because of social norms than actual disinterest (although Doki's enthusiasm probably intimidates Nabi a bit, as well). The rest of the shorts are more about Doki and Nabi's attempts to cope with society's opinion of their relationship. The example works so well because the creators (Koreans) show both sides' crowds as being equally disapproving (removing bias) and refraining from demonstrating which country is represented by which animal.

<ul><li> There's features an interesting take on Abhorrent Admirer in one story arc. It revolves around a queen with a trio of daughters who is making arrangements with another king to have his son marry one of her daughters to cement an alliance, with intent to betray him later and become absolute ruler of both kingdoms. The prince in question, however, is in every possible way disinterested. Not because the daughters are necessarily ugly, but because they're <em>gnolls</em>, and he's just plain not interested in an interspecies relationship (by gnoll standards they're actually pretty hot catches). Two of the daughters are incredibly forward and eager; it's never shown onscreen but when the middle daughter tries to actually use sex to win him over, it's implied he reacts badly. When he succumbs to the fact that he's not going to get out of this, he chooses the third daughter, who's surly and completely unwilling. When his father asks why he chose her over her cheerful, willing sisters, he points out that if he has to marry one of them he might as well choose the one he agrees with and who will, more importantly, be equally as miserable with the arrangement.

<ul><li> Alpaca is a minor example. She's by no means a bad person (she's actually one of the nicest islanders if also one of the least functional), but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Vinesauce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Vinesauce">Vinny</a> doesn't want her anywhere near <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Vinesauce</a>, mainly because she's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal">alpaca</a> and because Vinny has eyes for Two-Faced only. This becomes very prevalent in Episode 20, where an attempt to get Wario a girlfriend ends with Vinesauce and Alpaca becoming a coup. Vinny tells them they can't be together, and openly thinks of Alpaca as an obstacle. Ironically, the problem is solved when Walrus (Two-Faced's lover and Vinny's main <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitcomArchNemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitcomArchNemesis">Sitcom Arch-Nemesis</a>) hooks Alpaca up with someone else that very same episode.
</li><li> Seabiscuit would've also been treated as this to Vinesauce, for the same reasons as Alpaca, but also because her voice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote">causes Vinny pain</a>. Why didn't she become this? Because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they got together in Episode 28, the episode in which Isaac pushes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a> halfway through; when the game is reloaded, Vinesauce and Seabiscuit aren't interested in being a couple, and the latter soon finds someone else</span>.
</li><li> Later on, there's Balegdah. She just barely escapes being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk">Gonk</a>, she has a bad temper, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">and worst of all</a>, she's based on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedMeme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedMeme">Discredited Meme</a>. Of course, she ends up getting together with Vinesauce, and Vinny can't do a thing about it. From then on, she's treated as this by Vinny, even though Vinesauce actually likes her a lot. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, given how Vinesauce immediately moved on after Balegdah got assimilated near the end of the first series, it's very possible that he did share Vinny's opinion of her.</span>

Laura is a pretty lady but uses a Snapchat filter to distort her face and speaks in a lower, huskier voice while playing Helen in order to fulfill the "ugly" portion of the trope. When Snapchat got rid of the square jaw filter, the couple found other ways of making Helen come to life - including an improvised sketch shot from Helen's point of view (much to Steven's chagrin), and especially Helen <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">haunting Steven in his dreams</a></em>, implying all the while that she's very well aware of how she really makes him feel &amp; doesn't care as long as she gets to "smash" him. Most disturbingly, in that last one, Laura also appears as herself, implying Helen is hitting on a married man.

One of them has Kitana chasing Liu Kang in front of the site's logo, whining that he "runs too fast" and that "[they're] meant to be!". They run back and forth across the logo, with Liu always outrunning Kitana <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until she disappears, leaving him to hesitate as he wonders where she is... long enough for her to appear out of nowhere, snatch him, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeFemaleOnMale">drag him offscreen for some "Hot Edenian Love"</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BowChickaWowWow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BowChickaWowWow">complete with a porn-y track made of Garageband loops</a></span>.

Wolverine threatens to claw Deadpool mid-sentence.
</li><li> In the first verse of "A Whole New Team", Deadpool piggybacks on Iron Man in flight and sings, "I can show you my sword, and I don't mean my katana." Deadpool continues hitting on the exasperated Iron Man for the rest of his lines.

At one point, she even privately asks Fig and Kristen to make sure she's never alone with him because he makes her so uncomfortable. (Though this could be just as much because she doesn't trust herself not to hex him in retaliation.)
