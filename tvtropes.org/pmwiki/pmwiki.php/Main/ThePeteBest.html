<ul><li> Eric Stuart, the longtime voice actor for James in the 4Kids dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em>, was actually the <em>second</em> voice actor for the character. Ted Lewis was James's voice actor for the first few episodes of the show's run. Lewis went on to voice Tracey and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Giovanni</a>, among many other minor characters, and notably returned to the role of Giovanni even after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">the mass voice actor replacement of 2006</a>.
<ul><li> Another case of this happened with Meowth, who is best known as being voiced by the late <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaddieBlaustein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaddieBlaustein">Maddie Blaustein</a>. However, for the first thirty or so episodes of the dub, his voice actor was Matthew Sussman (credited under the name "Nathan Price"), who retired the role afterward while continuing to provide additional voices for a couple more years.
</li></ul></li><li> Raoh was originally voiced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NorioWakamoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NorioWakamoto">Norio Wakamoto</a> when he appeared in Episode 32 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FistOfTheNorthStar">Hokuto no Ken</a></em> before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenjiUtsumi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenjiUtsumi">Kenji Utsumi</a> took over the role. This was before Raoh's proper first appearance, before Raoh's design and backstory were finalized (before he even had a proper name even) since Raoh only shows up as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterSilhouettes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterSilhouettes">silhouette</a>. Wakamoto would later appear as another character named Shuren.
</li><li> Tristan Taylor from the 4Kids dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> was voiced by Sam Riegel for the first ten episodes until Greg Abbey took over. However, Riegel's goofier take is more well-known these days, especially to fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YuGiOhTheAbridgedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YuGiOhTheAbridgedSeries">Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series</a></em>, simply because of how easy it is to make fun of.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CrispinFreeman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CrispinFreeman">Crispin Freeman</a> is best known for being the voice of Zelgadis, however, Daniel Cronin had voiced the character for nine episodes before the character was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> and recast with Crispin after he reappeared eight episodes later (apparently, the people working on the dub couldn't get back in contact with Cronin). Interestingly, this was a controversial recast in the day, as many fans were used to Daniel's voice, and had a hard time adjusting to Freeman; with how long Freeman has been in the role, however, nowadays people who haven't been watching since the beginning only see Cronin as Zelgadis' "old voice" when they watch the earlier episodes.
<ul><li> The same could be said for Joan Baker as Amelia. Most people associate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VeronicaTaylor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VeronicaTaylor">Veronica Taylor</a> as the character's voice actress, not knowing there was another actress who had briefly voiced the character for her first three episodes. In addition, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LuciChristian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LuciChristian">Luci Christian</a> also briefly voiced the character for <em>Slayers Premium</em>, but her performance is usually also sidelined by Taylor's.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a>:
<ul><li> The entire Ocean voice cast for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>. Once associated as the voices of the series, that honor now goes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation">Funimation</a>'s voice cast, who has completely replaced the former (with actors like Sean Schemmel and Chris Sabat instead of Ian Corlett and Brian Drummond). While Ocean did do their own dub of the second half of the series for Europe and Canada in association with AB Groupe, this has also been displaced by Funimation's version, which is all that's on DVD in those (and all English-speaking) territories.
</li><li> Within <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FUNimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FUNimation">FU Nimation</a>'s studios itself, their very first dub, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSleepingPrincessInDevilsCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSleepingPrincessInDevilsCastle">Sleeping Princess in Devil's Castle</a></em>, had several regulars like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherSabat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherSabat">Christopher Sabat</a> as Yamcha, Laurie Steele as Young Krillin, and Mike McFarland as Master Roshi, but also had several actors who would soon be replaced with cast members fans are much more familiar with. Kid Goku was originally voiced by Ceyli Delgadillo before Stephanie Nadolny and later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColleenClinkenbeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColleenClinkenbeard">Colleen Clinkenbeard</a> handled him for more recent stuff, Leslie Alexander voiced Bulma in the dub before being replaced by Tiffany Volmer and later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MonicaRial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MonicaRial">Monica Rial</a>, and Launch had two different voice actresses for her good and bad sides (Monika Antonelli, the original Puar and Chiaotzu, was the good side, and Christine Marten, who has no other credits, was the bad side) while Meredith McCoy would provide the voice of both her personalities for the rest of her appearances.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FUNimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FUNimation">FU Nimation</a> also had a few cases of this in their first dubbed season of <em>DBZ</em>, which covered the "Ginyu" and "Freeza" arcs. Chris Cason (who also voices Shou in the franchise) was the original voice for both Tien Shinhan and Mr. Popo, but temporary retired the following year, leaving the characters to be respectively recast with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnBurgmeier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnBurgmeier">John Burgmeier</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherSabat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherSabat">Christopher Sabat</a>. While Cason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOriginalDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOriginalDarrin">returned to the role</a> of Mr. Popo beginning in 2010 for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallKai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallKai">Dragon Ball Kai</a></em>, Burgmeier has continued to provide the voice for Tien. Dale Kelly was the original voice for Captain Ginyu in Funimation's dub, but 2 years later he was replaced with Brice Armstrong and after Armstrong's retirement R. Bruce Elliot. Lastly, Chris Sabat himself is the Pete Best for both Nappa and Raditz, providing their voices for a flashback in one episode, as well as providing the voice for the former in the original English dub of the Bardock TV special. In all future appearances in anime and video games, Phil Parsons has been Nappa, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JustinCook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JustinCook">Justin Cook</a> (who is also the voice of Teen and Adult Dende as well as Super Buu) is Raditz.
</li><li> Funimation's original voices for the Pilaf Gang for their appearances in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallMysticalAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallMysticalAdventure">third Dragon Ball film</a> were completely different than the usual voices that have played them in all other appearances. Pilaf was voiced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikeMcFarland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikeMcFarland">Mike McFarland</a> rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckHuber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckHuber">Chuck Huber</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JustinCook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JustinCook">Justin Cook</a> voiced Shou instead of Chris Cason (an inversion of his status as Tien), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CynthiaCranz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CynthiaCranz">Cynthia Cranz</a> originally voiced Mai, while Julie Franklin handled her for the dub of the TV series and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColleenClinkenbeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColleenClinkenbeard">Colleen Clinkenbeard</a> has provided her voice for all future appearances.
</li><li> For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> most people attribute <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewMercer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewMercer">Matthew Mercer</a> as the voice of Hit, but he was the second actor for the role. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarthDebutedInSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarthDebutedInSmashBros">In his first English-speaking appearance</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallXenoverse2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallXenoverse2">Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</a></em>, Aaron Roberts (who also voices Cae in the anime) provided Hit's voice, and Mercer took over for all subsequent appearances.
</li><li> In the Japanese version, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaokoWatanabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaokoWatanabe">Naoko Watanabe</a> is best known as the voice of Chi-Chi, but <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MayumiSho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MayumiSho">Mayumi Sho</a> voiced her in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> and the first two seasons and three movies of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, before taking a hiatus from seiyuu work to care for her family. She very briefly returned to voice Chi-Chi in the first <em>Budokai</em> game, but otherwise, the role has long been associated with Watanabe (who also voices Puar).
</li><li> In the Latin American Spanish dub of <em>DB</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JesusBarrero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JesusBarrero">Jes&uacute;s Barrero</a> was the first voice actor of both Yamcha and Puar from their first appearance until episode 45, when he left and the roles were given to separate actors (Yamcha to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RicardoMendoza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RicardoMendoza">Ricardo Mendoza</a>, who continues on the role up to this day, and Puar to Cristina Camargo).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BattleOfThePlanets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BattleOfThePlanets">Battle of the Planets</a></em> (the first English dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ScienceNinjaTeamGatchaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ScienceNinjaTeamGatchaman">Science Ninja Team Gatchaman</a></em>) had entirely different actors for Tiny and Jason in the earliest-dubbed episode, "Attack of the Space Terrapin". Most fans associate Alan Dinehart and Ronnie Schell with the respective characters, however, Schell voiced <em>Tiny</em> in this first episode, while David Jolliffe voiced Jason. For some reason or another, Sandy Frank recast the parts after that, leaving Schell to take on the more prominent role of Jason (and voicing the character in a higher, somewhat raspier voice than Jolliffe's take), while Dinehart took over Tiny.

</li><li> For most of the franchise, Ricardo Mendoza voices Shiryu and Roberto Mendiola voices Ban, but in their first appearance in the second episode, it was the other way around.
</li><li> The Brazilian original voiceover for Shiryu was S&eacute;rgio Rufino, who voiced the character in the 1994 broadcast, but was shortly replaced by Elcio Sodr&eacute; after nine episodes, because Rufino was suffering from hoarseness at the time. In 2003, the series got a redub with most of the cast being the same, and Sodr&eacute; was recast as Shiryu voicing him in the entire series. Later, all <em>Saint Seiya</em> productions featured Sodr&eacute; as Shiryu.

<ul><li> Tragic example: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelOHare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelOHare">Michael O'Hare</a> (Commander Sinclair) was found to be suffering from mental illness, and replaced with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceBoxleitner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceBoxleitner">Bruce Boxleitner</a> (Captain Sheridan, new look, same great taste) in time for Season Two, though he did make sporadic appearances in Season 3. He didn't stay long enough to make an impression on fans or his castmates, and never told anyone about his condition, leading to rumors of drug addiction. That said, the revelation of his condition in 2013 did spark a new wave of admiration and respect for him from longtime fans of the show, particularly with the hindsight of just how harrowing episodes like "And the Sky, Full of Stars"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0cvpr');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0cvpr" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0cvpr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which deals with his character being deliberately tortured with mind games</span> must have been for him to film.

Leonard and Sheldon had an extroverted female co-worker and friend named Gilda, who was dropped and replaced by Raj and Howard. The main story revolved around the guys trying to help the cynical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardDrinkingPartyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardDrinkingPartyGirl">Hard-Drinking Party Girl</a> Katie, played by Amanda Walsh.

</li><li> The mid-60's comedy <em>Camp Runamuck!</em> featured Leonard Stone as Doc in most of the episodes. In the pilot, however, Frank DeVol portrayed Doc, who the role was originally intended for and who left due to health problems.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em> had a fourth precinct detective in the pilot who was dropped due to lacking good chemistry with the other characters. The trope (and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a>) are also referenced in the episode <em>Swan Song</em> when the rock musician murderer gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveRant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveRant">Motive Rant</a> about how the victim (his bandmate) was going to "Pete Best" him.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ed">Ed</a></em> had an in-universe example. A band sued their founder, lead singer, and songwriter, on the grounds that she plagiarized her lyrics. It was all a pretense because the record label didn't like her. They had already scouted a potential replacement, but the trial took so long, the replacement joined another band. They tried to take back their leader, in vain. The episode ended with the band performing in front of a not so impressed talent scout.

</li><li> Laura's original best friend, Penny Peyser (Ebonie Smith), disappeared after the first season, and Eddie's, Rodney Beckett (Randy Josselyn) didn't last much longer. Their successors, Maxine Johnson (Cherie Johnson) and Waldo Faldo (Shawn Harrison) are much more recognizable.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement">Home Improvement</a></em> originally had actress Francis Fisher playing Jill, but producers were uncertain about her take on the character (playing her a lot more exasperated over Tim's antics) and this led to her being replaced with Patricia Richardson for the series itself.
</li><li> Pert Kelton was the original Alice Kramden when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHoneymooners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHoneymooners">The Honeymooners</a></em> was just a segment of Jackie Gleason's variety show. She was caught up in the Red Scare and was replaced by Audrey Meadows around the time for the show's "Classic 39".
</li><li> When the syndicated newsmagazine <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/InsideEdition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/InsideEdition">Inside Edition</a></em> premiered in January 1989, it was originally hosted by British journalist David Frost. After about three weeks into its first year, Frost was replaced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillOReilly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillOReilly">Bill O'Reilly</a>, who would host the show for about the next six and a half years. After O'Reilly's departure came former <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Today" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Today">Today</a></em> anchor Deborah Norville. Norville began hosting <em>Inside Edition</em> in March 1995 and continued to host it a good 20 years later.
</li><li> A number of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronChef">Iron Chef</a></em>s are "the Pete Best" because of how the English dub was handled: The first dubbed episodes were from the <em>last</em> two seasons, featuring the lineup of veteran Chinese chef Kenichi Chin (credited in the English dub of the show as Chen Kenichi, family name first even though the other chefs were credited Western-style with their given name first), French chef Hiroyuki Sakai, then-new Japanese-American fusion chef Masaharu Morimoto (the <em>third</em> Iron Chef Japanese), and Italian chef Masahiko Kobe (by far the youngest of the Iron Chefs, 26 at the time of his appointment, 28 in the earliest dubbed episodes at which time he had already been on the show for 2 years). Later, the decision was made to dub a new order of episodes starting with the <em>second</em> season, featuring the lineup of Sakai and Chin with Iron Chef Japanese I, Rokusaburo Michiba. Not shown in the English dub except for a single episode (in which he <em>lost</em>) was Iron Chef French I, Yutaka Ishinabe, who left the show after a single season because he disliked the artificial pacing of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityTelevision">Reality Television</a>, and not shown until very late in the show's run was Iron Chef Japanese II, Koumei Nakamura, appearing in seasons 4 and 5 after Michiba's departure from the series. Until late, most American viewers had little idea that Nakamura had been part of the show for two years, as Morimoto was depicted as being Michiba's direct successor.

By the time the actual series premiered, she was replaced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SashaAlexander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SashaAlexander">Sasha Alexander</a> (notable in that she herself would be replaced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CoteDePablo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CoteDePablo">Cote de Pablo</a> after the second season). And from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em> two-parter that provided the backdoor pilot for <em>its</em> spinoff, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISLosAngeles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISLosAngeles">NCIS: Los Angeles</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LouiseLombard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LouiseLombard">Louise Lombard</a> played the character who would have been that show's team leader.

He replaced Tom Snyder as the host of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLateLateShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLateLateShow">The Late Late Show</a></em> and re-vamped it, giving it a new set and a more comedic style than Snyder's. Then he left the show...and in came Craig Ferguson, who became a darling in the late-night ranks. Then Ferguson left and James Corden took over.

Since Kathleen had a much larger role in later seasons (oldest child Maureen featured most prominently in seasons 1-2), Siko became much more associated with the role.
</li><li> The original (un-aired) pilot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NUMB3RS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NUMB3RS">NUMB3RS</a></em> had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GabrielMacht" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GabrielMacht">Gabriel Macht</a> as Don, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LenCariou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LenCariou">Len Cariou</a> as Alan, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferBransford" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferBransford">Jennifer Bransford</a> as Terry Lake. For the actual series pilot, those roles were played <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobMorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobMorrow">Rob Morrow</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JuddHirsch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JuddHirsch">Judd Hirsch</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SabrinaLloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SabrinaLloyd">Sabrina Lloyd</a> respectively. The un-aired pilot also featured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelRooker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelRooker">Michael Rooker</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnnaDeavereSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnnaDeavereSmith">Anna Deavere Smith</a> in roles that were cut completely from the final script.
</li><li> The talk show <em>Live with Kelly and Ryan</em> (hosted by Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest) was known for most of its life as <em>Live with Regis and Kathie Lee</em>, and hosted by Regis Philbin and Kathie Lee Gifford. Gifford left in 2001 and was replaced with Kelly Ripa, Philbin left a decade later and was replaced by Michael Strahan, and Strahan was replaced by Seacrest in 2016. The show underwent various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestHost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestHost">guest hosts</a> prior to each successor, along with a name change after each new host was established (<em>Live with Regis and Kelly</em>, then <em>Live with Kelly and Michael</em>). However, despite all this, Gifford was <em>not</em> the original co-host; under its original name of <em>The Morning Show</em>, it was co-hosted by Philbin and Cyndy Garvey<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1wg47');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1wg47" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1wg47');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">then wife of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MLBTeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MLBTeams">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> star Steve Garvey</span> for its first season in 1983, followed by Ann Abernathy for another season before Gifford entered in 1985. The show began naming itself after its hosts in 1988. Thus, the show is a double example &#151; those who remember it only for the <em>Regis and Kelly</em> era onward may not realize that Ripa replaced Gifford; and those who <em>do</em> remember Gifford may not realize that she herself was a replacement.
</li><li> Penny Santon originally played Nurse Consuelo Lopez in the TV movie that started <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarcusWelbyMD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarcusWelbyMD">Marcus Welby, M.D.</a></em> before recast by Elena Verdugo for the rest of the run.
</li><li> The original pilot for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren">Married... with Children</a></em> was never aired. When the show went into production, they used new actors for Bud/Kelly.

Ironically, Christopher had originally tested for the part, but instead of doing a table reading, ad-libbed much of his dialogue, which was unprofessional, and the part went to Morgan instead. Afterward, the producers decided Christopher's quirky personality was a better fit for Mulcahy, so they brought him back, on the condition that he would stick with the script.
</li><li> Everybody knows that the IMF on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissionImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissionImpossible">Mission: Impossible</a></em> was always led by Peter Graves' Jim Phelps. Mostly forgotten is Dan Briggs, played by Steven Hill in the first season. Hill left the show (and temporarily, acting) for reasons that were partly religious, and his character was given the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherChuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherChuck">Brother Chuck</a> treatment.
<ul><li> Ironically, Hill would become the "Ringo" figure when he assumed his most famous role, DA Adam Schiff on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em>. The DA in the original pilot was Alfred Wentworth, played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoyThinnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoyThinnes">Roy Thinnes</a>; however, the pilot was filmed two years before the show was finally picked up by NBC, and Thinnes chose not to return as a regular.

Jackson was assigned to call play-by-play for MNF's first season in 1970 only to give way to Frank Gifford (who ABC Sports president Roone Arledge wanted from day 1; eventually bringing Gifford in as soon as his contract with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS">CBS</a> expired). Became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope">Zig Zagged Trope</a> for Jackson, who later would become most famous as the voice of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC">ABC</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CollegiateAmericanFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CollegiateAmericanFootball">college football</a> coverage.

Midway through Season 3, Schram ended up quitting the show due to a rumored contract dispute, resulting in Sharona being replaced for the rest of the show's run by Natalie Teeger, played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TraylorHoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TraylorHoward">Traylor Howard</a>. Downplayed in that Schram is often the more well-remembered of the two among general audiences, albeit Howard is the one more associated with the show by its fans.
</li><li> Tim Brooke-Taylor was an early member of what would eventually evolve into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MontyPython" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MontyPython">Monty Python</a>, alongside Graham Chapman, John Cleese, and Michael Palin, and made appearances in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AtLastThe1948Show" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AtLastThe1948Show">At Last the 1948 Show</a></em> and <em>How to Irritate People</em>. He left the group between the latter and the start of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus">Monty Python's Flying Circus</a></em> &mdash; by which time Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Terry Gilliam had arrived &mdash; though still went on to be a pretty successful actor in his own right.

She left the show after less than three months, however, and thereafter Pat Priest took over the role.
<ul><li> On the unaired 15-minute pilot episode, Eddie was played by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HappyDerman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HappyDerman">Happy Derman</a> and Lily was replaced by a character named Phoebe, who was portrayed by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoanMarshall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoanMarshall">Joan Marshall</a>. <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ButchPatrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ButchPatrick">Butch Patrick</a> replaced the former actor, while the latter was supplanted by the character Lily Munster, played by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YvonneDeCarlo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YvonneDeCarlo">Yvonne DeCarlo</a>.

However, Wall only worked for a few months, long before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMuppets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMuppets">The Muppets</a> had become big.

Weinstein left after only one season on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ComedyCentral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ComedyCentral">Comedy Central</a> and was replaced with Kevin Murphy and Frank Coniff respectively for Season 2, which was when the show starting to make it big and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">becoming really good</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters">MythBusters</a></em>:
<ul><li> While she filled a different role in the show in its original format, folklorist Heather Joseph-Witham became the Pete Best of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters">MythBusters</a></em>, effectively replaced by the Build Team as the show's focus shifted from the myths themselves to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGyvering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGyvering">MacGyvering</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">Stuff Blowing Up</a>.
</li><li> Scottie Chapman is another <em>MythBusters</em> example; she was originally the machinist of the Build Team, but left the show during Season 3, right around the time the Build Team's role on the show was expanded and they were added to the theme sequence and was replaced by Grant Imahara. While Scottie has made sporadic appearances since then (and the hosts/current producers have not been shy about showing flashbacks that prominently feature her), the regulars on the show have become far more famous.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyWifeAndKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyWifeAndKids">My Wife and Kids</a></em>: The original Claire, played by Jazz Raycole in the first season (only eleven episodes), is forgettable. The second Claire, played by Jennifer Freeman in seasons 2&#150;5, is much more recognizable.
</li><li> Believe it or not, Missy was not the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NedsDeclassifiedSchoolSurvivalGuide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NedsDeclassifiedSchoolSurvivalGuide">Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide</a></em>. The first season had a character named Bitsy, played by Spencer Locke, who filled a similar role.
</li><li> This happened quite often on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NightCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NightCourt">Night Court</a></em>. It was not until Season 4 that the show's lineup stabilized.
<ul><li> Karen Austin and Paula Kelly were only present during the first season before leaving, and their characters (Lana Wagner and Liz Williams, respectively) were quickly forgotten about. Austin has stated that she was let go due to being diagnosed with Bell's Palsy, and producers thought this would be an issue for filming. It has never been disclosed why Kelly left the show.
</li><li> In addition to the above two, there was Gail Strickland (who played the public defender in the pilot before being replaced by Kelly) and Ellen Foley (who was only in Season 2 because the producers were waiting for Markie Post to become available).
</li><li> The first two actresses playing the female bailiff were far more memorable but also had short-lived tenures on the show. <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SelmaDiamond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SelmaDiamond">Selma Diamond</a> portrayed Selma Hacker, who was replaced in Season 3 by Flo Kleiner played by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FlorenceHalop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FlorenceHalop">Florence Halop</a>.

However, in the first series, Rhys-Jones was nowhere to be seen and the Pete Best of the group was Chris Langham, a comic actor and writer who performed creditably but left at the end of the series citing artistic differences. He was replaced by Rhys-Jones only at the start of the second series. The fact Langham has since been convicted of crimes to do with indecent photographs of children has made it easier for the BBC to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson">airbrush his involvement out</a> of the series' official history.

Instead, Lucas' best friend was a contrasting character named Reagan (more tomboyish than Haley) portrayed by Samantha Shelton. All of the key scenes featuring Shelton as Reagan in the pilot were re-shot with Bethany Joy Lenz taking her place, although you can still see "Reagan" in the background scenes where she has no lines.

However, the character was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">widely disliked by the fans</a> for coming off as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGenericGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGenericGuy">bland</a> compared to the other characters while critics noted Schneider never seemed to quite a gel with the rest of the ensemble cast, his status as the odd man out only becoming more obvious when the show began <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">finding more of its own distinct identity</a> away from its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS">parent show</a>.

However, half of the original cast also makes up a portion of retroactive recognition - Captain Carl was played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilHartman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilHartman">Phil Hartman</a> (who had also helped create Pee Wee Herman) and Dixie was played by Johann Carlo.

However, it was later felt that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalDissonance">serious voice provided didn't match Jindrax' appearance</a> and Danny Wayne Stallcup (who was also Jindrax' suit actor) was given the role.
</li><li> The first series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobotWars">Robot Wars</a></em> was hosted by Jeremy Clarkson, much better known nowadays for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGearUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGearUK">Top Gear (UK)</a>.</em> He was replaced in Series 2 by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CraigCharles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CraigCharles">Craig Charles</a> (best known as Dave Lister on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em>) who was much better suited to both the material and the show format (Clarkson was known for being quite rude to the contestants and didn't really hold the show in high regard) and <em>Robot Wars</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">really took off after that.</a> Charles would remain the host of UK <em>Robot Wars</em> up until it went off the air after Series 7 and fans were quite upset when other commitments prevented him from returning as the host of the 2016 reboot series (hosted by Irish comedian Dara O Briain).
</li><li> Sal Barone played D.J. Conner in the pilot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne">Roseanne</a></em>. Then the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TVStrikes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TVStrikes">Writers' Strike</a> happened, during which he grew half an inch and couldn't be perceived as a 7-year-old kid anymore. He was replaced with Michael Fishman, who, besides being a bit younger, looked decidedly more like Roseanne than Sal did. There are also stories that Sal did not have a good relationship with Sara Gilbert.

But it was cut, and he went home, crying all the way back because he thought he'd just blown the only break he was ever going to get. He stuck with his standup career and eventually did get to be a regular ten years later.
</li><li> The show parodies Pete Best's story with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieMurphy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieMurphy">Eddie Murphy</a> as Clarence Walker, the saxophonist who's still bitter about being kicked out of the band.
</li><li> In the second episode of the 14th season, with Mathew Broderick as a guest, they make a parody of Albert Goldman, author of a controversial biography of John Lennon, which made this character (played by Phil Hartman) claim that he had been part of The Beatles and played trombone in the band before they reached the stardom, but was expelled by everyone present (both John, Paul, George, Ringo ... and Elvis) on considerations about his lack of talent and large build. In the end, Mr. Goldman threatened to take revenge eventually for that affront (it should be noted that this author wrote a polemic biography of Elvis, too).

</li><li> Canadian sketch comedy series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SCTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SCTV">SCTV</a></em> originally had a seven-person cast that included <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HaroldRamis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HaroldRamis">Harold Ramis</a>. Ramis only appeared in sketches for the first season and the first couple of episodes of season 2- after season 1, he chose to focus on writing before leaving the show entirely to help write <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnimalHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnimalHouse">Animal House</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Caddyshack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Caddyshack">He did</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters1984">all right for himself</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GroundhogDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GroundhogDay">though</a>.

Hal Miller took over from 1972-74.
<ul><li> In season three (1971-72), a bunch of new human characters was added. Luis is the only one <em>still</em> on the show. Maria continued to appear until season 45 (when <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SoniaManzano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SoniaManzano">Sonia Manzano</a> retired), David was on for more than a decade (before his actor <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NorthernCalloway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NorthernCalloway">Northern Calloway</a> ran into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">personal and health problems, then died</a>).

</li><li> Only two characters from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stargate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stargate">Stargate</a></em> retained their original actors<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1nwqe');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1nwqe" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1nwqe');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">specifically, Skaara and Kasuf, played by Alexis Cruz and Erick Avari</span> when the movie was adapted into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>.

Richard Dean Anderson, not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtRussell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtRussell">Kurt Russell</a>. Daniel Jackson? Michael Shanks, not James Spader.
<ul><li> Most people associate Torri Higginson with Dr. Elizabeth Weir since she played the role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>. However, in the character's first appearance on SG-1, Jessica Steen played her.
</li></ul></li><li> Jeffrey Hunter played Christopher Pike in the original pilot for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek</a></em>. The reception was thin for that first pilot, but NBC, in an unprecedented move at the time, let <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneRoddenberry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneRoddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a> produce a second pilot, replacing Hunter (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberOne">Number One</a>, played by Majel Barrett, who later played Nurse Christine Chapel in the series proper) with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner">William Shatner</a> as Captain Kirk, and folding much of the traits of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberOne">Number One</a> character into Leonard Nimoy's Spock. The rest, as they say, is history.
<ul><li> Despite being asked to return, Hunter didn't want to, and he used a loophole in his contract to get out of his role in the series. He would've had to star in the show if it was picked up after the first pilot, but since a second pilot was commissioned instead of a full season order, he was free to walk away.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3lebw');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3lebw" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3lebw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Ironically, since he died not much long afterward, the show probably did better without him.</span>
</li><li> Shatner claims in his memoirs that Hunter was manipulated into leaving by his girlfriend at the time, who was always on set complaining about how dumb the show made him look. The producers didn't like that situation much either, or by some accounts, they were planning to recast Pike anyway.
</li><li> The majority of the first pilot with Hunter was later incorporated in a memorable two-part episode, <em>The Menagerie</em>, in the show's first season, placing Pike firmly into the canon of the series. Pike would also be a major character in the series' motion picture reboot, played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceGreenwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceGreenwood">Bruce Greenwood</a>, and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery">Star Trek: Discovery</a></em>, played by Anson Mount.

You might see her on a <em>Trek</em> celebrity cruise, but apart from that, she's a bit player in the DVDs and doesn't join the roundtable discussions about the show. However, her character was revived for three time-travel plots, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheFinale">the series finale</a>. Crosby also got to play her own daughter thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">Timey Wimey</a> shenanigans.
<div class="indent">"For me, I was miserable. I couldn&#146;t wait to get off that show. I was dying.

Zenor was not picked for the second filming of the pilot, so actress Susan Lanier took over the role of Chrissy. Suzanne Somers won the permanent role in the third and final pilot.

Unfortunately, because of the legendary rapport Leno had with his replacement Kevin Eubanks (not as legendary as that between Johnny Carson and Doc Severinsen, or David Letterman and Paul Schaffer, but close), no one remembers that fact.

Griffin was a radio vet (as were some of the others) but she had difficulty adjusting to an on-camera role during rehearsals and quit just two weeks before the August 1 launch date.

<ul><li> The original host of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeatTheGeeks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeatTheGeeks">Beat the Geeks</a></em> was J. Keith van Straaten. He was replaced after the first season by Blaine Capatch, apparently because the producers thought van Straaten was not geeky enough. For some reason, original Music Geek Andy Zax, aka the Walking Encyclopedia of Music, was this after being fired and replaced near the middle of the first season. After two different replacements (Michael Jolly and Michael Farmer) proved inadequate, Zax returned to his rightful place.
</li><li> When <em>Dealer's Choice</em> debuted in January 1974, its host was Bob Hastings. He lasted only a few weeks before Jack Clark took over, mainly due to talking <strong>way</strong> too much for the editors' liking.
</li><li> Remember <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulLynde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulLynde">Paul Lynde</a>, that sassy gay guy who was the center square on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHollywoodSquares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHollywoodSquares">The Hollywood Squares</a></em> (minus a period from 1979-80)? Yes. Well, from 1966-68, there were various people in the center square, most notably (from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GSN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GSN">GSN</a> reruns of the 1968 nighttime show) Buddy Hackett.
</li><li> The UK classic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldenShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldenShot">The Golden Shot</a></em> (1967-75) was a huge hit with host Bob Monkhouse. His introduction was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">network's saving throw</a> after the show <strong>bombed</strong> under original host Jackie Rae.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGongShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGongShow">The Gong Show</a></em>.

</li><li> Art Fleming, the original host for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy">Jeopardy!</a></em>, is not as well known to newer generations as his successor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexTrebek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexTrebek">Alex Trebek</a> despite two Emmy nominations and a fairly long run as host (1964-1975, 1978-1979). However, this is mostly due to Trebek hosting for an even longer period &#151; his version has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">run continuously</a> since 1984. Also, as with <em>Wheel</em> below, most of Fleming's run has been erased.
<ul><li> In a literal case of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdAlEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdAlEffect">"Weird Al" Effect</a>, a lot of people only know about Fleming because he's mentioned in (and appeared in the video for) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a>'s "I Lost on Jeopardy".
</li><li> The Trebek version has its own version in the Clue Crew, a set of assistants who have regularly provided video-based clues since 2001. The longest-tenured are Jimmy McGuire and Sarah Whitcomb Foss. However, the original Clue Crew consisted of McGuire, Foss, Cheryl Farrell, and Sofia Lindskog. Lindskog left in 2004, with both Kelly Miyahara and Jon Cannon replacing her; Farrell left in 2008, Cannon in 2009, and Miyahara in 2019.
</li></ul></li><li> Jay Stewart is known for his long role as the announcer/sidekick on the original incarnation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LetsMakeADeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LetsMakeADeal">Let's Make a Deal</a></em> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>. However, Wendell Niles announced the first season of the original show's 1963-77 run instead.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lingo">Lingo</a></em> is most well-known by Americans for its 2002-07 run on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GSN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GSN">GSN</a> with iconic host Chuck Woolery (and the short-lived dirty-minded 2011 reboot hosted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillEngvall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillEngvall">Bill Engvall</a>), it actually began as a Ralph Andrews production from 1987-88, hosted originally by Michael Reagan (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan">Ronald Reagan</a>'s son) and later (the last five weeks) by Andrews himself.
<ul><li> The GSN version itself has an example. There was no hostess or announcer in the first season. Season 2 had Randy Thomas (best known as the voice of Hooked on Phonics commercials) as the announcer, but no hostess. In Season 3, Stacey Hayes joined as a hostess (with modeling assistance from Paula Cobb on the first two taped episodes) while also taking over as announcer, before Shandi Finessey took over the hostess/announcer role for the rest of the run.
</li></ul></li><li> Brett Somers and Charles Nelson Reilly didn't appear on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MatchGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MatchGame">Match Game</a></em> until a few weeks into the run when they almost immediately became regular panelists. They stayed for the next nine years, except for a few weeks when Charles was busy with other projects and a few times when Brett was unavailable. This is a curious case, as they didn't Pete Best any individual people; they just became mostly-permanent panelists alongside Richard Dawson (who would later leave after he got the hosting gig on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyFeud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyFeud">Family Feud</a></em>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNewlywedGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNewlywedGame">The Newlywed Game</a></em>'s original announcer was Scott Beach, who was apparently fired for singing anti-war songs to the audience during commercial breaks. He was replaced by Johnny Jacobs, who held the role until his death in the early 80's, and racked up several more announcing gigs, primarily for <em>Newlywed</em> creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckBarris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckBarris">Chuck Barris</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackBarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackBarry">Jack Barry</a>-Dan Enright productions.
</li><li> The original version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight">The Price Is Right</a></em> ran on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC">NBC</a> from 1956-63 and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC">ABC</a> from 1963-65, hosted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCullen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCullen">Bill Cullen</a>. It isn't brought up too often nowadays.
<ul><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkGoodson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkGoodson">Mark Goodson</a> wanted to revive <em>Price</em> in 1972, he had a clear set up in mind: weekly syndication, hosted by Dennis James and distributed by Viacom. Once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS">CBS</a> got wind of the revival, Bud Grant approached Goodson about doing a daytime show with Bob Barker as emcee. Barker wanted no part of it, not like those in charge of the revival, and begged Grant for another game show; Grant declined, which suggests that Barker's alleged backstage tyranny was payback for having the show forced on him.
</li><li> As for James, he did nighttime <em>Price</em> until 1977, when his contract expired, and Barker took over until its end in 1980. His version, along with those of Tom Kennedy (1985-86) and Doug Davidson (1994-95), are ignored in every way.
</li></ul></li><li> For the first few years of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhatsMyLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhatsMyLine">What's My Line?</a></em>, Hal "Dimples" Block was a regular panelist. As the show progressed it became increasingly dignified and refined, and Block's loutish persona soon became undesirable and his seat was permanently replaced by Bennett Cerf. To add insult to injury, most of Block's run is lost due to the films being destroyed for their silver content after the episodes ran once on live TV.
</li><li> When it started on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC">NBC</a>'s daytime lineup in 1975, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune">Wheel of Fortune</a></em> was hosted by Chuck Woolery and Susan Stafford. Chuck was replaced by Pat Sajak in December 1981, followed by the iconic hostess Vanna White taking Susan's place exactly a year later. Pat and Vanna successfully made the transition to nighttime syndication in 1983, and still hold those roles to this day, although Pat relinquished his daytime duties two years before that version ended in 1991. This also led to a reverse Pete Best situation with his daytime successors (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague">Rolf Benirschke</a> for a few months, then Bob Goen after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop">Channel Hop</a> to CBS), as their runs on daytime are comparatively lesser-known.
<ul><li> Interestingly, Woolery zig-zags this trope, as he is well-known for hosting <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrabble">Scrabble</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoveConnection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoveConnection">Love Connection</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Greed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Greed">Greed</a></em>, and the aforementioned <em>Lingo</em>, but his <em>Wheel</em> tenure is comparatively less known. It doesn't help that most of his run has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">erased</a>. He is also a further zig-zag, as he hosted the very first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pilot">pilot</a> in 1973 (under the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingTitle">Working Title</a> <em>Shopper's Bazaar</em>), while Edd "Kookie" Byrnes hosted the second and third pilots.
</li><li> Original announcer Charlie O'Donnell managed to Pete Best <em>himself</em>. He was the original announcer for the show from the second and third pilots until 1980 when he left due to the show getting a cancellation that was later overturned. He was replaced by Jack Clark, whose voice is the one that many think of when they think of early <em>Wheel</em>. Clark died in 1988 and was replaced by M. G. Kelly for just under a season before Charlie returned in 1989. (Charlie died in 2010, and Jim Thornton replaced him.)
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope">Zig Zagged</a> with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhoWantsToBeAMillionaire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhoWantsToBeAMillionaire">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</a></em>. Meredith Vieira hosted the show for 11 seasons in syndication, versus only 3 on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC">ABC</a> for original host Regis Philbin; however, the ABC version was explosively popular and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToBeWhoWantsToBeAMillionaire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToBeWhoWantsToBeAMillionaire">spawned a legion of tropes that revived the then-flagging game show field</a>, so Regis is still seen by many as the most iconic host of the show. (After Meredith left in 2013, she was replaced by Cedric the Entertainer, then Terry Crews, then Chris Harrison.) In addition, all four hosts are known in varying capacities for something other than <em>Millioniare</em> (Regis for the aforementioned <em>Live!</em>; Meredith for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheView" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheView">The View</a></em>; Cedric for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSteveHarveyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSteveHarveyShow">The Steve Harvey Show</a></em>; Crews for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EverybodyHatesChris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EverybodyHatesChris">Everybody Hates Chris</a></em>, and Harrison as host of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBachelor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBachelor">The Bachelor</a></em>).
</li><li> <em>Pole Chudes</em>, a Russian copycat of <em>Wheel</em> of sorts, has a downplayed case of this. The show is associated with Leonid Yakubovich, who hosts it since 1991. The position of the host was handed over to Yakubovich by Vlad Listyev, who started <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PCh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PCh">P Ch</a></em> and hosted it for about a year. However, Listyev himself was one of the most influential figures on Russian television (if not the most), being the founding member of VID television company (famous for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanityPlate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanityPlate">'Mask of Doom' logo</a>) and the first CEO of the first Russian non-state-owned networks, all of which keeps him from being totally forgotten.

<ul><li> This phenomenon can also happen when a movie is adapted for a television series; for instance, more people recognize Sarah Michelle Gellar as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a> than they do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Kristy Swanson</a>.
</li><li> Alan Alda is more identified as Hawkeye Pierce than Donald Sutherland. This goes for most of the cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Mash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Mash">M*A*S*H</a></em>. This is helped by the fact that most of the TV cast of <em>M*A*S*H</em> faces a certain amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotSpock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotSpock">I Am Not Spock</a> while many of the actors from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mash">film</a> are famous in their own right.
</li><li> Similar to the <em>Buffy</em> example above, how many people remember <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtRussell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtRussell">Kurt Russell</a> as Jack O'Neil in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stargate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stargate">Stargate</a></em> as opposed to Richard Dean Anderson's Jack O'Neil<strong>l</strong> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>?
<ul><li> O'Neill himself does. When spelling his name in one episode he mentions that there's also a Jack O'Neil who is far grumpier. On the other hand, many people can go from James Spader in the movie to Michael Shanks at the beginning of the series and not notice the change in the actor.
</li></ul></li><li> Gummo Marx was a member of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarxBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarxBrothers">Marx Brothers</a>' vaudeville act, but he quit around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>.

Culley was replaced in the team because too many fans recognized him from his former role and chanted "Moondog" for him. His distinctive mustache didn't help matters (and really made the Demolition facepaint look silly on him). It should be noted that the gimmick was Culley's idea in the first place, so he got kicked out of his own creation only to see it reach stardom.

The Midnight Express was originally formed in a promotion called Southeastern Championship Wrestling as a three-man team consisting of Austin, Rose, and Dennis Condrey.

Condrey was in turn replaced a couple of years later by Stan Lane, and it's debated among fans to this day whether the Condrey/Eaton or Eaton/Lane version of the team was better. Rose eventually rejoined Condrey and they feuded with Eaton and Lane over who was the "real" Midnight Express, but Rose gets little recognition compared to Condrey Lane and Eaton, and Austin is a footnote.

<ul><li> The four major North American pro sports leagues all had numerous franchises in their early years that went defunct. The Akron Pros, Canton Bulldogs, Cleveland Bulldogs, Frankford Yellow Jackets, Providence Steam Roller (all NFL), Baltimore Bullets (NBA)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5v2r4');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5v2r4" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5v2r4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame">not to be confused with</a> the Baltimore Bullets team that's now known as the Washington Wizards</span> and Montreal Maroons (NHL) all had the distinction of winning league championships before going under.
</li><li> The Ottawa Senators are a subversion. The original Senators teams won 11 Stanley Cups in the early 1900s, their last one coming in 1927, before, like the Maroons, going bankrupt and folding. Therefore, the Senators would've been a straight example until 1992, when a new Ottawa team, also called the Senators, started playing, making the original teams somewhat notable again (in fact, the current Senators team even has the Stanley Cup banners from the original Senators championships hanging from the rafters). Technically speaking, the Sens do play the trope straight, since they were considered a brand-new team when they arrived in 1992 and not an official continuation of the old team.
</li><li> In the NHL there were many teams that qualify for this trope. Aside from the famed "original six" The early NHL had many notable teams such as the senators who spent their last few seasons in St. Louis, several Montreal based teams that attempted to compete with the Canadians, The Quebec Bulldogs, The Hamilton Tigers, The Brooklyn/New York Americans(the last of the nonoriginal six teams to leave the league), and the Pittsburgh Pirates/Philadelphia Quakers. When the Original Six finally decided to allow new teams into the NHL (after some pressure during TV negotiations) St. Lois, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh were among the first to join the league with new franchises, but none of them are continuations of the old teams. Quebec City and Hamilton are the last remaining old NHL cities with no NHL hockey yet but are often considered as expansion/relocation destinations. So, one day this trope will be averted for all the old NHL teams.
</li><li> In American intercollegiate sports, most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CollegiateAmericanFootballConferences" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CollegiateAmericanFootballConferences">"Power Five" conferences</a> (the top 5 leagues who have automatic bids in the top tier of football bowl games) trace their roots to the late 19th/early 20th centuries, when college sports conferences were still loose affiliations of regional schools. When college sports started becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a>, some schools elected to de-emphasize their athletics programs and dropped out of what would eventually become the Power Five leagues. Some are now members of the NCAA's lower profile divisions, others are in "Group of Five" Division I leagues. The most famous example is The University of Chicago leaving the Big Ten in 1946. Tulane and The University of The South (aka Sewanee) were founding members of the Southeastern Conference. Idaho and Montana were in what eventually evolved into the Pac-12. And the two forerunners of the current Big 12 (The Big 8 and Southwest Conferences) once counted Drake, Grinnell, Southwestern University, Washington University of St. Louis, and the since-closed Phillips University as members.
</li><li> On 2 June 1925, New York Yankees first baseman Wally Pipp was benched for a game against the Washington Senators that came after a five-game losing streak.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6bor8');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6bor8" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6bor8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> A popular urban legend is that Pipp was suffering from a migraine at the time.</span> The guy who takes over for him? None other than Lou Gehrig.
</li><li> This has happened to several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague">National Football League</a> quarterbacks. To note some of the more prominent examples (in chronological order):
<ul><li> Quarterback Craig Morton had the unfortunate situation of being the Pete Best to <em>two</em> superstar quarterbacks. He brought the Dallas Cowboys to Super Bowl V, where they lost to the Baltimore Colts. After that, he was gradually replaced by backup quarterback Roger Staubach and finally moved on to other teams. Morton eventually managed to revive his career with the Denver Broncos, leading them to Super Bowl XII, where they lost to...the Dallas Cowboys, led by Staubach. He eventually retired from football with the Broncos, just in time to be replaced by a young rookie named John Elway...
</li><li> In 1992, when then Packers-star Don Majkowski was injured, he was subsequently replaced by a little known former 2nd round pick from a small Mississippi college...who would then go on to start over 300 straight games, set most NFL passing career passing records, and enter the Hall of Fame on his first ballot. That quarterback's name? <em>Brett Favre</em>.
</li><li> In 1999, the St. Louis Rams acquired Trent Green from the Washington Redskins and slated him as their starter. However, Green went down with a knee injury before the season even started. His backup - a former Arena League quarterback with eleven career NFL pass attempts - took over for Green. Kurt Warner would wind up leading "The Greatest Show on Turf" to a Super Bowl title that season and would have a brief but stellar career that landed him in the Hall of Fame. Fortunately for Green, his career would rebound after being shipped to the Kansas City Chiefs.
</li><li> Then, a few years later in 2001, Patriots star Drew Bledsoe (who'd just signed a <em>massive</em> contract) was injured after taking a brutal hit which caused internal bleeding in a game against the division rival NY Jets. They then turned to this untested <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn">sixth-round pick</a> named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBrady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBrady">Tom Brady</a>...
<ul><li> This actually happened to poor Bledsoe, who was a great QB in his own right, <em>twice</em>, as he was benched midway through what ended up being his final season in the league for a 2nd-year <em>undrafted free agent</em> by the name of Tony Romo - while a less dramatic example than Brady, this occurred in 2006 and, after a nearly decade-long period of post-Troy Aikman<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7kg27');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note7kg27" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7kg27');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">a Hall of Fame QB who led the Cowboys to three Super Bowl wins in the 90s</span> QB woes, Romo would go on to be the Cowboys' starting QB for almost a decade and set most of their franchise career passing records.
</li></ul></li><li> The same example happened with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Tommy Maddox, who started thirty-one of the team's thirty-two games in 2002 and 2003, got injured and the rookie Ben Roethlisberger took over. The result? An undefeated season in 2004, losing only to Tom Brady, and two Super Bowl wins in the 2005 and 2008 seasons. Unfortunately for Maddox, unlike some of the other quarterbacks on this list who would at least move on to start for other teams, Maddox would never again land a starting job in the NFL.
</li></ul></li><li> In a more general sense, any non-superstar player who held a certain starting position before being replaced (due to injury, retirement, or just poor play) with a superstar. Bonus points if the replaced player was clearly <em>good</em>, or even a star in his/her own right. This obviously does not apply if the player was able to make enough of a name for themselves to be remembered even after being replaced.
</li><li> People often argue that Tony Dungy was this for the 2002-03 Tampa Bay Buccaneers team that won Super Bowl XXXVII - coached by Jon Gruden. Dungy had been there several years and assembled most of the talent on that team before playoff frustration and disagreements with management over his coaching philosophy cost him his job. Dungy landed on his feet, though - that same offseason, he took a job with the Indianapolis Colts, who had a then 26-year-old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeytonManning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeytonManning">Peyton Manning</a> at quarterback. The Colts would go on to a sustained run of success under Dungy, and a Super Bowl XLI championship.
</li><li> Isiah Thomas, well-known as the star of the Detroit Pistons during the "Bad Boys" era of the late 1980s-early 1990s (and before that known as the star of Indiana's 1981 NCAA champions), is more well-known now for being snubbed by the Dream Team before the 1992 Summer Olympics, possibly due to his rivalry with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MichaelJordan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MichaelJordan">Michael Jordan</a>.
</li><li> Manchester United's first pinnacle of success was winning the European title in 1968. But the retirement of legendary manager Sir Matt Busby was followed by the catastrophe of relegation from the topflight a mere five years later. United was not fated to win the English league title for another twenty-three years. It is often forgotten - especially after Sir Alex Ferguson's stellar period as manager - that a lot of the work that needed to be done to make United credible contenders again was achieved during those 23 years by managers like Tommy Docherty and Ron Atkinson, who in their own right would have been acclaimed as great managers had they not been eclipsed by Ferguson's stellar achievement. Alex Ferguson inherited a club in great health with a roster of impressive young players, testament to Atkinson.
</li><li> One main reason why the Golden State Warriors have been very successful nowadays (especially when compared to past Warriors teams) is the coaching genius of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SteveKerr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SteveKerr">Steve Kerr</a>, particularly his offensive system based on unselfish passing, three-point shooting, and the pick-and-roll. A huge part of success, though, can be credited to the previous coach Mark Jackson, who improved the Dubs' defense (which was their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">greatest weakness</a> back when they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">the NBA's laughingstock</a>).
<ul><li> In the same vein, a lot of people credit the Warriors' success to the three-point shooting of "Splash Brothers" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/StephenCurry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/StephenCurry">Stephen Curry</a> and Klay Thompson, the gritty versatility of Draymond Green, and (later) the sheer talent of new addition Kevin Durant. However, the first star of the Dubs' successful era (and the precedent of the big names mentioned above) was David Lee, who was the Warriors' best player back when Curry was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">injury-prone</a>, Thompson was considered a relative disappointment for a Lottery Pick, Green was either a reserve (or, pre-2012, playing at Michigan State), and Durant was still part of the OKC Thunder. In true Pete Best fashion, Lee's status as the Dubs' star ended with his injury in 2014, which catapulted Draymond Green to the starting lineup and turned the Dubs into the NBA's most feared team (alongside the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">lights-out shooting of Curry and Thompson</a>).
</li></ul></li><li> Younger fans might not be aware that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ESPN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ESPN">ESPN</a> aired most of the first round <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Basketball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Basketball">NCAA Tournament</a> games until 1991, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS">CBS</a> snagged the rights for the entire tournament. ESPN's coverage was a significant factor in popularizing the tournament and ESPN itself.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts">Mixed Martial Arts</a>: Plenty of MMA fighters had their best years before the boom of Mixed Martial Arts.:
<ul><li> Some early pioneers, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DanSevern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DanSevern">Dan Severn</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KenShamrock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KenShamrock">Ken Shamrock</a>, left the sport for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling">Professional Wrestling</a> to make money, only to return later when MMA paychecks improved.
</li><li> Igor Vovchanchyn is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeteBest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeteBest">The Pete Best</a> to fighters like Fedor Emelianenko and Mirko Cro Cop. He was the first kickboxer to have sustained success against grappling artists in the mid-nineties, was universally feared as a striker in the late nineties and got a scary number of victories over established names. However, because his success happened in the "Dark Ages" of MMA, only hardcore fans remember him.
</li><li> Jose "Pele" Landi-Jons is a fighter active from the mid-nineties to the present day, skilled in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuayThai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuayThai">Muay Thai</a>. His body shape and style are both almost identical to that of legendary former UFC middleweight champion Anderson Silva, and in fact, he trained Silva at one point and had a real-life enmity with him. Almost no one knows who "Pele" is (not the least because his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame">name</a> makes him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeteBest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeteBest">The Pete Best</a> in another way), while Silva has had much more success and is regarded as one of the pound-for-pound best fighters in the world.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BasRutten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BasRutten">Bas Rutten</a> dominated the Pancrase organization, won the UFC heavyweight championship, and retired before MMA ever went mainstream. However, he's made quite a name for himself for his commentating and commentary, as well as his infamous <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8mBe0_Ha78">self-defense tapes<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> Wallid Ismail was an early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BrazilianJiuJitsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BrazilianJiuJitsu">Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</a> sensation, winning championships and becoming one of the first "professional" BJJ competitors<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note809ao');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note809ao" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note809ao');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In his famous fight against Royce, he was wearing a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.bjjee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wallid-royce.gif">Gi full of sponsored patches<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>. He was one of the first to get sponsor money by winning tournaments.</span> In 1992, he dueled and won Ralph Gracie (which was trained specifically to defeat him and end his streak) in the <em>Mundial</em> and in 1993 he defeated Renzo Gracie, he then challenged Royce Gracie for a fight, which he accepted in 1998 under "special conditions" (no time limit or point system, only winning by submission), he would then win by choking Royce out with a "Rel&oacute;gio" (or Clock Choke). For that, he became known as the "Gracie Hunter" years before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KazushiSakuraba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KazushiSakuraba">Kazushi Sakuraba</a>. He also became a figure on the early Vale Tudo scene, competing in IVC (International Vale Tudo Championship), UFC, and PRIDE. Even appearing at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AntonioInoki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AntonioInoki">Antonio Inoki</a>'s UFO, Bom-Ba-Ye, and even doing cameos at NJPW, and founded Jungle Fight, Brazil, and South America's largest MMA promotion. All of this happened before MMA went mainstream.
</li><li> Jens Pulver started fighting in 1999, was the UFC's first-ever lightweight championship, and, for eight years, was the only person who ever defeated BJ Penn at lightweight. However, when UFC really hit the mainstream Pulver's suspect chin and defensive grappling were used against him multiple times, culminating in a two-year, six-fight losing streak. Unfortunately, most modern fans only remember the tail end of his career, which has consisted of him getting punched out or submitted.
</li><li> Before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KazushiSakuraba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KazushiSakuraba">Kazushi Sakuraba</a> made a name by hunting down BJJ fighters with his shoot wrestling abilities, fellow shooter Rumina Sato had already achieved that feat in at least two occasions, submitting Ricardo Botelho and John Lewis. However, Sato's lack of exposure (occasioned by his refusal to fight outside of Shooto until he gained a title) made him almost unknown to western audiences.

<ul><li> A common occurrence for many modern Broadway shows is for them to start Off-Broadway, then if they find success there, moving to Broadway, typically with most of the original cast and crew. The cast members who are replaced always become this, especially if theirs is the performance immortalized on the cast recording:
<ul><li> Brian d'Arcy James, who originated the role of Dan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/NextToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/NextToNormal">Next to Normal</a></em> Off-Broadway, was the only cast member to not move with the show to Broadway, being replaced by J. Robert Spencer, who promptly got a Tony nomination and a whole lot of notoriety.
<ul><li> Another Brian d'Arcy James example: few people seem to remember that he originated the role of King George III in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamilton">Hamilton</a></em> while it was off-Broadway. He was replaced by the much more celebrated Jonathan Groff once the show moved onto Broadway.
</li></ul></li><li> Contrary to widespread belief, Andrea McArdle was <em>not</em> the first to play <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Annie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Annie">Annie</a></em> in the musical. She <em>was</em> the first Broadway Annie, and replaced Kristin Vigard, who played her in the Goodspeed Opera House previews before the show went to Broadway.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/DearEvanHansen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/DearEvanHansen">Dear Evan Hansen</a></em>: The role of Alana was played by Alexis Molnar when the show premiered in Washington, DC. She was replaced by Kristolyn Lloyd when the show opened off-Broadway and subsequently moved to Broadway, and Kristolyn is the one featured in all the show's Broadway hype and publicity alongside the rest of the original cast.
</li></ul></li><li> Jules Bledsoe introduced "Ol' Man River" as Joe in the original Broadway production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ShowBoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ShowBoat">Show Boat</a></em>. Paul Robeson would play that part (which consists of little more than the famous song and its reprises) in the 1928 London production, the 1932 Broadway revival, and the 1936 film version (for which he got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovieBonusSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovieBonusSong">Movie Bonus Song</a>). Robeson was the most famous black dramatic actor of his day, and Bledsoe was not a good actor, so it's no wonder whose performance was regarded as definitive.

</li><li> Paul Hecht originated the role of John Dickinson in the musical <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SeventeenSeventySix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SeventeenSeventySix">1776</a></em> - but it was Donald Madden, who took over the role on Broadway, who went on to star in the film version and create the definitive Dickinson. The same thing happened with John Cullum, the third Rutledge on Broadway, who played the role the longest and went on to recreate the role for the film.
</li><li> An interesting example is the role of Sally in <em>You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown</em>. The original 1967 production didn't even feature the character, with Patty (not Peppermint Patty) instead. Patty eventually got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a> in the <em>Peanuts</em> universe, and by the time of the 1999 Broadway production was forgotten. She was replaced with Sally, who was a good fit for Kristin Chenoweth, complete with an extremely catchy solo, and she won the Supporting Actress Tony. Meanwhile, Patty's been nearly forgotten.

There were no less than <em>three</em> sets of performers handling clown duties before him: Wayne Hronek (who created the act and taught it to Dewhurst), Alex El Sobrino, and Alfredo et Adrenaline (a male-female duo who presented a completely different act in 1995-96). <em>Mystere</em> has never been filmed in its entirety, and its making-of documentary didn't come along until Dewhurst's tenure, so very little footage of Hronek's version of the act exists, and none at all of the other two.

Jones, who was the producer of the game, was the only founder remaining. Sam and Dan Houser, who founded Rockstar Games, actually started to work in the franchise with the first expansion, <em>London 1969</em>, but sometime after the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto2">Grand Theft Auto 2</a></em>, Jones decided to leave and found Realtime Worlds, leaving the Houser brothers with DMA and developing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIII">Grand Theft Auto III</a></em>, which would be a massive success and a game-changer in the market, making the original founders, especially Jones, forgotten.

Around the same time, he started having increasing concerns over Bethesda's changing corporate culture in the latter half of the 90's, so he eventually tendered his resignation from the company in 1998, citing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeDifferences" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeDifferences">Creative Differences</a>, but still made some small contributions to <em>Morrowind</em> at the behest of his good friend and Bethesda founder Christopher Weaver.

And prior to that, the show was merely a 1992 college project named "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Whoopass</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Stew</a>" with all the girls voiced by Jennifer Fried, and instead of the as-of-yet iconic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomKenny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomKenny">Tom Kenny</a> as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LemonyNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LemonyNarrator">Narrator</a>'s voice, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CraigMcCracken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CraigMcCracken">Craig McCracken</a> himself provided the voice for his own production. In addition, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ErnieAnderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ErnieAnderson">Ernie Anderson</a> was the narrator in the WAC shorts, but he had passed away by the time the TV series was greenlit, and Kenny was cast.
</li><li> In his first appearance, Gangrene Gang memner Lil' Arturo was voiced by Carlos Alazraqui. Tom Kenny voices him in all subsequent episodes.
</li><li> In a non-voice acting example, Townsville had a completely different mayor in the first WAC short. The character in that episode appeared to be modeled after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton">Bill Clinton</a> and was voiced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimCummings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimCummings">Jim Cummings</a>. The classic Mayor (voiced by Tom Kenny) and Miss Bellum replaced him in the main TV show. This is also an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Art Evolution</a> as the earlier mayor had a more realistic look compared to the classic mayor, who's as stylized as the girls themselves.
</li></ul></li><li> The animated adaptations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield">Garfield</a></em> have two examples:
<ul><li> Garfield's original voice was not Lorenzo Music. In the very first animation that aired on <em>The Fantastic Funnies</em> (1980), adapting five newspaper strips, Garfield was voiced by Scott Beach. Music became Garfield's voice starting with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldSpecials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldSpecials">Here Comes Garfield</a></em>.
</li><li> While Thom Huge <em>did</em> voice Jon Arbuckle in <em>The Fantastic Funnies</em>, the role was handed over to Sandy Kenyon for <em>Here Comes Garfield</em>, the first of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldSpecials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldSpecials">Garfield Specials</a>. Huge returned for the rest of the animated specials through <em>Garfield Gets a Life</em> in 1991, along with the entirety of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends">Garfield and Friends</a></em> (1988-1994).
</li></ul></li><li> Most people remember Jeremy Shada as the voice of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em>'s Finn even though he took over, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAgedWithTheActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAgedWithTheActor">ironically enough</a>, just as his brother Zach was going through puberty years after he recorded for the <em>Random! Cartoons</em> version.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em>: Alfred was voiced by Clive Revil (who seems have a habit of being this) in the first three episodes "On Leather Wings", "Christmas With the Joker" and "Never Fear". Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. took over for the rest of the series and its spinoffs.
</li><li> Jack Mercer was not the original voice of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Popeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Popeye">Popeye</a></em>. That honor goes to William Costello, who was the sailor man's voice actor for his first two years before Mercer took over afterward, supplying Popeye's voice for the majority of the remainder of his shorts and continuing to do so for all appearances afterward until his death in 1984.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants">Spongebob Squarepants</a></em> has several examples from its Latin American Spanish dub:
<ul><li> Spongebob himself was voiced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KaihiamalMartinez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KaihiamalMartinez">Kaihiamal Mart&iacute;nez</a> in the first season, after which he was one of several voice actors who were fired from the dubbing company, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EtceteraGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EtceteraGroup">Etcetera Group</a>, after a pay dispute. Because of this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LuisCarreno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LuisCarreno">Luis Carre&ntilde;o</a> replaced him, and he continues to voice the role to this day (even after moving to Miami).
</li><li> &Oacute;scar Zuloaga voiced Plankton until the Christmas special <em>Cristmas Who?</em>. From <em>Welcome to the Chum Bucket</em> to <em>Squirrel Record</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LuisMiguelPerez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LuisMiguelPerez">Luis Miguel P&eacute;rez</a> would voice him and become associated with the role.
</li><li> Karen was usually voiced by Melanie Henr&iacute;quez until her retirement, and by Gabriela Bel&eacute;n since then, but her voice actress in the first season was actually Rocio Mallo, who had to quit the role after moving to Mexico (she has since moved back to Venezuela).
</li><li> Sandy was originally voiced by Mercedes Prato but was fired for the same reasons as Mart&iacute;nez, leading her more famous successor Anabella Silva (as well as Yaraivi Alcedo, Lidia Abautt, and Lileana Chac&oacute;n) to take over.
</li><li> Most people remember Juan Guzm&aacute;n as the French Narrator, as well as the voice reading the signs in Spanish, but he actually replaced Orlando Noguera in both after he moved to Mexico (Noguera would later move again to Miami, where he continues to do voiceover work).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CliffordTheBigRedDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CliffordTheBigRedDog">Clifford the Big Red Dog</a> was not originally voiced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRitter">John Ritter</a>. In a series of direct-to-video specials from the late '80s, Brent Titcomb provided his voice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PorkyPig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PorkyPig">Porky Pig</a> was originally voiced by Joe Dougherty, with Porky's stutter being shared by Dougherty in real-life. Unfortunately, Dougherty's stutter was actually a little <em>too</em> pronounced, resulting in recording sessions taking three or four times longer than normal for a cartoon, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrizFreleng" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrizFreleng">Friz Freleng</a> eventually being forced to replace him with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelBlanc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelBlanc">Mel Blanc</a> in order to avoid being fired for running up excessive tape and studio costs.
</li><li> Elmer Fudd &mdash; or his prototype, Egghead &mdash; was originally voiced by Danny Webb, and later recast with Arthur Q. Bryan around the same time the character evolved to his definitive version.

His 10% ownership in the company would be worth over $220 billion today... if he hadn't sold his shares back to the Steves 12 days into the partnership for $800.

</li><li> The supermarket chain Waitrose was started by three men &mdash; Waite, Rose, and Taylor. Taylor left after a couple of years, and the business was renamed after the remaining two.
</li><li> Sears, <em>Roebuck</em> &amp; Co. Roebuck's name isn't even on the sign anymore. Historically, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/2840.html">he had to retire earlier than expected due to ill health.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Though, in Roebuck's favor, "Roebuck &amp; Co." is now a Sears clothing brand and one of the store's more popular products.
</li><li> Dow Jones &amp; Company was founded by Charles Dow, Edward Jones... and Charles Bergstresser. What makes this example particularly unfair is that he was the chief financier for the new company and he came up with the name <em>"<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanNewspapers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanNewspapers">The Wall Street Journal</a>"</em>. However, it was his decision to become a silent partner, so his name never appeared on the company's name. Still, it's subverted since his influence is still expressed by the publication (such as during its <a class="urllink" href="https://news.lafayette.edu/2014/07/11/wall-street-journal-discusses-co-founder-charles-bergstresser-class-of-1881/">125th anniversary<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>).
</li><li> MGM Studios was created by merging three earlier production companies: Metro, Goldwyn, and (L. B.) Mayer. The Goldwyn company in turn had gotten its name from its two founders, Samuel Goldfish and Edgar Selwyn. By the time the company merged into MGM, Sam Goldfish had long since parted ways with Selwyn to set up as an independent producer ... after changing his own name to Goldwyn.
</li><li> Alexandria was part of the District of Columbia until 1846, when its residents successfully petitioned Congress to cede the land back to Virginia.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Monaco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Monaco">Monaco</a>, now the second-smallest country on the planet by land area, was slightly larger for most of its history. But in 1848 the French Riviera towns of Menton and Roquebrune seceded from Monaco over taxation issues. Monaco's current fame as a playground for the wealthy derives from the casino at Monte Carlo, which was built as a way for the country to earn back the revenue it lost from the secession.

(Many hands go up.) Who remembers the earlier GE P40DC which was intended as the F40PH's successor? (Very few hands remain up.) Anybody remember the EMD SDP40F, the F40PH's predecessor? (Even fewer hands remain up.) Who remembers the GE P30CH, the F40PH's GE counterpart? (Just a few hands remain up.)
</li><li> Most people know of the Sesame Place theme park in Pennsylvania, but even fewer remember the failed attempt at a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WestCoastTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WestCoastTeam">west coast version</a> in Irving, Texas in the early 1980s.
</li><li> David Blair, a White Star Line officer who was originally planned to be Second Officer on the fateful voyage of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RMSTitanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RMSTitanic">RMS Titanic</a></em> with William Murdoch and Charles Lightoller as the Chief Officer and First Officer respectively. Captain Smith wanted Henry Wilde as his Chief Officer which bumped Murdoch and Lightoller down a rank and reassigned Blair out of the voyage. (The Junior Officers kept their positions.) This last-minute change might have saved Blair's life but also resulted in the infamous "forgot to leave the keys to the lookout's binoculars" incident.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS">CBS</a> was originally known as the Columbia Phonograph Broadcasting System, a unit of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColumbiaRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColumbiaRecords">Columbia Phonograph Company</a>. After Columbia Records sold off the fledgling radio network, it became known as the Columbia Broadcasting System. In 1974, the company became known simply as CBS, without actual meaning. Ironically, CBS bought Columbia Phonograph's successor, American Recording Corporation, in 1938, and the record company became known as Columbia Records. In 1987, CBS sold Columbia Records to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sony">Sony</a>, with the purchase completed early in 1988. As Sony had a short-term license on the CBS name, the record company was eventually rechristened as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonyMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonyMusic">Sony Music Entertainment</a> in 1991.

That's pretty much all he's known for now. The fact that his powers were largely the same as the Beast probably didn't help his case. Although Sunfire fits the trope even better, since he voluntarily left the team in the issue immediately following the first adventure.
</li><li> Back when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XStatix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XStatix">X-Statix</a> was still called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XForce">X-Force</a>, they had an entirely different lineup. Of that lineup, only U-Go Girl and Anarchist survived the first issue. And they weren't even the original lineup! The average X-Forcer had a very short life expectancy. It didn't help that their crazy, amoral sponsor Spike Freeman preferred that the team have a high turnover rate

<ul><li> Alex Wilder could be an example as well, as his unofficial replacement Victor Mancha not only is more well known thanks to his ties to the greater Marvel Universe (he's the son of <em>Ultron</em>, making him the brother of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheVision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheVision">The Vision</a>, a well-known member of the Avengers) but he proved to be far more popular as well.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRocker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRocker">The Rocker</a></em> The whole plot revolves around this trope. Rainn Wilson plays Robert "Fish" Fishman, the drummer in an 80's glammetal band called Vesuvius. When his band gets signed, Fish gets dropped in favor of their producer's nephew. Despite his swearing to become even bigger than they do, he fails, until more than 20 years later when his nephew asks him to fill in for the drummer for his band, and they manage to hit it big, thanks largely to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> and a series of videos entitled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity">The Naked Drummer</a></em>.
