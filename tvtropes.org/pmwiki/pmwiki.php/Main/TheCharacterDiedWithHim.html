</p><p>In other words, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimReaper">Grim Reaper</a> himself arranges an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongBusTrip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongBusTrip">(obviously long)</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">bus trip</a>.

</p><p>This often causes major changes in the cast dynamic. If the character was a big enough part of the show, it could be derailed or even ended altogether. It's <em>usually</em> seen in Anime, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternAnimation">Western Animation</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveActionTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveActionTV">Live-Action TV</a>, but this can happen in film as well if the movie is a series (see <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones">Indiana Jones</a></em> below).

<ul><li> A rare non-actor version of this once occurred in the classic adventure strip <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TerryAndThePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TerryAndThePirates">Terry and the Pirates</a></em>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">wisecracking</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Ace Pilot</a> Dude Hennick was based on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> friend of <em>Terry's</em> creator, Milton Caniff, named Frank Higgs. Higgs, like Dude, flew on relief efforts for war-torn China in the years leading up America's entry into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. Dude had not been seen in the strip in years when, on a Christmas Day, 1945 strip, Caniff spoke directly to the reader, revealing Dude had been based on Higgs... and that Higgs died in a plane crash. "I know today you're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">probably thinking of your own 'good Joe' who didn't get to see this Christmas</a>, but if you liked Dude, I hope you'll spare a thought for Higgs. Dude died when he did."
</li><li> Invoked but ultimately averted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Doonesbury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Doonesbury">Doonesbury</a>'s Uncle Duke after the death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HunterSThompson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HunterSThompson">Hunter S. Thompson</a>. When <a class="urllink" href="http://doonesbury.slate.com/strip/archive/2005/3/8">Duke reads the news<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of Thompson's passing, his head immediately explodes, only to reappear so that he can make sure he didn't misread the story. After Duke confirms the story, his head promptly explodes again. For the remainder of that week, Duke descends into a bizarre, probably drug-fueled series of Ralph Steadman-inspired hallucinations. Considering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FearAndLoathingInLasVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FearAndLoathingInLasVegas">to whom the tribute was being paid</a>, this actually seems appropriate.

That the single take captured genuine emotion and showed that grown-ups, too, can feel sad and cry when people they love die, played a huge role in keeping the scene at one take... and also played a major role in the scene's critical acclaim.

The producers thought that it would be too confusing to talk about Mr. Hooper being gone forever while still showing him on screen. (However, several years after Hooper's passing, a "Really Dead Montage" would be played, usually when a newcomer asks about the store or Hooper himself; it was probably determined that enough time had passed and that the audience generally understood that Hooper was no longer with his neighbors and friends.)

</li><li> Not quite an <em>actor</em>, but the Fifth Doctor's could-have-been companion Kamelion, a shapeshifting robot, had to be written out of the series when the mechanical prop's software designer, Mike Power, died in a boating accident. As he'd only just finished programming the expensive apparatus and hadn't had the chance to write down the instructions, the prop malfunctioned constantly and became such a liability that the character spent the rest of his tenure in a back room of the TARDIS, then was given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">Mercy Kill</a> in Five's penultimate story.

</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> A rare double case occurred on the series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FifteenLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FifteenLove">15/Love</a></em>, where two main characters were killed off in one heartbreaking episode because of the (very) young actors' deaths in the same car accident.
</li><li> 80's sitcom <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NightCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NightCourt">Night Court</a></em> had it twice:
<ul><li> Original cast member Selma Diamond, who played <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDanza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDanza">bailiff Selma</a>, died after the first two seasons, so her character was also written off as deceased.
</li><li> The succeeding bailiff was Florence, played by Florence Halop; but Halop passed away after one season and thus her character shared the same fate. It wasn't all that surprising, considering the ages of both actresses. In fact, there were whispers and jokes that both actresses had fallen prey to some sort of "Night Court curse," and this is said to be one of the reasons that series creator and executive producer Reinhold Weege decided not to bring in a third elderly actress and instead replaced Halop with Marsha Warfield, who was only 32 when she began playing Roz Russell. In fact, the producers knew Florence Halop would not be around for Season 4; the ep "Flo's Retirement" was their way of preparing viewers for this.
</li></ul></li><li> In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera">soap opera</a>, this is one of the only occasions when you know a character is <em>not</em> coming back from the dead (regardless of whether <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody">they ever found the body</a>), although this is usually reserved for elderly actors who have played the role for so long that it would be impossible, if not outright disrespectful, to re-cast the part.
<ul><li> A very touching example occurred on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneLifeToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneLifeToLive">One Life to Live</a></em>. NYPD officer John W. Perry had frequently appeared on the show as an extra before he was killed in the September 11th attacks. The first anniversary was commemorated when Commissioner Bo Buchanan was seen looking at John's picture and sadly musing, "I can't believe it's been a year" (in a scene that evidently did not require much acting on the part of Bo's actor, Robert Woods). The in-universe story was that Perry had been <em>visiting</em> New York on that day (the show is set in Pennsylvania), but had died as he had in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>&mdash;<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">rushing down to the Trade Center to help, and killed when the South Tower collapsed</a>. It was very well-handled, especially for an entertainment genre that had struggled over how or if to acknowledge the tragedy onscreen.
</li><li> Also on <em>One Life to Live</em> was Michael Zaslow, who played David Renaldi; the actor was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease and confined to a wheelchair. The character, who was absent from the show for several years, was given the same diagnosis when he returned. When Zaslow passed away in 1998, David was written to have likewise died.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GeneralHospital" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GeneralHospital">General Hospital</a></em>, Anna Lee died in 2004, and her character, Lila Quartermaine, was killed off. John Ingle, who played her husband, died of cancer in September 2012, and so his character Edward Quartermaine died of a heart condition. (His last word before passing: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">the name of his beloved wife, Lila.</a>)
<ul><li> Before that, Emily McLaughlin, who had played Nurse Jessie Brewer from the beginning of the show in 1963, passed away in 1991. Although Jessie had only been seen sporadically in later years, John Beradino (who had played Dr. Steve Hardy from the beginning of the series) broke character at the end of an episode to announce McLaughlin's passing. Jessie was officially acknowledged in-story as having passed on during the 30th-anniversary episode two years later. Beradino would pass away from pancreatic cancer in 1996, and Dr. Hardy was written as having died of a heart attack. The two characters did make a return appearance in 2015, but only as a flashback to their younger days, and with current cast members (Rebecca Herbst/Nurse Elizabeth Webber and Jason Thompson/Dr. Patrick Drake) playing the roles.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllMyChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllMyChildren">All My Children</a></em>, Erica Kane's mother Mona developed lung cancer at the same time as her actress, Frances Helfin. When Helfin passed away, a scene was written into the show in which Erica goes into her mother's room, and comes out devastated at having found that she died in her sleep.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet">Coronation Street</a></em> actress Betty Driver died aged 91, so her character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDanza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDanza">Betty Williams</a> was killed off as well. This has happened several times in <em>Coronation Street</em>: Jack Walker, Jerry Booth, Albert Tatlock, Stan Ogden, Bert Tilsley, Blanche Hunt. Elsie Tanner and Christine Hardman were both mentioned as having died several years after they left the show and Annie Walker is talked about in the past tense.
</li><li> This was done on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DaysOfOurLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DaysOfOurLives">Days of Our Lives</a></em> when the last remaining original cast member, Frances Reid (who played matriarch Alice Horton), passed away. Macdonald Carey was given the same treatment when he died in 1994.

However, when 91-year-old actress Helen Wagner, who'd played Nancy from the beginning, died a few weeks before the final episode was scheduled to be filmed, the plan was scrapped, and Nancy was said to have died, with other characters memorializing her onscreen.
</li><li> <em>Love and War</em>: John Hancock, who played bartender Ike Johnson, died halfway through the first season. The other characters are shown attending Ike's funeral. Ike was replaced by his brother Abe, played by Charlie Robinson, who inherited Ike's share of the bar.
</li><li> Joan, the first wife/biological mom of the kids in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EightIsEnough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EightIsEnough">Eight is Enough</a></em>. Actress Diana Hyland appeared only in four episodes before being diagnosed with breast cancer. Joan was written out of the rest of the season and Hyland died twelve days after the first episode aired. When season two aired, it was revealed that Joan had died.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HighlanderTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HighlanderTheSeries">Highlander: The Series</a></em>: Werner Stocker, the German actor who played the monk Darius, died of cancer. This resulted in Darius being murdered. The episode dealing with Darius' murder was filmed after his death but used some of the footage of the character that the studio had available spliced in. This also radically changed the direction of the entire show as both the "Watchers" and "Hunters", groups which came to be almost as central to the mythos as the Immortals themselves, were created as writers scrambled to re-write the first season finale without him.
</li><li> Unlike <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllInTheFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllInTheFamily">All in the Family</a></em>, on the original British show <em>Till Death Us Do Part</em> the demise of the protagonist's wife Elsie - when it transformed into <em>In Sickness And In Health</em> - was due to the genuine demise of actress Dandy Nicholls.
</li><li> When Norman Beaton died, the show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Desmonds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Desmonds">Desmond's</a></em> was replaced by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Off</a> about secondary character Porkpie. The first episode begins with him consoling Desmond's widow.

</li><li> Following Andy Hallett's death, his character, Lorne, was retired in a self-titled, one-shot comic. While it would've been easy to keep the character alive since the series had long since transitioned from television to comic books, this was seen as the proper way to give tribute to the actor.
</li></ul></li><li> Aunt Ginny in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMiddle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMiddle">The Middle</a></em> died along with Frances Bay, the actress. "The Map", an episode that began with the Hecks coming home from Ginny's funeral, ended with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMemoriam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMemoriam">In Memoriam</a> to her.
</li><li> The early seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em> had a character named Dr. Virgil Swann, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemakeCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemakeCameo">played by</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherReeve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherReeve">Christopher Reeve</a>.

<ul><li> Jim Davis passed away suddenly during production of the fourth season. The production crew had his character, Jock Ewing, go offscreen for a year while they figured out how to write out his character, then finally perish in an offscreen plane crash.
</li><li> Barbara Bel Geddes' character, Miss Ellie, does not appear in the rebooted series, as the actress had passed away in 2005. She is stated to have died of a heart attack sometime between the end of the original series and the pilot of the rebooted series.
</li><li> After the death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryHagman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryHagman">Larry Hagman</a> in 2012, his character J.R. Ewing was shot offscreen during the second season of the revival series.

</li></ul></li><li> The first episode of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultinationalShows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultinationalShows">UK version</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FraggleRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FraggleRock">Fraggle Rock</a></em> after the death of Fulton Mackay opened with the Captain's nephew PK taking responsibility for both the lighthouse and Sprocket after his uncle's death.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em> actor Cory Monteith died from an overdose, it was decided that his character would also pass away. Creator Ryan Murphy worked together with Lea Michele, Monteith's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceOnTheSet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceOnTheSet">real-life girlfriend</a>, on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMemoriam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMemoriam">memorial episode</a>. The episode "The Quarterback" focused on how Finn's family and friends and everyone he knew coped with the loss. The show preferred not to say how Finn died because, in Kurt's words, his life was more important than the moment of his death.
</li><li> Old Nan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> was obliquely treated as having died after Margaret John's death, though it was never actually spelled out in the show.

In the season finale, Gibbs is told that his father died of a stroke and the episode had Gibbs coming to terms with it as a side plot. The episode is dedicated to the memory of Ralph Waite. In a variant, when the actress who played Ducky's mother died, Ducky said that she had been moved to a resting home, and her character wasn't actually killed off until a couple of seasons later.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISLosAngeles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISLosAngeles">NCIS: Los Angeles</a></em>, the death of actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MiguelFerrer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MiguelFerrer">Miguel Ferrer</a> also meant the death of his character, Assistant Director Owen Granger.
</li><li> Lee Thompson Young's suicide happened near the end of season 4 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RizzoliAndIsles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RizzoliAndIsles">Rizzoli &amp; Isles</a>,</em> with no time to do more than write his character, Detective Barry Frost, out of the last episode of the season. It was later revealed that Barry died in a car accident.

There are quite a few episodes dealing with the in-universe aftermath, including the characters holding a toast to her and her son Howard trying to get her ashes after they were misplaced.
</li><li> The short-lived CBS action series <em>Cover-Up</em> had a case of this involving a death which occurred during the actual filming of the series. Jon-Erik Hexum, who played Mac Harper, the original sidekick/love-interest to the main character, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalMethodActing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalMethodActing">accidentally killed</a> himself during a recording break by shooting himself in the head with a blank pistol cartridge, apparently in the belief that it would just cause a harmless bang and not realizing the serious dangers of such an act (the pressure blast from the cartridge exploding fractured his skull and forced pieces of it into his brain). Because of that, the ninth episode of the series had his character killed off-screen in the line of duty and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">Suspiciously Similar Substitute</a> Jack Striker (played by Antony Hamilton) take his place. Striker tells the hero, Dani, that &#145;Mac is not coming back&#146;. The episode then ends with an in memoriam message dedicated to Jon himself.

In 2015, When Angela returns in <em>Girl</em>, she reveals that her father has also died, roughly around 2011.

Amy Sherman-Palladino confirmed that in the time between the show's final season and the revival, Richard (Hermann's character) also passed away and one of the major storylines in the revival would be how the Gilmore women cope with the grief and bereavement.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Porridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Porridge">Porridge</a></em>: Ronnie Barker, who played the protagonist Fletcher, passed away in 2005. In a one-off revival special in 2016, his grandson Nigel states that Fletcher passed away in 2011 after enjoying a long and happy retirement on the straight.
<ul><li> Ronnie Barker's other great creation, Arkwright from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OpenAllHours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OpenAllHours">Open All Hours</a></em>, is said to have died at some point prior to <em>Still Open All Hours</em>, having raised Granville to follow in his footsteps. A framed photograph of him hangs in the living area behind the shop.
</li></ul></li><li> As <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks">Twin Peaks</a></em> had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelGap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelGap">quarter century</a> between the original series and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revival">The Return</a></em>, numerous actors had died in the meantime. While some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterOutlivesActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterOutlivesActor">outlived their actors</a>, others did not:
<ul><li> Pete Martell and Alexander Packard's fate was one of numerous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftHanging">Left Hanging</a>, as their last scene has them at least potentially killed by an explosion. <em>The Secret History of Twin Peaks</em>, released after the death of both actors, confirmed their deaths.
</li><li> Garland Briggs, whose actor died in 2008, turns out to have died shortly after the time frame of the original series. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresentAbsence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresentAbsence">The circumstances turn out to be plot critical.</a>

The episode "Eggs Over, Not Easy" is dedicated to him, since it deals with Becky still trying to get over Mark's death.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Implied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Implied">Implied</a> to be the case for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldLady">Nana Mary</a>, whose actress, Shelley Winters, died in 2006. Notably, both these characters have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyJunior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyJunior">Dead Guy Junior</a>.

Daniel also visits Mr. Miyagi's grave in Episode 5 (which reveals the character died in 2011), and the episode is dedicated to him.
<ul><li> Zig zagged with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Tommy</span>, whose death was already planned to happen months before his actor would follow suit. That was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">Real Life Writes the Plot</a>, as his actor really was dying of cancer.
</li></ul></li><li> A recurring character on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrongMedicine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrongMedicine">Strong Medicine</a></em> was Milo Morton, a doctor who became a love interest to main character Andy. Actor Richard Biggs unexpectedly died of an aortic dissection in May of 2004. An episode had been written where Milo would meet Andy's ex-husband Les. It was re-written with Andy getting a phone call that Milo had been killed by a drunk driver while helping people at an accident scene and Les helping her cope.

Despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonPolito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonPolito">Jon Polito's</a> death in 2016 after season 7, he still appeared the following season in "Halloween 4: The Revenge of Rod Skyhook," <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">now played by Robert P. Costanzo.</a> However, a season later in "In Your Head," it's revealed that Earl has died, and the episode is about Jay trying to figure out where to scatter his former partner's ashes.
</li><li> Averted for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StElsewhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StElsewhere">St. Elsewhere</a></em>. in the credits for the series finale "The Last One", MTM Production's (the production company behind St. Elsewhere) logo was replaced with the company's mascot, Mimsie the Cat, lying on her deathbed right next to an IV bag and a heart monitor. When the credits end, the monitor flatlines. Ironically enough, Mimsie died for real just days after the episode aired, which led many people to believe that the episode aired after Mimsie's death and that this was MTM's way of announcing it. However, this is far from the truth.
<ul><li> Funnily enough, over a decade prior for the finale of another MTM production, <em>The Texas Wheelers</em>, MTM pulled a similar thing featuring an animated version of Mimsie. In this one, she staggers from behind a wagon wheel and drops dead. This is not confirmed fully, as <span style="display:none">invoked</span><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">no footage of it exists online yet</a>, although <a class="urllink" href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-12-01/features/8503230642_1_kitten-hill-street-blues-mtm-enterprises">this Chicago Tribune article from 1985<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> claims this was true.
</li></ul></li><li> The fourth season premiere of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Riverdale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Riverdale">Riverdale</a></em> focuses on the sudden death of Archie's father, Fred Andrews, months after actor Luke Perry suddenly passed away from a stroke.
</li><li> The Scottish cop show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Taggart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Taggart">Taggart</a></em> had its title character die off-screen following the death of the actor, Mark McManus. The show continued with the rest of the ensemble cast and notoriously ended up with more seasons without Taggart than with him.
</li><li> Charlie Murphy died in-between seasons 2 and 3 of ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackJesus">Black Jesus</a>'. This is acknowledged in the Season 3 premiere, where it's revealed that despite Vic (Charlie Murphy's character) being an asshole and not believing that Jesus was the real Jesus, his love for God still got him into Heaven.
</li><li> Brazilian sitcom <em>A Grande Fam&iacute;lia</em> suffered this twice: the family's patriarch, Mr. Floriano, died with his actor, Rog&eacute;rio Cardoso. His brother, Uncle Juvenal, was soon introduced as a replacement - and also died with his actor, Francisco Milani, just two years later.

They have noted this fact in interviews, feeling that if he wasn't there to perform on the song, it wasn't right to perform it and that it was better for the song to remain special to his era. It remains one of the few hit singles that isn't a mainstay of the band's set lists.

<ul><li> This has happened numerous times on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheArchers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheArchers">The Archers</a></em>, as it is such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">Long Runner</a> that actors are often in it for long enough to become elderly. Usually the death is offstage, but relatively soon after the actor's own death; a notable exception was Nelson Gabriel's death, which occurred after the character had been a tax exile for some time, still talked about by the other characters but not appearing.
</li><li> Similar Polish radio dramas <em>Matysiakowie</em> and <em>W Jezioranach</em> had done this a lot of times. Averted in many cases since 90s with using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">The Other Darrin</a>.

However, the Rani being a Time Lord, they could both acknowledge this trope and still make the story, with Siobhan Redmond cast as the Rani's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor">new incarnation</a>.

Tom Magliozzi died in late 2014 due to complications of Alzheimer's disease, but the show had already gone to an archive format two years earlier due to his failing memory. His brother and co-host Ray and the show's producers continued the running of the show with a mix of previously aired and unaired material, including clips featuring Tom in every segment. The show is now run as <em>The Best of Car Talk</em>, with Ray recording a few new sponsor messages in retirement.

Strangely enough, he is resurrected as part of the plot in <em>Xrd</em>, although it's ultimately justified in that the new Zato <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInKindness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInKindness">isn't the villain</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">he used to be</a>.

As the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda">next game</a> in the series featured no returning characters from said trilogy, writing Zaeed out was no longer necessary, so <em>Citadel</em> was simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMemoriam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMemoriam">dedicated to Sachs' memory</a>.
</li><li> While Ben from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FullThrottle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FullThrottle">Full Throttle</a></em> has never been killed off, one of the reasons the game will never have a sequel is that his voice actor Roy Conrad died of lung cancer in 2002.
