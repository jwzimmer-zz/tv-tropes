</p><p>As the name implies, the Mighty Glacier is one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan">strongest people in the world</a>. A single hit from a Mighty Glacier is about ten hits from anyone else. Mighty Glaciers also tend to carry <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">weapons that would</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">break anyone else's arms</a> just to pick up, and can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadBearingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadBearingHero">hold open doors</a> that would break a lesser person's fingers off when they slammed shut.

Reeeeeeaaaaalllly slow. They would need rocket skates to be described as "inching along". Some games mitigate the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a>'s slowness by providing support units which can carry it around more quickly than it can move on its own.
</p><p>A greater muscle mass (to a point) theoretically provides speed but the Mighty Glacier tends to use the heaviest equipment possible, sacrificing any speed for the pure crushing power that only he can achieve. Too much muscle can hinder speed and endurance to a degree, as some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">deconstructions</a> of Mighty Glacier characters show.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note05bnt');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note05bnt" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note05bnt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, people with loads of muscle can still be fast and have endurance to a point but they most likely will not have the same as those with relatively less muscle mass, and lots of muscle can hinder agility and flexibility to a degree as well... but of course, some people work hard enough to be capable of doing it all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> types</span>

However, some games punish this build when landing more hits than the enemy over time is easier and just as effective as strong individual hits. Racing games tend to have a variant where the heavier vehicles have slow acceleration and turning, but once they get moving their powerful engines allow them to go <em>really</em> fast. They also tend to be able to knock lighter vehicles around.

</li><li> Nanoha herself, too. She's not slow in terms of agility, but her attacks are rather slow but extremely powerful beams. Starlight Breaker alone takes significant time to charge, which is why she only uses it when her enemy is being held by magic binds.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGiantsAreBigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGiantsAreBigger">Giants</a> have immense strength and durability and can easily curb stomp large humans, but also thanks to their bulk Giants can be taken down by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">speedy and powerful</a> fighters (e.g Zoro and Sanji vs Big Pan and Luffy vs Hajrudin) or simply overcome by the sheer numbers (e.g Galley La and Franky Family vs Oimo and Kashii). Averted with some Giants e.g Oars, who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanTHeyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanTHeyLook">remarkably fast for his size</a> due having Luffy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingShadow">Living Shadow</a> inside him, requiring the Straw Hats to use a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinationAttack">Combination Attack</a> to bring him down.
</li><li> Post-time-skip, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg">Franky</a> is the slowest member of the crew due to all the tech weighing him down. Though to compensate Franky has the most firepower of anyone in the crew, being able to blow stuff up with the lasers from his arms and Franky is also still a slugger up close as Senior Pink <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidFireFisticuffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidFireFisticuffs">discovered</a>.
</li><li> Gecko Moria when he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">absorbed every single shadow in Thriller Bark</a>, became massively bloated but strong enough to crack the whole island in two just by punching the ground, however, due to his size Moria couldn't lay a finger on Luffy who used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Second Gear</a> to pound the shadows out of him before the sun came up.
</li><li> Blackbeard has incredible strength and endurance. However, he is also very slow, and his Devil Fruit has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessaryDrawback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessaryDrawback">Necessary Drawback</a> of <em>attracting</em> damage to his huge frame. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">Charles Atlas Superpower</a> endurance is usually enough to compensate.
</li><li> Whitebeard. He's no slouch, and many fighters would probably lose to him in a contest of speed, but he has no feats that suggest truly superhuman speed which is pretty uncommon amongst the absolute top tiers in the series. Actually he almost doesn't evade any attacks in the war because he relies on his reflexes to block the attacks. To his defense, his lack of real super speed is only so easily noticed because his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan">raw strength is so absolutely massive</a>. It's implied that Whitebeard is only so slow due to the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass">he was dying of disease during his only on-page fight</a>. When he's stabbed in the back by Squard, Marco says flat-out that Whitebeard should've been able to dodge it with ease, and in Ace's flashback to his early days with Whitebeard, the guy was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">pretty much untouchable</a>.
</li><li> Big Mom, if one doesn't consider her three main Homies (chunks of her soul acting as powerful servants) as part of her. Reaction times aren't quite as lightning-fast as most to be found that far into the New World, and her speed, while not exactly slow, isn't gonna let her pull a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep">Flash Step</a> on anyone else. But she doesn't <em>need</em> to dodge, because she shrugs everything off like an "iron balloon", and her direct offense is such that if you so much as let her <em>touch</em> you, you're either pulverized, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatenAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatenAlive">Eaten Alive</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSoulIsMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSoulIsMine">got your soul torn off</a>.

</li><li> Some Ancient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism">Zoan</a> Devil Fruit types have this problem e.g Jack's massive Mammoth form while he had good reach with his trunk was still overwhelmed by Inuarashi and Nekomamushi in close quarters. Page One and X-Drake's full Spinosarus/Allosaurus forms have an incredible bite force but Sanji could easily dodge their chomping attacks (Page One, in particular, did better in his Hybrid form). Also Queen in his Brachiosaurus form was overpowered by the aforementioned Big Mom pretty quickly, though he still put his weight (33-88 tons) to good use.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em>, despite the fact that his strategies usually emphasize speed, Ash Ketchum has caught a few Pok&eacute;mon that qualify as this trope. His Snorlax is a notable example. It's pretty slow, but it can really dish it out and can take a lot of hits easily, thanks in part to its large, heavy body. Ash's Turtwig was fairly fast and agile, but once it evolved into Grotle, it lost most of its speed due to its new size. Thanks to some coaching from Paul's Torterra, however, it learned that it could make up for this with incredible endurance. There is also Ash's Goodra. As a Goomy, it could only move at a snail's pace, and got a little bit faster once evolving all the way to Goodra, but not much. However, it can tank hits like a pro and has very powerful attacks of its own. This is especially true when it uses Bide, since it's able to patiently endure a few hits and then unleash a massive attack at twice their collective power.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> examples:
<ul><li> This is the 3rd Grade of Super Saiyan (or Ultra Super Saiyan) in a nutshell: increasing the muscle mass to the point they are far stronger than a 2nd Grade Super Saiyan (both with fists and ki), but in exchange the sheer added bulk makes them slower compared to anyone with that much power, in addition to the increased ki consumption. Goku spotted this flaw while training and worked around it with a more efficient way to power up the Super Saiyan form, but Future Trunks found out the hard way only caught on after getting his butt kicked by Cell, who stresses the important difference between a Mighty Glacier and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> and muses that Vegeta too could have done it but spotted the flaw and stuck to the 2nd Grade (that bulked him up to the exact limit necessary to increase both strength <em>and</em> speed) until he managed to teach himself Goku's solution (that offered better power than the 2nd Grade to boot). Gohan sidestepped it entirely by being trained by Goku in his solution and then being the first to achieve Super Saiyan 2.
</li><li> Cell himself briefly attempts something similar to Super Saiyan 1 3rd Grade when he panics due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Super Saiyan 2 Gohan</a> dominating him-and, having been slowed down, gets beat up up bad that he literally <em>vomits Android 18</em> and regresses to his Semi-Perfect form. Later, after achieving the Super Perfect Form, he does it again... And as he used it in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamOWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamOWar">Beam-O-War</a> where only power mattered, it <em>almost</em> worked.

Janemba&#146;s second <em>smaller</em> form is an unabashed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> however.

He is a mountain of strength but, as he himself complained, the movement was a nightmare for him, and he was sluggish at best.
</li><li> Many of the linemen from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21">Eyeshield 21</a></em>, understandably. Especially Kurita (whose tied with Gao for strongest high school lineman in Japan) and the Taiyou Sphinx, with their main defense being their sheer mass. Subverted with Ootawara, Kurita rival, that had developed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">a level of speed that is freaking ridiculous for someone his size</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Akimichi clan is made up of Mighty Glaciers. They're all pretty big, due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">eating a lot</a> in order to convert calories into chakra, are physically very strong, and can expand their arms, legs, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfTheFiftyFootWhatever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfTheFiftyFootWhatever">entire bodies</a>. However, they are also very slow, and as we've seen in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">Chouji's</a> fights, this lack of speed tends to put him at somewhat of a disadvantage. They compensate for this by teaming up with the Yamanaka and Nara Clans&mdash;the former can control their opponent's mind, and the latter can immobilize them physically.
</li><li> When using the first three tails of the Kyuubi's chakra Naruto becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a>. The fourth tail's transformation leaves him immobile due to the strainng on his muscles, but also renders him nigh-invulnerable and packing serious artillery. He goes right back to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> with six tails as he acquires an exoskeleton to move his body for him.

The catch is he can't control himself, and most of the time stops by slamming into something. That, and most of the time he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">too lazy</a> to use his speed. Played straight up until the fight where he does this, though. Think of the scene at Briggs, for instance, where he just kind of meanders about while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceQueen">Armstrong</a> tries to figure out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">how much ordinance</a> it will take to deal with him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a> franchise:
<ul><li> The Destroy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny</a></em> is a giant mobile armor/Gundam cross. At 400-tons it's heavily armed and can shrug off most attacks, but lacks the mobility of the regular Gundams and mobile suits. Stella more or less uses hers as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut">The Juggernaut</a>, bludgeoning her way across Eurasia and to her fiery death in downtown Berlin.

It was arrayed with <em>28</em> mega particle cannons and one even larger one on it's chest which allowed it to rip the EFSF forces a new one. Unfortunately, it was incredibly slow and had no close-combat capabilities whatsoever and was destroyed when the Gundam got behind the I-fields protection.
</li><li> The Destroy's ancestors are the Psyco Gundam and Psyco Gundam Mk-II from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam</a></em>. Ranking in at 41 meters, the Psycos are armed with the teeth with beam weaponry, with the Mk-II adding in Reflector Bits to allow all-ranged attacks and is a general terror to all.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Ramiel in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>. For those unfamiliar with the show, it is a giant octahedron which flies slowly, with the most powerful cannon in the whole series. Nothing in the series could have gotten close to it without being destroyed. It eventually takes a sniper rifle shot powered by the <em>entire energy output of Japan</em> to take it down.
</li><li> The Megadei in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO">The Big O</a></em> move like real-world tanks. They're big, unsubtle, lumbering, not very graceful, but near catastrophic in damage output.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>, the Colossal Titan takes this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">Crippling Overspecialization</a> levels. It can smash the Walls and doom humanity, but can hardly lay a massive finger on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Survey Corps</a> used to <strong>much</strong> faster opponents. It would be dead if it didn't have the power to emit scorching hot steam to protect itself. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ironically, the hot steam technique ends up contributing to its downfall.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul">Tokyo Ghoul</a></em>, this is the defining characteristic of the Koukaku Ghouls. The muscle that forms their kagune has a metallic quality, making it extremely strong but also unusually heavy. Most lack the flexibility or mobility of other kagune types, making them best suited for use as a sword or shield.
</li><li> Enter Corporal Randall Oland of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PumpkinScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PumpkinScissors">Pumpkin Scissors</a></em>: your everyday <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant">Gentle Giant</a> that feeds kittens, sleeps with hobos, cares for his new comrades and slowly, really slowly, takes on armored vehicles and kills the enemy crew one armor piercing bullet at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoRangeLikePointBlankRange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoRangeLikePointBlankRange">Zero Distance</a> at a time.

ARC-V</a></em>, this is the idea behind Gongenzaka's Superheavy Samurai. While technically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a> deck, his most powerful Superheavy Samurai monsters can attack in Defense Position while using their (massive) DEF for Battle Calculation. Since his deck requires to not have any Spell or Trap Cards in his Graveyard, Gongenzaka cannot run on the Action Field and grab Action Cards like other Duelists, so he just stands their and tanks their attacks. As a perfect visual analogy, his Superheavy Samurai either stand or <em>sit</em> still on the same spot and attack with long-range attacks.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Brave10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Brave10">Brave10</a></em>, Seikai is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">The Big Guy</a> of the team, and his battle strategies include things like just standing there and letting people hit him rather than parry since he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">nigh invulnerable</a>.

<ul><li> Among the X-Men's foes, there's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard">Blob</a> and Stone Wall, who fight side by side in a version of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants that serves the U.S. government as Freedom Force. Both of them are immensely strong, but neither one is known for his speed. Heck, the Blob likes to brag that his mutant power literally makes him the proverbial "immovable object". He may as well be the trope codifier.
</li><li> Colossus counts too. Even though he's easily much, much stronger than he is heavy, this doesn't translate into any speed advantage. In one X-Men issue, he is summoned to Limbo by his sister and has to chase down Baba Yaga&mdash;he could barely run faster than a shriveled old hag. Not only is he a slow runner but he's pretty sluggish in a fist fight too; Thor lampshades this when he curbstomps Peter without taking any hits in an issue of Cable and X-Force. This is pretty much why Colossus sticks to going toe-to-toe with opposing heavy-weight big guys and leaves the quicker ones to Beast or Wolverine. This is a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>, as early editions of the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe attributed Colossus with impressive levels of speed in human form, and claimed he reached peak Olympic athlete levels of speed when he turned into metal.

Instead he'll often take a slow, heavy, looming gait as he approaches his foe, tanking a hail of bullets against his bulletproof skin like a gentle breeze, before proceding to launch them through the air with a single heavy punch or simple toss. Jessica is generally much more lithe and scrappy, and in The Defenders he's also contrasted against the lightning fast, highly skilled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015">Daredevil</a> and supernaturally powered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronFist2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronFist2017">Iron Fist.</a> Though it's more downplayed in his own series, as the lack of comparison supers leaves it up to him to do most of the fast moving.

When he was younger, he could move very well and even throw a dropkick. Acromegaly slowed him down starting in 1987. His managers actually had him invoke this trope earlier in his career, telling him to slow down his fighting style in favor of a more deliberate style to make him seem even more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut">an unstoppable force of nature</a>.

<ul><li> In the 3rd Edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>, Clerics tend to be this. Though casters, they get most of the best offensive buffs in the game. It will also take them a round or two to buff. As a result most fights start with the heavily armored Cleric clanking toward the foe as he buffs himself, then smacking said foe down with one or two hits <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarryABigStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarryABigStick">from his heavy mace</a> when he gets there.
</li><li> In 3.5, the Stone Dragon techniques from the <em>Book of Nine Swords</em> rely on keeping yourself grounded and balanced so you can deliver massive damage, punch through defenses, and break rock and metal. All its attacks require you to be on the ground, and most of its stances require you to not move or break the stance. The Dwarf-only class Deepstone Sentinel goes further, allowing you to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">control the ground around you with martial arts</a>, as long as you don't move at more than a crawl.
</li><li> Also in 3.5 the Dwarven Defender prestige class, which gives you a limited use ability that increases your strength and constitution but preventing you from moving. It's dwarf exclusive. It's very useful for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine">Hold the Line</a> situations in a bottlenecked dungeon where all enemies must get through the dwarf's square to reach your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannons</a>. In most open spaces, considerably less so.
</li><li> In 5e, Dwarves have a low movement speed of 25 (the standard for almost every other race is 30), but get a good boost to their constitution (increasing the number of hit points they have). All dwarfs get proficiency in Hammers and Axes allowing players to hit harder in melee with classes without normal access to martial weapons. Mountain Dwarves additionally get a bonus to strength, allowing them to hit harder with every melee weapon.
</li></ul></li><li> Most American battleships in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VictoryInThePacific" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VictoryInThePacific">Victory In The Pacific</a></em> are this&mdash;not only are they slower than their Japanese counterparts, but they have no central base to operate from, adding to the "glacier" effect by limiting the amount of ocean over which they can project their "mighty" surface combat power.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>:
<ul><li> The mainstay of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy">Astra Militarum</a> tank companies, Leman Russ battle tanks are described as slow and lumbering but powerful and durable. How the games rules represent this changes with the edition with the 7th Edition making it a Heavy Vehicle, allowing it to fire at full effect when moving but reducing its top speed. The 8th Edition rules on the other hand give the Leman Russ higher Toughness and Wounds characteristics than any other, non-Titanic, Astra Militarum vehicle and allow it to fire its main gun multiple times at full effect if it moves under half its, already reduced, movement distance.
</li><li> Space Marine Assault Centurions can shred almost anything they engage in close combat, which is unlikely given that their movement speed tends to be only marginally better than the scenery. They can be mounted in a Land Raider, at least, which gives them increased mobility <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">at the expense of a very, very large "shoot me" sign</a>.
</li><li> Space Marine Terminators and Chaos Marine Obliterators can't run. However, both have even better armour rating than the standard power armour, and every member in their squad uses weapons that would normally be restricted for regular troops to the preciously limited special or heavy weapons category.
</li><li> Models with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist">Power Fists</a> always hit last in close combat. They are meant for <em>anti-tank</em> work though, so if the wielder manages to weather the enemy's assault and then strike them back... <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">Hoo-boy</a></em>.
</li><li> Nurgle, the Chaos god of pestilence, is also a god of fecundity. It's no surprise the Nurgle Chaos troops and daemons all have sluggish speeds but powerful offense and are some of the toughest nuts to crack in the game.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em>'s selection of 'mechs is grouped into four classes, the biggest and slowest being Assault. Assault 'mechs are most often slow, plodding, ultra-durable behemoths, and usually pack enough firepower to destroy a Light mech or cripple a Medium with one salvo. They also don't have to worry too much about their speed, since most Assault 'mechs are equipped to deliver death at extremely long range. And the Assault mech has even been one-upped, now, as rules for Colossal class mechs from 105-200 tons now exist. They're bigger, tougher, more heavily armed, and slower than even Assault mechs. Unfortunately, they're also saddled with a few extra drawbacks, like being easier to hit than other mechs due to their massive size and being unable to use certain types of tech, like Stealth Armor or Jump Jets.
<ul><li> Every class of 'mech also tends to have a 'standard' ground speed, especially amongst 'mechs from the original 3025 timeline. This is because a 'mech's land speed is based on its engine size divided by its weight, and the heavier the engine is, the faster the 'mech is for its weight. This means each weight class of 'mech has 'mechs with intentionally undergunned engines, making it slower than the default but giving it more weight available for weapons and ammo. Classic examples of glaciers include the <em>Panther</em> light 'mech , <em>Hunchback</em> and <em>Centurion</em> mediums and the <em>Annihilator</em> assault 'mech. Subverted with the <em>Urbanmech</em>, whose massive weight savings from its comically undersized engine (it has two dots of ground speed, which means even an <em>Atlas</em> will outrun an urbie) doesn't save it from being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Joke Character</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>:
<ul><li> Mount Mostath, a glacier-mammoth Behemoth whose assigned duty is to arrange glaciers in the arctic north. Its normal movement is too slow for anything with a human lifespan to notice that it's animate at all, but when sufficiently agitated, it does attack the aggressors. It has Strength rating of <em>Immeasurable</em> and its stomps usually inflicts infinite damage to those without divine constitution. Even a mere mortal can run quickly enough to evade Mount Mostath's stomps, given its tremendous size and weight.
</li><li> Malfeas Charms are also heavy on things like "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfHate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfHate">if you screw with me I will hit you</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams">with hate-powered lasers that will</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticNuke">give you radiation sickness</a>"... but has absolutely nothing published to enhance flurries, Join Battle rolls, Dodge DV or movement speed. An Infernal can take both Malfeas brute-force mojo and Adorjani movement magic, producing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> powered by radiation, pain and crazy.
</li></ul></li><li> The Neu Swabian League of the space combat miniatures game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FullThrust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FullThrust">Full Thrust</a></em> have tendencies in this direction, with many ship classes that are big, heavily armed, but slow for their types.
</li><li> Dwarf teams in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BloodBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BloodBowl">Blood Bowl</a></em>. A well-built dwarfen line or cage is a bulwark of death that will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualGrinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualGrinder">slowly, inexorably, slide across the field and leave your players pummelled and senseless in the dirt</a> and leave your star blitzers marked by linemen that could probably take them in a one-on-one block. And that's before we factor in their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">Big Guy</a>, a <em>steamroller</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em>:
<ul><li> Dwarves are <em>all over</em> this trope, with durable and hard-hitting units that are nevertheless meaningfully slower than everything else (the Dwarven movement score of 3 is the worst available in the game without a unit that's actually been hexed by an enemy spell).
</li><li> <em>The Throne of Chaos</em> presents the Chaos Dwarves in this manner in terms of artillery and firearms. Chaos Dwarf cannons are extraordinarily powerful, more so than anything the Empire can access, and are entirely capable of smashing city walls and devastating entire formations with a few shots, but their war engines are meant for prolonged siege warfare and slow to reload and bring to bear. Imperial cannon can strafe its Chaos Dwarf equivalent multiple times between the latter's volleys, and Imperial mounted pistoleers are described as firing off their salvos faster than anything the Chaos Dwarfs had ever seen.
</li><li> The Lizardmen also have this kind of thing in their frontline combat troops, Saurus Warriors, which have standard movement distances and an Initiative score that's unlikely to impress even the slowest troops from other armies. The Lizardmen do, however, have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> Skink units, while everything in the dwarf army is either a) really good at killing things up close or b) really good at making the enemy want to come closer so they don't have to take another rune-enhanced boulder to the face.
</li><li> As in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimDark">Grim Dark</a> future, so it remains here: Nurgle units for the Chaos forces are slow but pretty punchy and extremely tanky.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarFleetBattles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarFleetBattles">Star Fleet Battles</a></em> has battleships. Fearsome things, bristling with weapons, with tremendously thick shields, but their gigantic engines are only enough to drive their gigantic bulk as fast as other ships in the fleet, and they turn like drunk pigs. Only the Klingons actually built any, and they handle as badly as anything else anyone ever built. The Federation designed one, and it handles even worse than that.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HeavyGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HeavyGear">Heavy Gear</a></em> and its first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LicensedGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LicensedGame">Licensed Game</a> feature the Mammoth Strider. The design is different from Gears in that it is not a true humanoid biped; instead, it is a <a class="urllink" href="http://i302.photobucket.com/albums/nn100/Kealios/15mm%20Sci-Fi/NorthernMammothStrider01.jpg">hunched, broad shouldered machine with very short legs<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>. As a result, it has the absolute slowest land speed in either game, hardly able to reach 30 kilometers per hour and with less maneuverability than even a modern tank. The most basic, bottom of the barrel Gear starts off with a 42 kph top speed. This also makes it slower than the setting's land-warships. To compensate for its sluggishness, the Mammoth is extremely tough and even more well-armed. It can absorb repeated strikes from missiles designed specifically to kill mech units, shuffle unharmed through machine gun fire, and basically ignore anything smaller than battleship cannons. The Mammoth is also armed to the teeth with five weapon mounts for the largest missiles, cannons, and lasers, such that it is considered a legitimate match against six enemy Gears. Simultaneously. The Naga Strider is essentially the AST's answer to the CNCS' Mammoth Strider, except slightly faster and with less armor and firepower. It is also the only Strider in its class to mount <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RollerbladeGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RollerbladeGood">wheels in its feet</a>, allowing the Naga to use hit-and-run tactics against its opponents.
</li></ul><ul><li> In Hawk Wargames's <em>Dropzone Commander</em>, both human factions&mdash;the UCM and the PHR are this. The UCM's tanks and the even slower PHR battle walkers can't match the speed of the Shaltari war striders, let alone the superfast anti-grav tanks of the Shaltari and Scourge. They make up for it by having heavier armour than the aliens (the material strength of the humans' armour is actually weaker than those for the aliens, but human vehicles more than make up for it by having extremely thick armour while the aliens use a much thinner hull), and the weaponry on human vehicles rival or exceed those of the alien races.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/XWingMiniatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/XWingMiniatures">X-Wing Miniatures</a></em>, the Imperial VT-49 Decimator has a fairly limited selection of moves&mdash;not much of <a class="urllink" href="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/xwing-miniatures/images/f/fe/MI_VT-49-DECIMATOR.png/revision/latest?cb=20161209202850">its dial<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is green, and it has no particularly noteworthy repositioning options or turning moves (most ships have at least a Koiogran turn to quickly reverse direction, but the Decimator has to turn around the slow way; without a pricey upgrade it can't boost; and it can never barrel roll). Additionally, while it has a lot of hull points, its Agility of 0 means that unless you're at range 3 or on the other side of an obstacle, you'll be taking a fair amount of damage from enemy attacks. However, it comes with a 3-die main gun that can be fired in any direction, and the Expose elite talent lets you throw on a fourth die, which is around the point where even arc-dodging TIE Phantoms and Interceptors start hoping their dice don't let them down&mdash;especially if the Decimator is flown by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass">Rear Admiral Chiraneau</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheApocalypse">Werewolf: The Apocalypse</a></em>, the Gurahl (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsWorseWithBears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsWorseWithBears">were-bears</a>) cover this trope in two ways. One, when it comes to their non-human forms, their Dexterity is pretty much the same in all of them (at most a +1 adjustment), but their Strength and Stamina get dramatic boosts. Two, unlike most Fera, they're incapable of spending Rage to get extra actions. However, they can spend Rage to get further buffs to their Strength. Yes, a Gurahl in Crinos form is only going to hit once, but when that single hit can punch a hole through a tank, and it's quite possible that they'll just shrug off any non-aggravated damage they take in the process of doing so (not to mention the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> that will cover whatever their boosted Stamina can't soak), that Gurahl will only <em>need</em> one hit.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness">Tanks</a>. They started out in The Great War as the ultimate Mighty Glaciers, with horrendous top speeds slower than that of a running infantryman, but great firepower, and nigh invulnerability to small arms fire. As wars became increasingly dynamic and mobile, though, tanks underwent progressive evolution to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruisers</a>, with modern Main Battle Tanks striking an even balance between firepower, armor and mobility. The image, however, still sticks. The last true Glaciers would have to be the heavy monsters built or designed by the Nazis and Soviets in World War 2.
<ul><li> The Nazis had several super-heavy tank projects. You have the Landkreuzer projects, which were never completed. The P1000 <em>Ratte</em> would be a 1000-tonne mobile fortress armed with two battlecruiser guns and many smaller peices, while the (nominally) 1500-tonne P1500 <em>Monster</em> would be armed with the largest gun ever fired in anger. Both projects were scrapped in 1943, as their mass would make the tanks move at a snail's pace (if they could get them moving at all), or more critically, make a barn-sized target for even the high-altitude Allied aircraft. And engineers looking at the proposals quickly figured they'd double the weights in their names.
<ul><li> These were preceded by the 188 ton Panzer VIII <em>Maus</em>, the largest tank ever actually built (barely; only two prototypes and one never had its turret installed), wasn't quite as insane but still very much an example. Its turret alone was as large as many tanks, and this allowed it to carry a huge 128mm main gun <em>and</em> a 75mm secondary gun side by side in it. Its front armor was 200-240mm (8-9 inches) thick and even its "weak point" at the rear had 150mm (6 inch) thick armor. That makes its <em>thinnest</em> armor equal to the "thickest" armor on the King Tiger Heavy tank, the most well protected tank of any nation to see mass production during the entire war. But it had only slightly better mobility than a beached whale, with a top speed of 20 km/h (12 mph) on hard, level ground. Essentially the <em>Maus</em> was a barely-mobile heavy pillbox which may have been devastating against enemy ground forces, but would have been a juicy target for Allied fighter-bombers. The most damning thing against it is that it wasn't an efficient use of manufacturing capacity or resources.
</li></ul></li><li> The French Char B1-bis heavy tank was slow, ponderous, and based on an outdated design paradigm, but they were exceptionally tough and had a powerful 75mm main gun and a respectable 47mm turret-mounted gun. One such tank called <em>Eure</em> was ambushed by several German Panzer IIIs and Panzer IVs and sustained 140 hits without significant damage. Alone, it destroyed thirteen of its ambushers. In his book <em>Panzer Leader</em>, tank ace Heinz Guderian recounted an incident where an enemy B1-bis was inflicting heavy casualties and he could only watch helplessly as all the shells that he and his comrades shot at it simply bounced off its armor.
</li></ul></li><li> Any tank destroyer that didn't fall into the category of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> fit this role. They have powerful, forward-facing guns and tough frontal armor but slow traverse and acceleration speeds. The German military in particular fell into this doctrine of tank destroyer combat.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elefant">Elefant tank destroyer<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was insanely heavy at almost 70 tons and could barely hit 20 km/h on road and moved at a snail's pace off-road, yet it was practically impervious to nearly all Soviet tank-mounted weapon and could leisurely snipe at enemy tanks from under cover... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllegedCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllegedCar">assuming its mechanical issues didn't take it out of action first.</a>
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagdtiger">The Jagdtiger<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> took this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>, mounting an even heavier 128mm gun and adding sloped armor. Like the Elefant, it was also sluggish since it used the Tiger I tank's engine despite weighing 30% more than the Tiger I- at 71.7 metric tons, it was the heaviest land combat vehicle to ever enter production (the Maus only having made it to the prototype stage).
</li><li> Although the American army relied more on nimble turreted tank destroyers, they did contemplate on building assault vehicles similar to those of the German army. Their finest example was the experimental T28/T95 superheavy tank, which was designed for assaulting the heavily fortified walls and bunkers guarding the Axis homelands. Its frontal armor has a thickness of 305 mm (literally a <em>foot</em> thick), its gun had a caliber of 105 mm and capable of punching through solid concrete, and its max speed is only 13 km/h (8 mph). The T28/T95 was essentially a steel bunker on treads. However, the Army ultimately passed up on the T28/95, viewing it as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">unusable in combat</a> as the heavy weight limited movement across terrain and couldn't arrive in time for combat. Also, the war ended before it was ready to be deployed and afterword there wasn't a point to having such a massive, slow vehicle.
</li><li> While Soviet ISU-152 and SU-152 self-propelled howitzers weren't decidated tank destroyer (more like siege tanks, because their main role was to provide heavy artillery support and destroy fortifications), their 48-kg AP shells worked extremely well against basically every armor Germany possessed. And their heavy sloped armor made them pretty tough, too. The decidated ISU-122 tank destroyers with long-barreled 122-mm guns fit too.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Tercio infantry. This infantry formation dominated the battlefields in renaissance Europe for nearly two centuries. It was the combination of pikemen with very long pikes, and gunners armed with matchlock muskets. Their attack power was formidable, as nothing could stand in the way of a wall of advancing pikes, and the guns (a novelty on the battlefields) could punch through even the strongest armor at a close enough range. Their durability is also legendary: they had to move in a close formation, and they were the slowest unit on the battlefield, so they were specifically trained to march forward no matter the casualties. Actually, their only hope of survival was to keep on pressing forward, because a pikeman with his long pike is defenseless alone if someone with a sword comes too close, and the matchlock was both heavy, unwieldy, and took nearly a minute to reload. If they break formation, even a small cavalry unit can cut them all down. So the formation had to be able to take a lot of punishment, they could deal a lot of punishment in close and medium range, but they were horribly slow: a stellar example for the Mighty Glacier trope. (the tercio was made obsolete only when flintlock muskets replaced the matchlock: their better rate of fire and ability to mount a bayonet made the pike square obsolete)
<ul><li> Tercio infantry were especially effective against the Ottoman Turks as the pikes could repel any cavalry attacks and the armoured front ranks were impervious against archery, and the Turks had no decent heavy infantry of their own.
</li></ul></li><li> Cataphract cavalry. The ancient precursors of knights (who themselves were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruisers</a>), cataphracts had both horse and rider fully encased in scale, lamellar or mail armor. They were armed with long spear used with both hands. These guys never could do faster than trot, but they were invulnerable to arrows and javelins, and could break almost any period infantry. Romans calculated it took eight ranks of legionaries to stop a Parthian cataphract charge. Cataphracts eventually superseded legionaries in late Roman armies.
<ul><li> Roman legionaries themselves count, at least when in formation. Tall, heavy shields meant that the men carrying them couldn't move very quickly, but just try stopping a Roman legion once it gets going. The men were trained to step forward, strike out with their shield, stab with their sword, repeat until all the enemy were dead. Even in battles where the Romans <em>lost</em>, like Trebia (218 BC against Hannibal), the legionaries tended to enjoy some success and break the enemy formation simply by relentlessly marching forward and killing.
</li></ul></li><li> The slugger. This type of boxer moves slowly and doesn't maneuver too much, but has extremely strong chin and stronger punch. Usually one well-placed punch by a slugger is able to finish the boxing game.
<ul><li> George Foreman late on in his boxing career, after his comeback. The fight with Michael Moorer being an example&mdash;George is mighty slow, can barely land a punch on Moorer all fight, but has a decent defense and a chin good enough that Moorer can't knock him out but is miles ahead on points, and then in the last round Moorer's concentration slips, one punch, WHAM, and Foreman has another world title belt.
</li><li> Eric "Butterbean" Esch had little footwork and dodged basically nothing, but was tough enough a man broke his elbow against his face and Butterbean kept on trucking, and he had enough knockout power to instantly floor <em>anyone</em> that took even one slightly solid punch to the head. Many of his winning fights involved tanking blow after blow until he saw an opening and concussed the one responsible.
</li></ul></li><li> Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar. Not renowned for running ability but he'll smash the ball so hard he doesn't <em>need</em> to run.
</li><li> The B-52 Stratofortress is a massive plane that needs eight jets to fly and can't break the sound barrier... but what it's meant to do&mdash;bomb the crap out of things&mdash;it does even better than the B-1B Lancers and B-2A Spirits supposed to replace it. In fact, the B-52 does this job so well that it's expected to keep flying until at least 2050, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorkhorse">94 years after it was first put into service</a>.
<ul><li> Heavy bombers in general until supersonic jet bombers started showing up in the late 1950s. The American B-17 is a particularly famous example: a cruising speed of less than 200 MPH married to up to 17,000 lbs of bombs and a legendary ability to survive battle damage. B-17s were known to return home one one engine, sans most of the tail, or on one immortalized instance, <em>after a German fighter had crashed into it</em>.
</li><li> Also the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickers_Wellington">Vickers Wellington<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, whose geodesic construction made it both exceptionally sturdy and able to accommodate ever-bigger bomb loads.
</li></ul></li><li> In the marching band world, we have the bottom bass drum. The bass five/six/seven(!?) player is usually a big guy to better counter the weight of the drum, and also tall, so that when the drum is on, their long legs can get them further and their long arms can still get the right technique. In other words, big and slow, but got the loudest beats.
</li><li> Schwerer Gustav was a heavy artillery piece which needed double tracked railroads to support its weight, with 2500 people setting up the tracks. Once it was in position it would launch 800mm 7.1 metric ton shells to a position over 37000 meters away.
<ul><li> Railway Guns in general. Heavier than the largest tanks, firing larger shells than even the largest <em>battleships</em> could dream of, but they can't be moved at all without railway tracks and a locomotive to tow them.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> David Ortiz of the Boston Red Sox. The man is slow as dirt when it comes to running. But when he hits the ball...
<ul><li> Barry Bonds in his later years (when he ironically won most of his MVP's). He lost a lot of speed with age, but he hit homer after homer.
</li></ul></li></ul><dl><dd><ul><li> Prince Fielder, now of the Texas Rangers. Even though he's passable enough at first base, one look at his massive, somewhat rotund form tells you all you need to know about him as a baseball player. He'll beat very few people in a foot race. But if he squares up a baseball with his bat, the ball's not coming back.
</li></ul></dd></dl><ul><li> Vladimir Guerrero is yet another example. The man was known for not having any speed when it came to running the bases, but a game didn't end without him getting multiple hits with the bat. He was picked for the elusive Baseball Hall Of Fame because of his success as a great hitter.

</li><li> Former NFL nose tackle Ted Washington (and nose tackles in general). In roughly his last 8 seasons, Ted broke the scales at weights as low as 350 pounds to as high as 400+ pounds. While not a big playmaker, Ted regularly shoved offensive linemen (300+ pound men themselves) off with one hand while pulling down the ball carrier with the other. Too bad he couldn't actually catch a player in the backfield with a 20 minute head start.

They had the greatest drawbar strength measured on a single steam locomotive in history but, while built for speeds up to 16km/h (10mph), in practise they never made more than half of that. They didn't need to anyways since they weren't road haulers, their purpose was to bank (assist-push) heavy coal trains up the steep inclines of the Appalachian mountains. They were pretty much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> since they used up so much fuel and water they were almost completely empty once the train hit the peak, with barely enough left to make the journey back down without exploding due to lack of water.

</li><li> Baseball catchers: they squat nearly the entire time they're on defense, which has the side-effect of ruining their knees, so you're hard pressed to find ones that can run fast. There are, however, quite a few catchers who are power hitters.
</li><li> Centers in Basketball; slower than their teammates (with a few exceptions like David Robinson and Hakeem Olajuwon), yet absolutely dominant near the basket due to their size and strength. This archetype is slowly fading away, though, as modern centers are expected to play a role in most teams' motion offenses.
</li><li> Center-backs in Football are not as quick as their teammates, but they are physically strong, which helps them overwhelm opposing forwards and deliver crunching tackles.
<ul><li> On the other side of the ball, we have "target-men": big, strong, yet slow forwards whose main asset on offense is their ability to out-muscle defenders and bat-down aerial passes to their teammates. Past examples include Eric Cantona, Emile Heskey, and Alan Shearer, while current forwards who fit that archetype include Olivier Giroud, Didier Drogba, Gonzalo Higuain, Romelu Lukaku, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, and Andy Carroll.
</li></ul></li><li> Defensemen in Hockey are not the fastest guys on the rink, but they are strong and massive enough to violently check opposing forwards. The majority of them also have very strong slap-shots, as demonstrated by Zdeno Chara and Brent Burns.

Massive, only half as fast as a fighter and having next to zero maneuverability, they made up for it in altitude and obscene payloads of bombs, in addition to being armed to the teeth with as many as <em>twenty-four</em> machine guns and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">autocannon.</a> The British thought that the volatile <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium">hydrogen gas</a> of these slow airships would make them a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>, but this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot">Hope Spot</a> was cruelly dashed when they discovered the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">bizarre fact</a> that the Zeppelins' extreme fragility paradoxically made them monstrously durable; bullets and explosive shells couldn't detonate against their fabric-and-aluminum hulls. Zeppelins routinely took hundreds or even <em>thousands</em> of rounds on their raids, leaking so slowly that they could fly all the way back to Germany safely. It took two years for one to be shot down, due to the invention of the incendiary bullet, which turned the tides. By war's end a third had been shot down.
</li><li> While the Grumman F4F Wildcat and F6F Hellcat weren't particularly agile (and the Wildcat was dog slow as well), they could take an extreme amount of punishment and were among the only planes that could stand a chance of withstanding direct hits from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Mitsubishi Zero's</a> cannons. Infamous Japanese ace Saburo Sakai once put <em>six hundred</em> rounds of ammunition into a Wildcat and it kept on flying, said Wildcat was already being attacked by 3 other zeroes at the time. The Russian Il-2 Sturmovik ground attack plane was even more durable; its armor was so thick that some German pilots dumped their entire supply of ammunition into a Sturmovik without killing it. Even the <em>canopy</em> was known to sometimes stop 20mm cannon fire. Even <em>more</em> durable was the B-17 and later B-29 flying Fortresses outgunned most airplanes several times over, having caliber machine guns in every place they'd fit and some that they don't, heavy armor, and sheer <em>mass</em> on it's side. B-17s regularly went from Britain into Germany, and back, in the light of day, with no fighter escort (As no fighter until the late-war Mustang had the range to follow them) and came back in one piece.
<ul><li> The F6F Hellcat, however, mounted a more powerful engine compared to its older predecessor, and while the agility wasn't improved, the engineers did improve on its <em>speed</em> markedly, while keeping the touted toughness, strength, and simple design of its older sibling, making the Hellcat a legitimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a>, and was the top ace-maker in the US Navy's inventory during the later half of the Pacific campaign.
<ul><li> The Hellcat stunned a lot of Japanese Zero pilots when it was first introduced. It looked so much like the Wildcat that Zero pilots simply barged right in, thinking they were up against a slow and lumbering Wildcat that they could fly circles around... until the Hellcat pilots pushed their engines up to Full Military Power. Surprise, surprise, surprise.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> You can become one if you train hard without proper muscle-stretching exercises. This is the origin of the phrase "Muscle Bound"&mdash;people who built their muscles extensively but (without proper weightlifting knowledge) severely damaged their joints. Strong and slow.
</li><li> It's believed that the largest sauropod dinosaurs like <em>Diplodocus</em> were extremely slow moving due to their sheer size and to conserve their energy, and may have only moved in slow, short bursts. However, their sheer size likely kept them off the menu of predators. <em>Argentinosaurus</em> may have weighed as much as <em>110 tons</em> which for obvious reasons nobody wants stepping, stomping or landing on them. Many also possessed long, whip-like tails, which may have been used like bullwhips for defense. Imagine getting hit by a <em>60-foot (</em>and, according to recent findings, <strong>serrated</strong><em>) bullwhip</em>. Ouch.
</li></ul><ul><li> A-10 Thunderbolt II, or as it is more often called the Warthog, is a rather slow aircraft (it can't break the sound barrier) has an insane amount of armor (1,200 pounds of it), can still fly if it is missing one engine and half a wing, and has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">30mm</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood">Gatling gun</a> that shoots <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepletedPhlebotinumShells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepletedPhlebotinumShells">depleted</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoKillLikeOverKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoKillLikeOverKill">Uranium shells</a>. Its might is best recognized in that, unlike most aircraft, it was designed entirely around the main gun. There are reports of enemy planes <em>emptying their entire stock of ammunition</em> into a Warthog and failing to shoot it down.
</li></ul><ul><li> Catapults, trebuchets, and other medieval siege engines. Because they had to be pulled by horses or people, they weren't very fast, and couldn't be aimed without turning the entire machine around, but they were the perfect tool for launching boulders, bombs, and dead bodies over castle walls.
<ul><li> Cannons and artillery in general until fairly recently have been slow to set up and required animals/trucks to pull them around, but are some of the best ways to attack fixed positions and only the hardest of targets can survive the barrage.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExaggeratedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExaggeratedTrope">Exaggerated</a> for <em>real</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">glaciers</a>. They can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">carve out entire landscapes,</a> including Yosemite National Park, if you give them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualGrinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualGrinder">a few thousand years</a>.
</li><li> The giant ground sloth. It was a slow creature, but let's look at it: bigger than most elephants, armed with sharp claws and protected by thick hides and nodules of bone that were embedded in their skin as natural armor. They were one of the few South American Creatures not to be driven out by Northern American competition, but instead managed to actually move as far north as ALASKA! If they had another thousand years, they could have taken on Russia.
</li><li> The saber-toothed cat <em>Smilodon</em>. Having relatively short legs coupled with a stubby bobcat-like tail, it was among the slowest predators and unable to chase after prey like its modern relatives. However, the cortical thickening in its forearms shows it had more arm strength than any big cat, meaning it brought down its prey by <em>tackling it to the ground so it could finish it off by stabbing the throat with its giant canines.</em>
</li><li> Battleships compared to other types of warships, at least until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">WWII-era fast battleships</a> took over. They carried the biggest guns, giving them the ability to quickly turn any smaller warships into scrap metal in a hurry, and were armored against their own guns, which means anything smaller had very little chance of seriously hurting them<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note603v3');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note603v3" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note603v3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Except torpedo-equipped shis as destroyers and especially submarines</span>. As a tradeoff, though, they tended to be the slowest frontline warships around, with cruisers ranging from 20-30% faster, and destroyers even faster than that.
<ul><li> During World War II, many older battleships qualified, though especially USS West Virginia in her post-Pearl Harbor configuration and the British Nelson class. All three ships had the firepower, armor, and fire control to tangle with any fast battleship short of a Yamato, and were only no longer frontline battleships due to a top speed of 21 and 23 knots, respectively.
</li></ul></li><li> The Aligator Snapping Turtle. While these beasts are even slower than most other turtles, they have one of the thickest shells of any turtle and jaws that can easily break through bone.
