</div></div><p>This occurs whenever there is inconsistency in how things work or behave between the gameplay and storyline sections of a video game, the latter of which generally consists primarily of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cutscene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cutscene">cutscenes</a> and dialogue. While this is generally forgivable due to technological limitations, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> instances can result in the shattering of the player's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief">Willing Suspension of Disbelief</a>. Typically, it's done to try and make a more interesting game, since simply getting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> all the time like in that cutscene would be utterly boring, while having a person who <em>can't</em> open doors like in that last cutscene would make the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">needlessly frustrating</a>. Accordingly, it's sometimes excused by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality">Acceptable Breaks from Reality</a>, but by no stretch does that justification cover all of the flat-out weird mismatches perpetrated by game makers over the years.

</p><p>A loosely equivalent technical term for this is "<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludonarrative_dissonance">Ludonarrative Dissonance"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, a term coined by Clint Hocking (a former employee of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucasArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucasArts">LucasArts</a>). "Ludonarrative" is the portion of the story told through the gameplay ("ludo" comes from the Latin word meaning "play" or "game"), so ludonarrative dissonance is when there are logical inconsistencies between what is conveyed through the gameplay and what is conveyed through the story, or when the gameplay is presenting one message while the story is presenting another. The term as it is used today lies closer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a> that comes from the messages of the gameplay mechanics undercutting the messages of its narrative, rather than just continuity conflicts between the story told through gameplay and the actual story.

Sure, duct taping two magazines for a machine gun together so you can reload faster is completely plausible in Lara's circumstances, but turning a WWII-era Japanese Type-100 submachine gun into a frelling AK-47 with nothing but a couple spare parts? Many of the upgrades Lara is able to cobble together at camp from random bits of scrap and <em>parts taken from animals she hunts</em> (bow strings or wrapping the limbs with sinew? Believable.

It's implied that beating the boss of the dungeon frees the area of its influence, but you can go back in those dungeons and still see the same monsters and creatures you fought before as if you didn't actually accomplish anything. This is especially egregious with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">Dodongo's Cavern</a>: it's explained that the place had become very dangerous with the sudden resurgence of Dodongos and other monsters, and that Link was a hero for vanquishing them so the Gorons could mine the place in peace, and yet all the Dodongos and other monsters are still every bit as prevalent in the cave, even if you come back as an adult seven years later. The only one that stays dead is King Dodongo, and he hung out in the lowest basement of the cave which was accessed by a hole high up on the ceiling and was impossible to get out of.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheForceUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheForceUnleashed">The Force Unleashed</a></em> is an interesting example.

But Starkiller's skills with the force and the lightsaber far outshine anything Palpatine, Luke, Anakin or Yoda (the four supposedly most powerful) have ever done in the films, causing many to label him the most powerful force-sensitive ever. The game's developers and defenders have claimed it to be an example of this trope, but the problem is, the game's narratives actually seem to support Starkiller's insane skill and raw power. Forget canonically and infamously pulling a Star Destroyer out of the sky (technically, he only redirected its fall); he defeated Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader twice, and (non-canonically, but in what-if stories) Boba Fett, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Obi Wan Kenobi's Force Ghost (seriously), an untrained-but-embracing-the-darkside Luke Skywalker, the Ewok tribe, Chewy, Han, and a fully trained Jedi Leia. The only hint at him having some limits to his abilities are the fact that these fights required boss battles, when judging by gameplay he should have been able to force-lightning or hack them all to bits in an instant.

<ul><li> Witchers, professional monster slayers, are neutral cards that can be played with any faction, including monsters. On the other hand, the Witcher code states that they're supposed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">"neutral"</a>.
</li><li> Ge'els is in the Monster deck with the other Wild Hunt characters despite the fact that his biggest contribution to the plot of Witcher 3 is betraying the Wild Hunt to Geralt. This is especially notable since Avallac'h, another Aen Elle elf who doesn't side with the Wild Hunt, reflects this by being a disloyal card.
</li><li> Similarly, the Bloody Baron is a loyal Northern Realms card despite the fact that he was a deserter who tried to negotiate with Nilfgaard.
</li><li> Several cards are based on Witcher potions and can be used on any unit, even though anyone without Witcher mutations would die if they drank one.
</li><li> The White Frost card takes this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. In spite of the fact that it is literally <em>the end of the world</em>, it's a neutral card that can be played by any faction, not just the Monsters.
</li><li> All of the bronze dwarf cards are Scoia'tael cards, and most dwarf cards have benefits dependent on other dwarf cards in play. Thus, several dwarves are placed in the Scoia'tael deck when they weren't actually members or even if they actually <em>opposed</em> the Scoia'tael. This includes:
<ul><li> Yarpen Zigrin, who considers the Scoia'tael to be just as racist as the humans they fight.
</li><li> Dennis Cranmer, who was captain of the guard for a Temerian Duke, but isn't in the Northern Realms deck.
</li><li> Zoltan Chivay, which is odd since "Zoltan: Animal Tamer" is a neutral card.
</li><li> Brouver Hoog, who is a leader card despite the fact that he decreed that dwarven youths were not to join the Scoia'tael.
</li><li> The latter two examples combined form a <em>double</em> example of Gameplay and Story Segregation: Zoltan is said to have nothing but contempt for Hoog and his policies but serves under him in-game.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SentinelsOfTheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SentinelsOfTheMultiverse">Sentinels of the Multiverse</a></em>:
<ul><li> Legacy's deck includes several cards that represent the superhuman durability gained by the current Legacy, which is a bit awkward to justify when the hero variant you're using is Greatest Legacy, who didn't have that durability.
</li><li> Size-shifting alien Sky-Scraper can use Thorathian Monolith to grow to giant size and shelter her comrades. Because Monolith lasts an entire round, and Sky-Scraper can change size after playing it through either her Extremist variant or other heroes giving her free card plays, she can end up sheltering her comrades while the size of a mouse.
</li><li> Luminary has a card to represent his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat">Kill Sat</a>, which has, logically, gone up at some point since WWII. He can use this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat">Kill Sat</a> in the year 1883, in the far future, in mystical realms, or in an extradimensional prison that doesn't <em>have</em> an outside to keep kill sats in. It also has amazingly precise aim; it can manage a direct laser hit on Apostate without charring the sword in his hand, for example.
</li><li> Luminary is also the head of state for Mordengrad. The Mordengrad environment deck has a few synergies with Luminary, but cards that attack heroes will fire on him without hesitation.
</li><li> The fight against Baron Blade starts with having to take out his Mobile Defence Platform. You can do this while <em>on</em> the Mobile Defence Platform, since it's an environment deck.
</li><li> Plague Rat's Infection specifically spreads via the victim's bloodstream. In the Letters Page podcast, they agree that a few heroes should logically be unaffected: Omnitron-X (a robot) and Dr Medico (an energy being) don't even have blood, and Dark Watch Mr Fixer (a ghost possessing his own corpse) <em>does</em> have blood but it's not like it actually does anything.
</li><li> The villain's health has been confirmed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> to represent the overall difficulty of their plan, not the amount of punishment they can actually take. This is how, for example, Citizen Dawn is a challenging one-on-one fight for Fanatic in the Cosmic Contest but takes an entire team to fight in normal gameplay. It also explains how one singular entity, Wager Master, has only 51HP but another one, OblivAeon, has 300 health spread over his second and third phases; WM is a jackass dilettante who's only there to hoard attention and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">Troll</a> the heroes, OblivAeon is <em>committed</em>. It falls apart, though, when it comes to Iron Legacy, who only has 32HP<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0vr5s');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0vr5s" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0vr5s');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the same as standard Legacy</span> but is a punishingly hard level four enemy who can crush an entire hero team without mercy in only a few rounds if you don't get the right cards to deal with him.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder5');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighting Game&nbsp;</div><div id="folder5" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
All fighting games fall under this trope to some degree. Due to balancing, no character (except maybe a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss">SNK Boss</a>) is as powerful or weak as the storyline says they should be.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em>: Multiple:
<ul><li> The special moves "Hadouken" (Surging Fist), "Shoryuken" (Rising Dragon Punch), and "Tatsumaki Senpuu Kyaku" (Hurricane Kick) are moves with the potential to severely injure opponents (Ryu's Shoryuken left Sagat heavily scarred, for example, although that particular incident was exceptional). These moves are toned-down versions of the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">"murderous techniques"</a> (which Gouki/Akuma uses and Gouken knows) that can actually kill an opponent (the "Gou Hadoken", "Gou Shoryuken", and the "Tatsumaki Zanku Kyaku"). Since it would obviously be unfair to make any move lethal, all of this is heavily toned down in the games itself. The canonical power of the moves limits their frequency in anime versions, promoting the Hadouken (for example) from "something Ryu routinely throws out fifty times in two minutes" to "final, fight-ending strike of destiny".
</li><li> Lampshaded by the "Shin (True) Shoryuken". It's a massive, destructive super, a good indication of the kind of damage the technique does when the gloves come off.
</li><li> The infamous scarring Shoryuken deserves special mention, as it not only struck one of the least vulnerable parts of the human body (especially for a massive bruiser like Sagat), judging by the length of the scar, <em>it didn't even connect solidly</em>. Sagat would be in considerable pain but shouldn't have been defeated at that moment. In <em>Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie</em>, where Ryu's fight with Sagat is seen in the opening, Sagat <em>isn't</em> defeated by the Shoryuken; he charges at Ryu in a rage, prompting Ryu to charge up a Hadoken to finish him.
</li><li> It's worth noting that while they're fairly weak from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII">Street Fighter II</a></em> onwards, in the first game, the special moves were <em>very</em> powerful, with a successful hit knocking a third of an opponent's health off. Each hit was also rated from one to three stars, and this acted as a damage multiplier; it was entirely possible to one-shot someone with ridiculous luck.
</li><li> Akuma's Shun Goku Satsu attack only seems to kill opponents in the story. This indirectly led to one of the most surreal moments in the series. In the special ending for <em>Street Fighter III 2nd Impact</em>, Gill (who'd just been SGS-ed by Akuma) does his Resurrection. In other words, an attack that doesn't actually kill, but did in that particular instance, was foiled by a power that doesn't actually allow one to return from the dead, but did in that particular instance.
</li><li> Dhalsim and Oro are very powerful according to the storyline. However, that power doesn't translate into gameplay unless a person <em>really</em> knows how to control them. <em>Nobody</em> got it worse than Oni; at least the original Akuma <em>used to</em> be a terror, and even the watered-down playable version had a truckload of combos and a withering pressure game. Oni, supposedly Akuma's ultimate form, has only a few effective combos, does piffling damage, and <em>takes</em> about 50% more damage than anyone else. In his <em>debut</em>. After he got buffed, he became decidedly more effective at doing what he was meant to do (applying suffocating, unrelenting offensive pressure and turning hit confirms into lengthy, showy, and highly damaging combos), but his poor health and stun, generally lackluster defensive options and poor standing in fireball wars, and heavy reliance on meter kept him relegated to mid tier.
</li><li> Ingrid is described as a literal <em>goddess</em>, who can <em>transfer people between universes</em>, and the true master of M.Bison's Psycho Power. In the game, she's an unremarkable character who throws sparkles a lot, and her moves that use magical power are much less effective and powerful than Bison's.
</li></ul></li><li> Likewise, crossover games like the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom">Marvel vs. Capcom</a></em> series often have this. For gameplay purposes, human martial artists (albeit ones with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">Charles Atlas Superpowers</a>), police officers, and even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">lawyers</a></em> can withstand attacks from superpowered characters who can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk">level buildings with a single punch</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">slice through any known substance</a> in their source material.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadOrAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadOrAlive">Dead or Alive</a></em>, certain characters are shown using weapons in cutscenes that they can't actually use in battle, such as Hayate's bow and arrow or Eliot's niuweidao. A few like Kasumi and Hayabusa even have said weapons as costume accessories, but still cannot use them outside of cutscenes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MeltyBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MeltyBlood">Melty Blood</a></em> also has notable balancing effects on the characters due to their remarkable powers in the original visual novel. Shiki Tohno has the power to kill <em>anything</em> with a pocket knife - including a <em>building</em> - but in the game, it's just a regular super move, albeit a damaging one. And he's weak compared to Arcueid, who in addition to having all the benefits of being a vampire without being undead, has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WindsOfDestinyChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WindsOfDestinyChange">probability manipulation</a> power called Marble Phantasm. At least half the main cast are <em>petrified</em> of her, but again in the game it's just a kinda-good super move. Both characters are balanced against each other. And also against Hisui. Who is a maid.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> games with career modes fall victim to this. Your status as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face">face</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel">heel</a> is solely dependent on the choices you make during storyline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cutscene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cutscene">cutscenes</a>, meaning your actual behavior in the ring is entirely irrelevant. For example, you may play your matches dirty, doing things such as using weapons, removing turnbuckle pads, delivering low bows, and taking advantage of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyDistractedReferee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyDistractedReferee">Easily Distracted Referee</a>, but as long as you make the corresponding decisions during cutscenes, the game will act as if you're a straight-up face. Some games will penalize you by taking away momentum (the stuff that lets you perform special moves) for using tactics that don't match your alignment. However, you can still <em>do</em> them at any time, and the storyline will never acknowledge it. Though losing momentum, especially considering the sheer amount that you lose, is a pretty powerful deterrent to breaking type. Unless it's a complete mismatch, you <em>need</em> those finishers.
<ul><li> WWE career modes every now and then like to have you beat an opponent, and then have them get back up and pin your wrestler in the following cutscene, or some such thing. It should be a normal part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">kayfabe</a>, except that you're then stuck with a <em>real</em> loss that goes on your wrestler's statistics record, even though you put in the effort of winning the friggin' match. In the later games, particularly the Smackdown vs. Raw series, the losing cutscene has a requisite that's actually <em>easier</em> than winning a match of that type (cover for a 2-count, set a ladder anywhere pretty close to the belt and climb, etc.). Afterward, the game will say that you lost, but you get the normal reward for a win and the loss isn't counted in your stats; at worst, it's a no-contest. Weird league, weird trope, weird gaming moments.

<ul><li> In the cutscene before the final battle, all ten of the heroes line up in front of Chaos to fight him. You then proceed into a three-round, one-on-one battle. Somewhat mitigated in the sequel/prequel, when you enter the battle with four more party members that can take your initial character's place if/when they die, plus one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssistCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssistCharacter">Assist Character</a>, who is chosen at random from the remaining five heroes.
</li><li> In the final chapter of Scenario 013 in <em>012</em>, the boss cutscenes show the Chaos's warriors being challenged and after a battle being defeated by their Cosmos counterparts. Despite this, you can challenge them with any character and you'll still see the cutscenes. In the first game, this was averted; you had to have the character relating to the boss to get both cutscenes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">which means you'd have to memorize who's in what chapter and do it multiple times with each character</a>.

It may have a negative effect like random stats or depleting your HP, but it does not drive you crazy unless your character actually uses it in a cutscene. In some endgame cutscenes, it's possible to watch your character use their Soul Edge that you unlocked to destroy the Soul Edge dropped by the final enemy; or throw their Soul Edge away, pick up the other, and get corrupted.

</li><li> Some games resolve the problem of fatalities versus story by disabling them in story mode, but other extremely gruesome attacks such as the X-Ray moves and Krushing Blows are still allowed. Some fights are meant to be friendly sparring matches or a minor quarrel between allies, but you can still have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Jax break Johnny Cage's spine in retaliation to him hitting on Sonya</a>, or Johnny Cage brutally shattering his daughter Cassie's skull during a practice battle.

</li><li> <em>Mortal Kombat 11</em>'s story mode revolves around time travel, and it's established that if anything happens to a past version of someone, it will apply to their present-day self, such as past Johnny Cage getting grazed by a bullet and his present self suddenly sporting the scar. Despite this, Johnny can suffer injuries <em>far</em> worse than a grazing shot from a bullet, and his future self will remain unharmed. It's also stated numerous times that Cassie and Jacqui are in particular danger because if their parents' younger selves are killed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone">the girls will cease to exist</a> due to the resulting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeParadox">Time Paradox</a> undoing their births.

<ul><li> Averted rather oddly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallZBudokai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallZBudokai">Dragon Ball Z Budokai 3</a></em> with Yamcha. Likely as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to his death in the manga, and a similar death in the story mode, Yamcha is programmed to die instantly during a fight if a Saibamen opponent manages to use its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAttack">Suicide Attack</a> on him regardless of his health, while every other fighter will survive it if they have enough health. This is also the only attack in the game which will instantly kill the person it was used on like it did in the anime.
</li><li> A recurring factor in any game that has a story mode is that you have to play through most of the fights that happen in the series. The issue is that it's entirely possible that the difficulty won't match what "should" happen: your character should be able to win the fight in their sleep, but it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">infuriatingly difficult</a>, only to then continue on like nothing happened; alternately, you win a fight in 13 seconds with a "PERFECT!" rating, only to immediately view a cutscene with your character on the edge of death and the enemy wondering "Is that all?"
</li><li> When he appears in fighting games, Future Gohan always has both his arms, despite the fact that his most iconic trait is him losing his left arm against the Androids. It gets even stranger with cases such as <em>Raging Blast 2</em>, where Future Gohan's fighting style is specifically programmed only to use his right arm (such as performing one-handed versions of his signature attacks, the Masenko and Kamehameha). This is believed to be because of censorship issues in Japan relating to characters losing limbs; various <em>Dragonball</em> games developed in America don't have this problem.
</li><li> A related phenomenon is how <em>DBZ</em> games will try to preserve iconic moments from the original manga and anime even if they don't make sense in the context of the games. For example, Gohan's Father-Son Kamehameha was originally performed one-handed because Cell broke his left arm beforehand. Every time the attack appears in a video game, Gohan still performs it with only his right arm, despite the fact that there's absolutely nothing wrong with his left arm, and he can (and will) use it both before and after performing that one attack.
</li><li> In pretty much any game where you fight Freeza as Super Saiyan Goku, he's likely going to be a very tough fight, whether he's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClimaxBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClimaxBoss">Climax Boss</a>, or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss">Disc-One Final Boss</a>.

</li><li> In the story mode of the first <em>Budokai</em> game, certain characters will transform and will start the fight in that state. However, they can still lose their transformations if they lose enough energy and get knocked down. From a gameplay perspective, this is perfectly normal. From a story perspective, it makes no sense and it makes even less sense when, for a example, a character that entered their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a> before the fight starts will still be in that form after the fight is over whether or not they lost that form during the battle.

</li><li> The 1998 PC game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sin">SiN</a></em> has this in spades. A number of bizarre gameplay elements include: the main character (John Blade) being turned into a half-naked mutant late in the game, then being changed back to his original human self, weapons, armor, and all; not being able to walk into a testing facility early on because you have police attire on, but the moment you switch into a work uniform, the few employees at the building won't recognize who you are; the opening two levels revolve around an unsuccessful heist to retrieve a document, but if the player finds the item wanted by the terrorist, it is simply an empty envelope that doesn't factor into the rest of the story; walking into a building and being captured, even if you have full health and enough ammunition to waste its entire group of occupants; falling into a trap door in a random room at a secret base that only serves to dump you into a meat cart for the final boss battle, and many other minor infractions.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>: has some pretty severe examples, though in this case, it's more like "books and <strong>everything else</strong> segregation":
<ul><li> A common misconception is that the weapons are much more lethal in the books. The plasma pistol melts huge holes in flesh and can kill anything in one hit, and the needler does exactly what one would expect a weapon that fires exploding glass to do. This is not actually the case however; the weapons only act like this one specific novel, and in that case were noted to be modified. In the actual game they're often two of weakest weapons; the plasma pistol usually only good against shields and the needler tends to only become a real threat if you shoot out half the clip into one target. Gameplay-wise, even a standard marine or grunt can take a plasma pistol or needler shot <em>to the face</em> and not be all that harmed by it. This is quite consistent with cutscenes (both in-engine and prerendered) which depicts plasma weapons as somewhat anemic, as well as official films.
</li><li> Canonically, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Spartans</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">MJOLNIR armor</a> are capable of running upwards of 40 miles per hour in short bursts, jumping 15 feet in the air, surviving both in a vacuum and underwater, (barely) surviving <em>atmospheric re-entry</em>, and punching holes in vehicles. In-game your default speed is about 16 mph, which is pretty fast for a regular pace (and still superhuman considering how much armor you're wearing) but nowhere near that; this would be less noticeable and more justified (as presumably your character's default run speed isn't their fastest sprint) if the games from <em>Reach</em> and onwards didn't specifically put in a sprint mechanic that's only 23 mph in bursts. Also, you die instantly if you fall more than a few dozen meters or go into the deep part of a river, which acts as a barrier against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking">Sequence Breaking</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a> situations. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3ODST" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3ODST">Halo 3: ODST</a></em>, where you play as just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> elite soldiers, the differences in gameplay are very minor. (If anything, Master Chief was often derided in the early days of <em>Halo</em>'s lifespan for being comparatively unimpressive next to older FPS protagonists who really did move and fight like that.) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4">Halo 4</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo5Guardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo5Guardians">Halo 5: Guardians</a></em> made the effort to avoid this trope, giving the Spartans more in-game superhuman feats like climbing up ledges and natural sprinting, alongside <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionCommand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionCommand">Action Command</a> sequences that let you pry open doors and handle heavy items. You're still relatively slow, though (at least according to two specific books; they pointedly never demonstrate speed on that level in any of the cutscenes or films).
</li><li> Cutscenes tend to override any weapon selection your character may have had prior to it. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3ODST" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3ODST">Halo 3: ODST</a></em>, Romeo fires three shots at an enemy, and when gameplay starts, he's missing three rounds. But at the end of that segment, the cutscene has him wielding a sniper rifle, regardless of what he was using an instant earlier during gameplay. This is necessary for the Rookie to be able to find the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WreckedWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WreckedWeapon">broken rifle</a> later. This is especially odd on occasions where you aren't using a gun of any sort, but perhaps something like a giant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropTheHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropTheHammer">melee hammer</a>.
<ul><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2">Halo 2</a></em>, where the character does retain the weapon selection in the cutscene. However, it is always wielded as if it was the default weapon, causing some weapons to clip into the character model in certain scenes.

While the game is designed to hide the fact (again, as per usual in the genre), you are essentially walking down a straight tunnel, with little ability to alter your course or direction. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is cleverly justified by the revelation that you are mind-controlled, conditioned to perform any action prefaced with the phrase, "would you kindly".</span> This clever <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">deconstruction</a> of the genre earned praise, but Clint Hocking pointed out the problem in it: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Once the mind control is lifted, <em>the gameplay does not change</em>. You should expect to be able to choose any path you now wish, but you're as tightly controlled as ever, despite allegedly being free</span>.
</li><li> ADAM is described by NPCs as a substance you need to have injected into you to make plasmids and gene tonics work, and after that regular injections are required to prevent physical and psychological damage. In the game itself, it is simply treated like a currency you use to buy said plasmids and tonics, which cost no actual money besides. The game also features the corresponding EVE, which acts as fuel for the plasmids, and is never touched on in the narrative. One of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicServiceAnnouncement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicServiceAnnouncement">Public Service Announcements</a> might be lampshading this: "A Rapture reminder: We all have bills to pay, and the temptation to break curfew to make a little extra ADAM is forgivable..." So, wait, you can pay your bills in ADAM instead of dollars?
</li><li> ADAM is supposed to be overwhelmingly addictive, along with a classic case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity">With Great Power Comes Great Insanity</a>; most of the splicers attack the player because they think he's someone else, or in the hopes of getting more ADAM. None of these detrimental effects ever affect the player character, despite injecting liters of plasmids over the course of the game. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Justified however because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Jack</a> was genetically designed to be immune to the secondary effects of ADAM.</span>
</li><li> While the player gets no bad side effects from ADAM, almost no splicers get <em>good</em> effects. While Jack shoots lightning, fire, bees, and ice from his finger tips, only Houdini splicers (who can vanish and shoot flames) and Spider splicers (who can walk on walls) seem to have any rare abilities. The much more common Thuggish splicers and Leadhead splicers all rely on weapons to kill you.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShockInfinite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShockInfinite">BioShock Infinite</a></em> has a total of 8 Vigors. Several of these vigor containers can be found lying all over Columbia, one even appearing as a component of a game at the Columbia Raffle and fair, but only 3 of these Vigors are used by your enemies, and of those enemies, only a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniqueEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniqueEnemy">Unique Enemy</a> used 'Shock Jockey'. Also, the other two enemies who use Vigors, known as Firemen and Crows have seriously upgraded/modified versions of the Vigor; Firemen can release a blast of flames around themselves which is a kamikaze attack when they're low on health, and Crows, unlike Booker, can turn into ravens but only use them to attack in a cutscene, relying on a sword all other times.
<ul><li> Because of the depth of its story, Bioshock Infinite also provides an extreme example of a very common dissonance in FPS adventure games: both Booker and Elizabeth talk about their horror and shock at people killed or harmed by Comstock, yet in the action sequences of the game they slaughter many more people themselves with no emotional reaction. This is particularly notable because an early firefight <em>does</em> result in Elizabeth having a horrified reaction at how many people Booker kills in self-defense, and it's touched on again in a FEW of the later firefights, but overall goes unmentioned. It's almost like the story was written as a movie where only those few action scenes were present, and the bulk of the shooting galleries in the game weren't written to connect to the overall story.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> It's a plot point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER">STALKER</a>: Call of Pripyat</em> that anomalies move. In the game itself, however, none of them ever leave their positions.
</li><li> You will never see anyone firing anything other than the boring 'ol handgun in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeCrisis">Time Crisis</a></em> cutscene, despite the fact that machine guns, shotguns, and grenade launchers have all been standard equipment for some time. The funniest example would be Giorgio Bruno taking a few shots at a swarm of Terror Bites... this <em>after</em> you've taken out the last wave with a machine gun. Then there's Alicia Winston threatening Jake Hernandez with a handgun and firing a warning shot next to his head... the same head you've blasted several dozen times to get to this point, raising the obvious question of what the hell good one more is going to accomplish.
</li><li> Bill in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a></em> is stated to have suffered a knee injury from shrapnel during his tour of Vietnam, which makes it hard for him to walk or go up and down flights of stairs. In the game, he can run just as fast as the rest of the survivors. Adrenaline is a heck of an anesthetic.
</li><li> Coach goes through a similar thing in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2">Left 4 Dead 2</a></em>. Coach suffered a knee injury during college football and he hasn't been the same since then. Admittedly, being a defensive lineman doesn't necessarily require a lot of running, and the other three survivors clearly aren't more <em>fit</em> than he is, even if they're slimmer.
</li><li> No matter how injured Gordon Freeman gets in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em>, he can always be healed by health kits, and Alyx Vance has regenerating health which makes her almost as tough as Gordon. Gordon's healing can at least be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">hand waved</a> by his HEV suit's life support systems, but Alyx has no logical excuse. Then near the start of <em>Half-Life 2: Episode Two</em>, Alyx gets <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">stabbed by a Hunter, leaving her critically injured and apparently comatose</span>. Of course, Gordon has to go get larval extract from Antlions, as neither Health-kits, a medic, her regenerating health or <em>four</em> Vortigaunts can do anything more than stall her death.
<ul><li> Also, the HEV suit Gordon wears occasionally mentions administering morphine as its primary medical treatment but it also mentions injuries including major fractures and lacerations. While pain killers might help Gordon keep going a little longer, there's little reason as to how Gordon can get those wounds multiple times and not literally fall apart.
<ul><li> The suit also somehow prevents headcrabs from latching onto his head and turning him into a headcrab zombie even though it doesn't have a helmet.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Dallas in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaydayTheHeist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaydayTheHeist">PAYDAY: The Heist</a></em> is a chain smoker and is always out of breath, but that doesn't happen at all while you play as him, which is a good thing since you will be running around a lot.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon">Marathon</a></em> series consists of nothing more than jumping from one terminal to another while destroying Pfhor or sometimes human enemies with every gun you have, flipping switches and collecting components. The terminals really have no bearing on the plot in hindsight - in fact, the fan-made website "Marathon's Story", with all the terminals from the games, can be read to get the story without troubling yourself to reach each one.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997">GoldenEye (1997)</a></em> has a particularly jarring example of this. Natalia is supposed to be your ally in the single player campaign. If she's killed at any point during a mission, you automatically fail it. What's more: in the "Cuba" mission, she <em>just learned how to fire a gun</em> and is shown to be a pretty unskilled gunwoman. However, in the multiplayer mode, she's a playable character. Thus, in a multiplayer game, she and you can freely shoot/kill each other until your hearts' content. And her firing skills in the mode are every bit as capable as anybody else's. This is true for quite a few other characters in the game, as well. Even scientists and civilians (who are totally defenseless in the single player campaign) suddenly become ruthless killers when used in multiplayer.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark">Perfect Dark</a></em> did the same thing but hand waved it by referring to its multiplayer mode as a "Combat Simulator," with the implication that the matches were just computer simulations rather than reality.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MindJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MindJack">MindJack</a></em> had a similar issue with the player being able to transfer their consciousness to any NPC. While it is not unreasonable that a person mindjacked by an experienced marksman would become a good shot as a result, it is slightly odd that <em>every single NPC is apparently carrying a shotgun</em>, purely to pull out if they suddenly become the player character..
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Destiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Destiny">Destiny</a></em> has the mysterious Awoken, who live on a distant planet and have a strange and alien culture, which the player comes into contact with during the story... but they're also a playable character race. Meaning that if you play as an Awoken, you weirdly have no idea about your own culture or even who your Queen is. (This was later handwaved by the claim that Awoken born on Earth are commonly treated as outsiders, but this doesn't explain why your character wouldn't know about them.)
<ul><li> This game also has replaying missions be a regular part of the game, but when replayed they continue to have the same story dialog as they did on the first playthrough. Thus, you may find your Ghost will advise you of a good place to find a warp drive while actually warping to the planet it's talking about.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Destiny2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Destiny2">Destiny 2</a></em> begins with the villain blocking access to the Traveler, the entity which gives all Guardians their powers. Your Guardian alone discovers a shard of the Traveler which restores his/her powers alone. They are now uniquely placed to save the universe.. until you go to the first multiplayer sandbox map and meet hundreds of other Guardians who apparently all have exactly the same backstory.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch">Overwatch</a></em> separates its gameplay and lore as two different entities. The matches you play have nothing to do with the actual story and character relations.
<ul><li> Although most characters in the game have the same skills in the lore and in the game, the exception, for balance, seems to be Reaper, who in the official comics and shorts is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">seemingly indestructible</a> and is immune to the sleeping darts of Ana.
</li><li> The characters' actual personalities are also affected by this to some degree. In particular, Tracer's playful happy-go-lucky attitude to shooting enemies or planting sticky bombs on them is appropriate to the game where the enemy is simply eliminated and respawns in a few seconds. Imagining her having a similar attitude in the external setting where she would be <em>actually killing people</em> makes her appear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild">quite different</a>..
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands1">Borderlands 1</a></em>: If the player dies in the tutorial area, before, or immediately after, activating the Hyperion New-U Station, they're revived and placed at the point where they left the bus, but still get a financial loss and message like they actually used a New-U Station, even though they actually didn't. The New-U station doesn't act as the checkpoint for loading into the game, either. The one inside Fyrestone proper is the first one that does that.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands">Borderlands</a></em> eventually had to declare the New-U stations non-canon since it didn't make any sense that the cast would worry about dying when they just come back to life, or why the corporation that was trying to kill them would allow the machines they ran to resurrect the cast indefinitely for a pittance. The stations are still around, and they still talk to the player, but no one acknowledges them and they act more like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreekChorus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreekChorus">Greek Chorus</a>.

</div></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Blood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Blood">Blood</a></em> reveals very late into the game that, in fact, the reason the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> was after Caleb was that he knew Caleb would become stronger the more beings he killed, to the point of becoming nearly unstoppable, and he wanted to possess Caleb and use his body to dominate the world. In gameplay, Caleb is certainly a capable fighter, but as it's a first-person shooter, his combat skills pretty strictly manifest in the form of guns and temporary powerups. A Caleb at the start of the game who hasn't killed anything yet and a Caleb who's killed hundreds of enemies are exactly the same, barring only their equipment. And no matter where you get in the game, Caleb can (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">and will regularly</a>) be killed by regular ol' bullets and explosives.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Drakengard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Drakengard">Drakengard</a></em>, you're only allowed to take one party member with you into battle, and he doesn't follow along with you on the battlefield, no; you transform into him for a predetermined amount of time. Contrast this to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cutscene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cutscene">cutscenes</a>, which show all the party members present in the battles when applicable. Dragonfire kills anything human in a single blow, but not so for some higher-end Mooks in-game. Caim wields a relatively smallish BFS as his default weapon in the cutscenes, but his default weapon in-game is realistically proportioned to be used by a human being. Manah can obliterate armies in cutscenes, but never displays this sort of power when fighting you in-game. And so on in that order. Heck, an important NPC in <em>Drakengard 2</em> is one of the party members from the first game - who was completely unavailable until you beat the game once and as such never actually joins up with Caim or is even hinted to exist in the path to the ending that the second game follows from.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher3WildHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher3WildHunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a></em>, even though monsters are said to be growing rarer, you encounter them by the bucket-load at pretty much every single area you go to. This is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a>, though - the reason monsters are growing rarer (and the need for Witchers vanishing) is that monsters can easily be repelled with even a small military garrison. As the game takes place during an invasion of the Northern Kingdoms by the Nilfgaardian Empire, the armies are focused on the battlefield, allowing the monsters to make a comeback. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfGameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfGameplayAndStoryIntegration">Tellingly, the most common monsters you encounter are necrophages, which thrive in the conditions the war creates.</a>

Unlockable by collecting medals acquired from accomplishing some missions). Even though you play as Crimson in the gameplay, the cutscenes still shows Avalon only (a.k.a. Jake), while Diana still works as the supervisor in Nightwing spacecraft.

However, the in-game games have some in-game cheats that don't work in free play mode, even though it's supposedly the same game both times. Most likely this is because in the story mode, you unlock new games by beating their challenges, and the makers didn't want players to miss out on the later games if they can't beat the challenges; but in free-play, you're just challenging your best performance, so cheats would make the scores inaccurate.

However, to progress the story, you have to pass several checkpoints based around her Affection levels- which you have to raise by brewing potions to increase her attraction to you. Whoops.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder9');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MMORPGs&nbsp;</div><div id="folder9" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> This trope is pretty much universal and constantly active in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassivelyMultiplayerOnlineRolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassivelyMultiplayerOnlineRolePlayingGame">MMORPGs</a> &mdash; typically in the "infinite-lives bosses", the "what do you mean, resurrect spell?", <em>and</em> the "we desperately need level 1 fighters even though we have level 70 shopkeepers" varieties.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mogworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mogworld">Mogworld</a> is entirely based on doing this in the other direction.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> One of the more nonsensical examples is in the Caverns of Time dungeons, where PCs are sent back in time by the Bronze Dragonflight to various famous incidents in past <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em> titles. In many cases, most of the current playable races could not have been present for various reasons (Horde characters in particular, but also Night Elves and Draenei). So in those dungeons, those characters get hit with a illusion buff that disguises them as a Human for the duration of the dungeon. You would think this would make it an inversion of the trope, except that it also applies to Blood Elves&mdash;who all would have been Alliance High Elves in those days, and so could have been present for all these events. Turning them Human is just odd, when a simple eye color change would suffice. It's especially nonsensical in the Culling of Stratholme instance, where you see a variety of <em>Warcraft 3</em> units represented at the front gate of the city, one of which is a <em>High Elf Priest</em>. It turns specially weird when you take into account that classes aren't disguised in any way, so you can have Warlocks and Death Knights helping Thrall escape from Durnholde, shapeshifted Druids running about, and Humans casting Shaman spells. But no High Elves.
</li><li> In the game, four playable classes can remove curses and/or cure poisons and cast resurrection spells that will restore to life any player character they are cast on. But in the storyline of both tie-ins in other media and in the stories of the game's own quests, curing each type of disease or poison requires multiple unique components, death is feared like in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, and resurrection (not counting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong">Came Back Wrong</a>) is almost unheard of. For example, there's one quest in Northrend where you find a poor poisoned goblin and have to run around killing giant spiders until one of them barfs up a poison sac. Never mind that at least three classes can easily cure poisons, as well as anyone with high enough first aid has the ability to make antivenom out of those self-same spiders, or (by the game mechanics) if he died, four classes could easily resurrect him, and any engineer would have the ability to at least try. This problem is addressed somewhat in some later quests involving healing NPCs, in which you are given items that can heal their wounds, but also told you can use your healing skills if you so desire.
</li><li> The <em>Cataclysm</em> expansion added the ability for the Tauren race to become Paladins and Priests. That's all well and good, except in the game's lore, they <em>aren't</em> actually paladins <em>or</em> priests. While in Warcraft those classes wield the God-like power known as the Light, the tauren are unique in that their powers come from the literal sun itself, and worship of it. You'd never know in game, however, as they are functionally identical to the other priests and paladins regardless of their lore.
</li><li> In the Nightborne recruitment scenario Alleria, who is connected to the Void, triggers a void creatures outbreak which results in her banishment from Quel'Thalas. However, nobody would raise an eyebrow should the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> be a shadow priest, who are very likely to wield a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">sentient Void-serving dagger</a> well-known for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorrupter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorrupter">The Corrupter</a> on the scale it nearly drove an entire civilization to extinction.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em> has a rather glaring example of this in the Freedom Phalanx. The premier superheroes of the setting, akin to Superman, Batman, Captain America, and other A-listers... sit around waiting to give you quests, and generally do absolutely nothing else, with poor excuses for why they never fight at your side. In the few times you DO team up with them, they're generally as bad as any of the other NPC allies, and die in short order, while their villainous counterparts will kick your butt all over the surrounding environs, generally being some of the most dangerous bosses in the game. Even more confusingly, when you face the same heroes in <em>City of Villains</em>, you can do so in single combat, and they're now, like their counterparts, the hardest bosses in the game. Apparently the only time the game can give these people the powers they're storyline-wise credited with is when they're beating on you instead of random <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a>.

<ul><li> Your appearance is purely cosmetic. No matter which race you choose to make your avatar (And there are <em>a lot</em>), you'll still be treated as a normal human. The most blatant instance of this is if you choose to make yourself a vampire. Gaia Vampires <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">are weakened by sunlight</a> (though not killed), do require blood (though mostly drink a soy based substitute), and are weak against most of the traditional vampire weaknesses. And yet you can run around in broad daylight killing animated cloves of garlic with no side effects.
</li><li> If you carry actual weapons on your avatar, none of them can be used. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">explained</a> in the prologue "manga" to the game; regular weapons just plain <em>don't work</em> on the Animated. You have to use the rings and their powers to fight them. In the "manga" a powerful and popular knight tried to kill an Animated with "My <em><strong>ANCIENT KATANA!</strong></em>"... and got torn to pieces because it failed to harm it; and yet there's a Ring that creates a katana, which <em>does</em> work.

This is particularly notable with the healing companions, only three of which have medical training (the rest are slicers, archaeologists, or the like). Melee-based companions for non-force users also suffer from this; Torian Cadera is a sniper when you first meet him, while Tanno Vik is actually a demolitions specialist. The trooper's ranged damage companion also deserves mention; while Jorgan is a former member of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdSniper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdSniper">Deadeyes</a>, when he joins he uses...

The Sprites are the source of the good weather that gives the island prosperity, and therefore vitally important to everyone on the island. However, most of the Sprites you'll find are being held by random inhabitants of the island who give them to you as rewards for trivial tasks like winning a squid race. One merchant in town happens to possess a full 20% of them. Not a single inhabitant seems to realize that it might be a good idea to return the sprites themselves. To make matters worse, Mario gets blamed and arrested by the authorities for the incident that made the Shine Sprites disappear and has to solve their problem as punishment.

But despite this fact, only <em>one</em> Buzzy Beetle can be killed with fireballs: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman">the Fake Bowser at the end of World 3</a></span>.

One of the safes containing a page of the Thievius Racoonus can only be opened by defeating the game's final boss, and the level containing the safe must be replayed to actually get to the safe. For some reason, the level is also one of the few levels in the game where Sly encounters his nemesis Carmelita Fox. Therefore, if the player wishes to collect all of the pages in a game, then Sly and Carmelita have the same conversation twice, with it making absolutely no sense the second time around.

If they rebel, however, you can't continue with the story if the town in question has the next storyline quest. Since the cities count as mechanical creatures, you can even get the dwarf Kalkus to aid you in besieging his own homeland.
</li><li> Casual games can be even more prone to this trope than conventional video games. In the Hidden Object game <em>Escape The Museum 2</em>, the protagonist has to find several plot-irrelevant items in order to acquire pieces for a homemade battering ram, then assemble them correctly, in order to bash through a wooden door. One of these superfluous items, which you're not allowed to use for anything? A <em>chainsaw</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSeventhGuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSeventhGuest">The 7th Guest</a></em> and its sequel suffer terribly from this trope, the reason being mainly that the puzzles Henry Stauf set up throughout his mansion make the plot feel disconnected at times because of how hard, long, and sometimes annoying they seem to be. The cutscenes in the first game can become a clever thought puzzle in piecing together the order in which they occurred during that night, but the sequel had no such events, instead having the puzzles separated by arbitrary fetch quests hinted at from riddles Stauf gives you on the electronic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gamebooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gamebooks">Gamebook</a>.

<ul><li> The heroes are on a racing team...in the cutscenes. In gameplay, not so much. Ashelin, at least, is kind enough to warn us that she's going to take it all on herself, but nobody else seems to have much in the way of team spirit either; Jak can get blown up dozens of times by his closest friends.
</li><li> Similarly, your team doesn't make progress unless Jak specifically places. You can have Ashelin and Torn come in first and second and the game will treat that as your team being trampled.
</li><li> You need to rack up wins to earn access to the later races. Other people can just kind of turn up later on. This is perhaps understandable for people like Sig and Kleiver, who have history as Death NASCAR drivers; less so when it's Keira, who finally gets to drive at the last minute and nobody complains.
</li><li> GT Blitz refers to Jak as a "nimble and lightning-quick racer" even if you've been exclusively driving the big, tanky <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> vehicles.

<ul><li> One of the cutscenes in <em>II</em> depicts a human footman commandeering an orcish catapult and using it to destroy a goblin zeppelin. In gameplay, catapults can't even attack zeppelins, let alone strike them down in one hit.
<ul><li> In the Human ending to the "Tides of Darkness" campaign: No matter how you destroy the Dark Portal to end the war against the Orcs, the cutscene will always show the Arch Mage Khadgar using his magic ritual to destroy the portal. This can be quite noticeable, if you decided to use a force of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove">Gryphon Riders</a> to get the job done for the mission, and no Land troops were present on the land mass where the portal resides.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>III</em>, Arthas sells his soul in exchange for power by picking up the runeblade Frostmourne. In spite of this however, he goes from being a level 10 Paladin in the last human mission to being a level 1 Death Knight in the first undead level, leading to a massive drop in in-game stats, including inexplicably losing Frostmourne's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Chaos Damage</a>. Similarly, Illidan also sells his soul for power by consuming the Skull of Gul'dan. When he shows up later in <em>Frozen Throne</em>, his appearance has changed and he boasts about how powerful he is... but his stats aren't any different from that of a typical level 10 Demon Hunter.
</li><li> Another blatant one in TFT where Tyrande and Furion sail to Maiev's aid against Illidan. Illidan and Tyrande have dialogue if they meet in battle, but no matter how many times Furion and Illidan are in sight of or attack each other, Illidan is astounded to see his brother during the ending cutscene.
</li></ul></li><li> According to the backstory of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DefenseOfTheAncients" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DefenseOfTheAncients">Defense of the Ancients: All-Stars</a></em>, some of the heroes should be nearly invincible, and most of them should all already have tons (in some cases, literally eons) of battle experience. Yet they all start at level 1 with almost no spells available.

<ul><li> In all the games, Carriers and Battlecruisers are huge capital ships in all cutscenes, story sequences and novels, but in gameplay they are the size of a truck and can be shot down by rifle-wielding Marines, although it does take a somewhat appropriately large number of them.
</li><li> In one cutscene in Episode II, we see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSquad">half a dozen</a> or so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">Terran Marines</a> kill at least that many hydralisks before succumbing to their superior numbers; in gameplay Marines are far weaker, and hydralisks have ranged attacks instead of relying on their claws. Note also that Ghosts are never seen wearing any kind of helmet or breathing apparatus, despite their routine deployment in hard vacuum (probably not a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanCanBreatheInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanCanBreatheInSpace">Batman Can Breathe in Space</a> because cutscene Ghosts are always shown in an atmosphere or pressurized ship).
</li><li> In dialogue and cinematics, the viewer is given the impression that the Terrans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle">wouldn't stand a chance</a> in a straight fight with the Protoss, and that Terran technology is inferior to the Protoss. However, in actual gameplay, the Terrans play like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">glass cannons</a> who have plenty of firepower to give their foes a run for their money, though you do need sufficient micro management to unleash their potential. <br><br>Even more funny is that lack of certain abilities seem highly arbitrary. For instance the Terran Battlecruiser gained the ability to do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarpDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarpDrive">tactical jump</a> (like jumping into hyperspace) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftIILegacyOfTheVoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftIILegacyOfTheVoid">StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void</a></em> melee mode, and you'd think Protoss capital ships would have something similar considering the Protoss' prodigious knowledge. It's also funny that the Protoss didn't consider using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloakingDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloakingDevice">cloaking generators</a> on some of their aircraft &mdash; like with the Terran Banshee attack helicopter &mdash; and need to rely on cumbersome methods such as a nearby Mothership to provide a cloaking field. <br><br>This gets a pass for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetitiveBalance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetitiveBalance">Competitive Balance</a> however.

<ul><li> One mission during the main quest requires the player to rescue an Argonian being bullied and threatened by racist Dunmer. The Argonian says they refuse to listen to anything he says because of his race. Despite this, the player character can talk to the Dunmer and convince them to leave the Argonian alone, even if the player character is an Argonian him/herself. The racists don't even mention this.
</li><li> It is possible to become the leader of two Guilds or Factions which hate each other. For example, take the Mages Guild and House Telvanni. One quest for the Mages Guild requires you to root out a Telvanni spy within Guild leadership. You can be the Archmagister of House Telvanni, root out the spy who now technically works for you, and be rewarded by the Mages Guild for your good work. Another example, you may be the Mages Guild Archmage, but a House Telvanni quest will have you get the Mages Guild's monopoly on magical training dropped.
</li><li> Several characters will comment that outlanders are not well liked by the native Dunmer. This supposedly includes foreign-born Dunmer. However, a Dunmer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> will still get the standard +10 "same race" disposition boost when interacting with native Dunmer NPCs.

Justified, as there are no female generic Telvanni Guards, and only generic guards can arrest the player if a crime is committed.
</li><li> An early Mages' Guild questline involves a bet between the alchemist Ajira and the enchanter Galbedir on which apprentice will become journeyman first, with the player helping Ajira gain an edge... but Galbedir is already set as being a journeyman when the game starts, despite the plot treating her as still an apprentice. Oddly enough the game <em>does</em> have the mechanics to avoid this &mdash; there are scripting commands to raise or lower an NPC's rank in a faction &mdash; it just never uses them.

However, if the player is a Khajiit, they can freely enter and exit even <em>Windhelm</em> (where even Argonians aren't allowed) without any trouble aside from the occasional rude comment. While this can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">handwaved</a> after the player goes to see the Greybeards and it's revealed that they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a>, the player can go straight from the tutorial in Helgen to Windhelm with no trouble at all.

In the battle against him, he also used two of the Nocturnal abilities, one of them constantly, while normally a person can only possess one and it can't be used constantly. In the player's hands, it can only be used as an unbreakable lockpick and can't pick unpickable locks. The player character doesn't see the Skeleton Key the way <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mercer</span> does, though.
</li><li> In the <em>Dawnguard</em> DLC, one quest of the vampire questline involves turning <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the moth priest</span> into your thrall. The player uses vampire's seduction and then feeds on him to make him a thrall. The player can feed on almost any NPC like this, but it never makes a thrall.
</li><li> There is a lengthy sub-quest which can end with the player becoming arch-mage (read: head honcho) of the College of Winterhold. All the students and professors at the college will praise the character's intense magical abilities. Amusingly, however, the missions involved in the quest are fairly generic and don't require magical expertise. You can roll through the entire quest staving in heads with your warhammer while arrows bounce off your heavy armor, then have a distinguished professor of magic explain that you're the only magician skilled enough to lead the college. Also, despite being Arch-Mage, you still have to pay to get back in if you murder one of your students.

However, you're still able to use this system during the latter leg of the game, where Zack is on the run with Shinra Company hunting him down and gunning for his blood. In fact, it is completely impossible to avoid this segregation by finish all the side missions early. There are missions released only <em>after</em> the Nibelheim incident.

<ul><li> The Buster Sword. Its attack power and materia slots are some of the lowest in the game, but Cloud is always depicted wielding it in cutscenes, no matter what he's actually equipped with. This also applies to the rest of the characters. No matter what weapon they're equipped with, official art and cutscenes always shows them with the crappy, low-rent equipment they started with.
</li><li> The quintessential example, and one that was parodied at the time the game came out, is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aeris' death</span>. The game arbitrarily renders the equipment that the character was wearing as impossible to retrieve.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6rpj5');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6rpj5" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6rpj5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Yet it gives you back all the equipped materia.</span> It's also never suggested that anyone could try to use a Phoenix Down to revive the character in question. This is despite characters routinely falling in battle, with a 0 HP meter, who can be easily revived with a single use of the object. This is because the story relies on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aeris'</span> actions from beyond the grave.
</li><li> The abovementioned problem with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlapOnTheWristNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlapOnTheWristNuke">Slap-on-the-Wrist Nuke</a> attacks is all the more problematic in a game where the actual plot involves Sephiroth trying to use the Meteor spell to blast a chunk out of the world. Over the course of the game, you'll pick up or observe spells and summons that (in other games, anyway) are <em>far</em> more powerful than Meteor, and whose attack animations seem like they should do even more damage to the planet in general. The infamous Supernova attack should be more than enough to fulfill Sephiroth's plan, for instance. (To the game's credit, Meteor itself is off-limits to the player and enemies.)
</li><li> After Cloud, Tifa and Aerith are dumped into the sewers under Don Corneo's mansion, both Tifa and Aerith are lying passed out on the ground and will not get up until Cloud talks to them. Despite this, it is possible to run around and get into a random battle, and both will be present and active in the battle party.

<ul><li> The player gets a regular paycheck from their organization, SeeD, which is based on their SeeD rank. This works fine, until about halfway through Disc 2 when the player is made the commander of Balamb Garden. You would think that this would give you a pay raise. But no, your rank doesn't so much as rise a single level when you are promoted, and it is still possible to be <em>demoted</em> and receive a pay cut. Storywise, you're the highest ranking person in the Garden. You can even be demoted in the few areas where you only control Rinoa, the only member of the party who <em>isn't</em> working for SeeD, near the end of Disc 1. Even more confusing, after time starts compressing at the end of the game and you are thrown out of time into the future and can no longer interact with towns and most NPCs, you still are paid at regular intervals. That's a pretty impressive banking system.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rinoa</span> becomes a Sorceress later in the game. The Sorceress are able to naturally use magic, without needing to Draw spells from monsters. Obviously, this doesn't apply to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rinoa</span> (she can do this during her Limit Break, though, but the same applies to Selphie as well, who is not a Sorceress).
</li><li> One interesting case comes up during a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">Self-Imposed Challenge</a> in which the player doesn't use the Junction system. One person doing the challenge reflected on how, after learning that the Guardian Forces caused memory loss, the heroes acknowledged that they only got this far because they used them, and pointed out that this was not the case.
</li><li> During the prison sequence, you're told that there's an anti-magic field in the prison that prevents magic from being cast properly. Selphie attempts to use cure, but it doesn't work very well. As such, they say that they have to rely on their weapons, so it's up to Zell, since he uses his fists as his weapons. However, the second you gain control of Zell, he has full access to and use of magic, and so do your other characters during the battle with Biggs and Wedge. Afterwards, when you leave the cell, an announcement comes on that the anti-magic field will be lifted. This, however, doesn't explain why your characters were able to use magic before it was lifted.

This only applies to battles, though, as she is perfectly capable of using any healing spell from the menu.

<ul><li> The intro cutscene is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMediasRes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMediasRes">dozens of hours into the story</a>, yet the pile of weapons it opens looking at includes Yuna's original staff (which you likely ditched after <em>the first temple</em>, if you got the Destruction Sphere). It also has Wakka's bright blue Official Ball, at a point where your primary weapon for Wakka is most likely either wrapped in iron rings or encrusted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpikesOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpikesOfDoom">Spikes of Doom</a>, but it wouldn't be out of character for him to have brought a spare ball for practice; hard to do <em>that</em> when a bad catch will turn you to stone.
</li><li> Prior to the first Blitzball tournament, everyone talks about how the Luca Goers are the best team and they always win every tournament. However, once you get past the first tournament and start playing for real, you find that's not the case. In terms of player stats, the Al Bhed Psyches are by far the best team and the Goers are kind of middling. It raises the question of how the Aurochs were able to beat the Psyches in the first tournament, especially when their star player Tidus was off trying to rescue Yuna.
</li><li> The thing that made Final Fantasy X different from the other Final Fantasy games (besides the Sphere Grid system) was the ability to switch Yuna's seven guardians between the three battle line spots to the four reserve spots. Even though the cast have valiantly fought together side by side in cutscenes, if the three main battle contenders are KO'ed, then it doesn't matter how strong or healthy your reserve members are, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyBackup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyBackup">the entire world is doomed because they couldn't be bothered to toss you over a Phoenix Down.....</a>

You can also equip any character with any weapon, but all cutscenes will show them completely unarmed. You therefore have the jarring contrast of the playable characters being ultra-powerful warriors, able to summon world-rending cataclysms at will (quickenings are the worst offenders), but nothing in the story hints at how they're able to accomplish these things. Every post-boss battle scene seems to imply that the enemy just politely agreed to kill themselves.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em> characters seemingly pick their cutscene weapons at random.

Even though they take over the city, and presumably the rest of Japan, without much resistance, and despite the fact that said battalion is parading around <em>in mech suits</em>, they don't bother wrecking whatever malls and shopping areas are left (some get wrecked during the game, but before the Last Battalion showed up). This allows Tatsuya and co. to do whatever shopping they need unmolested.
</li><li> A nefarious case in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> comes when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shinjiro is shot to death by Takaya. No one attempts to heal him (it is still the Dark Hour when it happens, so someone could use a healing spell) or even attempt to stop the bleeding normally, despite the fact that the party at this point has arguably gotten far worse injuries in their battles with Shadows and have come out of them without much of a problem. This also mixes with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax">Cutscene Power to the Max</a> - Junpei is also shot and nearly killed by Takaya a month later, but when you fight him in battle, his bullets don't do too much damage.</span>

The 7th Dungeon's "Time is Up" cutscene involves The Traitor invading your hideout. The Traitor is also the last midboss of the 7th Dungeon, and once you beat them, circumstances arise (Namely, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Akechi pulls a last second <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a> and apparently goes down in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to save your party from an ambush.

</li><li> The stated requirement for the test to earn S Rank is for the twins to pour their passion into a single item of amazing quality to turn in to Mireille. However, all you're actually required to do is turn in an item that's good enough to pass the first line, and if it doesn't, you can just deliver two or three crappy D-level items until you pass the line and then choose the "report" option. Mireille will tell you that just barely passed and to do better next time (though there isn't one) and everything else will play out exactly the same, with Mireille praising Lydie and Sue for successfully reaching S Rank and saying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoProudOfYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoProudOfYou">how proud she is of them</a>.

In the Organization, only Roxas (and later Xion) can use the Keyblade, making them invaluable to the Organization. In Gameplay, though, the hearts are collected when any of your allies defeat an Emblem Heartless, even if it was defeated by someone without a Keyblade. You also get the hearts if you (or an ally) defeat them with magic instead of a weapon.
<ul><li> Going with the above, the story likes to say that Heartless can only be defeated at all with a Keyblade and demonstrate by giving you a mundane weapon early on that has no effect on Heartless until you get the Keyblade, but in game anyone can fight them as if they were regular monster. Even worse, in the first game, you temporarily <em>lose</em> the Keyblade &mdash; this does torpedo your Attack and Magic stats, but you're still capable of dealing <em>some</em> damage with the very same wooden toy sword that passed through Shadows at the beginning of the game like they were intangible.

While Gyarados has the excuse that it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingSeafoodSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingSeafoodSpecial">able to float in the air</a> and Archen learns to fly after it evolves, there is no such excuse for the ostrich-like Doduo and Dodrio. Additionally, later generations introduced new ground moves that theoretically should be able to hit even something flying, such as Mud Shot, but they still obviously do not work on Flying-types.
<ul><li> There's also the inversion: Pok&eacute;mon who are depicted as flying or hovering but can be hit by Ground-type moves like Magnitude and Earthquake due to them not actually being Flying-types or having Levitate as their Ability. Some of, them, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingSeafoodSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingSeafoodSpecial">Nihilego</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnetismManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnetismManipulation">Magnezone</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent">Mega Charizard X</a>, even take super-effective damage from these moves.
</li></ul></li><li> A lot of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlavorText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlavorText">Flavor Text</a> provided by the Pok&eacute;dex directly contradicts gameplay or Pok&eacute;mon stats.
<ul><li> Supposedly, Charizard's fire breath is hot enough to melt boulders. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors">A Fire-type move used by Charizard on a Rock-type will still deal half damage.</a>
</li><li> Metapod and Kakuna are supposed to be totally immobile and only know Harden. Although Metapod and Kakuna (and other cocoon mons) caught in the wild will only known Harden, any such mon evolved by the player will carry its previous moves&mdash;String Shot and either Tackle or Poison Sting&mdash;forward.
</li><li> Nidorina and Nidoqueen are unable to breed, but several Pok&eacute;dex entries talk about how they take care of their young.
</li><li> Drowzee and Hypno are said to live off of dreams; it's their defining trait. The one attack that literally involves this, Dream Eater, is not in their level-up movepool, although they do learn it by TM.
</li><li> Abra is said to sleep through most of the day, teleporting away from danger in its sleep. They are not immune to being inflicted with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusAilments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusAilments">the Sleep status</a>, and are affected by it normally.
</li><li> Its evolved form, Alakazam, remembers <em>everything</em> - but can still learn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedMoveArsenal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedMoveArsenal">only four moves</a>.
</li><li> Cubone is said to wear the skull of its dead mother, but you can freely breed Cubone without any ill efforts for the mother.
</li><li> Many Pok&eacute;dex entries for the Slowpoke line make mention of Shellder biting onto a Slowpoke's tail/head in order to evolve. Having a Shellder is not required for Slowpoke to evolve, and the evolution can happen on top of a mountain miles away from ocean.
</li><li> Similarly, Magneton is said to be the result of three Magnemite being linked together by a powerful magnetic force. Three separate Magnemite are not required for obtaining a Magneton. Diglett and Dugtrio are more ambiguous, as the Pokedex entries seem a bit indecisive as to whether or not Dugtrio has three heads or is a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDividual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDividual">The Dividual</a>. However, they are often claimed to be triplets.
</li><li> Arcanine is renowned for its impossible speed, but its Speed stat isn't that high and easily beaten by other Pok&eacute;mon.
</li><li> Doduo is stated to be a poor flyer that makes up for it with its fast ground speed. Nothing impedes it from learning Fly, and using that move to travel from one side of the map to the other while carrying a ten-year-old that weighs as much as it does. Vullaby is even worse, being explicitly flightless and still able to learn the move. Meanwhile, there's a lot of Flying-types that seem like they should be able to fly around while carrying a person, but can't learn Fly (Noivern, Gyarados, Scyther, Togekiss, and especially Yanmega, which has has a dex entry claiming it can carry people while flying).
</li><li> Magcargo's body temperature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale">is supposedly hotter than the surface of the sun</a>. While this should kill everything on Earth, it doesn't.
</li><li> Qwilfish is often referred to as a bad swimmer, but one of its abilities is Swift Swim (which doubles its Speed in rain).
</li><li> Staring into the hole in Shedinja's back is supposed to mesmerize and then steal the soul of the victim. All of its player-side battle sprites have the hole clearly visible, but nothing unusual ever happens to the player character.
</li><li> Regice is stated to be so cold that it can be dipped in magma without harm and can freeze anything that gets near it. Fire-type moves will still harm it and Pok&eacute;mon can make contact with it without any ill effects.
</li><li> Spiritomb is supposed to be made up of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">108 souls sealed in a stone</a>, but it can breed and create more Spiritomb.
</li><li> Wailord is supposedly 14.5 meters tall and is presumably the length of a real blue whale, yet its battle model shows it smaller than its trainer. This is obviously so it doesn't take up the whole screen and force the camera to be zoomed ridiculously far out. Some even say that its Dynamax form is how big it really is.
</li><li> Female Unfezant are claimed to be better flyers than their male counterparts (possibly as a nod to how the long flashy tails of some real male pheasants <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">tend to weigh the birds down then they're flying</a>). The base stats for both sexes are exactly the same.
</li><li> The Pok&eacute;dex entry for Escavalier says it flies around at high speed. Its base speed is <strong>twenty</strong>, making it one of the slowest Pokemon in the entire game.
</li><li> Goomy's entry describes it as the weakest of all Dragon-types. Stat-wise, that designation belongs to Noibat.
</li><li> Feebas is stated to be a very common Pokemon that flocks in stagnant ponds and is often ignored by trainers due to its ugly appearance and low stats. When it was first introduced, it may have been the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">single hardest Pokemon to find in the wild at the time</a>. Also, the only place you could find it at was a river, not a pond, and it was highly sought after by players, since evolving it was the only way to get Milotic. Mercifully, it was made much easier to find in later generations, but it's still far from common.
</li><li> Many entries for legendary Pok&eacute;mon describe them of having various kinds of powers that should devastate the local area or the world (Lugia for example is said to have the ability to cause days long storms by just <em>flapping its wings</em>). While a legendary Pok&eacute;mon do have high stats in game, they aren't strong enough to decimate their opponents easily and can be taken down by more common Pok&eacute;mon. Likewise, legendary Pok&eacute;mon don't make a dent in the area if you use them in battle.
</li></ul></li><li> Any Pok&eacute;mon can have any nature, regardless of how its species is described in the Pok&eacute;dex. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">Piplup</a> can be Modest. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout">Loudred</a> can be Quiet. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Exeggcute</a> can be Lonely. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly">Misdreavus</a> can be Serious. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedDefeatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedDefeatist">Archen</a> can be Brave. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Necrozma</a> can be Docile. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Mewtwo</a> can be Gentle...
</li><li> Pok&eacute;mon with visible flames on their bodies (the Charmander line, Moltres, Magmar, etc) should logically be snuffed out if they're in the middle of a rainstorm or when hit by a water based attack. Despite how certain fire type Pok&eacute;mon are said to die if their flames go out, said flames never get extinguished. This gets taken to a ridiculous degree in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Pok&eacute;mon Ruby and Sapphire</a></em> where you can send out fire based Pok&eacute;mon to battle while <em>underwater</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesSeries">Tales Series</a></em> is generally pretty bad about plot-based injuries and the fact that you're usually carrying around a ton of medicine or food items that you can cook with. It's often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Waved</a> by the healers, trying First Aid for a couple seconds and going "there's nothing I can do" or "they're too far gone." And then all the games have their own little quirks...
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a></em> while Colette can fly, her in-battle motion only changes its <em>animation</em>, not its nature. She never uses her flight to bypass any of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SolveTheSoupCans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SolveTheSoupCans">random puzzles</a>, even though she <em>does</em> use her flight to pick up a vital key &mdash; <em><strong>once</strong></em>, in the game's 40-hour plotline.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss">Tales of the Abyss</a></em>, Guy, one of the protagonists, has a crippling fear of women (to the point that being glomped by one early in the game is sufficient to give him a momentary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a>). This doesn't seem to pop up when in battle, even against female enemies. It's indicated that he can overcome it given sufficient motivation, like when he grabs Anise's arm to pull her up when she almost falls off a cliff, so it's possible battle is one such case (or else, that he never physically comes into contact with them during it).
<ul><li> Tear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax">put an entire mansion of people to sleep and almost assassinated one of the most powerful members of the Oracle Knights</a> in an early cutscene. In actual gameplay, she's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage">White Mage</a> (though she can be played offensively, she's got the better set of healing spells).
</li><li> Also, the technique Tear uses to send the entire mansion to sleep is supposed to be a powerful spell that only does just that. Gameplay wise, it does damage like a normal attack, without any special effects.
</li><li> Despite how Natalia and Luke are supposed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef">terrible cooks</a>, they seem to do just fine when asked to cook recipes.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfLegendia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfLegendia">Tales of Legendia</a></em>, once Grune gets her memory back <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and is revealed to be an all-powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a></span>, you'd think she'd get stronger now that she actually knows who she is, what her powers are, and how to properly use them. Nope. Although there is some Integration here, as her battle quotes (and even the pitch of her voice!) all change to reflect her sudden change in personality.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfBerseria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfBerseria">Tales of Berseria</a></em>:
<ul><li> Regardless of how modest, prim and proper whatever costume you choose to dress Velvet up in might be, certain NPCs will comment on the scandalous nature of Velvet's clothing as if she's wearing her default outfit.
</li><li> Flamestone is said to be increasingly rare due to the global cooling and therefore increasingly valuable. Despite this, the Flamestone Chips you can find lying around as a random treasure specks on the ground sell for only a pittance and always for the same amount.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ultima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ultima">Ultima</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVI">Ultima VI</a></em>: Despite being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox">Wide Open Sandbox</a>, not all NPCs respond accurately to what's going on in the game world. Casting your best healing spell on Matt the cook does nothing, nor does it help the wounded soldiers Ed , Artegal, Gertan and Gilron in Cove. Thindle the weaver points to your stomach in dialogue even if you are wearing full armor. Freeing Boskin or other prisoners in Yew will not alter their behavior or dialogue. Solving the Skara Brae murder does nothing in-game. Like most <em>Ultima</em> games, dialogue about other characters being alive will remain that way even when the character has been killed, unless there is a specific flag triggered by that character's death such as Phoenix. Some characters will have different dialogue about each other if another character is in the party or in proximity, but only if scripted to; otherwise moving another character close by will have no effect. Terri mentions silver and copper pieces as standard currency; only gold can be found in-game. Selganor's questions about Mandrake Root prepared with a silver fork, the cap of Nightshade Mushrooms used in spellcasting, and Black Pearls being used as a propellant, are not evident in game, though there are cannons and powder kegs. The Compendium states reagents are prepared at the moment of spellcasting, with descriptions for each reagent which are not reflected in-game. Black Pearls are a one in ten thousand rarity, and only those perfectly formed are suitable or they are worthless. Blood Moss is found under rotting bark. Garlic is washed and ground. Ginseng is reboiled in fresh water forty times. Mandrake Root is boiled and dried. Spider Silk is used by the ounce. In-game, reagents are used as whole items, with no preparation, measured in stones. <em>The Ultima 6 Project</em> fixes some of this.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVI">Ultima VI</a></em>, one is told by Lord British to be a guest upon the house and dine in the banquet hall and partake of a dinner which is most eloquently prepared and indeed one does so by grabbing the very utensils which one would expect to utilize at that very moment and then all in the area will say STOP THIEF and aggro upon thine ass and then one will regret banqueting upon the very dinner of Lord British and this is referenced later as The Fork of Doom!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIII">Ultima VIII</a></em>: The Plateau is described as having mysterious balls of light. None are found there, aside from the Ethereal Void Mythran's house is inside of.

Also, when you unlock the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">chapter select feature</a>, you can partner with any character on any day, even if, in the chapter you select, the character has not met Neku yet or has vanished. The exception is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> boss battles, which you're required to win to obtain the Secret Reports &mdash; you'll be forced to play with the appropriate partner, even if you'd really, really, really prefer to use someone else. It's also averted in the 11-battle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">Boss Rush</a> challenge, which swaps your partners every few battles. Built up a fusion attack but didn't use it yet? Too bad, that partner is long gone. (Or you could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">learn what you're up against beforehand</a>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VampireTheMasqueradeBloodlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VampireTheMasqueradeBloodlines"> Vampire: The Masquerade &#150; Bloodlines</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game is based on the tabletop RPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade">Vampire: The Masquerade</a></em>. Of course, for gameplay reasons, disciplines work differently in the game than in the RPG... <em>except in cutscenes</em>. For example, in one scene, Beckett uses his Protean discipline to change into a wolf, which is a perfectly valid usage in the tabletop RPG but something you can't do even with maxed Protean in-game. Later on, a vampire uses Presence to seduce a mortal: Again, perfectly valid in the RPG, but in the game Presence is entirely useless to you outside of combat. Likewise, an empty dumpster or wooden crate shouldn't be able to stymie your progress toward the end of the game, by which time you have Strength and Potence 5; in the actual tabletop game, you could deadlift a truck at that point. The Unofficial patch actually fixes some of these issues, granting the option to change Protean's final form so you can turn into a wolf and making Presence usable out of combat to seduce mortals.
</li><li> In the climax of the game, if you picked the Kuei-Jin ending, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you are somehow unable to defend yourself when Ming-Xiao betrays you, even though the other endings have you tear through ten times the number of minions she uses to restrain you</span>.

The mission where Alicia sprains her ankle and must hobble around the map to find a plant that Welkin can use to gradually heal it. The player can still use Ragnite to heal the wounds she gets during the mission, but it does nothing for the sprain. The teamwork themes occasionally suffer, since the game can't predict whether or not any of Squad 7 may die, so it's likely that many of the player's favorite squad members have no impact on the plot and don't appear in cutscenes. After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Alicia becomes a Valkyria</span> she has an existential crisis over her new ability to kill enemy soldiers and tanks... except she's a powerhouse on the field, and can easy rack up a higher body count than most of your shocktroopers because of her extremely high accuracy and headshot rate, which means she's apparently okay with taking Mooks down execution style, but not with a laser. And after having taken Marberry Shore, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">during this and all other missions, your troops can take an anti-tank round to the face at point blank range and be rescued by a medic, but in the cutscene Isara takes a shot in the back and neither the medic nor ragnaid is a benefit</span>.

<ul><li> At one point you cannot get past a northern checkpoint because the game involves going around with a king who has been transformed into a monster, and they won't let a monster in. However, at this point the hero has learned a spell to teleport him and his party to any city he has been to. If the story treated this spell as existing, he could go through the checkpoint alone, reach the next city, return, then teleport back to the city with the king and party. For that matter, half the stores in the game sell an item that has the same effect (Chimaera wings), so it wouldn't necessarily have to be the hero who could go alone. Heck, they could find a random guy who's been to the city and pay him to transport them there. If the game's plot considered this, though, then keeping borders secure would be nearly impossible.
</li><li> The main plot involving the villain's murder spree, complete with you being forced to sit through a funeral for one of the victims. Instead of, I don't know, dragging the victim back into the church to be resurrected like you did all the times someone in your party has been killed in random battles.
</li></ul></li><li> The opening scene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantomDust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantomDust">Phantom Dust</a></em> has a team of espers scorch scores of monsters with single attacks when two of said monsters would be challenging to the player. This may be justified by the fact that some of the monsters look a little more sickly they do in the game proper. Another example is characters performing feats like telekinetically hurling what appears to be half a sky scraper at you when the player, who is easily the most powerful esper in the game, has no such abilities.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Anachronox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Anachronox">Anachronox</a></em> has the main character in trouble with a local mob boss who he owes a large amount of money to. However, being an RPG you can make huge amounts of money from fighting monsters. Alternately, the next locale you visit has trading robots which you can use to make a fortune with. Problem is, you cannot use this money to pay back the mob boss - the option simply doesn't exist and the debt comes back to bite you later on.

Yet in games like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XMenLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XMenLegends">X-Men Legends</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelUltimateAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelUltimateAlliance">Marvel Ultimate Alliance</a></em> and most other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel</a> games, he can end up getting his ass kicked (as a playable character or boss) by the likes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Colossus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Colossus">Colossus</a>, Crimson Dynamo, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a>, Lady Deathstrike, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ultron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ultron">Ultron</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WarMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WarMachine">War Machine</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">Wolverine</a>, when story-wise they shouldn't be able to move, let alone fight.

</li><li> At one point in the RPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Odium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Odium">Odium</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">team medic</a> gets attacked and poisoned by an invisible monster, cannot be cured, and dies at the end of the battle (and states that the grotesquely deformed bodies you found earlier are, too, victims of this poison).</span> Near the end of the game, you battle a group of these monsters, but their poison can be cured away and only does minor damage like any other monster's poison.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ParasiteEve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ParasiteEve">Parasite Eve</a></em> Aya can be wielding a shotgun, rifle, machine gun, grenade launcher, or even a damn rocket launcher, but these weapons are never rendered outside of battle. Aya is always shown using a handgun on the overworld maps and during cut scenes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a></em>:
<ul><li> In this and other Infinity Engine games, there are a number of resurrection spells and items that can bring your group members back from the dead. However, when the plot calls for a character to die, they die... and the option of resurrection is never even brought up.
<ul><li> It is however pointed out at least two times in the sequel that a character is too irremediably decomposed, profaned, mailed or corrupted for any resurrection or healing spells to work.
</li></ul></li><li> Irritating example: The background fluff claims that lots of people prefer carrying handy little gems instead of weighty gold coins. For the player, the utility is reversed: Gold is weightless and its value is precise, while gems' values are unknown and they clutter up your limited inventory space.
</li><li> In the sequel, after you escape the chapter 1 dungeon, a cutscene will trigger with Imoen casting magic missile, even if she used all her spells while controlled by the player. More silly if the player erased all her learned spells from her mage book.
</li><li> The sequel establishes a canon party that traveled with the protagonist during the first game. Some other characters returning from the first game can be met and the player can ask questions like "didn't you die?", that can sound a bit silly to say to someone in the middle of a conversation, but is a quite reasonable way to manage the dissonance between a character effectively dying during the playthrough and later appearing in the sequel as if nothing happened. However, there is one case that induces a plothole: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Imoen is revealed to be a child of Bhaal, thus she can't be normally resurrected, as when she dies, her corpse turns into dust (like Sarevok and Charname) and her soul rejoins the essence of Bhaal, speeding his resurrection. However, in the first game she can die and be resurrected every time the player wants. She could also die at the beginning of chapter 1 and be resurrected after months of in-game time for the final fight. In the expansion <em>Throne of Bhaal</em> the developers seem to acknowledge this dissonance by having Imoen discuss death and resurrection ("tell me, how is dying?" "I'm surprised that you make me this question, silly girl, I would expect you to have a discount at the local Helm's temple" "yes but it's not the same thing, it's like darkness and then you awake elsewhere" - the latter potentially a dissonance itself if she never died during your playthrough)</span>.
</li><li> In the sequel you are forced to join one side in the struggle between the shadow thieves and the vampires, even if the character is a paladin who would have big moral troubles in joining any of the parts (although the player could roleplay that it's the only available path to advance to the final goal, the main character simply accepts without questioning, however some companions might argue against specific choices). An undead hunter main character, or a ranger with vampires set as the racial enemy, could even join the vampires without any question. Some modders have created a mod called "Alternatives" which allows for different paths in order to progress the story, for those player who find hard to roleplay certain choices.
</li><li> Speaking of undead hunters and ranger racial enemies, in the Enhanced Edition there is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hexxat</span> that can join the party without any problem from Charname. Even if the player activates the turn undead button, no effect happens. Neither Minsc, who has vampires as racial enemies, raises any opposition at any point in the game.
</li><li> A wizard slayer Charname can freely recruit only magical companions with no one of them ever complaining.
</li><li> A paladin robbing a mansion or paying for gladiatorial combat between slaves? No problem, your status won't drop (in the Forgotten Realms, paladins get their powers from a deity and they lose them if they betray their vow) unless you get caught and kill the guards, thus losing enough reputation.
</li><li> It is perfectly reasonable to just meet a new character at the moment and then bring him/her into an epic final boss battle 15 seconds after joining the party for the first time, without any complaint, he/she even make comments like a seasoned companion.
</li><li> You can murder innocent people, raise your reputation through donations or specific quests, and everybody will forget your crimes and never rise any question.
</li><li> You can behave as a good paragon or an evil bastard, yet choose dialogue lines that are the complete opposite of your backstory. Even silly, you can choose a good line and then an evil line and viceversa, or even choose the same question and answer differently to the same character, ultimately contradicting yourself many times during a dialogue.
</li><li> If you summon monsters or undead in the middle of a city or inside someone else's home, nobody will complain.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic</a></em>, despite the Sith guards on Taris supposedly looking for Bastila, they'll never comment on her presence <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck">even when she walks past them in her Jedi robe wielding a lightsaber</a>. Maybe they're just <em>that</em> stupid, which might explain why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Malak</a> so quickly opted to destroy the entire planet.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublicIITheSithLords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublicIITheSithLords">Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords</a></em>:
<ul><li> Nar Shaddaa is home to the Jekk'Jekk Tarr, a bar that caters to aliens and sports a piped-in atmosphere toxic to humans. When the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> goes there as part of the game's overarching story, he/she is informed that a breathmask will be insufficient protection and a full-body containment suit is called for, as the poison can be absorbed through the skin. This will come as a surprise to any player who already completed an earlier sidequest by, yes, putting on a breath mask and just walking around as normal. And when you actually enter the JJT, you walk in, nearly asphyxiate, and then Kreia teaches you a Force power called Breath Control, which makes you immune to poison. But you don't even have to use it if you just... equip a breath mask.
</li><li> Subverted later in the game. The various Jedi Masters you're searching for will act as though your character is still cut off from the Force when you talk to them, totally ignoring something like the possibility that you were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JediMindTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JediMindTrick">mind-controlling mercenaries</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">blasting entire rooms of people with lightning from your hand</a> right in front of them not five minutes prior. There's a reason for that, though.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InazumaEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InazumaEleven">Inazuma Eleven</a></em> every soccer player can jump almost as high as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Saiyans</a> in a soccer match to create super natural moves, but none of the members in your team thinks of jumping across a small river to get to pieces of wood to create a bridge so that their van can cross, and you have to go around the whole maze-like forest.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalSonata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalSonata">Eternal Sonata</a></em>:
<ul><li> People who suffer from incurable illnesses develop the ability to use magic. As you advance into the game, you see that in fact everyone in your party is capable of using magic in battle; each character has "Magic" as a value in their stats. Still, the game says that just Polka and Chopin are ill and the only ones in your party that can use magic. Some characters even praise that capacity.
</li><li> It's said that nobody is buying floral powder from Tenuto anymore because of the cheapness of the mineral powder. Yet just about every store in the game that sells items to your party carries healing powers that are described as powders made from flowers from Tenuto. This sort of segregation is probably also the reason why, once your party has a massive amount of Gold, Allegretto and Beat don't hand a bunch of it over to the kids in the sewers so they don't have to live there anymore.
</li><li> This is also the main reason why Allegretto can't stop mocking Beat's obsession with photography, even though 12 haphazard shots of any random monster nets you more Gold than he's probably seen in a year, maybe even his entire life.
</li><li> Even if you go through the trouble of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">getting Claves back from the bonus dungeon Mysterious Unison</span>, the game basically acts as if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she isn't there</span> for any few remaining scenes in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her presence</span> would be a factor, including the game's ending sequence. In fact, the only time this isn't true is in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> exclusive bonus dungeon in which you can get an altered scene with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her presence in the party</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Kaelyn the Dove in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a>: Mask of the Betrayer</em> calls herself a doomguide, but has no levels in that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass">Prestige Class</a> since it wasn't added to <em>NWN2</em> until the <em>Storm of Zehir</em> expansion. Furthermore, Doomguide, in addition to being used for priests of Kelemvor with special Kelemvor-suited training (IE, having levels in the Doomguide prestige class), is also used as a term for priests of Kelemvor &mdash; which Kaelyn the Dove (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> no longer</span>) is.
</li><li> Caster from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateExtra">Fate/EXTRA</a></em> states that she's just a normal girl in terms of physical prowess. She's not even heavily skilled in melee combat by normal, real-world standards. Doesn't stop her from physically striking iron-bodied servants that can move faster than sound and actually hurting them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder">Fate/Grand Order</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Assassin class is stated to be the worst physical combatant of the various classes, and best for stealth tactics and picking off specific priority targets who can't overpower them (especially normal humans). However, in the game proper, an Assassin is no weaker than any other Servant of the same star level aside from a 10% damage penalty (which they share with the Caster class and isn't much lower than the penalty Archers get). To the contrary, due to the game giving Assassin a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors">Tactical Rock&#150;Paper&#150;Scissors</a> advantage over the Rider class, and many giant enemies being Riders, Assassins are somewhat memetic in the fandom for these sneaky rogues, serial killers, and executioners being able to tank the blows of giant monsters and kill them in one shot, while the powerful mages, demigods, and dragon-slayers struggle to do the same.
</li><li> Due to the game's summoning mechanics, it's very possible to have a character who's a major player in the story mode in your party by the time you reach that point. For instance, say you roll Merlin on a banner or use your friend's Merlin through Supports, and then reach Babylon, where you meet a mysterious mage who helps you out. The characters still act shocked when the mage turns out to be Merlin, even if they've been fighting alongside him for some time and know exactly what he looks like. This was given a bandage by a system where many newer Servants are not referred to by their True Name until you reach their part of the story; for instance, if you haven't played Shinjuku and you summon or use <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Moriarty</span>, then the game refers to him primarily as "Archer of Shinjuku" and even blanks out the name of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">his Noble Phantasm</a> to avoid making it obvious who he is.
</li><li> Overlapping with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPower">Popularity Power</a>, a lot of Servants have rarities or stats that don't correspond to their in-lore power. Arash is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamedInStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamedInStory">Famed in Story</a> as Iran's greatest hero, but he's a one-star, the lowest rarity, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">and mostly useless at first glance</a>. Cu Chulainn, who is considered pretty damn powerful in the lore of the series, is three-star, putting him below people he canonically managed to fight to a standstill or outright defeat. Jack the Ripper is considered a "young" Servant and therefore quite weak, but a five-star in-game, the top rarity. And then there's the large number of Servants given out for special events, who inexplicably gain or lose a star and completely change their focus because they're wearing a bathing suit, and all of whom end up at four or five stars.
</li><li> A microcosm of the above oddities is Okita and Nobunaga. In lore, Okita is a pretty weak Servant with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">no standout traits besides Agility</a>, owing to being only a few centuries old. However, this makes her a natural counter to Nobunaga, who (due to the historical Nobunaga being infamous as an anti-spiritual modernizer) has hefty advantages against older and more legendary Servants but is basically limited to "shoot easily-dodged muskets at it" against younger ones. But in game mechanics, this is reversed. Okita ended up being the five-star for the event that introduced the duo, so she's very strong in general, able to crit for tons of damage and bring down powerful opponents. Meanwhile, Nobunaga is an Archer (class advantage over Saber, Okita's class) who also gets bonus damage against characters with the Riding trait (which Okita has), so bringing Nobunaga along to fight Okita is actually a very good idea.
</li><li> In general, for the purposes of any story event, the game assumes you've summoned whatever Servants are convenient. For instance, the Agartha arc involves the premise that Astolfo, d'Eon, Fergus, Heracles, and Drake have all been summoned by you at some point and their disappearance is significant, even though it's very likely to get to that point in the story with pretty much every character on that list except maybe Fergus absent from your Chaldea.
</li><li> A lot of lore elements end up getting defied by the game's mechanics. Probably the funniest case is Medea's Rule Breaker attack. In canon, it's stated that the ability is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>: it's a dagger that can undo most spells and magical contracts, but Medea is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a> and the dagger is fragile, short-range, and unergonomic, so it's not really feasible for her to use it in actual combat. However, since "range" isn't really a factor in the combat system, ingame Medea has no problem just floating up to a giant monster and shanking them in the face. In fact, considering how good Medea is at charging up her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a>, chances are good she'll be stabbing people almost every other turn, making it actually the inverse, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a> source of steady damage.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NieR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NieR">NieR</a></em>. As part of a story event, a smith gives you a broken sword and promises to fix it. He does this again on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, which carries your inventory over. Nier asks if he doesn't have it already. Weiss just tells him this is how things happen the second time through.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross">Chrono Cross</a></em> has a feature where in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, you can pull all of the characters you had in your party whenever you had previously beaten the game; even the ones who are in contradictory paths. While some might have a special attack or two; they do not interact. (Especially huge is being able to bring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Harle</a> back.) Somewhat justified, since the existence of parallel worlds is one of the main story points of the game.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em>, at one point your characters' weapons are taken when you're captured by the enemy. Unless you have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk">Ayla</a> in the party, who can fight without weapons, engaging enemies results in automatically being tossed back in your cell, and even then, only characters that have retrieved their weapons will participate in the battle. This completely ignores the fact that most of your party members can use magic, and could quite easily demolish enemies with balls of fire or bolts of lightning in spite of being completely unarmed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile">Valkyrie Profile</a></em>, two late-game bosses are directly responsible for two of your einherjar's deaths much earlier in the game. If you bring either of these characters into the battle with their killer, neither will say anything.
</li><li> If you use a character enough in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RecettearAnItemShopsTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RecettearAnItemShopsTale">Recettear</a></em>, you get their "True Card" which lets you have them in your party immediately in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>. This includes having them fight themselves in battles where they are originally antagonistic. Or you could just go on the boss rush with the character that appears at the end (and sometimes the middle) of the rush.

Shortly thereafter they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> magic as simply "much weaker," but even when you use it in Phase 3 before reawakening the Tower, spells are no less powerful than before and you can still use one that involves painting a target lock for the Tower's own energy cannons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights">Neverwinter Nights</a></em>: Your character tries to get into a palace by claiming to be an emissary from Mulhorand (the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Egypt-equivalent</a>.) The guard doesn't fall for that, as Mulhorandi emissaries are dark-skinned and wear ornate garb. He says this even if your character <em>is</em>, in fact, dark-skinned and dressed ornately.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperheroLeagueOfHoboken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperheroLeagueOfHoboken">Superhero League of Hoboken</a></em>, superpowers comes in two types: the ones that work in fights, and the ones that work in puzzle screens. Even though they show up in the lists of available powers on puzzle screens, combat powers are waved off with a limp "that power only works in combat" message. Even when it's a power that should be devastatingly effective in that puzzle screen, like "put animals to sleep" when the problem you're facing is the villain preparing to unleash a horde of mutant pigeons or rat-horses.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/HyperdimensionNeptuniaVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/HyperdimensionNeptuniaVictory">Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory</a></em> they make a fairly big deal out of Neptune <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">not being a CPU in the alternate dimension</span>, and the first chapter of the game is devoted to finding the object that can restore her power. The same is done for her sister, Nepgear, and she isn't playable until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she receives the CPU Memory from Vert</span>. However, it's never brought up again, and when Uni, Ram, and Rom join the team at the end of the Good/True Ending route, they're able to flip back and forth between dimensions just fine.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyColor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyColor">Game Boy Color</a> adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePhilosophersStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePhilosophersStone">Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</a></em>, Harry may have Ron, Hermione, and at one point even Neville following him.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic">Blood Magic</a> is a forbidden dark art that can only be learned in-game by bargaining a child's soul away to a demon (barring an incredibly high Coercion score), and it's practitioners are severely persecuted. And while the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> using it, even in presence of blood mage-hunters, can be justified since you're a Grey Warden, meaning you're above "normal" law, it's very unlikely that the kindly, by-the-book mage Wynne would be willing to learn and use Blood Magic, but in-game nothing stops you from having her do it anyway.
</li><li> Lyrium is stated to be a highly addictive substance that gradually poisons the drinker over time. Despite this, every mage in your party can gulp down flagons of the stuff without any ramifications. There was originally going to be a "lyrium withdrawal" debuff that got stronger the longer you used it, but it was taken out before release.
</li><li> If you complete various DLC achievements, you unlock special equipment for future playthroughs of the main game, no matter what origin those playthroughs have. Meaning that the City Elf and Dwarf Commoner start out virtually skint, barely having two copper pieces to rub together, even though their inventory contains nearly 350 gold in dragonbone weapons alone. This equipment is also never taken away; even though the Dwarf Noble is arrested, found guilty, and thrown into the Deep Roads with sword, shield, and prison clothes, they won't confiscate the Orlesian-made high-grade leather armour, dragonbone axe, or magical stat-boosting belt (and indeed, if your Strength score is 20 or above the former will be donned automatically as soon as play starts).

He cannot return to his people without it, even if he completes his mission, because they'll just kill him. You can go on a quest to recover the sword and return it to Sten, for which he will be tremendously grateful. The sword will then become an equippable weapon, which you can give to another party member, sell for a quick buck or even destroy in front of Sten. He will not care.

However, you can walk 3 mages, robes and staffs in plain sight, past a crowd of Templars outside the Templar headquarters without anyone batting an eye.

In-game, however, she <em>greatly</em> disapproves of the decision and it can lower her disposition towards you if her approval score is borderline.
<ul><li> Raw lyrium is incredibly dangerous to anyone who isn't a dwarf (and is even risky for dwarves). People who spend extended time around lyrium risk physical and psychological damage, and mages can be killed by direct exposure to raw lyrium outright. The red version is even worse, as just having a small piece of it can drive even a dwarf completely crazy. And yet throughout the game, you can walk your character right up to deposits of both versions, even touch it, with no adverse effects.

<ul><li> The bosses will enjoy heavily modified laws of biology and physics during their fights, but immediately after the boss, they are suffering nothing more than a few non-lethal headshots and gunshot wounds. One example of this is the fight with Sis; as you're wrapping up the fight against her, she'd be peppered with gunshot wounds and (depending on your fighting style) explosive wounds. The cutscene immediately following shows Sis in seemingly near-perfect condition, as if she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyAFleshWound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyAFleshWound">only punched a few times</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> as a means to implement boss fights in the game.

A good example occurs in Chapter 6: according to the story, your team is trapped by a large monster and can't escape until you defeat it... except that the game goes by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsASlapOnTheWrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsASlapOnTheWrist">Death Is a Slap on the Wrist</a>, meaning that if it kills you, you respawn a short distance away and can resume sidequests and exploring the world at will. Despite this, when you approach the monster to kill it and resume the story, the game will act as if you've still been trapped by the monster the whole time.
</li><li> Similarly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChronicles2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChronicles2">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a></em> pretty much always lets you travel around Alrest via the Skip Travel system, even though there are multiple points in the story where the characters are trapped on a particular Titan. The Blade drawing system also seems to operate independently of the actual storyline: the plot repeatedly harps on the fact that Blades are their own people and don't just exist for the sake of being used by humans. The gameplay, on the other hand, practically <em>requires</em> you to draw dozens of blades, of which you'll likely only use a handful, either ignoring or dismissing the rest because they're not useful for anything except clogging up your collection.
</li><li> Fray, the hero of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlphadiaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlphadiaGenesis">Alphadia Genesis</a></em> starts off the story by already having a reputation as a famous Guild member and even wins a local tournament for the very first in-game battle. He starts at level 1.

At one point, Machias and Jusis' <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and later Laura and Fie's</span> inability to get along even leads to the Tactical Link system <em>breaking</em>. Rean and Alisa's dispute doesn't break the Link system because they get over their issues before they end up in the same party. That said, there are some issues...
<ul><li> The story makes a huge deal about how important and battle-changing combat links are but they hardly even make a difference during actual gameplay battles, especially during early and mid game.
</li><li> The story also makes a big deal about how much more powerful Laura and Fie are compare the rest but in gameplay, (barring overpowered skills like Rean's Arc Slash) they aren't too different from any of the other physical-based characters.
<ul><li> This is most exemplified during the battle where you play as Fie and Laura vs Rean and Machias, which is arguably one of the hardest, if not the hardest, battle in the game, especially on the higher difficulties.
</li><li> Perhaps as to try to make this more consistent, both Laura and Fie are the only ones to start the game with an S-Craft.
</li><li> To make the hard fight more believable, it was placed after Laura and Fie exhausted their energy in duel.
</li><li> Although you can switch in and out party members in a fight, you're only required to fight with four. Regardless, everyone gains EXP as if they had all participated in the battle. Furthermore, characters will sometimes compliment another character's fighting after the battle and how much they helped out, even if they weren't part of your chosen battle team.

Indeed, you can march right into a city of Drayks and Drakons who are rebelling against the headship or even equality with humans, and go and chat with Drayks about how little they're being respected, and they won't bat an eye if you happen to have a force of obedient cannon fodder servant Drayks at your heels.
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkestDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkestDungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardNeedsFoodBadly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardNeedsFoodBadly">hunger system</a> is implemented as a random event which forces the characters to consume food or face health / stress damage. Food can also be consumed outside of that to restore health - but the hunger system completely disregards that. You can eat till the character refuses to take any more because they're full, and <em>the next moment</em> their hunger event strikes.
</li><li> The torchlight system is mostly just a straightforward way to manage risk / reward: you're safer in the light, but can get better rewards in the dark. Some of the ways in which it's implemented make sense, like getting better scouting events in the light or being at a bigger risk of an ambush in the dark; some really don't, for example finding more loot in the dark (as if it's easier to find stuff when you can't see it) or having a higher chance of ambushing enemies in the light (somehow it's harder to notice you approaching if you carry a bright torch).
</li><li> When traversing a corridor, it's possible to make the characters walk backwards, towards the door through which they entered. Doing so will prompt them to become concerned that they may be ambushed like that and inflict stress penalties. However, as the game is not programmed to be able to spawn enemies that attack the party from the back, it's one of the few occasions when the party is actually completely safe.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OctopathTraveler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OctopathTraveler">Octopath Traveler</a></em> is notable for its use of this trope in regards to its eight playable characters.
<ul><li> Gameplay-wise, the eight main characters are treated like a tight-knit party working together to achieve their individual goals. Story-wise, they're treated like solo adventurers going on their own quests with none of the other characters interfering in their narrative. The only time the characters even talk to each other is during optional minor conversations.
</li><li> The game doesn't explain why the characters are teaming up and traveling together, especially when most of their individual quests can be on the other side of the continent from one another and vary in terms of urgency. The most notable example is Therion, a selfish thief who openly hates teamwork but will quickly join up with random strangers he just met. Likewise, it's not explained why the other, more heroically inclined characters are assisting an unrepentant criminal or why they care about helping him maintain his reputation as a master thief.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YokaiWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YokaiWatch">Yo-Kai Watch</a></em>: You can catch multiple of one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">yo-kai</a> despite the fact that many are individuals. For example, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesMascot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesMascot">Series Mascot</a> is a cat yokai named Jibanyan. Jibanyan is not a species; he's one specific yo-kai. According to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatch">anime</a> there are hundreds of similar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nekomata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nekomata">nekomata</a> yo-kai with their own designs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YukiOnna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YukiOnna">Frostina</a> is also another yo-kai that can be caught several times, however Frostina is a specific individual who died in a snowstorm and looked much the same in life.
</li><li> Part of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em> series' gimmick is that when you're killed in the game, your character actually dies and respawns at a bonfire in-universe. This is why your souls end up where you died, why some enemies stay dead after you kill them, and why changes you make to the levels persist (such as opening doors or activating elevators). However, multi-stage boss fights retain their phases, even when this doesn't fit: for example, the final boss of the <em>Ashes of Ariandel</em> DLC has you kill <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Friede</span>, at which point Father Ariandel flips out and starts trying to beat you to death or set you on fire; when you die, however, you walk into the boss arena and he's obligingly chained himself back down until you kill <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her</span> again.
<ul><li> Some items also don't make much sense. For example, the Undead Legion used the Farron Ring to improve their sword technique...but because the Farron Ring reduces the focus cost of weapon skills, and the Undead Legion's Farron Greatsword doesn't <em>consume</em> focus for its skill (parrying is free), the ring is dead weight on a character using it.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">Deconstructed</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeathEndReQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeathEndReQuest">Death end re;Quest</a></em> with DLC Ripuka. Normally the DLC characters in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CompileHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CompileHeart">Compile Heart</a> games aren't that well integrated into the main story. In this case, the playable Ripuka, even if she is suffering from amnesia, <em>is aware of this</em>, that she's been summoned into the world as extra combatant who can't even be seen by the party members <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">or even Arata, which means that she's aware of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWall">Fourth Wall</a> like the enemy Ripuka and the other Ludens. When you're chatting with her, she's directly addressing <em>you</em>, the player</span>. Not only that, her knowing this fact also slowly drives her insane.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em>, if you play for more than two hours in one sitting, Ness's father will call to encourage him (or rather you, the player) to take a break from playing. The strange part is that this can occur before you get the Receiver Phone, the item that allows you to get (but not make) phone calls anywhere. Since this happens a few hours into the game, it's easy for you to get a call from Ness's father before Ness has a phone able to receive the call.

Naturally when he gets sucked into her third eye and they become stuck together, they are on bad terms. Dhar becomes a playable party member from that point and isn't necessarily being controlled by Ajna, just bonded to Ajna and can come out when he needs. Eventually Ajna finds Ravannavar and tries to kill him. Dhar can be used in both fights against Ravannavar, despite still being fiercely loyal to him (Albiet unremembered) before he makes his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a>.

Dinnah, but Gameplay proceeds to ignore this and has KOS-MOS the main pilot and Shion the co-pilot. Even more strangely, one cutscene in Michtam actually shows Alan co-piloting with Shion, which raises the question of where KOS-MOS even was.

Obviously, everyone's meter start at 0, and would increase if the player give them gifts or complete specific quests for them.

However, when they are first played he is only acquaintances with all of them.

It doesn't take into account the habitability of the existing planet before placing an adventure there, so you can have a planet that claims to be a T0 but ends up being a forested world with lots of wildlife when you actually land. Also, occasionally, player-made adventures will do things such as giving a name to the planet you're on, or being part of a series that assumes you've done the previous adventures, but they leave the captain unlocked so you can play them in Space stage where these details no longer make sense.

You never see those low prices from Joja yourself - on the contrary, their prices are 25% <em>higher</em> than Pierre's, making it a poor choice. The only mitigating factor is that they're open all week (Pierre closes his store on wednesdays), in case you planned poorly and need stuff on a wednesday. Arguments have been made that the low prices might only extend to the products that aren't relevant to the player character (when was the last time you bought shampoo, or new shoelaces?) but villagers need for everyday needs, but it still leaves questions.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skate">skate</a></em> suffers from this trope. At the beginning of the game, your skater gets hit by a bus after skating out into the street, and needs surgery in order to skate again. Later on in the game, however, there is a mission for Thrasher Magazine which requires you to break four bones in order to proceed. This, along with any other time in the game where you break bones is briefly commented on, but your character can get right back up and keep skating right away.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em>:
<ul><li> If the plot actually mattered where the gameplay was concerned, the playable characters would very quickly run into a big problem the first time they took damage - since one zombie bite is all it should take to turn one into the walking dead. Amusingly, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Nemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Nemesis">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</a></em>, one of Nemesis's attacks finds its mark on Jill during a cutscene, which naturally does infect her.
</li><li> One wonders why the characters don't just kick the doors in or shoot the locks. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">REmake</a> has an even more obnoxious example: One of the doors is so rickety that after you use it a few times, the knob falls off. Both of the characters <em>are wearing combat boots</em> but can't just kick in the door. Satisfyingly, Leon does this all the time in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em>, shooting or cutting with his knife simple locks or simply kicking the door open. At the very least, their inability to shoot the doors is explained in the books as being due to the ever-present risk of ricocheted bullets. Granted, the books exist on a different plane of canon than the games, but this should still hold up.
</li><li> What we should be wondering is why the mansion doesn't burn down in REmake when you're running around setting defeated zombies' corpses on fire (with kerosene haphazardly poured on them that certainly had to have splashed about) and shooting incendiary grenades at whatever you like... in a mansion built primarily with wood floors, walls, doors... just about everything, really. You'd think they'd all be burnt to a crisp long before the endgame.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil1">Resident Evil</a></em> also has one of the strangest cases of canonical events in video game history. Depending on who you play as the events of the game will be considerably different (to the point of being mutually exclusive of each other), one of the main characters will sit the entire game out in a cell, and either Barry or Rebecca will be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a> However, as far as canon is concerned, Chris, Jill, Rebecca, and Barry <em>all</em> explored and survived the mansion, effectively meaning <em>neither</em> playthrough is technically "canon" as entirely different events took place as far as later games are concerned (with the closest we've actually <em>seen</em> of these events being the non-canon S.D. Perry novelization).
</li><li> Leon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2">Resident Evil 2</a></em> gets shot by Annette in a cut scene and passes out from the shock. When he wakes up some time later, he can run around perfectly fine and his health doesn't get lowered from the gunshot wound, despite the fact that Leon was hit in the chest. Leon does collapse from his wound moments later, but he gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstAid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstAid">patched up with bandages</a> and is fine for the rest of the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2">Resident Evil 2</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Nemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Nemesis">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</a></em> both show the police in cutscenes attacking zombies with strong weapons like shotguns and machine guns, yet the zombies barely flinch as they make their move on their victims. In the actual gameplay, your shotgun can greatly stagger zombies (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode">or make their heads explode with a headshot</a>) and machine gun type weapons can shred zombies in three seconds while pushing them back. Because of those factors, zombies appear to be stronger in cutscenes than actual gameplay. They seemingly go by traditional zombie logic of headshot only, (thought as RE2 remake shows, they can survive up to 11 headshot from 9x19mm handguns). <em>Resident Evil</em> also does this to Barry when he and Jill have their first zombie encounter. Barry shoots the zombie three times with a <em>.44 magnum revolver at point blank range</em> before it slumps over. When you get to use the same weapon for yourself later on, you can kill zombies with just one shot, even on Hard.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em> Oh boy... While some gameplay and story segregation plagued older games, starting with 4, this became a norm for the series right until 7. Overall, there is just so many examples of it that it's easier to provide the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax">Cutscene Power to the Max</a> entries for Leon alone:
<ul><li> Leon sprinting in many, many cutscenes, but cannot do the same when you control him in the game itself.
</li><li> Leon can use binoculars when plot wants it only.
</li><li> Leon easily do knife combos and managed to block Krauser's attacks with it skillfully, yet he can only swing it awkwardly in gameplay.
</li><li> Leon can do backflips, roll, jump, duck, dodge enemies slashes... in QTE and cutscenes only.
</li><li> The scene that shout outs the original RE movie in which Leon can even wall run.
</li><li> You have to escort President's daughter Ashley, and the enemies will constantly try to steal her from you and carry her away. Should they leave the current area, even if Leon is two steps behind, the game is over. But when Ashley is abducted in a cutscene, which happens at least twice, Leon just goes on looking for her.
</li><li> The main villain Saddler makes it very clear that his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a> depends entirely upon Ashley being given a parasite and delivered back home alive. With that in mind, you will spend nearly the entire time thereafter protecting her from lethal traps and ambushes, even by baddies who, according to the plot, should <em>definitely</em> know better than to risk harming or killing her.
</li><li> Leon himself is also infected with the Las Plagas parasite, giving Saddler control over his body. However, outside of cutscenes, the parasite seemingly doesn't exist, as Saddler does not just make Leon lock himself in a makeshift cell until his plan has come to fruition.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising">Dead Rising</a></em>, but really in every game that involves zombies just about, the zombies can grapple with your character, and if you don't button mash to get way fast enough, they bite you, which has no effect other than lost health. and yet, in cutscenes, a bite is certain infection. It turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Frank does get infected if you progress to Overtime mode. Though then Gameplay and Story Segregation kicks in in the opposite way: Even if you spend the entire game not getting injured once, you're still infected</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising2">The sequel</a> is even more jarring, as the gameplay is still the wacky, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGyvering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGyvering">build-your-own-weapons</a> and dress like a lunatic style... which clashes <em>heavily</em> with the main plot, and Chuck's tender interactions with his daughter in particular.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FredbearAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FredbearAndFriends">Fredbear and Friends</a></em>, the two best hiding spots - under the desk and inside a bathroom stall - cannot be entered outside of two specific cutscenes, even if the animatronics' inability to bend and disinterest in opening doors would allow Thomas to easily pass the six hours he believes he needs there.

<ul><li> Tabletop Games usually avert this trope as much as possible when playing. Nothing irks players faster than an arbitrary screw by the GM; if the mechanics are good for the goose, they almost always are good for the gander. It is after all people interacting with other people, and illogical plot holes and actions can be readily pointed out and adjusted as necessary. A few games even allow players to intercede at the level of narrative, not character, but doing so usually has a mechanic behind it (aside from buying the GM pizza.) However, the mechanics of dice rolling for actions can often lead to bizarre, illogical and frustrating inconsistencies at times.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrapplingWithGrapplingRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrapplingWithGrapplingRules">Grappling with Grappling Rules</a> page details all the trouble with making realistic grappling combat mechanics while still being easy to play.
</li><li> Games with auto-failure parameters for dice rolls can result in characters failing improbably at completely mundane tasks, even within their fields of specialty.
</li><li> On the other hand, games with automatic successes can have characters attempting to pull off impossible actions with a lucky roll.
</li><li> NPCs who should be wiser, more experienced and even outrank the players will constantly defer the actions of the party to the player characters, even when it would make no sense to do so.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note829zf');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note829zf" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note829zf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Possibly they realize the players will just do whatever they want no matter what they say.</span>
</li><li> Games which do feature mechanical narrative intervention ("plot points") sometimes have a problem when the fact that these behave as a resource modifies the plot. For example, when a spaceship is approaching a difficult asteroid field, the pilot may swap out with the gunner who knows nothing about piloting because the gunner's player has more plot points. Even though they would likely fail the dice rolls, they can use the plot points to override them thus having no chance of failure, whereas the pilot character would most likely succeed but would not be certain to.
</li></ul></li><li> Most of the factions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> have, according to the lore, a vast array of abilities and assets that would make them virtually unstoppable. A single <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Space Marine</a> is a veritable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a>, protected in nigh-impervious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> and firing what is essentially am armour-piercing semi-automatic grenade launcher. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves">Eldar</a> have reaction times so fast that humans appear to be moving underwater, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HigherTechSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HigherTechSpecies">technology that makes the rest of the galaxy look like Stone Age nomads</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedTechnology">Necrons</a> are as advanced compared to the Eldar as Eldar are compared to everyone else. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts">Tyranids</a> have almost literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">limitless numbers</a>. Orks can take absurd damage before dying and are more numerous that any species in the galaxy except for the Nids. Followers of Chaos bind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLegionsOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLegionsOfHell">daemons</a> into weapons, vehicles, even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">themselves</a>, providing tremendous power. And daemons themselves not only warp reality around them and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption">corrupt</a> people by their very presence, but are also largely invulnerable to conventional weapons. But aside from a bare few exceptions none of this is represented in the mechanics, and those that are present are nowhere near as powerful as the lore suggests.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GamesWorkshop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GamesWorkshop">Games Workshop</a> once introduced campaign events in which players could send in their battle results and affect a franchise's narrative. Unfortunately they fell victim to this trope, which is probably why GW hasn't tried any in a while.
<ul><li> The Third War for Armageddon event for <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> was a bit of a disappointing stalemate, but the Eye of Terror campaign produced more dramatic results, with the forces of Chaos overrunning the defenders of the pivotal fortress world of Cadia, the Dark Eldar getting soundly defeated to the extent of having their capital sealed away in another dimension, and Orks and the Tau expanding all but unopposed. Yet for years subsequent material this attack from the Eye of Terror is only discussed in conjectural terms - the campaign occurred in the final days of the year 40,999... until the <em>Gathering Storm</em> books advanced the narrative, starting with the fall of Cadia and the Eldar being overrun in several places. Then in the Fall of Medusa V campaign, Games Workshop declared the Space Marines the winning faction even though they <em>failed</em> their objectives (the allied Imperial Guard were the actual winners and the Marines piggybacked on them), causing fans to accuse GW of favoring its mascot faction past the point of reason.
</li><li> Worse was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em>'s Storm of Chaos event, in which Chaos warlord Archaon launched a cataclysmic assault against the Empire. This was supposed to culminate in the dramatic siege of Middenheim, except the forces of Disorder spent the first weeks failing to overcome the first miserable backwater hamlet in their invasion route, forcing Games Workshop to blatantly overwrite the battle results and say that the place was quickly trampled. The grand finale wasn't much better, and involved an orc character showing up, curb-stomping Archaon, and then just as suddenly leaving along with all the other invaders. In the end, the whole event was rendered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">Canon Discontinuity</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the odder examples from fantasy (and later Age of Sigmar) is Valkia the Bloody. Going by lore she's Korne's favorite Daemon Prince and consort, worshipped as a minor deity in her own right by his followers. In actual game terms she's a fairly unremarkable human warlord.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Capcom's arcade game <em>Shadow Over Mystara</em> introduces two new characters to the playable party, and the plot acts as if they've always been adventuring with them from the start. One of them even pulls out a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon">Plot Coupon</a> from the first game that they "stole" to allow the party to access the final leg of stages.
</li><li> The rules book <em>Elder Evils</em> states that the elder evils are so powerful that even the gods would think twice before standing against them, but a comparison of the statistics of some of the elder evils in that book to the gods' statistics in <em>Deities and Demigods</em> shows that the gods could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">easily crush</a> the elder evils (well, the ones who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotGraspTheTrueForm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotGraspTheTrueForm">you can grasp the true form of,</a> anyhow). Likewise, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EpicLevelHandbook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EpicLevelHandbook">Epic Level Handbook</a></em>'s claim that even the gods can't stand up to a certain monster described in that book seems questionable when the statistics are compared.
</li><li> Elminster in the novels is one of the most powerful wizards in the world, had an affair with the <em>goddess of magic</em> (and is one of her Chosen), and is functionally immortal. However, his character stats as presented in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em> campaign setting... well, let's just say anyone who has a passing familiarity with Dungeons and Dragons can make a better epic-level wizard.
</li><li> Magic armor and clothing are "one size fits all" in order to keep players and DMs from having to juggle different equipment sizes in addition to everything else. Of course, some common-sense exceptions exist; generally, if there's a size difference of two or more categories (i.e. Small to Large or Medium to Huge), the rule probably doesn't apply.
</li><li> This trope is a common criticism of the fourth edition, which is chock full of effects where the rules text ("crunch") doesn't match the descriptive text ("fluff"). For instance, an inspiring speech that gives you a buff even if you cannot hear it; a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> that deals exactly as much damage as other attacks of the same level; a particular swordfighting maneuver that you can only do once per day for no reason, and can never learn to do twice; an infamous spell that lets you teleport an enemy into hell, but only if you teleport him right back (again, doing exactly as much damage as other attacks of the same level); and numerous archery moves and bolt spells that allow you to shoot at two creatures, but never at the same creature twice.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsSagaEdition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsSagaEdition">Star Wars: Saga Edition</a></em> RPG has far fewer guns on ships than has been previously established. However, this was made as a concession to the fact that if they did, rolling for each individual ship gun/battery would translate into hundreds of rolls, especially with bigger ships like the Super Star Destroyers. Besides, game mechanics are already of dubious canon.
<ul><li> Almost no Star Wars game has ever managed to model lightsaber combat in a way that supports the canonical duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader; inevitably one chops the other in half with their first blow because a person's ability to defend themselves is abstracted into their total armor value, and it is established that lightsabers can cut through armor. The Fantasy Flight Games Star Wars RPG abandons any attempt to work this into gameplay and simply states that except in exceptional circumstances any confrontation between Darth Vader and a PC is "You Lose" (the movie duel between Skywalker and Vader counting as having exceptional circumstances because Vader was deliberately not fighting at maximum strength)
</li></ul></li><li> For purposes of game balance, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsRolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsRolePlayingGame">Star Wars Role Playing Game</a></em> doesn't allow Jedi to deflect blaster bolts with their lightsabers, something they do all the time in the movies. You <em>can</em> buy the Reflect talent, which negates <em>some</em> of the damage from a blaster attack, but buying enough levels to completely negate even a simple blaster pistol bolt would require mastering several lightsaber combat talent trees. Padawans regularly deflect blaster bolts in the movies. Deflecting something like a speeder bike's repeating blaster is pretty much out of the question. Luke deflected several shots from one in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>: All over the place. While it's mostly understandable that you can summon creatures from hostile factions to your aid without them trying to stab each other, given that you are magically copying them and not calling the original, this turns up with the planeswalkers. To give just a few examples: you can have both cursed!Garruk and Liliana out in a BG deck, even though Liliana was the one who cursed Garruk and he spent most of Innistrad block trying to either kill her or make her withdraw it; and you can call upon planeswalker!Karn and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Venser</span> at the same time, even though the latter's death was what gave Karn back his planeswalking spark! You can even have <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Elspeth</span> and Ajani Steadfast out at once, in the same color, even though the Steadfast-era Ajani is wearing the former's signature cloak as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicKeepsake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicKeepsake">Tragic Keepsake</a>. There are also a lot of strange interactions between cards, most notably the possibility - in the right deck - of having a snake equipped with a full suit of armour, sword, shield, and even wearing boots.
<ul><li> This also comes up a lot in the tie-in novels for the game's sets, thanks to the writers only being given a story outline and not the exact specifics of each card. This leads to stuff like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Gerrard</a> being able to disembowel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderPeople">Tsabo Tavoc</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InvasionCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InvasionCycle">Invasion Cycle</a></em> (and Crovax later being able to kill her) even though her card specifically gives her <a class="urllink" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?printed=true&amp;multiverseid=23321">protection from legendary creatures<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, and Akroma and Phage fighting repeatedly throughout the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OnslaughtCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OnslaughtCycle">Onslaught Cycle</a></em> even though by the metrics of the card game Akroma should win every clash with Phage thanks to her higher stats and <a class="urllink" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?printed=true&amp;multiverseid=42049">protection from black<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The early days of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> was positively laden with monsters whose flavor text contained lines like "nothing can stop this creature's rampage" or "a master swordsman and a veteran of a hundred battles" or "this creature rules a dimension of darkness." In the game proper, none of these monsters have effects, and the majority have terrible statlines.
</li><li> Cyberpunk games tend to have a problem with hacking. To keep the game fun, hacking is usually modelled cinematically: you can hack any system if you're a sufficiently good hacker and can spend a short time frantically typing. This works in films when there's a single protagonist, but in a tabletop game, NPC hackers will be following the same rules. This usually results in PCs desperately avoiding using any form of technology because it is so easily hacked, yielding the opposite of cyberpunk.
<ul><li> As a concrete example, Shadowrun 4th Ed featured cyberware which could be hacked through their remote diagnostic connections, in part to give hacker characters a role in combat. Every player naturally had their PC disable all remote functionality on their cyberware and the idea was retconned after observing that any enemy who did not do so just looked ridiculous. 5th Edition then brought this back by giving cyberware enhanced functionality only if it was connected to the Matrix (ie, the Internet), but with there often being no explanation why this should be the case. (Not that it's difficult to imagine an "always online" requirement in a cyberpunk setting, mind you.)
</li></ul></li><li> In addition to the example above, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a> sourcebooks are quite clear that story-wise, the powers of magic-users and technomancers are as different as night and day. Gameplay-wise, however, technomancers practically are magic-users whose powers affect the Matrix instead of the real world. The 5e sourcebook "Kill Code" even outright stated that a technomancer weaving a Complex Form or compiling a Sprite resembles a magic-user casting a spell or summoning a Spirit more than it does resemble a decker using a program or starting an agent.

Every bit of material seems to add another bit of stupidity onto the pile - dangerously pyromaniac, terrified of dogs and horses, thinks writing steals your soul. One would think their stats would give them massive penalties to their Intelligence and Wisdom - but as most of <em>Pathfinder</em> is a reskin of <em>D&amp;D</em> 3rd Edition, where goblins were treated as fairly normal intellectually (if a bit rough-edged and crude), the only mental penalty Pathfinder goblins get is a -2 to Charisma. Even the standard goblin warrior statblock has 10 Intelligence (perfectly average) and 9 Wisdom (a bit below-average but hardly insane).

</li><li> The Valour. Sure, Pulse Rifles are weak against Necromorphs, and maybe the soldiers needed a while to grab their guns, but seriously. One slasher - the weakest type of Necromorph - manages to kill and infect an entire ship stocked to the brim with trained soldiers wielding Pulse Rifles and wearing advanced body armour that is as good or better than Isaac's Level 5 suit. (In fairness, some of the marine corpses clearly were killed by the crashing of the ship and not a necromorph, plus, according to one of the logs you can find on the ship, most of the marines actually survived until after the valour crashed into the Ishimura and were killed in a running battle against a horde of necromorphs that were attracted to the ship by the crash.)
</li><li> Necromorphs are, in-story, impossible to kill. The reason you cut off their limbs isn't to kill them, its to dismember to the point that they can no longer attack. In gameplay, however, shooting them in the chest enough will kill them eventually, albeit using up a lot of ammo and dismemberment deals high damage to them causing them to die if you cut off enough limbs even if some are remaining.

<ul><li> While <em>Advance Wars</em> in general can be bothersome about it, Dual Strike has one case that takes the cake. SEVEN Aircraft Carriers, each loaded with a Stealth, and near a somehow important Black Hole fortress no less. Bear in mind that Aircraft Carriers and Stealths are among the most expensive units in the game AND the Aircraft Carriers are support units, not to mention that (because the units were top secret before) <em>Black Hole does not recognize the ordinance in the first place</em>, so it's a wonder how they got trapped. Because of this suggestion that the Allied Nations is absurdly rich to the point that these units could even be around, let alone top secret, when they have been lucky to have had only ONE Megatank (a unit that isn't as expensive as any of the Aircraft Carriers) in the next mission, never mind that they have been having troubles with having reasonable forces, it's a wonder how <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Bolt Guard trashes most of the Allied Nations' facilities in a massive ambush before they could even respond</span>.
</li><li> When Allied Nations reinforcements arrive (mostly to help introduce new characters, such as when Jess brings Javier to the fight with her), they usually want to see the skills of Jake et al. Ergo, they demand some kind of "practice" match, and while it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">vaguely implied</a> that no soldiers are actually hurt, in-game battle scenes clearly show people getting blown away and tanks exploding. This is all ignoring the obvious: the Bolt Guard is destroying the very land underneath them, and there's really no time to clown around. Without these "practice" matches, you'd be stuck fighting against the same few COs for the entire campaign, but later matches have you fighting <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">clones of</span> Drake, Olaf, and Andy anyway.
</li><li> Several COs, including Kanbei and Colin, are treated as flawed at best as commanders in cutscenes and in-story, with Kanbei being a borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusDitz">Genius Ditz</a> and Colin having almost no combat experience. This is in contrast to their in-game skills, where, distant to the contrary, they're both regarded as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game Breakers</a>. It can be rather curious to have Colin open a mission uncertainly claiming that he's going to try his best, only to then steamroll it with endless free Neotanks.

<ul><li> Dying enemies either turn into crystals or drop an equipment box if they've been dead long enough. In cutscenes, bodies will hang around long after they should have changed into the aforementioned items.
</li><li> The first battle against Miluda has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition">Instant-Win Condition</a> of defeating her, at which point Ramza will call for the others to surrender, claiming that he'll spare them if they do.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em>:
<ul><li> A recurring one in the series is "Matthis Syndrome", a reference to the iconic example in the first game: Matthis can only be recruited by having his sister Lena talk to him, at which he'll have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">Heel Realization</a> and switch sides. His battle quote when he engages a unit is about how he only wants to see his sister again. You'd expect from this that Matthis would avoid attacking his sister. You would be wrong. In fact, since she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a>, it's extremely likely for him to kill her outright! There are many other examples of this throughout the series of characters attacking their siblings, lovers, parents, or children, because the game didn't bother to code in an exception to their AI.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Endgame S-rank weapons</a> tend to have very extensive backgrounds, talking about how they've been used in all kinds of epic conflicts in the distant past, or been held in the possession <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething">of an active and powerful royal family.</a> But the franchise is also one of the iconic cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons">Breakable Weapons</a>, meaning a weapon with their history should have been exhausted a long time ago. Some games do make the Lord's weapon indestructible, if only because these weapons tend to be effective against the final bosses and not doing so might make the endgame unwinnable, but "lesser" ones like the Regalia, the Sacred Twins, and the Legendary Weapons can break in as few as twenty to thirty hits. It's especially odd in cases where characters have tried to seal them away in some capacity, either for the ridiculous power of the weapons being too destructive, or to keep the weapons from being used against them, when simply smacking the weapon against a tree for a few minutes would probably do the trick.
</li><li> Several games feature a limited-use item capable of reviving a dead character&mdash;and given that the series uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath">Final Death</a> and has characters who died in battle be counted as dead in-story, the usual excuse with such items of it merely healing them from being knocked out or disabled doesn't really fly. Naturally, you cannot use said item to resurrect anyone who perished due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotlineDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotlineDeath">Plotline Death</a>. This does have the mild justification in that it's suggested such items only work on someone who died fairly recently, but oftentimes these deaths occur right around when you get the item in question.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGenealogyOfTheHolyWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGenealogyOfTheHolyWar">Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War</a></em>, despite being told that only Naga's power (and therefore only Julia) can beat Julius, you can kill him (or at least land the killing blow) with anyone, even your dancer. Although good luck doing that, considering that Julius's Loptous tome gives him a lot more defense by lowering <em>your</em> attack before the battle. The Book of Naga negates the entire effect.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones">Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</a></em>, a support conversation between Garcia and Dozla has the two talking about their failed attempt to practice archery, including Dozla trying to swing his bow like an axe, and Garcia putting the arrow in backwards. The two decide archery isn't for them. This is ignoring that it's very possible that Garcia promoted to a Warrior by this point, and can use a bow quite competently. (Admittedly, the scene was added for the English translation, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">the Japanese version had them instead go out drinking</a>.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn">Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn</a></em>, it turns out that two characters acted the way they did because they were bound by magical contracts that would kill everyone in their respective countries if they disobeyed. The only way to render such a contract null and void is for the physical contract to be destroyed and one of the signers to be killed by a third party. In the endgame, the player gets to kill the man who forced the other characters to sign the contracts; however, it is entirely possible to have him killed by one of the signees which should render the contracts unavoidable, but if this happens, it plays out the same as if he was killed by anyone else.
<ul><li> Micaiah used her Sacrifice ability <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to bring Lehran back from the brink of death, if certain conditions were met first. Afterwards, Yune mentions that Micaiah is too weak to fight in the next battle</span>. Yet she doesn't appear to be exhausted with no changes to her at all. It's a mistranslation as the line in the European version is "Micaiah is exhausted. Give her a chance to recover before the next battle."
</li></ul></li><li> In the overall series your chance to land a critical hit is usually displayed during battle. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Fire Emblem Awakening</a></em>, during the scripted battle between <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Khan Basilio</span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Walhart</span>, each has a 0% critical chance. They both land a critical hit on each other.
<ul><li> Thanks to <em>Awakening's</em> extensive reclassing system, dissonance will pop up when you reclass your characters and they still talk as if they're in their base class - for example, Kjelle begins as a Knight (a defensive class with heavy armor), and many of her supports and tile conversations mention it. She will still talk about it, even when reclassed as, say, an Assassin. This particularly applies to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YamatoNadeshiko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YamatoNadeshiko">Cherche</a>, a Wyvern Rider with a very affectionate bond to her wyvern, Minerva.

This will always happen, even if she is reclassed as a Cleric (no mount), a Troubadour (rides a horse), or promotes into a Griffon Rider (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>).

In-game, though, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> status owes entirely to the high base Defense of his Knight class, with his "personal" base in that stat being a flat zero&mdash;reclass him into literally anything else, and he becomes the opposite, an extremely frail <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a>.

As an Archer, he has no sword proficiency unless he reclasses. Additionally, he needs an A+ or A support to even use a sword as his base classes are Archer and Pegasus Knight.

Eldar psykers have to get to level 8 before they can use all four Eldar psyker powers, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">Space Marine</a> librarians can use all four of their psyker powers at level 1, as can Tyranid magi, zoanthropes, and hive tyrants. Granted, once an Eldar psyker has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">leveled up</a>, the four Eldar psyker abilities are comparable in power to the abilities of the other factions. Also, arguably justified since the Eldar are the player race, at least in the campaign mode. Still, it's a little weird, since you eventually get to recruit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">Space Marine</a> librarians, which are more powerful at level one than your own psykers are at level seven.

This is inevitable in any open world game with a well-developed, linear story. The wide array of things to do in the sandbox will inevitably result in the player engaging in actions contrary to the character's beliefs, personality, or motivations according to the story.

Though in the inverse, Arthur can confess to a couple of the girls at camp that he's been killing people for the hell of it, even if you're very high honor and don't kill anyone you don't have to.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em>:
<ul><li> None of the protagonists can technically be killed. If one's health bar runs out, he is said to be "Wasted!", and will return to the gameworld outside the nearest hospital. The implication being that the player character can <em>always</em> recover swiftly from any injury, including being trapped inside an exploding vehicle. Furthermore, when pedestrians are killed, they can frequently be revived by paramedics. Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotlineDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotlineDeath">when the plot calls for it</a>, any character can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a>.
</li><li> You can go on a mass-murdering destructive rampage, literally killing hundreds of civilians, police officers, SWAT officers, and US military personnel. Whether you get shot down or captured, you immediately get away with it, either by just being released from the hospital or, the even funnier part, being <em>released on bail.</em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoViceCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoViceCity">Vice City</a></em> at least implies that the police force and legal system are so corrupt that your mafia ties and crooked lawyer companion get you off. In <em>GTA 2</em>, when you got arrested, you respawned riding in the back of a cop car, and you had to jump out and run away from the cops.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas">San Andreas</a></em>, the player can willingly murder hundreds of cops (and get away without even being killed/arrested), yet all cutscenes still portray the player character as innocent. As the plot goes on CJ is shown in a more and more positive light and seems to be trying to "get away from" all of the illegal activity in order to start a good, honest life. And even though you can constantly murder police officers in cold blood and get away with it, much of the conflict of the story centers around a couple crooked cops threatening to frame CJ for the murder of a single police officer that he didn't commit. What about the dozens of cops he DID murder? Even if the player doesn't go on their own spree (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">which is unlikely</a>), there are many storyline missions that seem to canonically involve CJ murdering people out in the open.
<ul><li> There's also the money issue: cutscenes show CJ being dead broke after 'Green Sabre', yet you can have millions of dollars and a lot of property even at this early point of the game (and without cheating).
</li><li> It's entirely possible for a patient player to <em>win</em> the gang war with the Ballas and Vagos before 'Green Sabre'.
</li><li> CJ's attributes (weight, certain skills, etc) are mostly for the player's benefit and have no impact on the cutscenes, so you can get something like a morbidly obese CJ trying to get away from enemies or jumping over a fence with no issue. However, CJ's physical strengths/weaknesses come into play for two specific missions that won't let you start them if you don't meet the requirements; one mission requires a lot of swimming and diving and if your swimming skills are not high enough, CJ tells his contact that he doesn't know how to swim. In the other mission, you're required to use a jetpack to sneak into a military base and if CJ is too fat, the contact for the mission won't let you start it until you lose weight because the belt strap wouldn't fit around CJ's gut. These two missions are the only times where CJ's stats are taken into account for the gameplay and story instead of making them separate.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> fight, CJ calls out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Big Smoke</span> for wearing body armor, implying only wimps rely on it while true hardcore gangsters don't need it. CJ will say this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">even if you have him wear body armor</a>, which most players will do considering how valuable body armor is in <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> games in general.
</li></ul></li><li> Victor Vance from <em>Vice City Stories</em>, and Niko Bellic and Johnny Klebitz in <em>IV</em> are shown having the same goals and have calm personalities, but sound like ravenous maniacs if you decide to go after NPCs full-force. And this same bloodlust disappears when you start the next mission cutscene.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV">Grand Theft Auto IV</a></em>, Niko is portrayed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">a jaded individual who is haunted by bad things he has done in the past</a>, and is trying to make a new life for himself in Liberty City. Like in <em>San Andreas</em>, you can wantonly murder all the people you want, and in a way it's even more disturbing listening to Niko say things like "Stay down, my friend! I don't want to hurt you!" as he continues to stab an old lady as she writhes around on the ground screaming. Also "I don't want to use this! BAMBAMBAMBAMBAM Don't make me kill you friend! BAM"
</li><li> Also in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV">Grand Theft Auto IV</a></em>, is possible to the player to kill Luis Fernando Lopez in the mission "Three Leaf Clover" without failing it, which would create a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole">Plot Hole</a> considering that Luis is the protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIVTheBalladOfGayTony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIVTheBalladOfGayTony">Grand Theft Auto IV: The Ballad of Gay Tony</a></em> (which takes place after this mission) and also make Luis' appearance in "Museum Piece", a later mission, completely illogical as well.
</li><li> Several of the Grand Theft Auto games have missions involving recurring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">Non-Player Character</a> that end with you dropping them off somewhere and them leaving. During the brief period after dropping them off, when the mission is considered complete but before they actually disappear, you can do anything to them, including killing them, and nothing will happen - and they'll be back for the next mission. This becomes surreal when Trevor can thank a lady for a date by blasting her in the face with a shotgun after dropping her off, causing her to collapse in a pool of her own blood, and she'll not only be fine next time but won't remember it and will date him again.
<ul><li> Bioshock Infinite lampooned this: if you attempt to follow or hang around the Luteces after one of their scripted speeches ends, they'll explicitly say that yes, they are going to stay still until you stop looking at them and then disappear... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and there's even an in-plot reason why they can do that.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV">Grand Theft Auto V</a></em> attempts to justify the series' trademark rampages with Trevor, who's exactly the kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">unhinged lunatic</a> who would go on a wild killing spree. Unfortunately, there's no such excuse for the other two characters, who are more typical normal, down-to-earth GTA protagonists.

<ul><li> Allies can be revived by the player and non-allies can be revived by paramedics. The way that you and other characters act is a lot less segregated as shown by Johnny Gat's trial for over 300 counts of murder, though that's probably a little low too.
</li><li> This trope can make the leader of the Brotherhood, Maero, look <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a> because the scenes of the game don't change depending on what the player has done before. If you play the Brotherhood mission first his offer of 20% of Stilwater is not only reasonable but extremely generous considering that the Boss just woke up from a 5 year coma and the Saints are down to 3 gang members. However, if the player instead takes out the other two gangs first Maero instead looks like a total moron because the Boss has already claimed that much of the city and then some almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">entirely by themselves,</a> which with all the chaos it takes to get to that point logically Maero should already know about.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a>: The Game</em>, after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sonny's death</span> Don Vito calls a truce with the other four families, saying that unless pushed he will not be the one to break it. This doesn't stop you as Aldo Trapani from continuing your quest to take over businesses for the Corleones and kill enemy mobsters. In the sequel both the Corleones and the enemies will continue to belittle and mock Dominic even after you've mowed down whole Families.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype">[PROTOTYPE]</a></em> is similar. Alex Mercer is depicted as somewhat heroic and willing to risk his life to protect people during the cutscenes and comic book tie-in, and willing to let people live and just tell him what he wants to know, In gameplay, he can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">do much more than kill people for little to no reason</a> and will just take the information for himself instead of listening to them. Thought you don't <em>have</em> to do this, and you actually get an achievement for acting humanely.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype2">[PROTOTYPE 2]</a></em> takes this even further since Heller is more overtly heroic. Many cutscenes will have him fuming with rage at Blackwatch using civilians for their experiments, right after he's spent an hour turning civilians into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyAmITicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyAmITicking">hand grenades</a> and throwing them at each other. Maybe he just hates science? Humorously, the game lets you avert this with the Zombie Heller skin, which (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">aside from making him a zombie</a>) turns all his dialogue into unintelligible hissing and growling, leaving his motivations more up for interpretation.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheAmazingSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheAmazingSpiderMan">The Amazing Spider-Man</a></em>, one mission has the player investigating a bank robbery, which leads to the capture and arrest of Felicia Hardy (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCat">Black Cat</a>). Depending on how late the player does this mission, one could conceivably finish it, and then find out seconds later in an e-mail that Hardy has not only broken out of custody, but somehow found the time to rob a pawn shop and write a letter to Spider-Man instantaneously.
</li><li> The dialogue rich game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ScarfaceTheWorldIsYours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ScarfaceTheWorldIsYours">Scarface: The World Is Yours</a></em> has Tony Montana talk about how he wants the Big Bad dead. He does this even after the Big Bad is dead.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress">Dwarf Fortress</a></em>, according to the story<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9lbiu');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note9lbiu" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9lbiu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which comes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> rather than being in the game <em>or</em> the manual</span> the only things that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">demons</span> can't bust through are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">semi-molten rock and raw <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtanium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtanium">adamantine</a></span>, since that's what <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the gods used to trap the demons in hell</span>. However, once you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">release the demons from hell</span>, walls made of anything will stop them short (even walls made out of <em>soap</em>).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LANoire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LANoire">L.A. Noire</a></em> the huge twist of the level "Manifest Destiny" is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cole's affair is splashed across the newspapers to distract the media from a LAPD corruption scandal, derailing his career and getting him demoted to arson</span>. But the level itself is a completely chaotic bloodbath, with nearly Cole's entire Marine unit being massacred by the mafia in broad daylight with stolen US army guns, revealing a mob mole inside the LAPD. This makes the "twist" nonsensical, as those murders should have easily taken precedence. The game justifies this by having the upper echelons of the LAPD focus on Cole's issues rather than the case <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">because he was getting too close to uncovering their corruption</span>. In theory, the case would still be investigated, and later cutscenes make it clear that Roy is now heading the investigation, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> because Roy's corrupt too</span>, it never actually goes anywhere. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Which is exactly what the LAPD wants.</span>

Immediately after the cutscene ends, the player is able to scale the walls with relative ease and walk around the fortress in full Assassin armor without raising any attention to himself. Couple this with the fact that Ezio is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a> and Bart's statement becomes completely null and void.

<ul><li> The game has a surprisingly well defined main character in Aiden with a definitive backstory that feed into the present day story and motivations. Player control means you can be as nice or mean as you want and the gameplay itself has some elements that suggest a karma meter, how you progress through the story reflects how the NPC characters of the city respond to you. But ultimately, even if you try to play Aiden as nice as possible the chaos you cause doesn't quite align with how he is portrayed in the overall narrative.

</li><li> Aurelion Sol, a dragon-god that uses stars as weapons and has had his power level dragged down somewhat by magic, can be rather brutally taken apart by Jayce, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> whose Mercury Hammer is, indeed, a very fancy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MorphWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MorphWeapon">Morph Weapon</a>, but is notably out-awesomed by <em>cosmic power</em>.
</li><li> Then there's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnitsNotToScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnitsNotToScale">Units Not to Scale</a> thing. Malphite is a <em>big dude</em>, but he's not notably larger than someone like Sion or Mordekaiser, both of whom are just bulky undead humans, while in Malphite's splash art he is the size of a building and should, by rights, have a hard time moving around Summoner's Rift.
