No matter how wildly they vary from one another, and from one series to the next, however, they all have one thing in common: they're physically distinct from humans, even if it's not by much.
</p><p>Every now and again, though, while exploring the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink">Fantasy Kitchen Sink</a>, you'll run into a character of indeterminable race or species. Sure, they <em>seem</em> human, what with their upright stance, human-like intelligence, and ability to speak, and yet there's just something about them that gives them away as something distinctly <em>other</em>. Maybe it's that they live in a series where no human can do the things they do, maybe it's that a certain part of their body (or even most of it) is kept conspicuously concealed or they explicitly have a visible part of their body that's unusual such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair">weird-coloured hair</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourFingeredHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourFingeredHands">Four-Fingered Hands</a> (provided not everyone in the work looks like that), maybe they were clearly human at some point but something happened to them that may have made them undead/supernatural, or maybe it's that there just plain aren't <em>any</em> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHuman">other</a>" humans around, raising suspicions. This person is Ambiguously Human. Fairly often, a series will go out of its way to avoid stating their out-and-out species, or they'll be called human or nonhuman in spite of their shared traits. If you can't figure out whether they spawned from the same end of the gene pool as you just by looking at them, though, they fit the bill.

However, humans do exist in the Anpanman universe, only none of them are in Anpanland themselves.

Their "birth" consists of them randomly showing up in an area as a very small child, and most if not all of their family relations are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodSiblings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodSiblings">Not Blood Siblings</a>. Also, their physical wellbeing is directly affected by the status of their country (Spain is made ill by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">The Mafia</a> in his country, Lichtenstein nearly starves to death when her country is in a depression, and Hungary is "freakishly strong" around the time when her country helped with the War of Austrian Succession).

There are four soul-races, Humans, Hollows, Shinigami and Quincies. Humans and Hollows are opposites, and Shinigami and Quincies are opposites. Hollows are opposite to Quincies and possibly Humans and Shinigami, but the relationship between Humans and Quincies is unstated. When Ryuuken mentions the concept of "human power" he puts Ginjou (substitute shinigami), Sado (fullbringer) and Orihime (a mystery) under that umbrella. While he includes his mixed-blood Quincy son, Uryuu, he excludes himself (a pure-blood Quincy) and admits he's stretching the definition of "human power" to include Uryuu at all. He doesn't explain that comment, not even to explain what the definition is.

It's unknown if he's the same Freddie, undead or otherwise, but whenever animals are discussed, he tends to be included among them. Weirder still is his American counterpart, Mr. Mercury, who also looks like the deceased singer but can speak and has a distinct personality.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DateALive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DateALive">Date A Live</a></em>: Early in the series, a few characters have considered the notion that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Shido Itsuka</a> might not be entirely human, given that he can seal and use Spirit powers. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Further mudding the issue was the revelation that Spirits themselves used to be normal humans.

In universe, nobody knows what No Bones Jones the plastic man is.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen">X-Men</a></em>:
<ul><li> There seems to be no real consensus as to whether the mutants are human or not. They refer to themselves as "Homo superior" which would make them not human (or at least not the same species of human), but it's unclear whether that's an accepted taxonomy or not. They can interbreed with humans, which should make us the same species, and they're often as different from each other as they are from a normal person, so if they're not human, it makes more sense to say each is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleSpecimenSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleSpecimenSpecies">Single Specimen Species</a> than that they all make up a single separate species (some do pass on their powers to their children, making, for example, Banshee and Siryn a species of two, though if they have the exact same powers, the children technically aren't actually mutants). In light of how otherwise ordinary humans such as the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a></em> can gain superhuman powers either by accident or even deliberate artificial augmentation, the public assertion that mutants are not human because they are born with powers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">reflects a social judgement</a>. However, even the X-Men themselves started strongly taking up the claim that they are a separate species, which ultimately just validates the claims of their enemies. However, aliens definitely consider mutants to be humans.
</li><li> Later years reveal even more groups that the former mutants fall into: There's "Homo Supreme", a sort of super-mutant; the only known example is Mr. Immortal, who is theorized to have "evolved past death". Every Canadian mutant with a tie to Wolverine is actually a Lupine. They tend to be characterized by having a set of powers corresponding to an animal and a healing factor. Jamie Madrox, Multiple Man, is a changeling and is characterized by being born with his powers active, unlike most mutants who only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PubertySuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PubertySuperpower">"turn on" at puberty</a>.
</li><li> Also, what a mutant is isn't quite clear. While the "X-factor gene" is how it works for most, the earlier explanations tying it to environmental factors such as radiation causing the affected persons' children to be mutants (Sunfire comes to mind) have never quite been made non-canon, and there are children who inherited their non-mutant super-powered parents' gifts (or other powers) and are considered mutants... and ones that did who are not. Sunfire is a mutant because his parents were in Hiroshima and so he was born with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfTheSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfTheSun">Power of the Sun</a>, Storm is a mutant because of the X-factor gene, Franklin Richards is explicitly a mutant because his parents are cosmic-rays-affected Reed and Sue, while Spider-Girl, inheriting Spider-Man's powers, is explicitly not. There are also mutant Skrulls who, even if born with powers other than Skrull shapeshifting, obviously wouldn't have gotten it from the same gene humans do. It seems mutants are a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSubspecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSubspecies">Human Subspecies</a> (as well as subspecies of whatever other races have them.)
</li></ul></li><li> Sometimes comics will have comic relief characters with tenuous-at-best ties to continuity - like Ambush Bug, 'Mazing Man, or Forbush Man - who have cartoonish bodies (oversized heads or feet, unnaturally thin limbs, no nose, etc.) but everyone they interact with is a normally proportioned human. They're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk">gonks</a>. They're assumed to be human because, well, what else would they be?

While key Amazons of importance like Diana, Artemis, Donna Troy (who is adopted) and Grace Choi have displayed superpowers, it isn't quite clear if all Amazons have powers and like the mutants from <em>X-Men</em>, they have shown the ability to interbreed with normal humans.

There's a big question mark over whether they should be considered truly human or not, and considerable debate on the subject exists in the fandom. It's not clear if they're just humans with superpowers, or a different species altogether. On one hand, they look human to the point it's impossible to tell who is or isn't a Bloodliner at first glance unless they use their powers, can have human blood relatives, and it seems like not even qualified medical personnel can find any significant physical differences. On the other hand, they seem to be more physically capable and durable than humans even without taking their special powers into account, have abnormally high metabolisms, and it's possible that there's simply not enough known about bloodliners to know what differences to look for. And that's without mentioning strange physical traits some bloodliners have, such as Red's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBloodRunsHot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBloodRunsHot">unusually high body temperature</a>. This ambiguity also comes up in the story itself. Some characters believe them to be just humans with superpowers and other abnormal traits, while others think them to be distinct from humans. Even bloodliners themselves can't come to a consensus, with some considering themselves humans, and others considering themselves something else. And that's without getting into characters who have changed their minds on the topic, like Misty, who started thinking of herself as human again after spending some time traveling with Ash.

While his pre-clown persona, Jack Napier, is unquestionably human, you have to wonder about exactly what happened to Napier after he fell into that acid; after all, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldSurviveThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldSurviveThat">No One Could Survive That!</a>. It's undeniably creepy when the Joker tells his first victim: "I've been dead once already; it's very liberating." During his face-off with the Batwing during the parade, he seems <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAfraidToDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAfraidToDie">almost unafraid of death</a>; does he believe he's become immortal? And just how are we supposed to interpret the Joker's signature line "Did you ever dance with the devil by the pale moonlight?" (He was already saying that as Napier, but on the other hand it could have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a>.)

It's never made clear whether she survived being pushed out that high window (she only awakens after the alley cats lick and bite her, and up to that point she appeared pretty dead), and given Catwoman's borderline superhuman and/or supernatural powers (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane">though many have noted there are logical in-universe explanations for those</a>) it's possible that Catwoman/Selina is no longer human, but some kind of avenging angel/zombie/feline hybrid.

They're about the same size as the human characters, and obviously a villain with the power to raise the undead would have far grander plans in mind than the Penguin does in this movie, but... <em>those skulls</em>. They look real, and they're much too large to be ordinary masks. You have to look <em>very</em> closely to make out the actors' bare skin underneath, making it clear that what we're seeing is just a really high-tech Hollywood makeup job - although whether that's the case in-universe is doubtful, especially since the gang is living in near-poverty in the Gotham City sewers.

While supposedly just victims of severe drug-induced psychosis, their voices are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceOfTheLegion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceOfTheLegion">demonic</a>, they can be summoned and bargained with using a demonic instrument, and some of them seem to be made at least partially out of metal.

</li><li> In her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaryPoppins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaryPoppins">1964 film</a>, Mary Poppins apparently either is human or was at some point. But she lives on a cloud in the sky, suggesting she might be either an angel, a goddess, or a resurrected human who returns to Earth occasionally. She also possesses reality-warping powers - and, significantly, she is explicitly mentioned to <em>not</em> be a witch, meaning that she could not have studied magic as a mortal.

However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">The Stinger</a> reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Nick Fury" and "Maria Hill" were actually the Skrulls Talos and Soren for the whole film, raising the question of whether they were humans under the impression that they were working for Nick Fury, or Skrulls working for Talos</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Imperial stormtroopers can come off as this to inexperienced viewers. They look like robots, but their voices are clearly those of humans (albeit rendered tinny by the plastisteel helmets they wear). Luke and Han dress up as stormtroopers, but young viewers still might not make the connection.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Legends</a></em>, in the Kevin J. Anderson short story "Therefore I Am", the assassin droid IG-88 takes advantage of this ambiguity when he has his electronic brain uploaded into the Death Star's computer core by robot minions disguised as stormtroopers. And in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkForces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkForces">Dark Forces</a></em>, it's revealed that one faction of the stormtroopers - dubbed "Dark Troopers" - <em>are</em> robots (except for their leader, who's a human Imperial general <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeAndInCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeAndInCharge">encased in a gigantic cyborg suit</a>).
</li></ul></li><li> Darth Sidious (a.k.a. Emperor Palpatine) looks reptilian throughout the original trilogy, which seems strange since he's heading a government made up almost entirely of humans. Not until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em> are we shown that he once was perfectly human-looking, and that his flaky skin is the result of being struck with his own Dark Side lightning after it is deflected by Mace Windu's lightsaber.
<ul><li> That being said, there are still ALOT of people who think his scarring in <em>Revenge of the Sith</em> is an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisWasHisTrueForm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisWasHisTrueForm">This Was His True Form</a>, rather than disfigurement. In fairness, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanMcDiarmid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanMcDiarmid">Ian McDiarmid</a>'s portrayal after this point doesn't exactly seem like Palps is in pain. If it really <em>is</em> disfigurement, it allows Palps to play the sympathy card, if not, it begs the question of just what species he truly is and where he's really from.
</li></ul></li><li> Darth Vader is this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>. He's human, but due to his armour and the fact that most people are unaware of his past identity as Anakin Skywalker, there's much speculation as to whether he's human, an alien, or a droid.
</li><li> Darth Maul, Sidious' apprentice in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace">The Phantom Menace</a></em>, has horns growing out of his head but often covers them with a black hood, so he can easily be mistaken for a bizarrely face-painted human. On the other hand, he has orange eyes (though this could be rationalized as a sign of his Dark Side powers) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilentAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilentAntagonist">speaks very infrequently</a> for someone who's supposedly human. Turns out he's a Dathomirian (a crossbreed of a Human mother and a Zabrak father).
</li><li> The Tusken Raiders (or Sand People) are human-sized, and out-of-universe are played by human actors... but their bodies, feet, hands, mouths, noses, ears, and their eyes are always kept covered, they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> and pissed off <em>all the time</em>, and their language sounds more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScreamingWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScreamingWarrior">barbaric screaming</a> than anything truly verbal. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Legends</a></em>, it was eventually revealed that the Tuskens are a humanoid alien race (called either "Ghorfa" or "Kumumgah" in their own tongue) with slightly feline facial features, although occasionally there are some Human Tuskens who've been adopted into a tribe.
</li><li> Boba Fett is seemingly made of metal (actually his Mandalorian mask and armor, which he almost never takes off, even to eat or drink) and speaks in a hollow, machine-like voice - but his speech patterns (when he actually does speak, that is) are obviously those of a human. ("What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me.") Not until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones">Attack of the Clones</a></em> do we see Boba's human face - and he's just a child, and not wearing the armor yet, so little kids still might not catch on. Frighteningly, Fett had even more of a reason to keep completely covered up after his escape from the Great Pit of Carkoon, where the digestive acids in the Sarlacc's stomach burned and corroded his skin so badly that he came out looking slightly reptilian. Despite this, there is at least one account of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisservice">the post-Sarlacc Fett being seen nearly naked</a>.
</li><li> General Grievous (a sort of precursor to Darth Vader) is an example of Ambiguously Alien. He gets mistaken for a droid both in- and out-of-universe &#151; which is understandable, because very little of his original Kaleesh biology remains.
<div class="indent"><strong>Grievous:</strong> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">I AM NOT A DROID!</a></em>

</li><li> Both the films and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> feature many "Near-Humans" &mdash; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSubspecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSubspecies">Human Subspecies</a> who have genetically diverged so far from the original Coruscanti stock that they are thought of as aliens (or sometimes not; how human or alien they are considered to be often depends on how committed a government or society is to Human High Culture and/or civil rights). Thus, there are "humans" who are albinos, hobbit-like folk, people with gigantism, etc. Strangest of all are the Zelosians from <em>Legends</em>, who look completely human (their emerald-green eyes are the only thing remotely exotic about their appearance), but whose behavior is quite strange: they are extremely afraid of the dark, and will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">stop whatever they're doing and head home once the sun starts to set</a>. This is because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Zelosians are actually humanoid plants, and their blood contains a chlorophyll sap that nourishes them by photosynthesizing sunlight. Scientists believe that the Zelosians are a genetically-engineered species, since the odds of plant life naturally developing human-like physiques and intelligence are practically nil.</span>
</li><li> Also from <em>Legends</em>: Most ambiguously human of all was Danetta Pitta, an Imperial Grand Admiral of half-Borneck ancestry. Borneck, one of the near-human subspecies described above, are human except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazingTechnicolorPopulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazingTechnicolorPopulation">their mustard-yellow or bright-orange skin</a>; Pitta's only trace of his partial ancestry was an unusually pale yellowish complexion. Despite this, he was extremely ashamed of his heritage, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreWhatYouHate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreWhatYouHate">ruthlessly persecuted anyone who looked more alien than he did</a>.
</li><li> Snoke, the leader of the First Order in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens">The Force Awakens</a></em>, at first appears to be a gigantic humanoid alien.

The way his facial features diverge from humans could plausibly be from scarification, much like Sidious. The EU usually portrayed the Empire as being prejudiced against aliens, but it's unknown if this applies to the First Order or is even canon to the new trilogy at all. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastJedi">The Last Jedi</a></em> shows Snoke really is close to human size, but his origins remain unspecified <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">even after his death</span>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRiseOfSkywalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRiseOfSkywalker">The Rise of Skywalker</a></em> suggests <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he was a clone puppet created by the revived Emperor Palpatine</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RogueOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RogueOne">Rogue One</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindWeaponmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindWeaponmaster">Blind Weaponmaster</a> Chirrut &Icirc;mwe. He looks to be human, has an unshakable faith in the Force (despite not wielding it like a Jedi or Sith), and his eyes are clouded over. Despite being apparently blind, he gets around fine, and makes some shots that would be difficult for even a sighted person to make. This has led to speculation that he's not human, but a Miraluka, a near-human, Force Sensitive species seen mostly in the comic books and games that "sees" using the Force and only has vestigial eye sockets. While some Miraluka became powerful Jedi and/or Sith, others have no Force abilities speak of <em>beyond</em> being able to "see" with it.
</li><li> From the same film, we have the Death Troopers, which are really damned tall (towering over regular stormtroopers), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller">frighteningly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">efficient</a>, and speak in creepy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSpeech">distorted voices</a> that don't sound even remotely human.

Ford and Zaphod <em>do</em> look human, though. Ford is able to pass for one for fifteen years without difficulty, and while Zaphod normally has two heads and three arms, when the extras are absent he can attend a human party with nobody raising an eyebrow. Amusingly enough, this apparently <em>doesn't</em> go both ways, since aliens sometimes remark on Ford and Zaphod having a pet monkey with them instead of assuming Arthur is a member of their race.

The Daleks also refer to him as human, but then in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E4TheDaleksMasterPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E4TheDaleksMasterPlan">"The Daleks' Master Plan"</a> stated that the Doctor only makes himself appear human. On the other hand, the Doctor told Ian and Barbara that he was "not of this race" in the very first episode, and they are certainly from another planet. They also have some apparently extra-human abilities. Susan possesses some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a>, and the Doctor has all sorts of strange abilities like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicBlockDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicBlockDefense">Psychic Block Defense</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleGenius">the ability to remember the sequence of the Towers of Hanoi correctly</a> and having unusual amounts of vitality compared to a normal person (that, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulFragment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulFragment">transplanted</a> into a normal person, causes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalitySwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalitySwap">some pretty extreme results</a>).

Even though the Daleks can recognize the Doctor's new face immediately, suggesting they're familiar with this process, they still refer to him as a "human being". Arguably, it was only at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS6E7TheWarGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS6E7TheWarGames">"The War Games"</a> at the very end of the Second Doctor's tenure that he was finally declared to truly be an alien.

</li><li> The series often gives no indication whatsoever about whether humanoid cultures in "space" stories are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Human Aliens</a> (of which there are many, especially in pre-2005 stories) or far-future descendants of human colonies.

However, they look completely human and might be a lost human colony. They are explicitly stated to be able to interbreed with humans without any high-tech biological intervention, which would support this in most universes... but then again in <em>Doctor Who</em> humans are capable of interbreeding with cats.
</li><li> It is canon from their first appearance that the Daleks are heavily mutated versions of an originally humanoid race, although their actual backstory is very inconsistent (nuclear radiation causing mutations in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E2TheDaleks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS1E2TheDaleks">"The Daleks"</a>, intentional genetic modification in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E4GenesisOfTheDaleks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E4GenesisOfTheDaleks">"Genesis of the Daleks"</a>). However, how human this precursor race is goes back and forth. In "Genesis of the Daleks" a Kaled scientist notes that although Harry (a human) looks like them his internal workings are completely different, yet in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS27E13ThePartingOfTheWays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS27E13ThePartingOfTheWays">"The Parting of the Ways"</a>, the Doctor explains that humans were used as the source for the new Daleks because of their genetic similarity; and in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E12TheStolenEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E12TheStolenEarth">"The Stolen Earth"</a>, the Tenth Doctor tells Donna that the Kaleds were just like humans but with slightly bluish blood and a few fewer ribs. (Both of these can be explained with in-character behaviour &#151; the Kaleds have an insanely racist culture where any deviation from the norm makes someone a subhuman, and the Doctor could have been exaggerating or lying to make a point.) At least one Dalek story went so far as to suggest the Daleks weren't even slightly human/Kaled or organic, just being robots rather than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleGreenManInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleGreenManInACan">Little Green Man in a Can</a>.

Wells <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">of Earth 2</span> says he <em>was</em> human. Even when we confirm what he looks like under his mask, the fact he can turn his eyes black rather than make them glow and actually deepens his voice rather than make it vibrate makes him unsettling.

Is he a metahuman? Maybe an alien? Is he magical? Or is he something else? The fact that he could escape a cell in the Pipeline, something no other metahuman is capable of, without anyone knowing and his powers are far more fantastical than what Barry or Kara usually deal with suggests he might not have been something they are used to.

Another episode shows that he also looked the exact same when he was still in middle school, at least 7 years ago. This is made even weirder by the fact that he's noticeably larger than all of the other characters, most of whom are teenage or adult humans.

He's the only villain not associated with Ransik, therefore not a mutant. However, he's been alive since the middle ages and never takes off his armor. Considering that episode dealt with magic instead of science, perhaps he used magic to live hundreds of years or is in fact something more supernatural (which isn't out of place in Power Rangers).

The end result is a 'human' who is over eight feet tall, can shrug off most small-arms fire, eat brains to absorb knowledge, spit acid, strong enough to wield literal hand cannons, can neurally interface with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> through their skin...and those are just the <em>baseline</em> Space Marine abilities. Many of the Space Marine Chapters' gene-seeds have mutated, the results include werewolf Marines, vampire Marines, Marines with jet-black skin and glowing red eyes, Marines cursed with the worst possible luck, etc. There's less ambiguity where the Chaos Space Marines are concerned: most of them are so heavily mutated they are more Warp monstrosity than human. Especially the Thousand Sons' Rubric Marines, who are nothing but magic dust animating their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth">Macbeth</a></em>, Banquo and Macbeth aren't sure at first whether the witches are human or supernatural beings. Renaissance beliefs about witchcraft generally involved ordinary humans gaining magical powers by making a bargain with the devil, but Banquo remarks when he sees the witches that they "look not like the inhabitants o' the earth / And yet are on't."
</li><li> Caliban in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheTempest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheTempest">The Tempest</a></em> is referred to repeatedly as a monster by Trinculo, and Prospero describes him as earth, mud, etc., but what he is is never made clear, and it is possible that this is simply used to show contempt. He is described as human<em>oid</em> at least, and he never demonstrates any kind of supernatural abilities (although his mother, who died before the start of the play, is described as a powerful witch).
</li><li> The titular character of the argentine play (later released as a film and a book) <em>La Nona</em> is this. The eldest in a somewhat impoverished family, "La Nona" (jargon for <em>granny</em>) is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Big Eater</a> of superhuman quantities and is likewise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObsessedWithFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObsessedWithFood">Obsessed with Food</a>, and she's extremely old yet perfectly healthy despite eating way too much food. Throughout the play, La Nona averts her grandson Chicho's increasingly desperate attempts to get rid of her, and slowly causes every member in her family to die (or move away in Marta's case). Meanwhile, La Nona herself is none for the worse, and could very well be immortal. It is implied La Nona is actually misery in human form, representing the hard times argentine families lived during the 70s, with misery spreading through everyone, just like La Nona is given shelter by a blissfully unaware family at the end of the play.

<ul><li> Sephiroth (who is not a reliable source) states that humans are descended from Cetra who abandoned their nomadic urge to 'settle the Planet, then move on', instead choosing to settle down. It is unclear whether he means that humans abandoned a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to focus on establishing settlements, as happened in the history of the human race in reality, or whether he means that the Cetra were nomadic <em>spacefarers</em> and the humans those who decided to stay on one planet. The fact that an excavated spaceship is visible in an archaeology site reinforces this idea; but Aeris tells us that the Cetra 'were created by the Planet'.

He has a semi-spheroid shape to his head, tiny sunken pig-like eyes, a flattened snout in the place of a nose, an enormously underslung jaw with a mouth that can open unnaturally wide, and two protruding flattened teeth that resemble tusks. The Wii version goes one step farther by giving him a series of animalistic roars and growls instead of spoken dialogue. Notably, while King Hippo reportedly hails from "Hippo Island", no other natives of that island have ever been seen in-game.

<ul><li> The Shy Guys are a sort of "tribe" of little guys so shy that they never expose anything of their bodies to anyone. They wear long cloaks, shoes, belts, masks and gloves, and when they lose their masks the first thing they do is run away while covering their faces. It's unlikely, given the Mushroom Kingdom's populace, that they actually <em>are</em> human, but their basic shape indicates that they are. In one of the <em>Mario Power Tennis</em> endings a Shy Guy's mask falls off, and while he's turned away from the screen poor Luigi can see it perfectly. He immediately falls over, looking like he saw a ghost, trembling in fear as the Shy Guy walks past him, seeming to imply that the Shy Guys are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFace">anything but</a> human. The closest <em>we</em> get to seeing a Shy Guy's face is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuigisMansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuigisMansion">Luigi's Mansion</a></em>, where there are Shy Guy-like ghosts whose masks have to be removed before they can be sucked up. Behind their masks are a pair of glowing yellow eyes a la <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Jawas</a>.
</li><li> Wario and Waluigi, with their pointy ears, pink noses, and elf shoes, look more like goblins than regular people.
</li><li> Dr. Snoozemore in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiDreamTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiDreamTeam">Mario &amp; Luigi: Dream Team</a></em>. Is he human? A relative of the local Pi'illo people? Some unknown human-like species? It's extremely hard to know, and it's never even hinted at in the game itself.
</li><li> The residents of New Donk City, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a></em>, look like regular, realistically proportioned humans. However they are never referred to as human by the in game brochure, they're just "New Donkers". That, coupled with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardCharacterDesign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardCharacterDesign">Non-Standard Character Design</a> makes them a bit suspect when compared to humans like Mario, Peach and Pauline.
</li><li> According to an internal document from the 1990s, Mario himself isn't a homo sapien, but a "homo nintendonus" however it was likely intended as a joke, and the document itself contains a lot of outdated information. Per <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, circa 2017, Mario is human.
</li><li> In New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe, an item called the Super Crown is added that lets Toadette transform into a Peach lookalike. This raised questions as soon as it was announced, to say nothing of when fans decided to slap that thing on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Bowser</a></em> instead.
</li><li> Peach and the other princesses themselves arguably count. Back when the Brooklyn backstory for the Mario Bros. was still recognized enough to be mentioned in Mario 64's Player's Guide, Peach and presumably Daisy had the oddity of being from all signs human yet rule over short mushroom men. What little has been told of Rosalina's backstory combined with her shown abilities makes what she is open to question too.
</li></ul></li><li> Kanna and Anderson from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThreeTheHardWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThreeTheHardWay">Three the Hard Way</a></em> appear just as human-like as the rest of the party, but the former is a hundred year old alchemist belonging to a mythical ancient order, while the latter seem to have a close tie with the ageless Kaibutsu, and is very much implied to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">Really 700 Years Old</a> as well. Other cast members describe them as "weird" and "intense", and Vance frequently remarks that he wouldn't be surprised if those two are actually not human.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> usually distinguishes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">youkai</a> from humans in some way, physically and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">mentality</a>, but it's also made clear that the line between human and youkai is a lot more blurry than most realise, especially in Gensokyo where humans and youkai have existed in unusually close proximity for centuries.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies">Magicians</a> have a natural affinity with complicated magics but humans can use them with sufficient training, aside from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeedless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeedless">not needing to eat</a> they're quite similar to humans, and some Magicians <em>were</em> human (Alice, Byakuren) before they performed some alluded-to ritual.
</li><li> Marisa is noted to be more like a youkai than a human, and much of her behavior (isolating herself from humans, collecting magical artifacts, intense studying) are implied to be part of the ritual for human Magicians to transform into youkai Magicians. She insists she's human and is immensely proud of being able to hold her own in a land where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsASuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsASuper">Everyone is a Super</a> despite this, but it verges into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial">Suspiciously Specific Denial</a> territory; for example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TouhouSuzunaanForbiddenScrollery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TouhouSuzunaanForbiddenScrollery">Forbidden Scrollery</a></em> (which is all about how the enforced separation and antagonism between humans and youkai is precisely because it takes the slightest nudge to go from one to the other) her title is "<em>Extremely</em> Ordinary Magician". Reimu seems to consider her human, but it's also established that Reimu is far more friendly with youkai than someone of her position should be.
</li><li> Sakuya is classified as human, yet her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMaster">time and spatial manipulation abilities</a> are far beyond the capabilities of any other human (as well as being very similar to the abilities of a Lunarian character), and characters have noted her to be far more mature and worldly than her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge">apparent age</a> would indicate.
</li><li> Not even ZUN knows whether Mononobe no Futo is human, with her profile listing her species as "Human? (a taoist who self-identifies as a shikaisen)". More broadly, this applies to Miko and Seiga, fellow shikaisen who essentially faked their death in such a way that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelestialBureaucracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelestialBureaucracy">Celestial Bureaucracy</a> fell for it, gaining immortality in the process.
</li><li> Related to the above are hermits. Most are humans who get super-powers out of a strict training regimen. But there do seem to be some physiological changes, given that they act as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareCandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareCandy">Rare Candy</a> to youkai. And they might not all have started out as human. The first hermit character introduced, Kasen Ibaraki, is very strongly implied to be an oni who's only pretending to be a hermit.
</li><li> ZUN's also unsure whether Satono and Mai are human, as they get a similar "Human (?)" species entry to Futo. They were human when they were children, but are becoming less and less so thanks to Okina's magic energy. What exactly's happening to them is anyone's guess, but they still retain their human personalities. In <em>The Grimoire of Usami</em>, Yukari explains them as being stuck in the space between human and youkai.
</li><li> Lunarians. They're humans that moved to the moon to avoid kegare, so they no longer die of natural causes, but the profiles always list their species as "lunarian". All of the known ones are based on Shinto gods, which just makes things more confusing.

This was before he encountered the less human-looking denizens of the future and realized he was sent through time.
</li><li> The blind archers that Jack encountered early in his journey look remarkable off when they are freed from their curse. They have necks as long as their torsos and lack ears on their extremely round heads. Even in season 5, which is set 50 years later, they live with a race not that different from them and haven't aged.

<ul><li> Krusty the Clown leaves a lot of fans guessing. This ambiguity was evident in the very beginning, in the Tracey Ullman shorts, when Bart insists that Krusty is a "real" clown and not "just a guy in clown makeup." In the episode "Krusty Gets Busted", we see him out of makeup and with normal-sized feet. And in the episode that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedJudaism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedJudaism">informs us of his Jewish heritage</a>, Krusty has a perfectly human father and is clearly human (if somewhat weird-looking) as a little boy. So case closed, right? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity">Think again.</a> Subsequent episodes had Krusty pointing to his face and (seriously?) saying: "This ain't makeup!" and referring to his "grotesque appearance," though this is strongly suggested to be the result of one of his multiple heart attacks. And in the episode that had Krusty faking his death to cheat the IRS, Bart and Lisa find him hiding out as a "normal" man with yellow skin named "Rory B. Bellows"...who in due course leaps into the water and leaves yellow paint behind, revealing his (real?) whitened clown face underneath! On the other hand, Krusty's (biological) daughter Sophie is undeniably human (albeit with clown-like hair), as is Sophie's (single) mother. It's really hard to square all this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">Perhaps Krusty was adopted, and his "father" made him up to look like a human boy. And maybe Sophie is some other man's daughter after all</a>.
</li><li> Krusty's rival Gabbo (from the "Krusty Gets Kancelled" episode) is another creature who is hard to categorize. He can move about independently of the ventriloquist he's supposedly a dummy to, and appears to have a personality completely distinct from the ventriloquist as well - even to the point that the ventriloquist <em>can't control what he does</em>. Yes, he has pale, waxy skin and hinge-lines on his jaws - but those could just be makeup. And he <em>is</em> very small - but he could just be a midget. On the other hand, his lips flap up and down in a very inhuman manner and a newspaper announces that he's having a "real-boy operation." Just what <em>is</em> he?
</li><li> Charles Montgomery Burns. It's pretty suspicious that he can take a bullet in the chest from a gun fired by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Maggie Simpson</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">and survive</a>, especially considering his age. He also brags about his "strong, sharp teeth" and threatens to "club [people] and eat their bones"...and when, in the episode that had him dating Marge's mother, she told him "You are the Devil himself!", Burns became very angry and defensive ("What?! Who told you - ") before realizing she was speaking metaphorically.
</li><li> In the episode "The Sweetest Apu", Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon considers divorcing her adulterous husband and goes to see a very bizarre lawyer with bug eyes and elf-like facial features. Sure, he looks perfectly human if you're far away or looking at him from the back. But he acts so crazy and evil that he makes Manjula ill at ease, and she remarks that he reminds her of legends of demented monkey-men from her native India. As she is leaving his office, the lawyer bellows in a booming voice: "WHEN WILL YOU HUMANS LEARN?!" &mdash; but it's a pretty easy voice to fake, so it could be the lawyer is just a very ugly, very psychopathic human.
</li><li> The old, green-skinned Chinese man who sells Homer the cursed Krusty doll in one of the Halloween specials. It's possible he's wearing green makeup, but...<em>why</em>?
</li><li> Homer himself. One Season 1 episode had Homer get plastered in mud, which resulted in him being mistaken for Bigfoot. He is taken in for scientific examination, and after cleaning of the mud and a series of extensive studies, the conclusion was that he <em>may or may not</em> be human.
</li><li> On the subject of Krusty, there's also "Handsome Pete," a little person with a head that looks like a distorted version of Krusty's clown face, who was used as a one-off gag.
</li><li> One episode strongly suggests that Hans Moleman belongs to a subterranean race of mole people. Hans himself has a habit of surviving the various mishaps that apparently kill him, like being rammed off the road by Homer or having an ether-intoxicated Mister Burns drill into his skull.

Much about his anatomy appears human, but the costume he's wearing doesn't allow any glimpse of what's underneath. He's bigger than Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, but not as large as any of the confirmed humans. Perhaps the biggest point of contention is his head. It looks like a mask, but is <em>very</em> expressive. At the end of his debut episode, he was able to remove it entirely without any ill effects, showing he had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFaceUnderTheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFaceUnderTheMask">No Face Under the Mask</a>, and leaving it unclear as to whether it's his real head.
