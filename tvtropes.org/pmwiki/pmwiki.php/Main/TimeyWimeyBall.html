<ul><li> The <em>Memory Days</em> OVA features a plot where a magical book sends Natsu's team back six years in time for a few hours, creating a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a> where they influence events from their past (Natsu getting the scar on his neck, and Lucy deciding to join Fairy Tail).
</li><li> Things get <em>really</em> complicated with Eclipse, a gate created by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Zeref</a> that enables <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hisui plans to use the gate to travel 400 years back in time to kill Zeref, which would create a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalParadox">Temporal Paradox</a> as Zeref would never have concocted the idea. This leads to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> where an army of 10,000 dragons in the past comes through the gate, and so Lucy uses the gate to stop this from happening. However, this creates a <em>second</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">Acnologia</a> takes over the world seven years later, and so Rogue travels back to the day <em>before</em> Future Lucy arrives so he can stop <em>Present</em> Lucy from closing the door, resulting in a <em>third</em> timeline (the main one). Destroying the portal in this timeline prevents Future Lucy and Future Rogue from ever using it, thus sending them and the dragons back to their respective time periods. At this point, however, the timeline has become so jumbled that the damage caused by the dragons cannot be reversed, and everyone in that timeline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffectProofMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffectProofMemory">still remembers what happened</a>. Moreover, one of the dragons from the past is also influenced to keep a nickname that was given to him in the present, while another's ghost clearly remembers them.</span>

However, the spell gives everyone in the world momentary foresight of what would happen within that minute, which works in the heroes' favor, seeing how a good number of them were dying at the time.</span>
</li><li> Eclipse comes back into play again (this time in a much stabler way) when it's revealed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lucy's ancestor, Anna, worked with Zeref to send Natsu and the other Dragon Slayers 400 years from the past through the gate. For this to work, Anna left specific instructions for her descendants to open the gate on the other side when the time was right, which was passed along until it reached Layla, Lucy's mother, on July 7, X777, a good 14 years before the above fiasco happened.</span>
</li><li> Another concept of time travel is discussed in the form of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Neo Eclipse, Zeref's ultimate plan, which would theoretically allow Zeref to relive his own life with all of his present memories intact so he can prevent his family's death, avoid becoming cursed, and stop Acnologia before he grows too powerful. Unlike regular Eclipse, which is all but stated to keep any alternate timelines it has created intact, this spell would completely erase the current timeline from existence.</span>

Putting what is confusing about the time travel involved into words is, in itself, extremely confusing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DokiDokiPrecure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DokiDokiPrecure">DokiDoki! PreCure</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie">Non-Serial Movie</a> handles this trope in what's probably the most dumbest way possible. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, frustrated at the Pretty Cures escaping their temporal prison as well as reforming one of his minions, decided to travel to the <em>future</em> and kill everyone there. Apparently, according to this movie, if there is no future to look forward to, the present will cease to exist (despite the fact that going to the future and changing things there affects jack squat in the present).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> can get into this in the "Future Trunks" arc. Previously in DBZ, Trunks' time machine worked firmly on alternate time line theory. DBS sticks to that rule.. for <em>that</em> time machine. It then introduces divine time travel through the time rings, which works on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a>, as do any actions done by the gods using divine ki. However the time machine and time rings are both active, and each can only do its own version of time travel. It gets confusing <em>very</em> quickly.
<ul><li> For a more specific example that set off the entire plot: Trunks time-travels to the alternate past he created to get help against Goku Black. Black temporarily follows him and has a brief fight with regular Goku. Beerus and Whis, who were spectating, notice a similarity between Goku Black's ki and that of a Supreme Kai apprentice in universe 10, Zamasu. While they're investigating, Goku spars with Zamasu to find out why their energy is so similar. Zamasu really wasn't the most stable individual to begin with, and his defeat pushed him over the edge and prompted him to kill his master Gowasu to obtain a time ring, then use the Super Dragon Balls to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> swap bodies with Goku</span> and then terrorize Future Trunks' timeline <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> as Goku Black</span>, which prompted Trunks to go back in time. Beerus and Whis then go back to creating alternate timelines by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> destroying Present Zamasu before he could kill Gowasu (the Time Ring prevented Goku Black from being erased by this) and warning the Beerus of Future Trunks' timeline about Zamasu's plan before it could happen, respectively.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> There's at least one Stand user in every arc<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2kmjs');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2kmjs" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2kmjs');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventurePhantomBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventurePhantomBlood">Phantom Blood</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureBattleTendency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureBattleTendency">Battle Tendency</a>, which did not feature Stands at all</span> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventure">Jojos Bizarre Adventure</a></em> capable of manipulating time (and at least one other that can predict the future but not travel through time). All of them seem to operate on slightly different rules as to whether or not the past and/or future can be changed.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note38keh');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note38keh" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note38keh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">With the exception of The World, which can only freeze time, not travel through it.</span>
<ul><li> The predictive Stand, Thoth, predicts specific events in the near future. No one, not even its user, can stop those events from happening, but they're always vague enough for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropheticFallacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropheticFallacy">Prophetic Fallacy</a> to be in full effect; for example, it predicts that Jotaro would have his head split in half by an explosion, but the brother of Thoth's user disguised himself as Jotaro to avert suspicion and ended up being the one to be hit by an explosion. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Of course, Thoth's predictions might not be so malleable after all - Jotaro dies onscreen <em>twice</em> in future parts, and both times his head gets split in half in the exact same pattern predicted by Thoth.</span>
</li><li> In the next part, Yoshikage Kira's 'Killer Queen Bites The Dust' has the power to trap its victim in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">one-hour time loop.</a> Anything that happens in the loops will happen again in all subsequent loops, though the leadup to those happenings may be different; for example, when Hayato managed to stop the teapot from falling off the table, the handle of Kira's teacup broke a few moments later, spilling tea all over his jacket, and after Rohan triggered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HavingABlast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HavingABlast">Killer Queen's bomb</a> in the first loop, he still exploded in the subsequent loop even though he didn't trigger the bomb. However, if Kira ends the loops before they complete, events that should have been fixed no longer happen.
</li><li> In the part after that, Diavolo has the stand King Crimson, which is so infamously confusing that 'how does King Crimson work' has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">become a meme</a>. First of all, King Crimson itself has a sub-Stand called 'Epitaph' that functions almost identically to Thoth, in that it can predict the future at a range of up to ten seconds, and the predictions it shows cannot be changed but are vague enough to be subject to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropheticFallacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropheticFallacy">Prophetic Fallacy</a>. (This is seen in one story arc when Doppio is granted access to Epitaph but not King Crimson.) King Crimson's power, however, allows it to 'skip' those ten seconds, making it so that any unfavorable outcomes Epitaph predicts simply <em>don't</em> have to happen.
</li><li> Then there's Part Six, where Enrico Pucci eventually evolves his stand into 'Made in Heaven', which has the power to <em>accelerate</em> time. He uses this power to push the universe forward to the Big Crunch and recreate it. The new universe is exactly identical to the original, except that everyone living in it already knows everything that's ever going to happen to them and is unable to change it.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4d85w');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4d85w" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4d85w');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is Pucci's idea of what he refers to as 'Heaven'; a world without surprises.</span> Only Pucci is capable of changing events, though once he's changed someone's fate, they are able to act freely, as anything they do from then on is considered a 'butterfly effect' repercussion of Pucci's actions.
</li><li> Finally, in Part Seven, Ringo Roadagain has the stand Mandom, which allows him to rewind time by six seconds. Unlike most previous time-travel arcs, Ringo can freely change anything that happens in those six seconds; he typically allows his enemy to deal him a mortal wound, memorizes their movements and position, then rewinds, dodges their attack, and kills them. He'd probably be the most formidable of all the listed users if not for the fact that <em>everyone else</em> can also remember what happened in the six seconds Ringo rewinds, and, if they're clever enough to figure out what his power is, can take advantage of it to change <em>their</em> actions as well.

<ul><li> There's a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BackToTheFuture">Back to the Future</a></em> card game based on the film, where again each player is someone from an alternate timeline trying to manipulate the universe into one where they exist. However, one big difference is that after doing so, the time travelers have to <em>stop Emmett Brown from inventing time travel</em> so that nobody else can mess with it and their timeline becomes the only timeline. Paradox much?
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chrononauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chrononauts">Chrononauts</a></em>, players are competing time travelers from alternate futures sent on missions into the past to recover various historical artifacts. Each player is playing tug-of-war with the timeline so that they can return home, which results in a very <em>fluid</em> history. If enough paradoxes pile up, they can even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeCrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeCrash">destroy the universe</a>.
</li><li> In <em>Time Agent</em>, your objective is not to win. Your objective is to have already won... without Time Travel being invented. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">This is probably the least confusing part of the game.</a>
</li><li> In <em>US Patent #1</em> by Cheapass Games, each player has invented a time machine and hopes to profit from it, but the only one who will be able to profit is the one who holds a patent. Given that patents can be invalidated by proof of earlier work, the only patent that matters for a time machine is the chronologically first one. So the entire game consists of a race through time to be the first in line on the first day the Patent Office opens.

This did not work when "Thanos" and the In-Betweener interfered and Adam was given a choice of timelines, wherein he chose the shortest. The Magus appeared again when Adam Warlock attained the Infinity Gauntlet and divested himself of his good self (The Goddess) and his evil self (The Magus). The Magus initiated the Infinity War, but was defeated. Later, to seal the Fault in space caused, in part by the Annihilation Wave, The Phalanx Invasion, and the War of Kings, Adam Warlock <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who, as he expanded magical energy slowly started turning into The Magus, used an "unused" timeline to repair the fault.

Kang's gets <em>six pages</em>, and the bottom half of each page is devoted to Kang's timeline, which is chronological in years but requires jumping around from page to page to get Kang's chronological story.

</li><li> During Bendis' run on two Avengers titles he floated the idea that time is both like a living thing(which it technically is, embodied by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SentientCosmicForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SentientCosmicForce">Sentient Cosmic Force</a> that is Infinity) that occurs all at once and is damaged by time travel. These theories were hypothesized by Iron Man during conflicts with Kang after one time travel too many to change one moment and defeat Ultron <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeCrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeCrash">broke the spacetime continuum</a> and collided multiple potential futures and parallel realities with their present.

In the first chapter, the twins use it to transform a wall lizard into its evolutionary ancestor (which turns out to be a crocodile). In all the other chapters, the twins use it themselves; it no longer makes anything appear in the present time, but depending on the chapter, it either just takes them to the past, or somehow transforms them in their ancestor (and, somehow, with all the knowledge and remembrances that those ancestors have). In one chapter, when their mother makes an omelette with an egg found in the past, the twins remark that its strange look is due to the fact that the egg had over two hundred years, even though the time travel should have prevented the egg from aging.

As he becomes more prominent in the sequel, it's occasionally noted that time travel is extremely complicated - the general consensus is that you <em>can</em> change the past, but it's not easy and you <em>really</em> have to know what you're doing - and Strange generally declines to explain for two reasons. One, being cryptic and enigmatic is kind of his thing. Two, he dislikes "explaining temporal physics to neophytes". This is an audience, by the way, that includes <em>Odin</em> (though compared to Strange, when it comes to time travel, even Odin is a neophyte). When Thor takes umbrage at this, Strange (who is over <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em>300</em></span> times older than Thor) snaps that he should be glad that Strange isn't calling him a child.

<ul><li> Although, ironically, the conversation that confuses Austin doesn't actually contain any inherent paradoxes; the Doctor Evil he was chasing was the contemporary version who had also gone back in time.

His plan is to use the Omnitrix to turn Ben into himself (a second Eon), so that <em>he</em> can activate the device and end the reign of humans on Earth. The movie is pretty vague about how it works, but at first glance, it seems as though Eon may actually <em>be</em> Ben, corrupted by himself in his own past. On top of that, when Eon succeeds in implanting himself in the Omnitrix, he declares that "two cannot exist at once", disappearing into a different point in the time stream.

<ul><li> The time travel model used for this movie actually <em>does</em> make sense, it just creates convoluted timelines and is pretty confusing when watched without knowing this beforehand: <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Deja_Vu_Timeline.GIF#file">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Deja_Vu_Timeline.GIF#file<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> The authors were pretty unhappy with the way the material was directed, saying that it made the film seem like it had many unforgivable plot holes even though there weren't any.

Ultimately, it will result in the destruction of the world... actually, just the destruction of Grizzly Lake High School, because hey, it's not like the main characters know of a world beyond high school.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Frequency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Frequency">Frequency</a></em> is very inconsistent with the way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> works across the film. The movie initially suggests that there are two separate timelines, with a major character (John) in the present gaining memories of two separate timelines at the moment he changes history and saves his father. However, this is dropped afterwards, and the rest of the film suggests that he only has his memories of how events originally occurred. Perhaps more bizarrely, the climactic ending (happening in the two eras simultaneously, as both John and his father fight off the Nightingale Killer) suggests that events in one era will instantly cause timeline alterations to the latter &mdash; during the final fight, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Frank shoots off the Nightingale's hand during a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostageSituation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostageSituation">Hostage Situation</a></span>. In the "present day" of 1999, the same individual watches his own hand twist and collapse down into a stump, which shouldn't be possible in the first place if his hand was shot off 30 years earlier.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotTubTimeMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotTubTimeMachine">Hot Tub Time Machine</a></em> is really inconsistent with its time travel mechanics. Four friends travel back to one day in 1986 and hijack their younger bodies, so everyone sees them as their younger selves. Except one of the friends - Jacob - wasn't born yet and looks the same in the past as he did in the present, and can also interact with the past, but whenever something happens that might possibly stop his conception he flickers out temporarily. Initially the friends, fearing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButterflyOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButterflyOfDoom">Butterfly of Doom</a>, try to enact a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a> by making sure the big events they remember from that night still happen, but then they change their minds and try to make sure the night goes better the second time around. Some of the big events they remember still happen no matter what they do, but not in the way they remember them. Other events they really do alter. Meanwhile they directly or indirectly cause a couple of historical changes. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the end Lou decides to stay behind and use his knowledge of the future to greatly improve his and everyone's lives.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLakeHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLakeHouse">The Lake House</a></em> was a horrible mixture of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> ideologies. In some ways the timeline is constant &mdash; the guy she kissed at the party turns out to be the guy she's communicating with in the past. Yet in other ways the timeline is variable &mdash; she tells him how she misses the trees, so he plants one at the place she's going to live at &mdash; which she magically doesn't notice having grown until after she sent him that letter. And then there's the grandfather paradox involving the (lack of a) car accident at the end/beginning of the film, causing her to go/not go to the lake house and end up communicating/not communicating with the guy in the first place. And there's also the dog in the past timeline who responded to the name given to it in the future timeline.

<ul><li> If you injure the present version of someone, the time-travelling-from-the-future version of the person will immediately show the scars. However, all events involving the future version up until the point the present version was injured continue to have happened as if the injury had never occurred. So you can cut off a present versions legs to stop the future one from escaping, and the future version will immediately fall over in a location they never could have reached unless they had legs up until a few seconds ago.
</li><li> The trope is lampshaded on several occasions by the protagonists; criminals who don't really understand how the various time travel paradoxes work, only that trying to sort it out in their heads just gives you a headache.

When present Will and Dr. Smith enter the bubble, nothing happens to their future selves. Hell, Future Dr. Smith killed his past self without a second thought.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ProjectAlmanac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ProjectAlmanac">Project Almanac</a></em> begins because David finds a video of his current day self at his seventh birthday party, which leads to him discovering and rebuilding the time machine stored in his father's basement, suggesting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a>. Immediately after doing this, however, the cast wantonly screws with their own timeline to make things more favorable for themselves, clearly demonstrating that time can also be changed at will. What's especially crazy is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the situation the video depicts is David retgonning himself by destroying the time machine, which he succeeds in doing, meaning the very situation that led them to the time machine originates from a timeline in which said machine does not exist</span>.
</li><li> The film version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ASoundOfThunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ASoundOfThunder">A Sound of Thunder</a></em> (if not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASoundOfThunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASoundOfThunder">the book</a>) uses hilariously inconsistent rules of time travel (and those rules don't make much sense <em>before</em> they start breaking them). It's a crucial plot point that the characters keep returning to the exact same point in time, but never run into previous versions of themselves (no explanation for that is given)... until the time they do (no explanation for that either). Plants smash through the walls of a building because the past was changed in such a way as to cause plants to grow larger and more aggressively (no explanation is given as to why someone decided to build the building in the spot where, in the new timeline, a giant tree has been growing for ages &mdash; not to mention why the tree that's always been there smashes through the floor while people watch instead of just appearing as it if had always been there). At one point, the characters are unable to travel back to the point in time they want to reach because there's a time disturbance between the present and their destination in the past; the solution? Travel back to an <em>even earlier</em> point and then go forward (if you guessed that no explanation is given as to why the time disturbance is somehow not blocking that too, you've been paying attention).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009">Star Trek (2009)</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has it that instead of erasing the later series, it just split off a new timeline, so that the later series still happened in the original timeline (dubbed "the Prime" timeline in <em>Fanon</em>) but has not in the new timeline. This gets weird as there are many instances of characters from the Prime timeline traveling back to before the split, which means that if a character from the alternate timeline were to travel back to say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">The orbital Atomic Accident</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">The Bell Riots</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekFirstContact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekFirstContact">The first Warp Test</a> they would find time travelers from the Prime timeline, which from their point of view doesn't exist. Quite a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a>... or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">Ass Pull</a>, depending on the variance of your mileage. Prior to the film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> was pretty consistent that time travel changes affect the existing timeline, they don't spawn new timelines (though the existence of parallel but different realities <em>were</em> established, they just weren't caused by time-travel).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekGenerations">Star Trek: Generations</a></em>, contains a nexus which can at once be described as a portal through time and simultaneously interpreted as a veritable heaven which may, in fact, act as merely a database containing the sentient thoughts of all who have encountered it. Kirk's visit to his past doesn't affect the timeline (although one may say this is due to him not actually doing anything to affect it). Picard, on the other hand, experiences an alternate present. While all this could seem viable as time travel, Guinan stops by to mention that Picard can experience the past or the future, the limits of his experiences within the nexus seemingly being restricted to his own imagination. This should leave a very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a>-taste in anyone's mouth when they realize that Picard and Kirk traveling back to stop Soren may not actually be time-travel but merely a pocket of Picard's own imagination within the nexus. Thus everything that happens past this point in time (i.e. <em>First Contact</em>, <em>Insurrection</em> and <em>Nemesis</em>) are not actually part of the prime timeline as Picard is actually gone and the Enterprise is destroyed with its crew dead. Note that the new timeline Star Trek could still be viable as there's no mention of Picard or Enterprise D and Generations has no effect on Spock's existence. Basically, if you accept the nexus as a means of time travel then the time line splits. If you argue it as merely Nexus-Picard's mind, then it doesn't.

The prospective time traveler induces a grandfather paradox. The universe doesn't abhor it or disallow it or anything, but simply plays out the umpteen zillion iterations of the events in question. A leads to B leads to Not-A leads to Not-B leads to A leads to B... It should go on forever, but on each run-through, quantum randomness causes things to be very, very slightly different (an atom decays or not, a pair of colliding air particle zig instead of zag) totally regardless of anything the time traveler does. Normally they won't make any difference whatsoever, but after a few million or trillion iterations, the randomness happens to align in such a way that it breaks the paradox (i.e., kills his wife in a new way) and lets the timeline continue past it. What we the audience see is merely the "final cut" version of history, the one that didn't get stuck in an endless loop.

At first at seems like traveling to the past always creates a fresh new timeline, or "string," where none of your other trips happened, and if you screw something up, you can always make a new string where you didn't. However, it turns out that the strings can become tangled if there are too many of them, and making changes to history is like plucking the strings, causing them to "harmonize" with each other.

It's such a mishmash of pocket universes, alternate universes, and paradox that causality can't even be seen with a telescope on a good day. Essentially: think of the universe as a huge piece of vellum on which reality has been written. Then crumple it up. Most characters make such a habit of going not just back and forth in time but <em>sideways</em> that one <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">goes back to the day where he, as a child, met his elder self, and that elder self committed suicide... only now, as the elder self, shoots his younger self instead.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DateALive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DateALive">Date A Live</a></em> has this thanks to the existence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMaster">Kurumi</a>. A notable example occurs in the tenth and eleventh volumes. Origami (now a Spirit) has Kurumi send her back in time so that she can prevent her parents from being killed by a Spirit. Origami gets into a fight with another Spirit and one of her own stray attacks hits her parents' house. The revelation that <em>she</em> was the one responsible for her parents' deaths causes her to enter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Inverse Form</a>. She returns to the present (as Kurumi's power has a time limit) and causes massive destruction. Kurumi then sends Shido back in time in an attempt to prevent this. Shido initially fails but does comfort Origami after the fact, resulting in her obsessive love for him in the future. He then finds Kurumi's younger self and has her send him further back, allowing him to stop Origami from killing her parents. This creates a new timeline where Origami's parents <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">still end up dying</a> but in a traffic accident, so Origami no longer hates Spirits. However, she nevertheless inherits the power and personality of her original timeline's Inverse Form, which manifests as a split personality. Eventually, Origami's two personalities fuse into one, while the other Spirits also gain memories of the previous timeline.
</li><li> In Connie Willis's stories, the time machine sends you not to your target time-and-place but to the nearest point such that your actions will not change history. (This is consistent with James Hogan's theory mentioned above, though the mechanism is not explicitly stated.) In <em>Doomsday Book</em> (which shared the Hugo Award in 1993), a history student aiming for England 1328 lands instead in 1348, where she can't affect history because everyone she meets will shortly be dead of the Plague.

The first thing we hear about time travel is that it's like a picture book; it looks continuous, but it's not, and scribbling on one page won't change the ending, so it's impossible to change the future. That gets thrown out the window pretty quick, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">time loops</a> up the wazoo. Several space-time locations get multiple time loops overlapping over them at the same time. However, starting in Novel 9, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the timeline splits&mdash; not diverges, <em>splits</em>&mdash; and later fuses back together</span>, and in novel 10 it is revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the evil time traveler Fujiwara is from a different future than Mikuru. In his, she's dead&mdash;and he wants to fix that, because she's his big sister. Unfortunately, in the timeline she's from (where she survived), her little brother never existed in the first place</span>. So it's possible to change the future, right? Maybe. Because when all this craziness is going on, Kyon brings up the picture book analogy again, and it's confirmed that that <em>is</em> how time travel works (though at the same time it's implied to be an incomplete explanation). The mechanics of time travel in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse">The 'Verse</a> are pretty much incoherent now.

On the last, the idea of where it came from is explored a couple of times and eventually it's hit upon that it's impossible to know where it came from, the creators must have been written out of history.

(This is consistent with convention in geology and archeology, where an earlier period is "lower" because its evidence is in deeper strata.)

While this has its own problems, it at least eliminates the ability to murder your mother before she gave birth to you. You cannot change your own past, but you can change the past of anyone born after you so long as the changes you try to make are not contradictory, and you can bring objects back.

"Destiny struggles to reassert the pattern that was meant to be." Sometimes happily, and sometimes not so happily, it succeeds.
</li><li> The <em>Never Again</em> series starts out simple enough. It seems to follow the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics so that time travelers can do anything they want, but will create a new timeline that never intersects with the old. Then comes the third book, where that is thrown out the window, and the author's attempts to explain what is happening (with a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technobabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technobabble">Technobabble</a> about "intersecting universes" and the like) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark">just raises further questions</a>.

Also, characters living during a war where common necessities are scarce are using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentalTimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentalTimeTravel">Mental Time Travel</a> to go back in time before the war to buy any supply they run out of in the present (which should mean that at one point in the past their cupboards must have been bursting with supplies).
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonridersOfPern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonridersOfPern">Dragonriders of Pern</a></em> novels by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnneMcCaffrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnneMcCaffrey">Anne McCaffrey</a> have time-travel courtesy of a side-effect of how the dragons teleport themselves and their riders all over the planet. However, you can't change the past. Several story lines, especially in the original novels to do with solving the empty weyrs, rely on the fact that major characters go back in time to make history happen, usually inadvertently. Meanwhile, coming close to yourself causes mental confusion. This happens to Lessa at least once and, of course, it drives the plot.

Navigation for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Imperium of Mankind</a> requires the use of psychic Navigators to essentially <em>feel</em> their way to their destination, avoiding the worst of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsAnOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsAnOcean">warp storms and riding favourable currents</a> to reach their destination. However, given the abovementioned mutability of time along the way, <em>when</em> you arrive is anyone's guess. The crew could be in transit for weeks or months at a time to arrive at their destination at the same time as when they left, centuries late, or even <em>before they set out</em>, if you even get there at all. A graphical history for a given ship would more closely resemble a circuit diagram than a timeline if plotted out.
</li><li> One specific example had an Ork leader accidentally end up at his starting location just before the fleet left, and then promptly attacked and killed his past self to get a spare of his favorite gun (the Waaagh! disbanded in the ensuing confusion).
</li><li> There is also a long-running war between Eldar Farseers (who can manipulate current events to change the future) and actual time travelers from the Necron dynasties and Imperial Inquisition (who may or may not have accidentally erased themselves from the timeline).
</li><li> One Imperial ship responded to a distress signal, but was ambushed in the Warp. Just before its destruction it managed to send out a distress signal...

<ul><li> Since the "Yellow Church" claimed his plan to solve the Sidewinder crisis "seemed like such a good idea at the time", it could be safe to speculate Sister/Yellow Church is there due to a further loop leading back to Sidewinder.
</li><li> The series later attempts to explain all this earlier time-travel nonsense during the "Recollections" trilogy of seasons by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">explaining that the Red and Blue soldiers are actually simulation troopers meant to test Freelancer troops against a myriad of mad situations and everything they were subjected to in Blood Gulch was in fact a controlled situation they weren't meant to understand</span>.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StaticShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StaticShock">Static Shock</a></em> has a one-shot time-traveling metahuman who briefly teams up with Static and Gear, only to decide her powers are too dangerous, go back in time to before the Big Bang, and steal her past self's bicycle so she couldn't get caught up in it. Would be a classic paradox were it not for the fact that Static and Gear <em>still remember the previous version of what happened</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Upon pointing this out, Gear comments that if you try too hard to figure it out, your head will explode.</a>
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/pp2kiz/the-colbert-report-tek-jansen---from-the-future">This<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> episode of <em>Tek Jansen</em>, a series of shorts originally created for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenColbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenColbert">Stephen Colbert</a>'s show, illustrates how bad (or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">awesome</a></em>) this trope can get.
<ul><li> A short summary for all the non-Americans who can't see the video: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Prince and his three attendants, one of whom is named Schlorb, crash land on a planet. Tek Jansen arrives (and to clarify arrives means appear out of nowhere with a time machine) from the future to protect them. Then a second Tek Jansen arrives from further in the future and shoots the first Tek Jansen. Tek explains that in five minutes the first Tek would have eaten a couple of berserker berries, gone insane, and attacked them. He then eats the berries and goes insane. A third Tek Jansen arrives from sometime and shoots the second Tek. He says that Schlorb explained everything to him, but does not remember when. A fourth Tek arrives from the future and sends the third Tek into the past because Schlorb has an important message for him. A fifth Tek accidentally arrives naked with some lady on top of a console. The fourth Tek leaves (and to clarify leaves means disappear with the time machine) with them. A sixth Tek walks on screen with two clean shirts and does not recognize the Prince or his attendants. A seventh Tek arrives and shoots the sixth Tek because one of the shirts had too much starch in it. The seventh Tek is then eaten by a slime monster. An eighth Tek arrives in some sort of armor and asks if he was eaten by the slime monster yet. The kids say yes and Tek leaves frustrated. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">A ninth Tek arrives and says that he is pretty sure that he needs to take Schlorb into the past, and proceeds to do so. A battered tenth Tek arrives and warns the kids to stay out of caves, then leaves. An eleventh Tek arrives and says he knows of a great cave that they can camp out in. A twelfth Tek arrives, shoot the eleventh Tek, hands the group an egg beater, tells them to hand it to the next Tek that appears, and leaves. The Prince points out that this is pretty fucked up. A thirteenth Tek arrives fighting a giant egg. Tek grabs the egg beater and leaves, still fighting the egg. A fourteenth Tek arrives and explains that all this time travel has opened a chrono-rift in the space-time continuum. He is going to go fix it, but he wants the kids to do exactly what the next Tek tells them to. He leaves. But then a large group of Teks arrive all pointing in different direction. They proceed to fight each other, and the episode ends on a cliffhanger</a>. This all happens in two minutes</span>. You got all that?
</li></ul></li><li> There's a gigantic lampshade in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TrippingTheRift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TrippingTheRift">Tripping the Rift</a></em>. The crew saves the day by turning back time Superham-style: by flying the ship around a star counterclockwise really fast. While they're setting up, they discuss the inconsistency of the rules of time travel and the problems with changing the past.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen">X-Men</a></em>, Bishop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffectProofMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffectProofMemory">keeps his memories of the previous chain of events when he returns into the future</a>. Later the two parter "One Man's Worth" has the death of Charles Xavier before he founded X-Men resulting into a war-torn present. Wolverine and Storm from this changed reality travel into the past to help to save him. After the successful mission accomplishment they return into the future (present time) and for some reason lose all their memories about the Xavier-less reality.

Time in the afterlife apparently works like this: while time on Earth moves in a linear fashion that can be represented by a straight line, time in the afterlife curves and loops around until it looks like the name &quot;Jeremy Bearimy&quot; written in cursive letters. Including the dot of the &quot;i&quot; which, described as concisely as possible, is both Tuesdays and July and also sometimes never (in other words, it's the time moment in the Bearimy timeline where nothing never happens).	</p>
