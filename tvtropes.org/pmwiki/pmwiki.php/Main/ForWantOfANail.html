<div class="indent">For want of a paperclip, a page was lost. <br>For want of a page, a contract was lost. <br>For want of a contract, a deal was lost. <br>For want of a deal, a factory was lost. <br>For want of a factory, a company was lost. <br>All for the want of a paperclip.
</div></li><li> Toshiba Electronics commercials depict this inside the mind of the CEO, leading him to hold back on releasing the product to make sure it has all the features it needs, regardless of the cost. For example, adding shock-proof hard drives to their PCs. He imagines an electrician dropping his laptop, picking it up and plugging it into an outlet at a relay substation, which causes a spark that knocks out the power. This leads to a person's roommate opening the refrigerator, sniffing some milk, noticing it's spoiled but drinks it anyway, immediately turns into a zombie, and unleashes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a> on the world.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTriggeringDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTriggeringDeath">For want of Raye Penber</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> lasted much shorter than it could.
<ul><li> Even earlier than that, the human who picked up Ryuk's fallen Note happening to be both crazy enough and smart enough to use it constantly without getting caught <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">initially</span>.
</li><li> The first two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathNoteSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathNoteSeries">live-action films</a> showed that the whole second arc could have been avoided <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">if L thought to write <em>his own</em> name in the Death Note.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon">Delicious in Dungeon</a></em>, mistakes on their map cost Team Touden a day of dungeon delving, and a trap caused them to lose three day's worth of food. The party was not at their best due to hunger when they encountered the red dragon, causing Falin to be eaten, and the start of our story. Had things been otherwise, there likely would have been a very different fight with the dragon. Considering their reduced party, with Senshi admitting he's not much of a fighter, were <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> able to kill the dragon without any deaths later, they likely would have been very successful.</span>
</li><li> The basis for the plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DualParallelTroubleAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DualParallelTroubleAdventure">Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure</a></em> is that reality splits depending on whether a construction worker on site when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a> is found takes a sample home when his crew's ordered to destroy the evidence. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a>, Kazuki is at first able to see into the other reality, and eventually crosses over.
</li><li> The reboot of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RozenMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RozenMaiden">Rozen Maiden</a></em> manga features Jun, the protagonist of the original manga, who decided to take the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedPillBluePill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedPillBluePill">blue pill</a> path instead, resulting in him not meeting the dolls and remaining a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hikikomori" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hikikomori">hikikomori</a> for the remainder of his mid-school duration. We meet him as a disgruntled college student with a bad side job, and frequently being laughed at due to his past status as a hikikomori. That is until Shinku and the other dolls from the original continuity appear in his continuity...
</li><li> One of the recurring themes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes">Legend of Galactic Heroes</a></em>, where seemingly minor events cause a huge impact on history. What if Kircheis had been armed during Ansbach's assassination attempt <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and survived instead of died</span>? What if the supply depot Muller attacked had fought back instead of surrendering so that he couldn't rescue Reinhard? What if Hilde hadn't persuaded Mittermeyer to attack Heinessen to force a ceasefire, or if Yang ignored said ceasefire? What if Yang hadn't allowed the "Imperial escorts" on his ship <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">so that they couldn't assassinate him</span>?
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaiOtome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaiOtome">Mai-Otome</a></em> manga, Sergay is not Nina's father and Nagi, while not a very good person, is not the main antagonist. As a result, Nina stays on the heroes' side for the entire story.
<ul><li> On a lesser scale, Sergay is not anonymously paying for Arika's education in the manga, forcing her to take on several side jobs and leaving her no time to study, at one point putting her in danger of failing and dropping out.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, the main timeline ends up being VERY different than the one Trunks comes from. For example, Androids #17 and #18 are much more powerful in the main timeline but not really all that evil (they do initially intend to kill Goku out of boredom but don't really go out of their way to hurt anyone else) whereas in the future timeline, since Goku was already dead, they were made explicitly for world domination but were far less powerful because they did not account for Super Saiyans. Android #19 didn't exist in the Trunks' timeline nor did Android #20 (Dr. Gero had never turned himself into an Android). Goku also got sick much later than he did in Trunks' timeline. <br><br>The difference in strength between the main and alternate timeline versions of #17 &amp; #18 was explained differently in the manga. In the "Trunks: The Story" chapter when Gohan was fighting #17 &amp; #18, immediately before #17 kills Gohan, #17 tells him that he'd been using no more than half of his power. After a short timeskip, we see Bulma &amp; Trunks debating the need for a time machine. Trunks thinks he's already gotten strong enough to defeat 17 &amp; 18, while Bulma thinks he's too na&iuml;ve since he was only at about Gohan's level and Gohan was still killed. After this we see Trunks leave to fight them and the next panel we see they've put him in the hospital. There is no actual proof that the full magnitude of 17's power (and possibly also 18's) was revealed to Trunks before he went back in time. Assuming that Trunks was unaware of 17 &amp; 18's full power in his timeline, it would explain his surprise at their power in the main timeline. This would also indicate that the androids from the main timeline were actually just as strong as those in the alternate timelines and that Trunks was simply unaware of that fact. However, one thing remains consistent in both timelines: Goku dies.

However, later on, Andy's toys are assigned to dangerous infants who play rough and Lotso turns out to be a sadistic bully who wants them to be tortured, if not broken to death. Once the toys do figure out a master strategy to escape their prisons, Lotso drags them all with him into a garbage chute where they nearly get burned and destroyed by an incinerator.</span>

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlindChance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlindChance">Blind Chance</a></em> is an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Alternate History</a> at the individual level. Have one small detail play out differently (catching or not a train while noticing or not someone in the crowd), and the man's entire life will change as a result. The way how the entire story is told inspired the next two movies listed below.
</li><li> <em>Lola rennt</em> (a.k.a. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RunLolaRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RunLolaRun">Run Lola Run</a></em>): the wildly variant endings of Lola's twenty-minute <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">"Groundhog Day" Loop</a> can all be traced back to Lola's reaction to the boy with the dog on the staircase.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SlidingDoors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SlidingDoors">Sliding Doors</a></em> has catching/not catching a train as the "nail" and ends with dramatically different versions of the protagonist. The 'nail' moment was marked with music and later in the film when the protagonist had to make a decision the music was played again. Although we didn't follow this 'split' it implied that there were more points where a single decision would be important.
</li><li> In the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Frequency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Frequency">Frequency</a></em>, a son manages to send a message back in time and save his firefighter father's life. However, because of this change, his mother, who was a nurse, never left the hospital to make funeral arrangements and so was on duty to save the life of a man who would've died. This man turns out to be a serial killer who kills the mother and is now still at large in the present of the son.
</li><li> The vast majority of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Brazil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Brazil">Brazil</a></em>'s plot occurs because of a swatted fly that fell into a typewriter, causing an arrest warrant for Harry <strong>T</strong>uttle to instead be made out for Harry <strong>B</strong>uttle.
</li><li> The whole "Pottersville" sequence in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItsAWonderfulLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItsAWonderfulLife">It's a Wonderful Life</a></em> is an example of this. George's having never been born turns out to have an indelible effect on the lives of pretty much everyone he's ever known in real life. (Of course, the whole idea of the movie is how much one man can make a difference.)
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BackToTheFuture">Back to the Future</a></em> film trilogy is a series of nails showing what would have happened if a certain event did or didn't occur:
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture">first movie</a>, Marty McFly's father was a wimp who couldn't stand up to the bully Biff Tannen, but after Marty changed events concerning his father in 1955, he becomes a more confident and successful man who has Biff eating out of his hand, and Marty's family life has also improved.
</li><li> Also in the second movie, an automobile accident that would have happened in the third movie when Marty was racing with his friend Needles was the nail that caused Marty's future history to go down the toilet by 2015, eventually resulting in him being fired from the company he and Needles were working for. When the accident was avoided in the third movie, the YOU'RE FIRED message that Marty's girlfriend/future wife Jennifer Parker had received from the future was erased, meaning that their future could potentially become a better one.

The entire plot is basically kicked off by a <em>corset being laced too tightly</em>, causing the wearer of the corset to fall into the water, causing the cursed coin she's also wearing to summon the undead pirates who capture her, setting off the rescue mission by the other two main characters that makes up most of the plot.

And Ben being forced to look after an extremely unhappy Trevor makes his day and job interview a nightmare and he embarrasses himself at a Japanese restaurant meeting.

Also, he gets a zit.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FinalDestination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FinalDestination">Final Destination</a></em> films each involve premonitions allowing people to escape a mass disaster, only for Death to come after everyone who should have died according to "Death's design". The second film leans heavily on this trope; it's revealed halfway through that the first film's characters avoiding the Flight 180 crash created ripple effects as Death hunted them down, allowing others to escape their fates. (For example, one character in the first film is hit by a bus, which means that one of the passengers on that bus doesn't make it to the hotel she was planning on staying in that night, which means she survives when a gas leak suffocates everyone else in the hotel) It's implied (and was explicit in the original script) that the highway pile-up in the second film was arranged by Death to take out a number of these 'ripple survivors' in one go.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In the final film of the series, the final scene reveals that the film is a prequel, and that the Flight 180 disaster was a means of catching up to two survivors of an earlier bridge collapse, meaning that if those survivors had been a little bit slower escaping the bridge, the first two movies wouldn't have happened</span>.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> However, the fourth film (and the most recent events in-universe) reveal that actually this isn't a result of this trope but was in fact Death's plan for each person all along. The premonitions were Death's way of making sure that the protagonists survived long enough to reach their intended deaths.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotTubTimeMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotTubTimeMachine">Hot Tub Time Machine</a></em>, the bar bet turns into a nightmare for Lou. The squirrel that was vomited on in an earlier scene changes the history of the NFL playoff game as it disrupts John Elway's pass on the field.
</li><li> The beginning of Tajomaru's story in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rashomon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rashomon">Rashomon</a></em> starts like this: he was drifting off to sleep in a forest, but is awakened by the sound of hoofbeats and opens his eyes to see the samurai and his veiled wife passing by. He initially isn't interested, and drifts off again when a breeze stirs his hair and lifts the veil of the woman, causing him to want her, and from there, the events snowball into a murder which results in the trial. He blames the whole incident on the breeze revealing the woman's face and rousing him to view the face. Admittedly if the samurai hadn't stopped to inspect this strange, half-clothed man reclining by a tree at the edge of the forest road and kept moving, the breeze would have arrived later and Tajomaru wouldn't have given the couple a second thought.
</li><li> At the start of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShawshankRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShawshankRedemption">The Shawshank Redemption</a></em>, Andy Dufresne contemplates murdering his wife and her lover but instead throws his gun away after sobering up and deciding not to murder them. They're murdered by someone else and Andy is charged. Andy's only defense is he couldn't have done it because he threw his gun in the river. Had he not thrown away his gun, the bullets recovered from their bodies would have proven his gun was not used to commit the crime. This is actually pointed out by the District Attorney.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MoneyForNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MoneyForNothing">Money For Nothing</a></em>, Joey, while being driven home by his friend when there was not enough work at the docks, sees a metal bin that would make a nice toolbox and has his friend stop. The bin turns out to be from an armoured car and contains two canvas bags with $1.2 million meant for a casino. Joey takes the bags and leaves bin. Had he also taken the bin, the police would never have found out where and how the money left the truck and thus been unable to question the two kids who saw everything, including the make and colour of Joey's friend's car, and likely would never find Joey. However, the ending states the real Joey was acquitted on a plea of temporary insanity, so he wasn't thinking right.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan1">Spider-Man</a></em>, this idea is particularly strong. If Peter Parker had not had a crush on Mary Jane Watson for most of his life, he wouldn't have had to work up the nerve to talk to her at Columbia's science lab (sowing the seeds of later friendship and romance), which also means he wouldn't have lingered long enough to be bitten by the GM spider. He wouldn't have had his conflict with Ben or the fight with Flash Thompson, he wouldn't have gone out for the wrestling show, he wouldn't have let the thief go, and Uncle Ben would not have been killed. Despite the upside of the Parker family not losing Ben, the seminal events of Spider-Man's origin would never have happened, leaving New York without its most iconic superhero. This potentially means that Norman Osborn would still have become the Green Goblin, but there would have been nobody capable of stopping him. (Not as important, but he also never would have gained the confidence he needed to confess his feelings to MJ as Peter or save her life and catch her eye as Spider-Man, and however dragged out, they wouldn't have gotten together.)

Had Peter still become Spider-Man, this means the defining moment where he goes from vigilante to hero would never have occurred (though he might have succeeded in catching Ben's killer). Interestingly, while Captain Stacy's death by impalement at the claws of the Lizard never would have happened, his profession meant that there could always have been another day he didn't make it home to his family.

Had Peter fired his web just a little bit off the mark, or if MJ hadn't walked out of the concert to follow Peter, the crew would have recovered the drone and Mysterio's scheme of becoming the next Iron Man would have gone off without a hitch, and Peter would have likely retired from being a superhero in favor of having a normal life, having passed down the E.D.I.T.H glasses as well as the title Tony Stark's successor in favor of Quentin Beck.

He turns to crime but is caught. As he sits in jail, his sister dies of tuberculosis while in foster care. Having nothing left to live for, he falls into a pattern of alcoholism and drug use, committing robberies and muggings to feed his addictions. During one mugging, he accidentally kills the young wife of a brilliant scientist. The scientist never recovers from this heartbreak, turning cold and bitter. When the scientist hears about an experimental time travel technology, he builds a bomb and takes the city of New York hostage. The scientist does not care if New York is destroyed, because he knows the time travel technology will be used to save the city - and possibly his wife in the process.
</li><li> In the Christian movie <em>Second Chance</em>, the lead character, who is a Christian, sees all the fun his friends are having apart from him and wishes that he never was a Christian. An angel shows and says his prayers have been answered, and thus in his new non-Christian life, he sees that his parents are divorced, his mother is going out with other men constantly, and his friends see him as a sleazy jerk who is always sleeping around. During a scene where he is being chased by a few guys and desperately prays for his life to be restored, he reaches the doors of a church and finds out that the guys chasing him became his friends again, thus indicating that he was now given a second chance.

Keeping in the spirit of "What if?", the flavor text on a good portion of the cards give quick looks at an entire subplot that revolved around what would've happened if Mirri had slain Selenia before Crovax had a chance to, thus fulfilling the terms of a family curse, turning her into a vampire instead of him.

You can destroy a time traveler by introducing a few of these little changes into his perceived timeline. "Replacing the nail" is a defense. Did an enemy time-traveler realize you sat in a coffee shop and read a book on Saturday, July 8th, 1995? He can frag you by doing something as simple as stealing the book out of your bag. You can reverse it by replacing a near-identical copy into your bag before "past you" notices the change.

Harry's youngest son Albus and Draco's son Scorpius get their hands on a Time Turner capable of traveling back years into the past rather than mere hours. They want to use it to save Cedric Diggory from dying at the hands of Voldemort. Their meddling in history results in two alternate timelines:
<ul><li> The first timeline is caused when Albus and Scorpius disguise themselves as Durmstrang students to sabotage Cedric's attempt at the First Task of the Triwizard Tournament. Hermione spots them and suspects Viktor Krum of cheating, resulting in her not accepting his request to dance at the Yule Ball, going with Ron instead. Because of this, Ron never experiences any romantic jealousy over Hermione and never throws a fit about it towards her either. Instead, he continues to see her as a friend rather than a potential love interest. He does find love in Padma Patil and ultimately marries her, with the both of them conceiving a son named Panju. This makes Hermione an embittered woman who in her adult life becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher">Sadist Teacher</a> at Hogwarts, venting her romantic frustrations at the students. Unfortunately for Albus and Scorpius, the changes to the timeline did not result in Cedric surviving, as his humiliation at the first task made him more determined at the other tasks.
</li><li> The second timeline is caused when Albus and Scorpius successfully sabotage the Second Task of the Tournament. The humiliation of losing becomes too much for Cedric, resulting in him enlisting into Voldemort's Death Eaters. At the Battle of Hogwarts, Cedric manages to kill Neville Longbottom, who, in the original timeline, managed to destroy Nagini, Voldemort's final Horcrux. Because Neville was killed before destroying Nagini, Harry failed in his mission to kill Voldemort, resulting in Voldemort gaining absolute power. In this timeline, Harry was killed by Voldemort so Albus is never born. Also, Draco Malfoy has become the head of the magical law enforcement, with his son Scorpius being a somewhat important figure maintaining a reign of terror at Hogwarts, ran by Dolores Umbridge as headmistress. Also, Hermione runs an underground resistance movement with Ron and Severus Snape as members.

Each data cell in an SSD can only be written to so many times before it gives out, and most of the time that takes years, but the author admits his Macbook Air crapped out after only a month because of this very issue, which is why he wrote the article (he had no backup at the time). Basically, solid-state drives sort of know that their cells can give out for any reason, and so 10-20% of the cells included in an SSD are meant as remedy cells for use when others give out... but once that remedial supply is gone, any further cell failures are totally gone too. He writes that once this happens, the drive can simply refuse to boot up at all, meaning that if you want any shot at fixing the drive, you have to format it... losing everything on it forever. You can't retrieve data from an SSD the same way you can from an HD, because on the latter the data is not <em>really</em> deleted once you move to delete it, but on an SSD for data to be recognized as deleted it has to actually <em>be</em> deleted.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/SCPFoundation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/SCPFoundation">SCP Foundation</a></em>: On January 13, 1917, an 11-year-old boy is waiting with his mother for his father, who had just returned home from Europe. In one timeline, she held his hand and the two barely managed to avoid a speeding car. In another, she had brought a present for his father, which allowed the boy to run out into the street in excitement and the car to hit him. His parents mourn him, but history moves on. The biggest difference is that the organization the boy would one day found never comes into being. Welcome to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/unfounded-hub">Unfounded<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> Channel Awesome's Fanscription series is a "What if?" series that talks about how things would have played out if big events in film history took a different turn.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyIV">Rocky IV</a></em>, the premise of the movie is that Apollo Creed is killed in the ring by Ivan Drago and that Rocky then challenges Drago to a rematch in Russia to avenge his friend. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcMXPCKYus">But what if Apollo hadn't died?<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> What if Rocky, not wanting to see Apollo's pride lead to his death<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0182j');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0182j" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0182j');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Apollo was going through a midlife crisis at this point in the movies' timeline, as it was around this point that he cheated on his wife and gave birth to his illegitimate son Adonis, protagonist of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Creed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Creed">Creed</a></em> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Creed2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Creed2">movies</a>. And his pride had cost him his championship in his match with Rocky in the second <em>Rocky</em> film</span>, threw in the towel before Drago could land the fatal blow on Apollo?
<ul><li> Apollo is hospitalized and while he recovers, he is permanently paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair. Rocky visits Apollo in the hospital, but Apollo is angry at Rocky's decision to throw in the towel and kicks him out of the room. Frustrated, this leads Rocky to turn his anger and frustration on Drago. Apollo eventually understands why Rocky made his choices and reconciles to travel with Adrian to Russia to be by Rocky's side while Rocky is training. Apart from some minor alterations, the main plot is the same up until the bout with Drago in Russia, which Rocky enters in much better spirits than in the movie.
</li><li> The grudge match between Rocky and Drago goes slightly differently, with Drago getting the upper hand on Rocky in the opening rounds, enough so that Apollo considers throwing in the towel before Rocky meets the same fate as him, at least until the tides change and Rocky takes away Drago's advantage. It's words of motivation from Apollo (mixed with some of Tony's lines) that give Rocky the final push to win over Drago by TKO.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u_YeVtLH5s">Fanscription did another video<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> highlighting how <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyV">Rocky V</a></em> would've differed as a result of the above changes to <em>Rocky IV</em>. The what-if in this case also borrows elements from the later movies.
<ul><li> Rocky hangs up his gloves after the Drago match due to the potential brain damage he sustained. Five years later, Rocky's fortune is wiped out thanks to his shady accountants and he has to move back to his old neighborhood.
</li><li> Tommy Gunn's storyline is consolidated with that of Mason Dixon from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyBalboa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyBalboa">Rocky Balboa</a></em> and Union Cane from <em>Rocky V</em>. Tommy has been with his promoter George Washington Duke for several years, and the crowd is not impressed by how easily he wins fights. The heavyweight division's reputation is on the outs, and with Duke in command, many of Tommy's fights aren't 100% legitimate. Duke and his partner Merlin begin thinking of a way to regain public support, ultimately deciding to pull Rocky out of retirement.
</li><li> Apollo has been doing charity work since the physical injuries from his bout with Drago ended his boxing career. His reputation has been very much restored. During a press conference, he's asked about Duke's pitch.
</li><li> Duke does everything to try to goad Rocky into the match with Tommy Gunn. When none of this works, he sees an article about another charity event Apollo is overseeing and gets an idea. He calls a press conference and exposes Rocky's criminal record to the public. Not only that, but he also reveals the truth about Apollo's son Adonis. Apollo's and Rocky's reputations are tarnished. Apollo reaches out to Adonis and he decides to take him in.
</li><li> Rocky and Paulie are accosted by Duke and Tommy at a bar as a publicity stunt. Rocky decides he's had enough and agrees to the match. He goes to the Pennsylvania Athletic Commission and reapplies for a boxing license (as seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyBalboa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyBalboa">Rocky Balboa</a></em>). The panel is hesitant but is swayed in Rocky's favor by his motivational speech. He has a falling out and shouting match with Adrian and Robert over going back into the career that crippled his friend, and ultimately reconciles with Robert. He decides that the match with Tommy will be his last fight before he retires from boxing for good.
</li><li> There's lots riding on the climactic exhibition match, as Rocky and Apollo are seeking to restore their reputations and Rocky needs to get out of his financial hole. The match goes twelve rounds, with Rocky winning over Tommy by TKO in the twelfth.
</li><li> The ending scene of Rocky and Robert at the Rocky statue, where Rocky gives his son Rocky Marciano's cufflink. Except here, Apollo, young Adonis, and Tony are also present.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MagicMetahumansMartiansAndMushroomCloudsAnAlternateColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MagicMetahumansMartiansAndMushroomCloudsAnAlternateColdWar">Magic, Metahumans, Martians and Mushroom Clouds: An Alternate Cold War</a></em> timeline is built on the premise that the paranormal is discovered to be real during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, and is then heavily researched and adapted by both sides of the Cold War, while also becoming prevalent on its own. Quite a few changes compound over the years as things play out.
<ul><li> Beria is executed by Stalin in 1945 for trying to disprove the OSP's (the Soviets' paranormal research organization) efforts by shooting Renzaoren (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobot">Ridiculously Human Robot</a> found in a crashed alien ship).
</li><li> For unspecified reasons, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralia%2C_Pennsylvania">Centralia<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is never destroyed by its underground coal fire.
</li><li> Thanks to the intervention of Prometheus and Typhon, the monarchists lose the Greek Civil War, turning Greece into a communist state.
</li><li> Because of how things turned out in Greece, America provides more aid to the Kuomintang, allowing them to win the Chinese Civil War, reducing the PRC to just Manchuria. This also means that without a communist superpower at their back to support them, North Korea never invades the South.
</li><li> Trofim Lysenko is purged by Stalin for opposing the Soviet use of mysticism.
</li><li> Thanks to having golems boosting their regular military forces, Israel does well enough in the Arab-Israeli War to take and keep control of the Sinai Peninsula and Suez Canal. This causes a more embittered and paranoid Naguib to crack down on potential rebellion, including executing Nasser before he can overthrow him.
</li><li> The Nationalists winning the Chinese Civil War helps prevent the Red Scare. As a result of this, Eisenhower stays out of the Republican primaries in 1952, causing the nomination to go to Robert Taft, who then loses to Adlai Stevenson. Party fatigue then allows Nixon to win in 1956.
</li><li> Subhas Bose never dies in a plane crash, and goes on to take over India after becoming a metahuman. Even after his death, his followers stay in control, keeping India as a dictatorship.
</li><li> South Africa's imposition of apartheid leads to a native rebellion spearheaded by metahumans and shamans, which successfully overthrows the white minority government.
</li><li> The collapse of Churchill's reputation (from his obsessive search for Excalibur) allows Anthony Eden to take over leadership of the Conservatives years sooner. He also become Prime Minister a few years ahead of OTL due to public fear after a metahuman gangster's rampage.
</li><li> The US provides the Batista government in Cuba with the Lazarus zombie virus, which enables them to crush Castro's revolution. Conversely, attempts to use zombies to remove Francois Duvalier's regime fails due to Papa Doc fighting back with his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooZombie">Voodoo Zombies</a>, solidifying his regime; in response to the Americans' actions, Duvalier seeks closer ties to the Soviets, leading to Haiti taking the place of Cuba in a resulting missile crisis.
</li><li> Stalin survives his 1953 stroke due to the intervention of Koschei the Deathless (who was freed by the OSP and brought into Soviet service), going on to carry out several more purges, including a mini-pogrom against the Jewish population over the "Doctor's Plot" and executing Kruschev and Zhukov on Koschei's advice. When he finally does die in '58, Malenkov has him revived via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading">Brain Uploading</a>, only to pull the plug when this results in insanity and a nuke being launched at Moscow. With Malenkov's reputation ruined and much of the government dead from radiation poisoning, Dmitri Shepilov takes over as General-Secretary.
</li><li> Martin Luther King is murdered in 1957 by a metahuman Klansman.
</li><li> Without the Red Scare, Joe McCarthy's witch hunts are instead built around supposed Satanic influence in the government.
</li><li> The 1953 Iranian coup is prevented due to Mosaddegh getting a warning about it from the afterlife.
</li><li> Similarly, the 1955 coup against Juan Peron is averted due to people being more focused on the alien parasite outbreak in Patagonia.
</li><li> Nicolae Ceausescu's obsession with eliminating Romania's vampire problem at the expense of all other political matters eventually leads to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryCoup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryCoup">Military Coup</a> in 1973, ousting him in favor of Ion Mihai Pacepa.
</li><li> The French with the Battle of Dien Bien Phu thanks to the paranormal research at their disposal, and are able to get Kai-Shek's China on the anti-communist side in the war.
</li><li> Nixon is assassinated in 1964 by a metahuman associated with the Vietnamese communists. His Vice-President, Harold Stassen, wins the subsequent election by a landslide, only to then lose against JFK in '68.
</li><li> Pol Pot never changes his name from Saloth Sar, drifts more towards mysticism than communism, and eventually turns himself and his followers into Nagas to give them an edge against the French.
</li><li> The chaos that engulfs Paris in May 1968 &mdash; partly due to existing tensions from both the left and right wings but primarily because of an invasion from an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> where the Bonaparte dynasty conquered the world &mdash; weakens people's faith in Charles de Gaulle and leads to him losing reelection later that year.
</li><li> Syngman Rhee is never ousted as President of South Korea, due to a precognitive warning him of the coup. Instead, he ends up making himself the face of a new Christian movement led by Ahn Sahng-hong, who later creates a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfYouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfYouth">youth serum</a> for him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Americans eventually try to enable a pro-democracy coup against him, and when it fails he cuts an alliance with North Korea, keeping both nations separate politically but united against foreign intervention in their affairs. Rhee even shares the youth serum with Kim Il-Sung.</span>
</li><li> The Kuomintang are at first less willing to annex Tibet than the Communists were in OTL, due to not wanting to potentially upset the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorMonk">Yuzhou de fangshi</a></em> monks (who played a part in them winning their civil war) in the process. And when they do eventually invade, as does India, they're forced back by Tibet's metahumans and supply of mystical artifacts.
</li><li> The stress of the Himalayan War proves to be too much for Kai-Shek, and he dies three years sooner than OTL.
</li><li> The advanced technology at the Soviets' disposal because of Renzaoren and his ship allows them to put the first man on the moon (Alexei Leonov, specifically) in 1962. This spurs on the American space efforts to the point that, with aid from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> reverse-engineered from the Roswell ship, a manned flight is successfully sent to Mars and back in 1970/71 (composed of Buzz Aldrin and Frank Borman).
</li><li> Enoch Powell becomes British Prime Minister in 1970, leading to strained relations with JFK's America over Northern Ireland. He ends up resigning after attempts to alter history by killing George Washington cause a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeCrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeCrash">Time Crash</a>.
</li><li> Thanks to having access to necromancy, Idi Amin conquers Kenya and Tanzania, turning Uganda into one of the most powerful nations in Africa.
