<p>These are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Trope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Trope">tropes</a> that are one step beyond <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope">Dead Horse Tropes</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedTrope">Discredited Tropes</a>; not only are they not used straight, they're not used at all. You won't find this in <em>any</em> current series; they have disappeared from the writer's toolbox.
</p><p>Note that Forgotten Tropes aren't actually <em>forgotten</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureImperfect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureImperfect">Future Imperfect</a>-style; if they were, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">would we even be talking about them here?</a> Academics will know all about them, and a few minutes with a web search engine will turn up plenty, if you know what to look for. Rather than truly forgotten tropes, they might be better thought of as obsolete tropes or archaic tropes. They may, on very, <em>very</em> rare occasions, show up in a modern series, but generally those are only emulating a series that did have these. The best place to find Forgotten Tropes is in "classic" works; there you will see them, frozen like insects in amber. They're also often used by artists relying a great deal on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">Nostalgia Filter</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney">Walt Disney</a>, for example, probably did more than anyone else to keep a number of otherwise Forgotten tropes alive.

Many tropes evolved this way, and while their ancestors went extinct, the fossils remain (as do, occasionally, vestigial features in their descendants). Tropes of this nature are occasionally revived (though only rarely played fully straight without further examination) in the process of invoking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">Deliberate Values Dissonance</a> for the time period in which they were prevalent, as they typically reflected broader societal views on certain professions or issues. Alternately, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeBreaker">broken trope</a> may be impossible in a work set in the modern day, but work perfectly well in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeriodPiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeriodPiece">Period Piece</a>.
</p><p>Forgotten tropes are almost always some of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldestOnesInTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldestOnesInTheBook">The Oldest Ones in the Book</a>, except that they've fallen out of the book entirely. When a trope is forgotten but its parody isn't, it's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdAlEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdAlEffect">"Weird Al" Effect</a>.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirtyMinutesOrItsFree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirtyMinutesOrItsFree">30 Minutes, or It's Free!</a>: Pizza joints no longer do this for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">exactly the reason it became such a common comedy trope;</a> it was basically encouraging your deliveryman to try reckless maneuvers or risk not getting paid.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInHerApron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInHerApron">A Day in Her Apron</a>: As the cost of living has increased <em>exponentially</em>, while wages have stagnated, more and more households require that <em>both</em> parents work in order to run, instead of having a breadwinner and a stay-at-home spouse. (Plus, increased security measures at most workplaces ensure that even if someone <em>did</em> have a stay-at-home spouse, they wouldn't be able to switch places with them that easily, if at all.)
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BankToaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BankToaster">Bank Toaster</a>: Banks don't really do these kinds of promotions any more, and most of the old targets (the titular toaster) are now too cheap for anyone to put them under consideration.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackCapOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackCapOfDeath">Black Cap of Death</a>: The death penalty has been outlawed in the UK and much of Europe, meaning judges rarely ever wear these. Oddly they are regardless still issued them, as they have never been formally removed from the judicial uniform and are technically still supposed to be worn or at least carried at ceremonial occasions like the State Opening of Parliament.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainFever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainFever">Brain Fever</a>: An outdated idea from the days when neither neurological diseases nor mental illness were clearly understood (they still aren't entirely).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreachOfPromiseOfMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreachOfPromiseOfMarriage">Breach of Promise of Marriage</a>: Abolished since the 50s in America, due mainly to changing social norms.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CandyStriper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CandyStriper">Candy Striper</a>: As the use of untrained minors as an unpaid work force in the health care field fell off, so too did instances of this trope in media.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptivityNarrative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptivityNarrative">The Captivity Narrative</a>: The discrediting of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSavageIndian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSavageIndian">The Savage Indian</a> and the decline of First Nations communities in America have made this a hard sell.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatingWithTheMilkman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatingWithTheMilkman">Cheating with the Milkman</a>: Milkmen used to be fairly common before the spread of commercial refrigerators, but nowadays people just buy it from the store. In modern tellings, the milkman may be replaced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PizzaBoySpecialDelivery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PizzaBoySpecialDelivery">another visiting laborer</a> (plumber, maid, poolboy, delivery driver, etc.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircassianBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircassianBeauty">Circassian Beauty</a>: Took a beating when it was displaced as an "exotic beauty" stereotype by archetypes with less of a creepy history behind them.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollegeWidow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollegeWidow">College Widow</a>: Co-ed colleges mean that badgering older women is now fairly low on the list of things horny college students will do unless they're someone who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikesOlderWomen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikesOlderWomen">Likes Older Women</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConstructionZoneCalamity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConstructionZoneCalamity">Construction Zone Calamity</a>: Still seen sometimes in videogames and animation, but all the classic gags of the setpiece are now badly outdated.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivorceInReno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivorceInReno">Divorce in Reno</a>: Necessary in the days when non-consensual divorce outside Nevada was a tricky deal in America, not so much now.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngagementChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngagementChallenge">Engagement Challenge</a>: Pretty much exclusively seen in fairy tales.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilJesuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilJesuit">Evil Jesuit</a>: Found its greatest success in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalierYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalierYears">The Cavalier Years</a> and when anti-Catholic Protestant sentiment was strong. Nowadays, relations with the Church are much cooler, and people looking for "evil Catholic" stereotypes have much bigger fish to fry (especially the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PedophilePriest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PedophilePriest">Pedophile Priest</a>) than the Jesuits&mdash;who tend to be, if anything, viewed more fondly by outsiders.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodPills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodPills">Food Pills</a>: Something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadUnicornTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadUnicornTrope">Dead Unicorn Trope</a> due to the obvious logistical problems and it being frequently disproved in real life.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthReich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthReich">Fourth Reich</a>: After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, there were fears that a Fourth Reich might rise from the ashes of the Third Reich just as the Third Reich had risen from the ashes of the Second Reich. Thus, some works of post-war fiction featured villainous Nazis plotting to build a new Reich and launch <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII">World War III</a>. Originally treated seriously, this plot was relegated to pulp fiction by the 1960s. As the focus shifted from the possibility of a Nazi revival in Germany itself to the schemes of Nazi exiles in South America, this trope came to be superseded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArgentinaIsNaziland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArgentinaIsNaziland">Argentina Is Nazi-Land</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameShowWinningsCap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameShowWinningsCap">Game Show Winnings Cap</a>: An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">Author's Saving Throw</a> to deal with scandals of rigging in the 50s. With the scandals in the past, many shows break high figures.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiveTheBabyAFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiveTheBabyAFather">Give the Baby a Father</a>: As single parenthood has become more accepted, that a pregnant woman chooses not to marry is less relevant than it was before the 1970s.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicRussianEmigre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicRussianEmigre">Heroic Russian &Eacute;migr&eacute;</a>: Given this trope kicked off in 1917, any character to fit the archetype would be dead of old age by today. Variants of them show up as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromCommieLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromCommieLand">defectors in Cold War stories</a>, but they generally don't play any of the old tropes straight, and many modern defectors are likely to be critical of America as well.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorableMarriageProposal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorableMarriageProposal">Honorable Marriage Proposal</a>: Largely died in the Western world as it became less relevant for a woman to stay virgin until marriage. Still crops up in more conservative places.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandlineEavesdropping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandlineEavesdropping">Landline Eavesdropping</a>: The main trope isn't quite there yet, but an internal subtrope is. The trope of a gossippy neighbor eavesdropping on a party line phone call, where a single phone line was shared by everyone in the neighborhood, was common in media through the 1960's but has now faded from the imagination because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">Technology Marches On</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoverAndBeloved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoverAndBeloved">Lover and Beloved</a>: Modern gay culture tends to heavily reject this kind of worldview, seeing it as an unneeded or even sexist heterosexual framework being forced where it doesn't belong&mdash;if anything, the lack of such frameworks is usually seen as a good thing about gay relationships.
</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalMariee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalMariee">Mal Mari&eacute;e</a>: Age-gap marriages are less and less common, as are (at least in Western society) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriages</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunWedding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunWedding">Shotgun Weddings</a>), and the specific archetype has been blurred away.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeUpIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeUpIsEvil">Make-Up Is Evil</a>: The idea that <em>all</em> makeup is evil is largely kaput, as it's accepted that the vast majority of women will wear at least a little. Making fun of excessive makeup or the makeup industry is still fairly common, though.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarrativePoem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarrativePoem">Narrative Poem</a>: Originally served the purpose of making very long stories one would need to commit to memory <em>possible</em> to commit to memory. The advent of the printing press put them in decline, as prose proved much easier to manage.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatchetScrolling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatchetScrolling">Ratchet Scrolling</a>: Originally a technical limitation, but cropped up afterward in some later games to a more limited degree in attempts to add challenge. Levels that used it were rarely popular.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestorationComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestorationComedy">Restoration Comedy</a>: Largely vanished after the reign of Charles II as the era grew more distant.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoadshowTheatricalRelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoadshowTheatricalRelease">Roadshow Theatrical Release</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatyrPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatyrPlay">Satyr Play</a>: Only one such complete play even <em>survives.</em>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScalesOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScalesOfJustice">Scales of Justice</a>: The imagery shows up, but it's not associated so much with courtrooms and trials any more.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeenItAllSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeenItAllSuicide">Seen-It-All Suicide</a>: Mostly seen in cartoons, and died as cartoons were edited to remove it. More adult cartoons in the modern era tend to be a little more tentative with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAsComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAsComedy">Suicide as Comedy</a>, which is problematic when the whole gag is its flippancy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SentencedToDownUnder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SentencedToDownUnder">Sentenced to Down Under</a>: Australia hasn't served as a penal colony in quite some time, being a Commonwealth since 1901 and growing more independent since.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StigmaticPregnancyEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StigmaticPregnancyEuphemism">Stigmatic Pregnancy Euphemism</a>: As attitudes towards single motherhood have begun to change (and abortions are legal), it's no longer common for a young woman who becomes pregnant out of wedlock to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> to either have the baby or have an abortion under the guise of "going out to the country to see her aunt."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StringOnFingerReminder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StringOnFingerReminder">String-on-Finger Reminder</a>: Ironically. Writing notes or setting alarms on computers usually serves the same purpose far better.

How comedic writers dealt with this became a trope in and of itself. As the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWall">Fourth Wall</a> wasn't strong, a character would address the audience, say that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">Tropes Are Not Good</a>, and say how <em>this</em> play was special because of all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadHorseTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadHorseTrope">Undead Horse Tropes</a> it <em>wasn't</em> using, which was always a lie. The lie was either indirect (listing various tropes it wasn't using, but using other equally hackneyed old tropes) or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWritesThisCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWritesThisCrap">absolutely</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadLiar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadLiar">bald-faced</a>. Of course, since writing plays was much more competitive, this must have seemed like sports players boasting. But it also implies a truly odd appreciation for tropes and how they get used. Wow! Just think of it: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostModernism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostModernism">Postmodernism</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">is actually</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>!
<p></p></li><li> <strong>Law of unities:</strong> Neoclassical readers often cited rules created by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristotle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, termed the Laws of Unities, which held that a play should be set in one location, concern one action (have a singular plot thread with no sublots), and take place in one 24-hour period. These laws were taken seriously for much longer than playwrights honoured them; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamuelJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamuelJohnson">Samuel Johnson</a> was forced to defend Shakespeare 150 years after the Bard's death over his disregard of the unities. Another nail in the coffin of this trope was writers realizing that these laws were not so much laws as an attempt at a generalized description of the plays Aristotle knew about (and Aristotle was citing it <em>in contrast</em> to epic poetry, which means <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerendipityWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerendipityWritesThePlot">these plays probably did so to keep the scope and budget down</a>). It was only made law by neoclassisists who made Aristotle's work <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a>. The decline of reliance on ancient classics and the rise of romanticism in France meant the end of this trope. Of course, very short, single-setting plays are still being written and performed; it's just that playwrights now do this because it suits the nature of an individual work, not out of some sense of tradition or obligation.
<p></p></li><li> <strong>The original Greek Muses:</strong> The nine Greek Muses represented art forms that are almost all discarded now (though the Muses live on, they've been reincarnated as patrons of different arts). Clio (Muse of History) and Terpsichore (Muse of Dance) are the only two Muses you can expect a reasonably large number of people to remember, and then only because their names live on in the somewhat obscure words "cliometrics" and "terpsichorean."
<p></p></li><li> <strong>Humorism:</strong> An ancestor of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourTemperamentEnsemble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourTemperamentEnsemble">Four-Temperament Ensemble</a> Trope, this is <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humorism">a debunked medical belief<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that dates back to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt">Ancient Egypt</a>, which basically states that a balance of four bodily fluids or humors &mdash; blood, mucous, black bile, and yellow bile &mdash; in the body are needed for good health. It further states that each fluid is related to one of the four elements or nature and emotions, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourTemperamentEnsemble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourTemperamentEnsemble">temperaments</a>, and characteristics are grouped into categories based on one humor. Modern medicine (which realizes the true functions of the humors) debunked this, and the belief rarely shows up nowadays. It does, however, still show up in the use of words such as choleric or sanguine, and knowledge of the basics of this theory is still useful in literary studies due to its copious use in older works.
<ul><li> The Green Ronin D20 book <em>Guide to Fiends</em> presents the Distender, a type of devil who can control emotions in mortals via use of the four humors. (A sidebar in the book briefly summarizes the now-debunked Trope, acknowledging why the theory is no longer recognized.)

Where the forgotten part comes in is that while <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1666">The Golden Ass<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSatyricon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSatyricon">The Satyricon</a></em> are believed to be inspired by the genre, and it's assumed that the tales/tropes used in such stories were similar to those found in later collections like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDecameron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDecameron">The Decameron</a></em>, there are no surviving examples of actual Milesian Tales.

<ul><li> <strong>The Anglo-Saxon riddle poem</strong>: A game in which a vague poetic description of an item was given and listeners were expected to recall a rote answer, is almost entirely dead today.
<ul><li> The only popularly-remembered example, "Humpty Dumpty," is no longer perceived as a riddle about an egg, just as a poem about an egg. (This is in part due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdAlEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdAlEffect">"Weird Al" Effect</a> of Humpty's inclusion in the <em>Alice</em> books.)
</li><li> Used almost directly by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em>, specifically the riddle-contest between Bilbo and Gollum. Tolkien was aware of the trope because he was an expert on Anglo-Saxon literature, to the point of having done original translations from Anglo-Saxon into modern English.
</li><li> While no longer considered high art as such, vestiges do still survive in riddles found in modern-day joke books and games on Internet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fora" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fora">fora</a> (particularly if one of the participants is aware of the idea, either directly or through the influence of <em>The Hobbit</em>).
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>All Jews are Sephardic:</strong> In Medieval Europe and all the way through the Renaissance, the stereotypical Jewish person that would pop up in your average peasant's mind was one of Sephardic origin, since for a while, Spain was the place with the highest Jewish population in the world. People like Maimonides and Baruch Spinoza were well-known among religious or academic circles and thanks to the expulsion of Jews from Spain, the Sephardic stereotype spread to places like England and the Netherlands. In the 19th century, with declining Sephardic populations, dispersion and the rise of Jewish communities in Central and Eastern Europe (that changed the balance of power among them), this trope was replaced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJewsAreAshkenazi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJewsAreAshkenazi">All Jews Are Ashkenazi</a>. However, as the Western world has become a lot more multicultural thanks to liberalized immigration laws, Hispanic and Middle Eastern Jews are once again beginning to make their presence known in large cities, which means that this trope may well be making a comeback.
<p></p></li><li> <strong>The Red Jews:</strong> A legendary nation in German folklore that would one day invade the Christian world. It probably saw its major splendor with the Turk attacks that would lead to the fall of Constantinople, when it was popular to identify the Ottomans with the Red Jews stories (absurd, since the Ottomans were mostly Islamic). While unfortunately antisemitism still exists today, the idea of a Great Jewish nation (which nowadays would by default be Israel) invading the West is all but forgotten. Probably the modern equivalent would be other prejudiced tropes like "Jews Control the Media/Economy", but even in those cases, the way they use their power is passive, not violent. (Some modern anti-Semites do view <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khazars">the Khazars<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> as a rough historical equivalent, but there is limited evidence, if any, supporting this viewpoint.)
<p></p></li><li> <strong>The Nine Worthies:</strong> Nine characters who personified the ideal values of a brave knight. They were three pagans (Alexander The Great, Hector and Julius Caesar), three Jewish (Joshua, King David and Judah Maccabee) and three Christians (King Arthur, Charlemagne and Godfrey of Bouillon), thus uniting the three Western religions (polytheism, Judaism and Christianity) with which most Christians at the time were familiar. It was a very popular motif in art and writing, and there was a sort of spin-off (to call it in modern terms) with nine lady worthies (where different artists and writers have different lists). All of those figures are still very well-known, but most people are not familiar with the idea of all of them united in a single concept.
<ul><li> Its most familiar form today would be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewAge">New Age</a>'s Ascended Masters. The 1871 novel <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1951/1951-h/1951-h.htm">The Coming Race<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> by Bulwer-Lytton was <em>supposed</em> to be a satire of the idea, but H.P. Blavatsky took it seriously...
</li><li> A more obscure modern example, played entirely straight, would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnBellairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnBellairs">John Bellairs</a>' book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNounAndTheNoun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNounAndTheNoun">The Mummy, the Will, and the Crypt</a></em>&mdash;it turns out to be plot-relevant, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostWillAndTestament" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostWillAndTestament">the will in question</a> is hidden in a statue of Sir Godfrey</span>.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>Medieval fantasy creatures</strong>: A lot of medieval creatures are still famous, but the way they're represented and the motifs and traits they're associated with have evolved with time: most modern representations of the unicorn are related to its class, elegance and/or "royalness" and they're seen as delicate animals, but in the first representations they were, if anything, just the opposite: wild, untameable and fiery (for an example, look at the heraldic imagery of the United Kingdom, where it is the unicorn which is chained, not the lion, because the former is considered much more dangerous). Other derived tropes (like the idea that they could only be captured by virgins) are even more forgotten. Vampires and werewolves are seen nowadays as two different species but in the original stories they were seen as two variations of the same kind of creature. Also, the "bloodsucking vampire" stereotype is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink">Newer Than They Think</a>, at least in western Europe. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">Medieval English tales about "vampires" often described creatures that we would recognize more as zombies today -- and very tame zombies, at that.</a> They didn't suck blood, and they usually didn't even hurt anyone; they were just undead people who liked to cause mischief, coming off more as grotesque fairies. The bloodsucker-type comes from Eastern Europe, and was not well-known in the West until the 19th century.
<p></p></li><li> <strong>Prester John:</strong> A Christian King from a far-away eastern land who somehow kept the faith of his country and would appear to save the West from Islamic/Heathen invaders. It was very common to reference him in stories, folktales and maps. There were different theories about the localization of the Prester John Kingdom, including China, India or Ethiopia, but with the advancement of the age of exploration, more of the world was discovered and the idea of this hypothetical nation faded from most people's minds. It is still remembered by scholars and it still comes out in some modern works of fiction here and there, but even those works are relatively obscure. Stories about mythical countries or lands still exist today (some of them, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis">Atlantis</a>, are even older), but Prester John as well as the notion of a hidden or forgotten country similar to the West or Christendom in the middle of "barbarian" or "uncivilized" peoples have not only vanished from most mainstream fiction, but would be a point of controversy due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>.
<ul><li> The 1872 book <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1906">Erewhon<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> would have been recognised by contemporary audiences as a parody of this trope &mdash; the narrator stumbles on a far away kingdom (implied to be in Australasia) that perfectly resembles Western society, fantasising that it is a lost tribe of Israel or the kingdom of Prester John. However, Erewhon has a non-Abrahamic religion based around praying to be spared from disease, causing the inhabitants to view moral failure as a misfortune and illness as a personal failing.

</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>Termagant:</strong> The name of an imaginary god worshipped by Muslims, according to different tales of the Christian West. The Western Christians' stories often referred to Muslims as "pagans", and assumed that they worshipped Muhammad as a god, amongst other gods including Termagant. Some stories, like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSongOfRoland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSongOfRoland">The Song of Roland</a></em>, claimed that the Muslims worshipped an 'unholy trinity' of Muhammad, Apollyon, and Termagant. As time passed, clashes between the West and the Muslim world continued, but the idea of 'Termagant' as an evil trickster deity was forgotten. The term is still used nowadays to describe a violent woman, but even in that context it's dark and obscure, even more than the original meaning of the word.
<p></p></li><li> <strong>The land of Cockaigne:</strong> A legendary land of plenty and abundance that was very popular at the time, being a figure of speech used in poems, paintings and other forms of art, and used as a trope about mythical lands almost as much as in modern fiction we use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis">Atlantis</a>. Sexual liberty, wine, food available without hard labor. The catch?

<ul><li> <strong>Fashion satire prints:</strong> While exaggerations are pretty much the cream of the crop in satire, there was a time when mocking the fashion trends of the era were commonplace in every editorials from the late 18th century up until the early 20th century. It was easy for the cartoonist to sideline political issues with the excesses of popular culture of the era, and fashion was no exception. It was a time when cartoonists lavishly ridiculed the gigantic wigs and frou-frou styles of the late 18th century, the contrastingly plain yet slutty sheer muslin gowns of the Regency era, the gigantic hoopskirts and bustles and frills of the Victorian era, and the overly wide hats and very narrow skirts of the 1910s. And all of the prints showed shorter hemlines for comical effect. It wasn't until the 1920s and the 1930s put a halt to these prints due to the influences of film and fashion photography putting in a realistic look of the fashions, and due to the simplicity, the lack of supportive undergarments, and actual shorter hemlines removing the need for ridicule and exaggerations on editorial prints.
<p></p></li><li> <strong>Massive formal opera chorus:</strong> One convention found in many grand operas of the mid-19th century was the massive formal setpiece chorus in the middle of the middle act (i.e. the second act, or the third if more acts were to come)

</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>Secret Scottish weddings</strong>: In British literature up through the mid-19th century, a frequent plot device involved a secret marriage happening in Gretna Green or other Scottish border towns. This was because an English law dating to 1754 allowed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalMarriageVeto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalMarriageVeto">the parents of people under 21 to stop them from marrying</a>; Scottish law had no similar provision, and, further, allowed almost anyone to perform a marriage as long as two witnesses were present. Moreover, the wedding announcement could be held back from English newspapers. Gretna Green is still a popular venue for destination weddings, and turns up in that capacity in modern works, but its use in novels like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWomanInWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWomanInWhite">The Woman in White</a></em> to reveal a secret wedding in a character's past is now mostly forgotten even in period pieces.

<p></p></li><li> <strong>Columbia</strong>: Columbia was a poetic 19th century name for the United States of America (it is the "C" in "Washington D.C."). Columbia herself was represented as a young woman (or goddess) and was a popular national personification into the early 20th century. Since then she has been displaced by another American personification &mdash; "Uncle Sam". "Columbia" was also used as a synonym for the continent(s) of America, hence the names of the South American nation of Colombia and the Canadian Province of British Columbia (and the latter is even on the opposite coast from the one where Christopher Columbus operated).
<ul><li> The patriotic song "Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean" had a similar period of popularity.
</li><li> Many older American memorials and monuments still depict Columbia.
<ul><li> The most notable and newest of these are the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, dedicated in 1949 in Hawaii.
</li><li> The statue atop the US Capitol dome, while not officially of Columbia, shares many of her characteristics.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS">CBS</a> used to stand for the Columbia Broadcasting System.

</li><li> In Alex Ross's graphic novel <em>Uncle Sam</em>, there's a sequence where Sam meets up with Columbia to discuss the good old days.

</li><li> Uncle Sam himself replaced the almost entirely forgotten Brother Jonathan as national personification of the USA. (Jonathan was the brother of Britain's national personification John Bull, the satirical joke was that they did not get on although they looked almost identical). Brother Jonathan is referred to in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Flashman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Flashman">Flashman</a></em> novel <em>Flashman and the Mountain of Light</em>.

<p></p></li><li> <strong>Big boy pants</strong>: It used to be a rite of passage for a child to start wearing long pants and skirts. Younger children &mdash; both boys and girls &mdash; wore short pants with a dress or skirt over them, so that the material would not be worn out during playtime. Once you were old enough, you were trusted to wear long pants. By the 1940s, young children began using long pants. The <em>expression</em> "big boy pants" is still around, but now it's just a vague metaphor about growing up.
<ul><li> <em>Now We Are Six</em>, the 1927 book of children's poems by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AAMilne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AAMilne">A. A. Milne</a>, includes a poem in which a boy compares himself to his younger brother, and notes, "If John were Me and I were John, / I shouldn't have these trousers on."

</li><li> This trope is far from being forgotten in manga and is used mostly for school uniforms like in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShinkuuYuusetsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShinkuuYuusetsu">Shinkuu Yuusetsu</a></em>.
</li><li> The title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AuntieMame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AuntieMame">Auntie Mame</a></em> is shown as free-spirited because she gives her nephew long pants to wear in his childhood.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMusicMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMusicMan">The Music Man</a></em>, Harold Hill's warnings of juvenile delinquency begin: "The minute your son leaves the house, does he rebuckle his knickerbockers <em>below</em> the knee?" Like several of the following warnings, this was likely intended as a period cultural reference.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LeaveItToBeaver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LeaveItToBeaver">Leave It to Beaver</a></em>, from the late 1950s to the early 1960s, has one episode where June's aunt Martha watches the boys while their parents are out of town. She takes Beaver shopping for a "proper" suit that included short pants. This is what she thought boys his age should be wearing. Beaver is, of course, humiliated when she makes him wear the suit to school.
</li><li> In the 1960s, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HigherUnderstandingThroughDrugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HigherUnderstandingThroughDrugs">psychedelia</a>'s association with childish thought and a new fascination with youth led to adult women dressing in clothes similar to what children wore, leading to the invention of the miniskirt. Nowadays, the miniskirt is associated with its sexual subtext, rather than the childishness that was more important to Mary Quant at the time.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoardwalkEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoardwalkEmpire">Boardwalk Empire</a></em>, (which is mostly set in the 1920s) at one point Lucky Luciano (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungFutureFamousPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungFutureFamousPeople">who is still young and hasn't truly established himself yet</a>) gets called "short pants" by a particularly unhinged and rage-filled older gangster when the two start trading insults and attempt to intimidate each other.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Malena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Malena">Mal&egrave;na</a></em>, twelve year old Renato angsts that he's the only one amongst his friends who still wears short pants. The story takes place during World War II.
</li><li> It is still considered tradition by the Royal Family of the United Kingdom to have children wear short trousers until age 8, when they're finally allowed to wear longer ones. This includes even during the cold of Winter. Despite most of the family, even Charles, thinking it unnecessary and even strange. However, the Queen and some other believe it's a distinction of their place in society as aristocracy, with long trousers on young boys being seen as unacceptably middle-class.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>French opera ballet</strong>: The mandatory ballet in French grand opera is a trope long forgotten.
<ul><li> Composer Jules Massenet, presumably after one too many times being forced to shoehorn a ballet in, not only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadedTrope">lampshades</a> it in <em>Manon</em> by having the <em>ballet girls of the Paris Opera</em> brought to a party, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justifies it</a>, as he manages to tie it into several different plots &mdash; it's an expensive attempt by Manon's rich <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> to win her from the man she's playing courtesan to, but just beforehand, Manon learns that des Grieux, her true love whom she threw over in favour of riches, is about to become an abbot, and this leads to her ignoring the performance as the first sign of her redemption. Unfortunately, said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> begins conspiring against her after that.
</li><li> When Wagner's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Tannhaeuser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Tannhaeuser">Tannh&auml;user</a></em> was being premiered in Paris, he was told that they'd have to insert a ballet; he could either write one, or they'd pay someone's brother-in-law to arrange some of the thematic material from the opera into it. He said he'd write one, and that the place where it would make the most sense plot-wise would be in the very first scene. The management told him it would have to be in "the middle of the middle" because that was when they seated latecomers. Said latecomers were aristocratic patrons of the Paris Opera, who liked to dine at their clubs and thus couldn't be bothered to be there when the opera started, but still wanted to see the ballet, as they were romantically interested in the dancers themselves. Tannh&auml;user still premiered with its ballet at the beginning, but the uproar it caused led to interruptions, and the production was withdrawn after three performances.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Carmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Carmen">Carmen</a></em> was originally produced at the Op&eacute;ra-Comique, which permitted spoken dialogue. It was soon adapted into a French grand opera, with the dialogue replaced by recitatives by Ernest Guiraud, and a ballet added to the fourth act. Many productions include the recitatives but omit the ballet.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/DieFledermaus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/DieFledermaus">Die Fledermaus</a></em>, though a Viennese light opera, has a ballet in the middle of its second act that seems to be usually cut, even though it's one character's excuse for being there.
</li><li> This is referenced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Amadeus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Amadeus">Amadeus</a></em>, where the king has banned ballet sequences in operas because he considers them to be too overused.

Aficionados of Victorian novels and autobiographies will be familiar with children having to "get" a number of "lines", usually of Bible verses, poetry, or a Shakespeare play. Along with adult works, poems were written especially for this purpose, exemplifying virtues for children to emulate. This practice trickled down into family life, and children were expected to appear at adult parties to "say their piece", sing, play an instrument, or dance.

</li><li> In Germany, memorizing and reciting a few poems during one's school life (even in high school) was still normal in the 1990s (and probably still is to this day). Also, it was quite common until at least the 1980s to make prepubescent children recite a festive song or short poem for their family on Christmas Eve (or for "Santa Claus" during the school Christmas party), before they may open their presents.

(The poems are transcribed and translated on the movie's trope page. The British one is so horribly xenophobic it almost makes the German one seem justified.)

This trope was arguably the basis of Social Darwinism, but it died sometime between 1930 and 1945 and no one can say why for certain. Presumably it had something to do with the immensity of the Wall Street Crash (for if people got rich by hard work and clean living, did that mean all those that lost wealth were lazy and uncouth, along with unlucky?), the influence of the World War II experience (with Hitler's Germany being a horrific case of many of the tenets of Social Darwinism put into action), the New Deal (which made people question the idea of individuals being purely responsible for their success) and the nascent civil rights movement (springing from demographics of people who had been denied success for the color of their skin, not for the content of their character, even though Booker T.

Today the only one widely remembered is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol">A Christmas Carol</a></em> and thus most people don't realize there were many others of its ilk, but telling ghost stories around Christmas was a common tradition. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MontagueRhodesJames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MontagueRhodesJames">M.R. James</a> wrote stories for this purpose, which have aged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">rather well</a> apart from the more obscure Biblical and literary allusions.) A reference to it remains in the song "The Most Wonderful Time of the Year" that seems fairly weird to modern listeners (to the point where it is often replaced with a phrase like "long funny stories"). It also occurs in the framing prologue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTurnOfTheScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTurnOfTheScrew">The Turn of the Screw</a></em>.
<ul><li> While this trope is completely unfamiliar in America, it's a bit better known in Britain; in the seventies, the BBC often broadcast M.R. James adaptations at Christmastime, and new ones have been sporadically made since 2005 (the most recent one aired in 2013).
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>Travelers' tales</strong>: A genre of nonfiction (usually) adventure stories of far-off lands.
<ul><li> With the advent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Television" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Television">Television</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Film" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Film">Film</a> they morphed into Travelogues and travel programs, Up-Close-With-Wildlife programs, and Nature Documentaries.
</li><li> Quite a few of them, such as <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mandeville">The Travels of Sir John Mandeville<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, were seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory">somewhere between wild exaggeration and outright nonsense</a> even in the fourteenth century, and slowly fell out of favour as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">Europeans became capable of easily traveling or corresponding with distant places</a>. Even when the more serious ones were most popular in the 19th century (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulesVerne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulesVerne">Jules Verne</a> works), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe">Edgar Allan Poe</a> wrote a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthParody">Stealth Parody</a> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNarrativeOfArthurGordonPymOfNantucket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNarrativeOfArthurGordonPymOfNantucket">The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket</a></em>) to mock credulous readers.

But back in the day, the play was actually pretty popular, especially Lord Dundreary, an eccentric character that became the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a>. He was so popular that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak">strange, twisted aphorisms</a> he used became a brief vogue known as "Dundrearyisms" (e.g. "birds of a feather gather no moss"). It almost goes without saying that after the presentation at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. on April 14, 1865, everything about this play was soon forgotten, including this interesting example of what today we would call <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a>. <br><br>The play's plot overview (a rugged American is positively contrasted with continental <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit">Upper Class Twits</a>) also counts as a forgotten trope &mdash; European writers would applaud American egalitarianism and free-spiritedness (the title character is the hero of the story, and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> romanticizes life in New England in a monologue). This trope was killed around the time American writers such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FScottFitzgerald" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FScottFitzgerald">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a> described American class prejudices in the 1920s.
<p></p></li><li> <strong>Going Calling</strong>: Prior to the invention and proliferation of the telephone, if you wanted to talk to your friends in real time (as opposed to sending a letter), you had to actually visit them and talk to them face-to-face. Women (and it <em>was</em> almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysFemale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysFemale">always women</a>) had a system where they would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropInCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropInCharacter">show up unannounced at each other's homes</a> in order to speak to their friend/sibling/etc. (Often, though not always, the lady of the house.) And they would meet in the parlor and chat, sometimes for hours, sometimes just for a few minutes. If she wasn't home, then the "caller" (that is, the one who attempted to visit) would leave a unique "calling card", which was sort of like a modern-day business card, except for personal (rather than business) use, with her name on it. It was expected that whoever she tried to "call on" would go to her home and call on <em>her</em> ASAP. (Not doing so was considered <em>extremely</em> rude, which was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a>; there was at least one case where a woman noticed a house on fire, and considered alerting the homeowner... but then remembered that the lady of the house had not reciprocated a call, so she just continued on her way!) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">As more and more homes became equipped with telephones, it was no longer necessary to go to people's homes just to chat, and so the custom died out.</a>
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SenseAndSensibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SenseAndSensibility">Sense and Sensibility</a></em>:
<ul><li> After Mrs Jennings comes to her home in London, she spends most of her mornings visiting her friends acquaintances, and Elinor and Marianne Dashwood accompany her. Mr Willoughby tries to avoid them because everyone assumes he's engaged or about to be engaged to Marianne, but he has found a wealthier bride. He only leaves a card.
</li><li> Lady Middleton is interested in being acquainted with Miss Smith, future Mrs Willoughby, and is determined to leave her card with her as soon as she marries. Her husband doesn't approve because it's a slight against Marianne who is his distant cousin and neighbour.
</li><li> Lucy Steele has seldom been happier than she was on receiving Fanny Dashwood's card. She's a sister of her secret fiance and she loves that she can pursue her acquaintance.
</li><li> Edward comes to Mrs Jennings' house to leave his farewell card when he leaves London.

<ul><li> Sir Walter and his daughter Elizabeth boast that their acquaintance is "exceedingly sought after" in Bath and that everybody wants to visit them all the time. They are perpetually having cards left by people, even if they don't know them.
</li><li> Mr Elliot pointedly leaves his card in Camden Place by Sir Walter and Elizabeth when he wants to re-new their acquaintance.
</li><li> The Elliots receive the calling cards of Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple and the Honourable Miss Carteret. The narrator snidely points out they arrange them wherever they are most visible to other guests to make sure everyone knows they are on calling terms with high nobility.
</li><li> Sir Walter plans to visit Lady Russell, their family friend, but he only intends to "make a civil message" and "only leave his card".
</li><li> Elizabeth "gracefully" distributes the cards "Miss Elliot at home" as invitations to her evening party.
</li><li> In the cancelled chapter, Anne is manoeuvred into visiting Mrs Croft, but then she's afraid Frederick might be there as well. She tries to get out of there and asks Admiral Croft to allow her to leave her card and explain it afterwards.

Tolkien</a> began teaching at Oxford, his wife Edith was so bewildered and overwhelmed by the imposing personages of the other university wives and their lavish homes that she felt she could not return their calls.

<ul><li> <strong>The "10-20-30" melodrama</strong>: a long-extinct genre of theatrical productions which used many tropes now more typically associated with early silent films like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePerilsOfPauline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePerilsOfPauline">The Perils of Pauline</a></em>. The "10-20-30" name was derived from the cheap ticket prices charged for these productions &mdash; 10 cents, 20 cents, 30 cents. Interestingly, the name itself became obsolete during the very heyday of these melodramas ("15-25-35" would have been more accurate.)
<p></p></li><li> <strong>Romantic operetta waltz song</strong>: A major trope in early 20th-century operettas was having a big romantic song in slow waltz time with enormous vocal range and mushy lyrics, rendered with lots of <em>rubato</em>. Well-known examples included "Deep In My Heart, Dear" from <em>The Student Prince</em> (which plugged it <em>at least</em> once in each of its four acts) and the title songs of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheDesertSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheDesertSong">The Desert Song</a></em> and <em>Sweethearts</em>. These fell out of favor sometime between 1925 and 1930 due to advances in vocal amplification and electric recording that helped make low-voiced "crooners" the new stars of popular music.
<ul><li> This was already obsolete by the mid-20th century when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnnaRussell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnnaRussell">Anna Russell</a> parodied it as "Ah, Lover!"

</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>Invasion literature</strong>: A popular British sub-genre of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction">Science Fiction</a> (not named as such at that point) in the late Victorian and Edwardian eras. This genre focused on the invasion of Britain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture">20 Minutes into the Future</a> (or earlier) by a foreign power. This foreign power was most often either France or Germany, depending on which seemed Britain's most likely enemy at the time. Its mainstream incarnation vanished during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, presumably because they had <em>actual</em> wars with Germany. There are occasional not-explicitly-science fiction examples of the genre afterwards, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RedDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RedDawn">Red Dawn</a></em>, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreKiller">proliferation of nuclear weapons has more or less made direct armed invasions of first-world countries obsolete</a>, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooShark">such stories have to a lot of explaining to do</a>.
<ul><li> <em>The Battle of Dorking</em> (1871) by George Tomkyns Chesney, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a>, though not the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample">Ur-Example</a>. This was written in the aftermath of the Franco-Prussian war, which had shocked Europe with the speed with which Europe's second-largest army was defeated by a numerically smaller but technically more sophisticated foe. This theme ran through the genre.
</li><li> Both <em>The Riddle of the Sands</em> (1903) by Erskine Childers and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarOfTheWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarOfTheWorlds">The War of the Worlds</a></em> (1898) by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HGWells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HGWells">H.G. Wells</a> ended up having an effect on fiction long after the extinction of the original trope serving as the progenitors of modern espionage thrillers and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion">Alien Invasion</a>, respectively. The Invasion Fiction lives, but the invader has changed.
</li><li> A late example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NevilShute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NevilShute">Nevil Shute</a>'s <em>What Happened to the Corbetts</em> (1938), which depicts the bombing of English towns by an unidentified foreign power (implied to be the "Rome-Berlin axis"). By that time, of course, most people had a pretty good idea that something bad was going to happen, even if they didn't know <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">quite how bad</a> it would be.
</li><li> There were a few American examples of the genre, usually involving the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YellowPeril" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YellowPeril">Yellow Peril</a>; the revival of that associated trope during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> included a novel by Whitman Chambers titled <em>Invasion!</em>.
</li><li> The "threat to Britain from France or Germany" idea did make it into at least one post-Cold War techno-thriller, Larry Bond's <em>Cauldron</em>. The scenario involves the dissolution of NATO and a war pitting an aggressive France, allied with Germany and much of continental Western Europe, against the US, UK, and most of the former Warsaw Pact, excluding Russia. (However, the notion of England actually being <em>invaded</em> is never brought up.)
</li><li> A modern example of Invasion Literature most Australians will know of is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TomorrowWhenTheWarBegan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TomorrowWhenTheWarBegan">Tomorrow: When the War Began</a></em>, wherein Australia is invaded by an unnamed country.
</li><li> The genre was being parodied as early as 1909, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PGWodehouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PGWodehouse">P. G. Wodehouse</a> wrote his early novel <em>The Swoop</em>, in which England is invaded by the armies of <em>nine</em> different countries at once, only to be driven out by the Boy Scouts. (Oddly enough, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Saki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Saki">Saki</a>'s <em>When William Came</em>, written four years later, the "Boy-Scouts-as-saviours" idea is repeated, entirely seriously. The Scouts don't actually fight off the Germanic hordes, thankfully. Instead, they inspire the population to resistance by boycotting the Kaiser's parade.)
</li><li> One of the later examples is the comic book series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Savage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Savage">Invasion!</a></em>, which ran from 1977-9 in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TwoThousandAD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TwoThousandAD">2000 AD</a></em>. The creators had to change the Russians to "Volgans" and remove representations of Margaret Thatcher and other real life people.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarOfTheWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarOfTheWorlds">The War of the Worlds</a></em> was actually originally an example of this genre, so it could be considered a case of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolvingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolvingTrope">Evolving Trope</a>.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>The "young ladies' school"</strong>: In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, young women between 14 and 16 approximately attended "finishing schools" (often run by nuns&mdash;in the case of convent-like establishments or strong-willed spinsters&mdash;in the case of Swiss-style schools) to be trained in the arts of music and dance, style, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperLady">etiquette</a>, party-hosting, and homemaking, with the goal of training them to be good wives and mothers in the near future, in an attempt to educate middle-class girls like wealthy families did with home-schooling (as well as possibly getting them married into wealth). This trope fell out of favor around the late 1910s as attitudes towards education, marriage, women's rights, and the role of women in society changed, mostly because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatWar">The Great War</a> (although these continued to exist until the early 1960s at most &mdash; and as late as the 1980s, even the early 1990s, girls would take classes about homemaking in school, particularly "home economics"). The trope is still alive in East Asia, however, where traditional gender roles are more firmly entrenched, and Swiss-style schools are seeing an explosion of popularity.
<ul><li> Used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PsychoPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PsychoPass">Psycho-Pass</a></em>, though ruthlessly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">lampshaded</a>. It's explained that the idea of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YamatoNadeshiko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YamatoNadeshiko">"lady"</a> is completely irrelevant to the modern world, but as long as rich old men want a wife like that, there's a market for schools that produce them.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FawltyTowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FawltyTowers">Basil Fawlty</a> excuses his wife Sybil's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingLaugh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingLaugh">giggling</a> by claiming "I'm afraid her local finishing school was bombed."
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>Stealing the help</strong>: There's a common Edwardian comedy trope where some aristocrat will have a particularly good cook and their friends will do everything they can to "steal" that servant (because great food is such a crucial part of performing the part of a host). The trope started to disappear as early as the 1920s, when most families &mdash; or at least the middle-class ones &mdash; stopped wasting money on domestic servants because more advanced technologies made it easier and more respectable for housewives to do chores themselves.
<ul><li> This happens in some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Saki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Saki">Saki</a> stories.
</li><li> Happens in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PGWodehouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PGWodehouse">P. G. Wodehouse</a> stories with the chef Anatole.
</li><li> This gets a modern use in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VorkosiganSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VorkosiganSaga">Vorkosigan Saga</a></em> novel <em>Memory</em> where his parents and other relatives are tempted to steal away his new cook, Ma Kosti, but that's probably because the series is often social comedy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace">Recycled In Space</a>.
</li><li> Perhaps a modern variation is the competition by rich families for good nannies, as seen on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DesperateHousewives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DesperateHousewives">Desperate Housewives</a></em>.
</li><li> This is played with and parodied to hilarious effect in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ToSayNothingOfTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ToSayNothingOfTheDog">To Say Nothing of the Dog</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConnieWillis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConnieWillis">Connie Willis</a>.

</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>Female hysteria</strong>: Before modern psychiatry and medicine, hysteria was once a common diagnosis for a woman with any sort of illness. There are thousands of documented cases of women in real life diagnosed with hysteria (and often institutionalized or otherwise marginalized) who were later found to have had heart attacks, ovarian cancer, schizophrenia, depression, endocrine imbalances, or one of any number of physical or psychological diseases.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5ygvf');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5ygvf" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5ygvf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Sometimes, all it took was a woman saying "I don't want to have kids!" or "I want to own my own business!" or objecting to her husband having control of her money. These victims of "moral insanity" were frequently institutionalized. Going to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpookySeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpookySeance">Spooky S&eacute;ance</a> could also get you diagnosed, because Spiritualists were notorious for promoting feminism.</span> The trope became discredited after women finally got fed up with being told that their problems were all either "in their heads" or made up for attention, and faded from fiction at about the same time.
<ul><li> Hysteria, and more broadly the consistent mis-diagnosis and mis-treatment of women during the 19th and early 20th centuries, is the theme of the classic early feminist short horror story <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheYellowWallpaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheYellowWallpaper">The Yellow Wallpaper</a></em>.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>Ethnic white groups</strong>: Ethnic white characters and stories, if they're not outright forgotten, are usually touched on only in historical contexts. This trope was popular among American audiences through the 19th and part of the 20th century, and it consists in the idea that some Caucasian ethnicities aren't truly "white", ergo, not truly American, and it aimed to almost every European ethnic group: Irish (the famous "Irish Need Not Apply" signs in stores and other business), Germans (especially those of Catholic origin, although the sentiment extended to Protestants in WWI), Italians, Polish, and many more. And very early on many considered that only those of English heritage were capable of holding a place in American society. Even those from Nordic countries were frowned upon, most prominently the Dutch<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note60i7l');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note60i7l" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note60i7l');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Primarily by bringing Nordic surnames to American soil</span> (many English-rooted voters suspected that President Van Buren <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">was not actually American-born</a>). Nowadays, the idea that some ethnic groups couldn't be classified as white seems almost alien to most modern audiences. Heck, even most White Supremacist groups have ditched the old Nordicism idea (a concept that held that the superior race/truly white people were only those of Nordic or Germanic roots) and try to integrate all ethnic white groups to their movement. Xenophobia still exists today, but mostly is aimed at non-white groups like Latinos, Asians, etcetera. Consider how funny it would be if someday Hispanics came to be considered "whites" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatinoIsBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatinoIsBrown">(which, technically, some of them are)</a> and were among the ones discriminating against a new wave of immigrants in the country. European ethnic identities persist (among Irish, Ashkenazi Jews, and Italians especially), but they don't serve to isolate or alienate such peoples any more; now they're really just a way for ethnic whites to avoid being classed as the dreaded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteAngloSaxonProtestant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteAngloSaxonProtestant">"Anglo-Saxon."</a> And there are many groups traditionally regarded as "white" or "Western" who still do not qualify as <em>truly</em> white: Arabs, Armenians, and many other Middle Eastern peoples. <br><br>The trope was starting to break down as early as the 1920s, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKlan">the Ku Klux Klan</a> actually tried &mdash; unsuccessfully &mdash; to appeal to Irish Catholics <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">(who sometimes shared the Klan's racism and anti-Semitism)</a>, insisting that they didn't hate <em>all</em> Catholics, just "greasy" Latin people and the like (their revulsion toward the Vatican motivated as much by its being Italian as by its being Catholic).

<p></p></li><li> <strong>The "What, Me Worry?" Kid as Advertising</strong>: You probably recognize Alfred E. Neuman as the mascot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/MAD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/MAD">MAD</a></em> Magazine. But they didn't invent it, they actually just use it. No one really knows how it started but was one early example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a>: it was used as an advertising tool, mostly by medical services/dentists (but popular enough in other areas like insurances or auto-parts), and it consisted in claiming the procedures the doctor used were painless, with the kid stating "What, me worry?", "It didn't hurt at all" or other similar phrases. This was usually a lie, but a very well-liked one and it was still used all the way to the early twentieth century. But once the satirical magazine appeared and started to employ this image, it was completely associated with the publication, with its history in advertising forgotten incredibly soon.
<ul><li> The humorous stock poster of a "crazy person" depicted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BreakfastOfChampions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BreakfastOfChampions">Breakfast of Champions</a></em> seems very similar to this.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>Saturday Night is Bath Night</strong>: Before indoor plumbing became widespread in the early-mid 20th century, people bathed a lot less often. The most common time to bathe was Saturday night, the night before going to church on Sunday. References to this can be found in media going all the way to the mid-20th century (as referenced in the song "Splish Splash" by Bobby Darin in 1958). Related to this trope is mentions of doing laundry on Monday, as by Sunday one would have dirtied even their nice Sunday clothes, and laundry was a much more time-consuming process before washing machines and needed to be planned.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8hlc2');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note8hlc2" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8hlc2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Many homemakers followed this traditional schedule: Monday - laundry, Tuesday - ironing, Wednesday - sewing/mending, Thursday - market/groceries, Friday - housecleaning, Saturday - baking, Sunday - rest.</span>
<p></p></li><li> <strong>The circus parade</strong>: During the first decades of the 20th century, the arrival of a circus would mean that the whole town stopped to see it holding a huge parade on Main Street. This practice became less prevalent beginning with WWII, while by the 1970s it had disappeared. It has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> in the form of holiday parades however, most notably the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and the Tournament of Roses Parade (held during New Year's Day), both of which still make extensive use of live music, live animals (though mostly horses), acrobats, stuntpeople, and actors.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LittleNemoAdventuresInSlumberland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LittleNemoAdventuresInSlumberland">Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland</a></em> has one of these at the start of the film, mostly as a set up for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYouWereThere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYouWereThere">And You Were There</a> as the circus performers Nemo sees resemble characters that later appear in his dream. Fittingly it takes place sometime near the beginning of the 20th century.

</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>The Flapping Dickey</strong>: A dickey is a false shirt front, a roundish piece of starched cloth, paper or synthetic material, which was used under a formal jacket to "cheat" the look of a tuxedo. Dickeys were cheap, comfortable and easier to launder, which made them popular at a time when doing laundry was so labor-intensive. But they were considered unfashionable, and had a tendency (exaggerated in fiction) to flap upwards, humiliating the wearer. Thus a flaping dickey with a string-pulled mechanism was an obnoxiously common vaudeville gag, and was seen in fiction up to the 1990ies, long after laundry became much cheaper.
<ul><li> This is a key part in one of the transition gags in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockyAndBullwinkle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockyAndBullwinkle">Rocky and Bullwinkle</a></em>. Bullwinkle, clad in a tuxedo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfDressedCartoonAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfDressedCartoonAnimal">from the wait up</a>, attempts to sing an opera song, but his dickey curls up and knocks over the music stand, causing chaos on stage.
</li><li> A good example of this that probably most people would recognize is in Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPan">Peter Pan</a></em>, in which part of Mr. Darling's exasperation with his imaginative children is that he's late for a party and can't find his dickey, which turns out to have been repurposed by the kids as their pretend treasure map and, naturally, it flaps up into his face during the scene.
</li><li> Shows up a few times on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, notably part of Krusty's comedy schtick. Each time he does the flapping dickey gag, though, it is outright mocked for being cliche and old-fashioned, showing Krusty's desperation to get a laugh.

<ul><li> <strong>Oral Fixation</strong>: A feature of Freudian psychology that proposed several distinct mental stages. The first stage was oral fixation, formed during infancy through nursing and typically lost shortly thereafter. Therefore, a person who exhibited an oral fixation (smoking, chewing a toothpick, and sometimes extended to homosexuality) as an adult was thought to be somehow emotionally stunted and immature. The idea was quite popular and well known up until the 1970s and 80s, by which time Freud's ideas had been professionally discredited and the public had moved on to newer pop psychology. It will still pop up on occasion, but is hardly ever used in seriousness. The name of the trope now refers to its use as a visual shorthand for certain character traits.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LyndaBarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LyndaBarry">Lynda Barry</a> has a comic about this illustrating all the types of objects one could use to fulfill an oral fixation, from candy to lipstick.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>The smoking song</strong>: A song about (tobacco) smoking either banishing worldly worries or inspiring sentimental visions. It probably originally derived from the nineteenth-century opium craze (since smoking opium often caused users to have vivid dreams), only to eventually be replaced by the more socially acceptable use of tobacco in the twentieth century. Songs about smoking certain <em>other</em> things are still alive and well, however.
<ul><li> "Love Is Like A Cigarette" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheRoseOfAlgeria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheRoseOfAlgeria">The Rose of Algeria</a></em> is one example.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>The "love nest" song</strong>: A song describing the type and/or location of the cozy little home a couple would plan to settle down in.
<ul><li> An odd modern example would be in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LittleShopOfHorrors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LittleShopOfHorrors">Little Shop of Horrors</a></em>, where "Somewhere That's Green" describes the type of locale that Audrey would like to live with Seymour.

</li><li> "A Room in Bloomsbury" in Sandy Wilson's <em>The Boy Friend</em> is one of its more notable 1950s affectionate parodies of old 1920s tropes. In Ken Russell's film, set during a late 20s or early 30s performance of the play, it's presented as sweet but dated.
</li><li> The same sentiment is still common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">country songs</a>, such as Tim McGraw's "Where the Green Grass Grows" (released in 1998).

The genre survived until the Great Depression.

</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>Revues</strong>, in the first half of the 20th century, were plotless shows that combined song-and-dance numbers with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SketchComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SketchComedy">Sketch Comedy</a>, the latter often showcasing top vaudeville performers. As stage productions, revues were essentially ephemeral, with only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakawayPopHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakawayPopHit">Breakaway Pop Hit</a> songs being intended to potentially live on after the show closed. The <em>Ziegfeld Follies</em> was New York's longest-running revue series, running from 1907 to 1957, and at its height had an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllStarCast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllStarCast">All-Star Cast</a> reputation extending all the way down to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChorusGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChorusGirls">Chorus Girls</a>. In the mid-1920s, revues accounted for nearly half of all new musical shows produced on Broadway. The hitherto annual productions of the <em>Ziegfeld Follies</em> and its major competitors started became increasingly sporadic after that, though the genre's popularity held up until the 1950s, when it rapidly faded with the rise of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VarietyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VarietyShow">Variety Show</a>. During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RiseOfTheTalkies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RiseOfTheTalkies">Rise of the Talkies</a>, many movie studios produced revues, even going to the then-unusual expense of filming them in color.
<p></p></li><li> <strong>Cigarette lighter gag</strong>: Jokes about cigarette lighters refusing to light were obnoxiously common in the days of vaudeville. Apparently a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. The founder of Zippo noted that one of his friends carried an IMCO lighter (which was apparently ugly and unfashionable) "because it works". He copied and improved the mechanism when he founded his own company.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItsAWonderfulLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItsAWonderfulLife">It's a Wonderful Life</a></em>, this trope is the reason why <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWUOzT-EE24">George Bailey always wishes for a million dollars before activating the cigar lighter in the drug store<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Since the device working is such a rare occurrence, he might as well use it as a good luck charm.
</li><li> The idea is alluded to in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/QuietPlease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/QuietPlease">Quiet, Please</a></em> episode "Northern Lights", in which one of the scientists volunteers his lighter for the teleportation/time travel experiment because he figures it'll be no big loss if they can't get it back and explicitly says that it hardly ever works, anyway.
</li><li> The trope held on long enough to make it into the pilot episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bewitched" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bewitched">Bewitched</a></em>, where actual magic is necessary to get a table lighter to work.

Such sequences, leftovers from early cinema in which simply seeing such things was a novel spectacle, eventually vanished unless they were immediately relevant to the plot. They still exist in art and experimental cinema in various forms, but in commercial fiction films, they have long since faded from public consciousness.

</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>The "exculpatory preface" before a controversial film</strong>: During the early 1930s, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHaysCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHaysCode">The Hays Code</a> was not effectively enforced and was being regularly flouted, filmmakers felt obliged to immunize themselves against charges of corrupting public morals ("exculpate" means "absolve from blame") by including this, essentially a disclaimer that was held on the screen for a few seconds or so before any picture with a sociopolitical or "edgy" message began. The exculpatory preface insisted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial">(often disingenuously)</a> that the following movie was <em>not</em> a propaganda piece and was not intended to endorse a social or political point of view that might upset people. Perhaps the most notorious of these was the preface bumpering the scandalous 1932 horror film (with a coded civil-rights message) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Freaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Freaks">Freaks</a></em>, which is <em>several paragraphs</em> long and tries to justify the vigilante justice wreaked by the circus freaks in the film. Traces of this custom still turn up occasionally on television, especially when a program is introduced by a "this-does-not-reflect-our-personal-views" disclaimer at the end of any TV show with political or otherwise controversial content &mdash; but for the most part, the popular media do not fear censorship any more and respect their audience's collective intelligence, reasoning that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontLikeDontRead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontLikeDontRead">anyone who is offended by a program can just change the channel or turn off the TV</a>.
<ul><li> A more recent equivlent can be found in the Family Channel. When the channel was sold to International Family Entertainment There was a stipulation in the contract that the channel must air the 'The 700 Club' regularly. The 700 club was a heavily conservative christian talk show that did not fit in well with the later branding of the channel. Since they were legally required to continue airing the show the channel put it on as late as they legally could and always aired a message prior to it's airing stressing that the content of the show did not represent the thoughts and beliefs of the station airing it.

This character type was popular in the early 20th century, back when young ladies were supposed to be watched over by parents and chaperones before marriage: the widow had the advantages of independence, (moderate) experience and wealth, though the last of these assets often depended on gold-digging among prospective second husbands.

The use of goat glands &mdash; with miraculous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Popeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Popeye">Popeye-after-Spinach</a> type results &mdash; not only became a trope in films themselves, but a film industry term for silent films that had sound hurriedly added to them to bring them up to date.

Thanks to elevators, landlords can now rent out lofts for a hefty markup relative to the rest of the building, and starving artists had best starve somewhere lower down. If you smear some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigAppleSauce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigAppleSauce">Big Apple Sauce</a> on this trope, though, it comes back to life with some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> on its side. Buildings of five floors or fewer in NYC do not have to have elevators.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DWGriffith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DWGriffith">D. W.

This was so much the case that when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CecilBDeMille" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CecilBDeMille">Cecil B. DeMille</a> did the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTenCommandments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTenCommandments">1956 remake</a>, he dropped the modern story entirely and made the whole movie about Moses.
</li><li> This was a popular enough trope to be parodied by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BusterKeaton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BusterKeaton">Buster Keaton</a>'s film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeAges">Three Ages</a></em>.
</li><li> This gimmick is arguably still with us, in the form of "The History of..." spoofs in comic strips and TV commercials showing stereotyped scenes from past eras, often with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BambooTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BambooTechnology">Bamboo Technology</a>.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>The officer fallen on hard times</strong>: The British army commissioned a lot of officers from outside of the traditional officer class during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, and after the war most of these men had to return to their former stations in life. This was a popular character type in post-war British fiction, but most of those novels are now forgotten, with one of the few exceptions being <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LadyChatterleysLover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LadyChatterleysLover">Lady Chatterley's Lover</a></em>, in which Mellors the gamekeeper is a former officer. An example set earlier, but written more recently, would be Napoleonic-era naval officers (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AubreyMaturin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AubreyMaturin">Jack Aubrey</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HoratioHornblower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HoratioHornblower">Horatio Hornblower</a>) whenever peace breaks out.
<p></p></li><li> <strong>Spitting and spittoons</strong>: While casual spitting was becoming seen as crude by then, the habit persisted into the early 20th Century. Spittoons were a special type receptacle kept around so that people could spit in them. Hygienic concerns brought by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSpanishFlu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSpanishFlu">The Spanish Flu</a> caused a quick decline to it, but before it died for good, many an early-Golden Age cartoon short included nigh-incomprehensible by now scenes of spitting characters. Sometimes the gag involved using a random bowl or a pot for a spittoon. The spit itself, presented as a bouncy black droplet, often appeared to be a piece of chewed tobacco or gum equivalent and made a "ding!" sound on impact.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder6');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40s and 50s&nbsp;</div><div id="folder6" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <strong>Facial muscle control</strong>: As mentioned under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting">Clark Kenting</a>, facial muscle control was used by pulp magazines to hand-wave <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfDisguise">Master of Disguise</a> abilities, because it was thought that if a male character wore make-up for a disguise, that would make him a "sissy". Perhaps because of common awareness of the use of make-up in films or the lack of believability of the facial muscle explanation, this trope hasn't been used for a while. It's not that holding yourself a bit differently doesn't change your appearance, but you can't make yourself look like a completely different person that way.
<ul><li> Although this was used in the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MinorityReport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MinorityReport">Minority Report</a></em>, with the aid of an electronic device to relax the muscles.
</li><li> It was also used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Innerspace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Innerspace">Innerspace</a></em>.
</li><li> In the lengthy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em> fan novel <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.simegen.com/fandom/startrek/au4/">Alternate Universe 4<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, James Kirk learns to do this when he becomes an Action Agent in Lightfleet after being kicked out of Starfleet.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>Films adapted as radio plays</strong>: During the 1940s, films were sometimes adapted into radio plays, usually performed by the original cast of the film. The most popular of these radio programs was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/LuxRadioTheatre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/LuxRadioTheatre">Lux Radio Theatre</a></em>, which if it couldn't get the original cast, usually got other A-listers to perform the parts. Television, being a visual medium like film, made such adaptations redundant, though they did still happen to a limited extent even into the 1980s &mdash; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/StarWarsRadioDramas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/StarWarsRadioDramas">Star Wars</a></em> being a very famous example, and also one of the very last produced in this manner.
<ul><li> The genre survives in the UK, where some TV works (most notably <em>Doctor Who</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9ae4s');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note9ae4s" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9ae4s');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Done there so that Big Finish can still employ the original surviving cast members when available, particularly with the original series, since the stars are now 30-50 years older than they were when playing their roles on TV but in general still sound vocally very close to their younger selves</span>) have been adapted to radio; and in Japan, where some anime, like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, get short stories known as "audio dramas" (which, despite their name, are predominantly comedies).
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>Ballet sequences in musicals</strong>: A trope from Hollywood musicals of the forties and fifties was the ballet sequence &mdash; a segment in which the movie broke away from the main action, usually as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamBallet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamBallet">dream</a>, to tell a mini-story through stylized interpretive dance. It may have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolvingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolvingTrope">evolved</a> into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment">Big-Lipped Alligator Moment</a>.
<ul><li> The Big Ballet trend in musicals was started by George Balanchine and "Slaughter on Tenth Avenue" from <em>On Your Toes</em> (and revisited in the "biographical" <em>Words and Music</em>), which in turn might have been inspired by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BusbyBerkeleyNumber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BusbyBerkeleyNumber">Busby Berkeley Number</a> "Lullaby of Broadway" from <em>Gold Diggers of 1935</em>.
</li><li> Found as late as Ken Russell's consciously retro film version of Sandy Wilson's <em>The Boy Friend</em> (1971), even though the play itself does <em>not</em> have a ballet sequence. But then, the film is also replete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BusbyBerkeleyNumber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BusbyBerkeleyNumber">Busby Berkeley numbers</a> and countless other lovingly-rendered throwbacks to earlier eras.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>Sports comics and stage magic comics</strong>: In between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks">The Golden Age of Comic Books</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">The Silver Age of Comic Books</a>, a number of non-superhero genres were popular. While some, like crime, horror, romance, monster, and western comics are fondly remembered, still continue, or are occasionally revived, a few others have been entirely forgotten, such as the brief vogue for sports comics and the even briefer vogue for comics about stage magic (think of Moloch the evil magician from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em> as a contemporary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to this subgenre). This is partly because the institution of the Comics Code Authority in 1954 following the publication of <em>Seduction of the Innocent</em> (see below) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreKiller">killed off the more violent or lurid examples of these comics for nearly a generation, and some of the genres never recovered</a>.
<ul><li> Sports are still a popular topic for some American newspaper comics (see <em>Tank McNamara</em>), as well as in Japanese manga.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>Short stories in comic books</strong>: The two-page prose short story featured in many comics from the 1930s up to the early 1960s was due to postal regulations requiring any publication taking advantage of the cheaper magazine bulk distribution rates to have at least two pages of prose or other written content. The popularity of the letters pages and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee">Stan Lee</a>'s promotional "Bullpen Bulletins" pages replaced them, and eventually postal regulations changed.
<p></p></li><li> <strong>Civilian adventure comics</strong>: The dominance of the superhero has all but eliminated the once popular "civilian adventurer" type, who often had an exciting profession and invariably ended up battling criminals and spies. Many early comics featured the likes of aviator Hop Harrigan, TV host Roy Raymond, and adventurer Pep Morgan starring in backup features in the increasingly superhero-dominated anthologies. While some of these characters still exist, they usually survive by either becoming superheroes (like Congo Bill becoming Congorilla) or becoming part of the supporting cast of a superhero comic (like Speed Saunders, who has been tied in with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hawkman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hawkman">Hawkman</a>). The idea of such characters headlining their own comics is long gone. They still persist in sine newspaper comics&mdash;<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/MarkTrail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/MarkTrail">Mark Trail</a></em> for example&mdash;but only because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause">Grandfather Clause</a>.
<p></p></li><li> <strong>Superheroes with a vehicle as their gimmick</strong>: The hero whose sole gimmick is a super-vehicle of some kind &mdash; such as Taxi Taylor, Captain X, and the 1940s Red Torpedo &mdash; is all but forgotten, having long since been absorbed by superhero characters like Batman who have other gimmicks and talents besides a Batmobile or the like. A particular subset of these characters, the aviator hero with a special plane, exists today almost entirely in the form of the <em>Blackhawk</em> characters, who also have the gimmick of being a multinational team of flyers.
<ul><li> Captain Falcon of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FZero">F-Zero</a></em> video game series is a modern-day example of this trope: He is a professional race car driver who chases down criminals when not racing. This premise, in turn, is undoubtedly an homage to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpeedRacer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpeedRacer">Speed Racer</a></em>, the most famous example of this trope, albeit a character no longer taken seriously due to his campiness.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>Male <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">Heterosexual Life-Partners</a> who share a house</strong>: In the first half of the 20th century, this trope was common in children's comic books &#150; sometimes the main characters would even share a bed and showed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteHero">little or no interest in women</a>. However, in the United States <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredric_Wertham">Dr. Frederic Wertham<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> anvilled this point repeatedly in his 1954 book <em>Seduction of the Innocent</em>, which sparked a Congressional hearing, after which it became more and more common for adults to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">interpret this kind of relationship as gay</a>. Wertham emphasized that <em>even the youngest children understood the characters to be gay</em>. This inevitably led to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayPanic">Gay Panic</a> and mobilized the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a>, forcing American comic writers and publishers to abandon this trope and make changes specifically designed to avert it and stop the accusations. In Continental Europe there never was a comparable panic, so this trope continued to exist longer, gradually phasing out beginning in the 1970s, but mostly as a result of changing views on masculinity making the use of the trope impossible without being the target of snide jokes.
<ul><li> Examples of this trope in comic books include:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin">Tintin</a> and Captain Haddock
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlakeAndMortimer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlakeAndMortimer">Blake and Mortimer</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpirouAndFantasio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpirouAndFantasio">Spirou and Fantasio</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman and Robin</a>, until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayPanic">Gay Panic</a>, when the publishers had Dick Grayson's Aunt Harriet move in with him and Bruce Wayne, and introduced stories where Bruce dated women.
</li></ul></li><li> Similar housing arrangements can also be found in non-comics literature:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> and Watson (before the latter got married and moved out; and then again for a few years after his first wife died).
</li><li> A four-way example would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Biggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Biggles">Biggles</a> and his three chums, Algy, Ginger and Bertie.
</li><li> The trope is still quite common in fantasy literature, for example the main characters of Scott Lynch's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GentlemanBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GentlemanBastard">Gentleman Bastard</a></em> series, who are as-good-as-brothers friends and have been sharing a small room since they were kids, and apparently saw no real reason to stop as adults.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10edt9');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note10edt9" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10edt9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Neither of them is particularly lucky in love.</span> Or the main characters in Lynn Flewelling's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nightrunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nightrunner">Nightrunner</a></em> series, who were sharing rooms (and occasionally even a single bed, when staying in traveler's inns or friends' guest rooms) long before they ever developed any romantic interest in each other. In the latter case, it's depicted as an "old-fashioned arrangement" (due to lack of proper heating), or as the result of the very limited space in wayside inns.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11ku8z');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note11ku8z" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11ku8z');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">If they hadn't splurged on a private room, they would have been expected to share a bed in the common room with half a dozen strangers.</span> There's also mention of teenage noble girls sleeping in a bed with their nurse/chaperone &mdash; possibly to prevent nightly visits from their beau.
</li></ul></li><li> This living arrangement was also quite common in older film comedies from the Silent and Golden Ages of Hollywood. No one found it odd to see <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurelAndHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurelAndHardy">Laurel and Hardy</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges">The Three Stooges</a></em> share a bed together.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>Eccentric village characters songs</strong>: A folk song trope that isn't used much any more. In the fifties, there were plenty of songs about eccentric but beloved village characters such as the old lamp-lighter or the old umbrella salesman. Those songs are forgotten except by those very familiar with old songs.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomLehrer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomLehrer">Tom Lehrer</a>'s song "The Old Dope Peddler" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SongsByTomLehrer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SongsByTomLehrer">Songs by Tom Lehrer</a></em> parodies this. Actually, many of Lehrer's songs parody styles and tropes which were old even when he was writing them (although a few had seen revivals at the time); and have now been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdAlEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdAlEffect">all but forgotten</a> by any but aficionados of old music.
</li><li> Maddy Prior's "All Our Trades" stands out as a late example of this trope done straight.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>Everything's greener with chlorophyll</strong>: A minor trope in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a>, afterwards forgotten. The brief fad for chlorophyll as an additive centered on its supposed deodorizing and "healing" properties, not to mention giving products like toothpaste a natural green color. <em>TIME Magazine</em> reported a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,857175,00.html">chlorophyll boom<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in April 1952 which had become a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,860075,00.html">bust<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> by October of the next year.
<ul><li> In the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan">Iron Man</a></em> film, Tony Stark drinks a concoction he says involves chlorophyll to stave off palladium poisoning.
</li><li> The modern gimmicky plant extract health trend means that chlorophyll is still used in some cult beauty products bragging about their plant credentials. It gives the green colour to MOA's Green Balm (a coconut oil-based moisturiser marketed as a multipurpose "healing balm") and LUSH's Mask of Magnaminty, and gives supposed anti-aging properties in Asian beauty products like The Saem's Natural-Tox Green Grape sheet mask and Lu Ming Tang's Elixir de Vie eye cream.
</li><li> As explained <a class="urllink" href="https://explorecuriocity.org/Explore/ArticleId/173/why-does-the-company-that-makes-clorets-put-chlorophyll-in-gum-173.aspx">in this article from CurioCity<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, Clorets chewing gum incorporates a water-soluble variant of chlorophyll as a breath deodorant.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>All greasers are Italians</strong>: A minor trope back in the 50s about the stereotype that all or most greasers were ethnically Italian. It is given a nod in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Grease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Grease">Grease</a></em>, with roughly half the characters being vaguely of Italian descent (or sometimes not so vague, such as the character of Sonny being bilingual). Nowadays, this subculture is still remembered, but the racial connotation seem to be lost for modern audiences, especially since the '50s youth culture has caught on with all ethnic groups. The reality-TV show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JerseyShore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JerseyShore">Jersey Shore</a></em> did briefly revive this trope in a more modern context.
<p></p></li><li> <strong>Alum gag</strong>: One gag used in cartoons was when someone ingested the multi-use substance <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alum">alum<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, their lips would tighten to a pucker, their head would shrink, or their voice would increase in pitch. Adult men (and curious children) would have been familiar with alum's indescribable taste from its use as a styptic in the days of double-edged razor shaving, where it was common (and unfortunate) to get some in your mouth by accident. Alum's replacement with more commercial grooming products mean the only people who risk this experience these days are traditional shaving enthusiasts and people who aren't very good at making homemade pickles.
<ul><li> The latter two occurred in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> short "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LongHairedHare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LongHairedHare">Long-Haired Hare</a>".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges">The Three Stooges</a></em> also once accidentally added alum to a stew.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurelAndHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurelAndHardy">Laurel and Hardy</a> experience this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TitForTat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TitForTat">Tit for Tat</a></em> when alum gets sprinkled on some marshmallows.
</li><li> Many brands of modern 'extreme' sour sweets are advertised with shots of people making funny puckering faces; since alum is often used along with citric acid to create the face-sucking kick, this is a mild example of the trope existing today. And of course, if you're truly curious, styptic pencils made with alum are still available in many drugstores.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>Cuba is a hotbed of sin</strong>: In pre-Castro Cuba, and especially during the Batista years, the Mafia opened numerous casinos, nightclubs, and places of ill repute in the country to avoid American law enforcement, making it an extremely popular tourist destination. All of this died out with Castro's revolution &mdash; in fact, part of Castro's reason for taking over was because he was disgusted over American criminals controlling Cuba's economy. Of course, prostitution, and even a thriving gay culture still exist in Cuba and are grudgingly tolerated.
<ul><li> The idea of Cuba as a hotbed of sin is seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/GuysAndDolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/GuysAndDolls">Guys and Dolls</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather">The Godfather, Part II</a></em> owes a few scenes to this trope.
</li><li> The iconic 1997 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldMusic">World Music</a> album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BuenaVistaSocialClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BuenaVistaSocialClub">Buena Vista Social Club</a></em> owes its success to playing with this trope &mdash; the musicians on the album were elderly men who had played in the lost dens and brothels of pre-Communism Cuba in their youth. The album is a mixture of genuine sinhouse standards and original pieces in the same, forgotten style.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>Bullets go ping</strong>: Movie bullets used to make a long pinging sound whenever they hit a rock or metal surface; this sounds ridiculous to most modern ears, although the similar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletSparks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletSparks">Bullet Sparks</a> trope remains alive.
<ul><li> It was used in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon">Marathon</a></em> computer games as late as 1996 (<a class="urllink" href="http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/">source<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>).
</li><li> Due to its heavy use in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWestern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWestern">old Western films</a> (enough that the sounds are often associated with the genre), pieces paying homage to the classic era of Westerns will use this effect as a shout-out, similar to using the Wilhelm Scream. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption">Red Dead Redemption</a></em> is a good example of this at work.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>Rock and roll music causing juvenile delinquency</strong>: This one was fairly widespread during the first few years of rock's existence (mid-1950s, mostly), turning up both in fiction and in real-life accounts. Although juvenile crime is certainly still a problem, rock music hasn't been commonly viewed as a social menace since the 1970s at the very latest, and any complaints from parents about rock and roll nowadays are bound to be about how it supposedly makes young people lazy and stupid, not how it makes them criminals &mdash; and as the more highbrow, progressive varieties of rock move more and more into the mainstream, even <em>that</em> trope has started to disappear. Nowadays the complaint is usually about rock music's still sexually provocative image, musicians acting childishly and/or irresponsibly in public, or the superficially (or not) left-wing politics of many rock musicians, and that for hard rock and metal. If you hear a parent denounce rock and roll as literally evil any more, he or she is almost certainly a fundamentalist Christian &mdash; and usually a non-mainstream one, at that. Actually, the last time music was considered to encourage violence was in the 1980s, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewRockAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewRockAndRoll">the culprit most usually being rap music</a> &mdash; or, occasionally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal">Heavy Metal</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRock">Punk Rock</a>.
<ul><li> One of the very last works to portray this unironically was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockItsYourDecision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockItsYourDecision">Rock: It's Your Decision</a></em> in 1982, and many people who have reviewed it feel that it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDecadesBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDecadesBehind">Two Decades Behind</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WindmillCrusader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WindmillCrusader">Satanic Panic</a> of the 80s and early 90s briefly revived this in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenserAndWackier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenserAndWackier">more intense and spurious form</a>. Leaflets distributed by anti-Satanist groups said that an interest in rock music was indication that an adult was a Satanist performing bizarre ritual torture on children. Heavy metal album cover art was used as evidence in court to take the children of accused adults into care.
</li><li> The 1999 comic <em>Batman: Fortunate Son</em> depicts Batman as exactly this sort of "parent" towards Robin.
</li><li> A variation would be saying that a popular musician (actually anything popular) is part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIlluminati" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIlluminati">"The Great Jewish-Masonic-Satanic Conspiracy" (a.k.a. the N.W.O.)</a>, although it's far less prominent.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>All-Male Stylish Black Musicians</strong>: This one has origins in vaudeville. In order to get past the stereotypical view of blacks as unruly "wild men", black performers would don the most dapper suits they could afford and act as refined as possible. This had a deep mark on music for a very long time &mdash; think <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFourTops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFourTops">The Four Tops</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheInkspots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheInkspots">The Inkspots</a>, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankieValli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankieValli">Frankie Valli</a>... (The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a>, with black female singers as evening-gowned <em>grandes dames</em>, showed up frequently in the Motown "girl groups.") The trope remained popular in the 70s and 80s, but since the 90s it has fallen out of favor with the popularity of urban music among the Afro-American crowd. Certain modern black pop stars still use this trope, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Outkast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Outkast">Outkast</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JanelleMonae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JanelleMonae">Janelle Mon&aacute;e</a> (who does a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flip</a> version of the look), but it is part of a semi-ironic retro image rather than an omnipresent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope">Enforced Trope</a>.
<p></p></li><li> <strong>Crappy postal service</strong>: Mail in the mid-20th century was far from being a reliable service, with many jokes about letters either going to another place or arriving not days or months, but years or <em>decades</em> late. This problem became less common after the inception of the ZIP code in the 60s, and since the 90s the prevalence of e-mail has rendered the trope inoperative, except perhaps on certain political talk shows.
<p></p></li><li> <strong>Uranium Fever</strong>: Back in the 50s, uranium became such a valuable commodity for its use in nuclear energy that it became a modern substitute for gold as "the element that is so valuable it's worth trying to find it" in contemporary pop culture. Examples include songs like "Uranium Fever" as well as the movie of the same name, films like <em>Dig That Uranium</em>, and even cartoons like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockyAndBullwinkle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockyAndBullwinkle">Rocky and Bullwinkle</a></em> (where one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc">Aborted Arc</a> began with the improbable news that cereal boxtops had become more valuable than uranium) and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones">The Flintstones</a></em> (in one episode, Fred feels disappointed after finding out a gold mine he discovered isn't really real gold, but he immediately feels better when at the end of the episode he digs out what it seems to be uranium in a place under the terrain of his home and mentions how he's going to be rich), and even as an excuse in a few episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PerryMason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PerryMason">Perry Mason</a></em> (Perry needs to get on some land to conduct a search; he realizes that the mineral rights are available, and he pretends to be uranium prospecting). Then it was discovered how dangerous it is to handle uranium, and it was quickly forgotten. Nowadays a lot of people still know how valuable it is, but very few outside of experts and professionals will even try to find it.
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MissMarple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MissMarple">Miss Marple</a> novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/APocketFullOfRye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/APocketFullOfRye">A Pocket Full of Rye</a></em> this is a plot point &mdash; a gold mine that had been written off as worthless in the 1920s turns out to contain valuable uranium deposits.
</li><li> The 1958 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges">The Three Stooges</a></em> short <em>Oil's Well That Ends Well</em> was a remake of the 1939 short <em>Oily to Bed, Oily to Rise</em>, but with a uranium subplot added in, where the Stooges tried to get the ore to pay for their father's surgery.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>Chase Cartoons</strong>: After the big success of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a></em>, the idea of having some cartoon character chasing another as the basic premise became a sub-genre in the animation industry. Even parodies like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WileECoyoteAndTheRoadRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WileECoyoteAndTheRoadRunner">Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner</a></em> (that took the basic plot and put it to work with the two most unlikeliest animals in the weirdest setting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckJones">Chuck Jones</a> could think of) was a success in its own right when people took it at face value instead of the satire it was supposed to be. But while a lot of those characters remain beloved icons of the medium, you just don't see a lot of these kind of shows any more. The very few attempts to revive this premise in later years are seen as obscure, or as cult shows at best.
<p></p></li><li> <strong>Rejection Of Kanji</strong>: In the early years of Japanese pro wrestling breaking out of small clubs into the mainstream there were three noticeable naming conventions. Real full names, most commonly used by already well-known judoka, honorific titles from sumo tradition and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyOneName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyOneName">single</a> common Japanese names written in capitalized letters from the Latin Alphabet. The latter were a sign that a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel">heel</a> was rejecting Japanese characters in the loudest way possible. As foreigners became more accepted and were able to get over as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face">faces</a>, it became common to pit a foreigner whose name was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmigrantPatriotism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmigrantPatriotism">transliterated into kanji</a> against an all caps native just to make it more obvious. However, most of the perpetrators themselves ended up undergoing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">heel face turns</a> and the meaning became forgotten, to the point <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KentaKobayashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KentaKobayashi">Kenta Kobayashi</a> simply went with KENTA to distinguish himself from the more established similar sounding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KentaKobashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KentaKobashi">Kenta Kobashi</a>, with both acting as baby <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face">faces</a> at the same time in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ProWrestlingNOAH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ProWrestlingNOAH">NOAH</a> promotion, which seemingly uses all caps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">just because it looks cool</a>.
<p></p></li><li> <strong>The Spanish Civil War veteran</strong>: In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> movies made while the war was still in progress, it was a common trope to establish a character's anti-fascist credentials with a mention that he (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysMale">and it was always a "he"</a>) had fought in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishCivilWar">Spanish Civil War</a> on the Republican side. The most famous instance of this is Rick in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Casablanca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Casablanca">Casablanca</a></em>. After the war, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedScare">Red Scare</a> arrived and Spanish Civil War veterans were branded as communist traitors. As a result, this trope quickly disappeared from subsequent films about World War II. Despite the fact that World War II movies are still made in abundance and that there's much less of a stigma about Spanish Civil War veterans now, the trope of mentioning Spanish Civil War service to establish anti-fascist credentials appears to be well and truly dead.
<ul><li> Shows up in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielPinkwater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielPinkwater">Daniel Pinkwater</a>'s <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEducationOfRobertNifkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEducationOfRobertNifkin">The Education Of Robert Nifkin</a></em>, set in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a>, where ROTC instructor Sgt. Gunter is established as a badass in Robert's eyes by the fact that he fought fascists in the Spanish Civil War. Sgt. Gunter turns out to be a secret communist and gets fired for this, but remains a hero and mentor to Robert, and is portrayed as the only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Reasonable Authority Figure</a> amidst a school ruled by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedScare">Red Scare</a>-crazed nutcases.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal">Funny Animal</a> hides in a fur coat or rug</strong>: A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> in Golden Age cartoons (and for some time beyond that) featured an animal character using a fur coat (generally a mink coat) or rug (usually a tiger or a bear) as a means of hiding. These were common sights in middle-class homes until the 1970s (another popular trope at the time was that of the wife tricking her husband in order to get money for a new coat), when the rising animal rights movement sparked a backlash, which coupled with that decade's economic changes made them unaffordable for anyone except rich people, and for that matter mostly limited to crass <em>nouveau riche</em> types.
<p></p></li><li> <strong>Whoopee caps</strong> were common in the early 20th century amongst working-class men, and evolved out of a trend to buy cheap second-hand felt fedoras as head protection from chemicals doing auto work. Creative people soon discovered they could customise them by turning them inside out and trimming off the brim with a scalloped or 'crown' effect, then adding buttons, grommets and patches to them. This made them a popular accessory with teenage boys. The result was they were used in fiction to express a working-class tough or juvenile delinquent/non-conformist. Nowadays no-one knows what they are, except that they look ridiculous, and except for Jughead's signature hat in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics">Archie Comics</a></em>, a holdover from his earliest days that stuck around well beyond the point that even adults knew what it was.
<p></p></li><li> <strong>Doctors Making House Calls</strong>: Up until the mid-20th century, it was common for doctors to go to patients, rather than patients going to doctors. As healthcare changed, it became increasingly common for patients to see doctors in their offices, and eventually, most doctors stopped doing it altogether. (Part of the reason for this may be that healthcare switched from being doctor-controlled to admin-controlled, and doctors were pushed to see more patients each day, leaving no time for house calls.) Even when an elderly or disabled person who cannot leave their home, or has just been released from the hospital, is given home care, it's almost always administered by a <em>nurse</em>, not a doctor. This is trope is the origin of the phrase "<em>An apple a day keeps the doctor away.</em>"
<p></p></li><li> <strong>Manga Rental Stores</strong>: In post-war Japan, paper was a bit harder to come by, thanks to occupation-era rationing. Since libraries were also rare in smaller cities, book rental businesses started to pop up, and book-length manga turned out to be great eye-catchers for younger, and eventually not-as-young, readers. These stores grew to specialize in manga thanks to modernization, but were eventually driven extinct by manga magazines. By the sixties, they were all gone.
<p></p></li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball">Pinball</a> as a "game of chance"</strong>: Prior to flippers, pinball machines were pretty much a game of luck, as only the plunger (and occasional "nudging") would be the only control a player might get in a game. (For example, on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges">The Three Stooges</a></em>, the trio would run into a pinball machine and call it ironically "a game of skill!", a joke that would be lost on modern viewers.) The addition of "replays" would add a gambling element into it as good or lucky players can accumulate a lot of them and cash them out for money &mdash; after all, what else can you do besides play the same game again? Furthermore, up to around the 1950s, there were pinball variants called "bingo machines" where you shoot multiple balls and try to get them in specific holes to score a bingo, and earn a flood of replays, which, well, legally can't be used for anything besides playing again. Naturally, all this got the ire of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> that would get the flipperless machines banned in some areas (and by the Sixties, later forgotten, especially the bingo machines). The addition of flippers, which added a great degree of skill to the game, would kill this trope. The only remaining legacy of the gambling element may be an instruction card within the machine that would include the words "FOR AMUSEMENT ONLY".
<p></p></li><li> <strong>Telephone Exchange Names</strong>: Up to roughly the 1960s, phone numbers used distinguished names where each number has a name and a series of numbers after it, and the name's first two letters corresponded to the numbers on the dial, and the rest of the numbers dialed afterward. The names were those of central offices of each set of subscriber lines (to a maximum of 10,000). For example, "MUrray Hill 5-9099"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note121kfp');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note121kfp" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note121kfp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">one of the Ricardos' numbers on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ILoveLucy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ILoveLucy">I Love Lucy</a></em></span> would translate to "685-9099" when dialed, as the "M" and "U" are the 6 and 8 on the dial, respectively. (The "H" in Hill was not dialed as it was not part of the first word.) Works like the song "Pennsylvania 6-5000", based off a well-known number in New York City (yes, there, not the Keystone State), are nods to these. <br>A very common exchange name in fiction is "Klondike", specifically "Klondike 5-xxxx", which would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveFiveFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveFiveFive">translate to "555-xxxx" on the dial</a>. (One example of this is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture">Back to the Future</a></em>, where 1955!Doc's number was "Klondike 54385", i.e. 555-4385.) Eventually these were phased out for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePennyfarthingEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePennyfarthingEffect">too needlessly complex</a> with some combinations having no pronounceable or memorable names<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13cb9q');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note13cb9q" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13cb9q');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">specifically, the 5, 7, and 9 lacked vowels and made it very hard to create names if the first two numbers are a combination of such</span>, and with the rapid growth of phone service, this became an all-number dial for most by the mid-1960s.

<ul><li> <strong>Typewriter theme music</strong>: A minor trope in old newscasts was using thematic music that emulated the ticking sound of teleprinters, news tickers or typewriters. With the predominance of new technology in the mid-to-late 1990s, those devices eventually were considered obsolete, so using such a style of musicalization wasn't making sense any more (and younger audiences probably wouldn't be able to recognize them anyway) and since then most newscast themes have featured mostly "epic soundtrack" themes with "rockish" (late 90s-mid 2000s) or electronic styles (late 2000s-2010s). During the early years of the decade, however, some radio news bulletins were still using it as a sort of homage and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody">Affectionate Parody</a> of old-time newscasts such as <em>CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite</em>.
<ul><li> The theme for the 2011-2017 BBC2/Showtime comedy <em>Episodes</em> (which revolves around a couple of British scriptwriters in Hollywood) is a jaunty tune backed by typewriter noises. Interludes between are also frequently bridged with typewriter sounds, such as typing, dinging bells, and ratcheting.
</li><li> The pod music in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleBigPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleBigPlanet">LittleBigPlanet</a></em> uses typewriters, morse code, and other such sounds. Ditched in the sequels, however.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>Instrumental covers of pop songs as background music</strong>: Between the 1950s and the mid-1990s hardly either an elevator, supermarket or a department store/shopping mall wouldn't feature instrumental knock-offs of popular songs and standards in the background (also known as "mood music" or "Muzak", after the main company in the business). But by the mid-to-late 1990s, they began to be regarded as uncool, and in some cases they were seen as a form of mind control to bolster shopping. And the advent of new sound technology (namely CDs) by then phased them out in favor of the actual songs that kind of music covered.
<ul><li> The "easy listening" orchestras of the 1950s to mid-1970s (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">carrying the torch</a> of the 1920s-30s dance bands and 1930s-40s big bands) were popular with both record buyers and radio listeners, eventually establishing the "beautiful music" format common on FM (this at a time pop music was still mostly heard on AM). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolvingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolvingTrope">These were replaced by</a> "smooth" jazz-fusion-oriented acts, which were popular until the mid 2000s.

Also remains relatively common in doctor's offices.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>Airplane hijackers demanding to be taken to Cuba</strong>: The airplane hijacker who demands to be taken to Cuba (<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Cuba%C2%96United_States_aircraft_hijackings">which was a real-life phenomenon<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>) had a brief heyday with the skyjacking wave of the late 1960s and 1970s, but was already fading into Dead Horse territory by the 1980s, and has since been completely supplanted by hijackers with far more sinister motives.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus">Monty Python's Flying Circus</a></em> played with this. One passenger on a direct flight to Cuba tries to hijack the plane and go to Luton. He ends up talked into jumping off the plane just in time to catch a bus "Straight to Luton," which is then hijacked by a man who demands to be taken to Cuba. The bus changes its sign to "Straight to Cuba" and turns around.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em> references the Cuban hijacker trope with Dominican characters that are repeatedly mistaken for Cubans.

The other characters have to remind him that he's not on a ship ("What do you mean, I'm not on a ship?").
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Cracked">Cracked</a></em> magazine spoofed this phenomenon soon after it became big in the late '60s with a few pages of strips of many other modes of transportation being hijacked, including ice-cream trucks, rickshaws, magic carpets, and horses in the Old West.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>They Spent the Night Together?!</strong>: A staple of TV sitcoms as late as the '80s. Nearly every sitcom of the era had at least one episode in which everyone was up in arms because it appeared that two unmarried opposite-sex characters had slept together when they hadn't really. The denouement was always the emergence of a perfectly innocent explanation, i.e. if a car belonging to a male character was spotted in the driveway of a female character's house in the morning, it would turn out that he'd been by the night before, the car wouldn't start and he'd walked home &mdash; but not before the rest of the cast got whipped into a frenzy about how the poor girl's reputation would be ruined and how on earth could she let this happen?! (The Everly Brothers song "Wake Up, Little Susie" has the couple falling asleep at a boring drive-in movie and the boy is worried about his own reputation, not just hers.) Nowadays, of course, that attitude is seen as sexist rather than funny, and 1990s sitcoms often featured unmarried couples sleeping together without anyone complaining, eventually killing the trope.
<p></p></li><li> <strong>A VCR flashing 12:00AM</strong>: A common gag before the advent of DVDs, due to the notorious difficulty in resetting a VCR's time. The joke doesn't work in the era of DVD players, because the vast majority of them can't record, and thus have no need for clocks in the first place &mdash; and the few who <em>do</em> (and DVRs for that matter) have a clock either have an internal clock battery, or can fetch the local time from the broadcast metadata.
<ul><li> It used to show up in a lot of Cartoon Network shows like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyBravo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyBravo">Johnny Bravo</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory">Dexter's Laboratory</a></em>, with the joke being that someone is a genius but is still unable to reset the VCR, or this being used as an example of newfound brain power. It still shows up with some Cartoon Network shows from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>, specifically <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">Teen Titans Go!</a></em>.
</li><li> Broadcast metadata and the rise of the smartphone have also killed off the trope of multiple characters synchronizing their wristwatches in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpyFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpyFiction">Spy Fiction</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaper">The Caper</a> stories.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HomestarRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HomestarRunner">Homestar Runner</a></em> referred to this phenomenon in a Strong Bad Email, acknowledging its omnipresence and the nigh-impossibility of fixing it. Strong Bad asks Bubs to fix the clock on his VCR, and Bubs "fixes" it by duct-taping another digital clock to the VCR.
</li><li> Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie reference it in their Internet Help Desk skit, as a character they call the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtItMeant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtItMeant">Twelve O'clock Flasher</a>:

<ul><li> Part of the plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Matinee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Matinee">Matinee</a></em> is kids going to one of these types of films during the Cuban Missile Crisis. It's implied that they served as escapism from the Cold War.
</li><li> The idea of olfactory accompaniment for movies was even older; the "scent organ" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BraveNewWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BraveNewWorld">Brave New World</a></em> was merely a futuristic extrapolation of what was already being done occasionally in musical revues of the late 1920s.
</li><li> There has been one such idea that's been getting rolling lately: D-BOX theaters, where the seats shake in sync with the action on-screen. 4DX theaters do use scents, but their main selling points are other environmental effects like wind, rain, and fog in addition to the aforementioned seat motion.
</li><li> This sort of technique has become very common in theme park attractions, even if your average movie theater doesn't bother with such stunts.
</li><li> There's a whole segment in the 1977 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKentuckyFriedMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKentuckyFriedMovie">The Kentucky Fried Movie</a></em> built around this "Beyond 3-D!" gimmick, with an usher who plays out a romantic scene on the patron to the point of pulling a knife on him when the jilted onscreen lover discovers her paramour's infidelity.

</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>Rock Bimbo</strong>: The "rock bimbo" was a trope that often appeared in comedy through the '80s and early '90s, based on perceptions of female fans of rock bands like Guns n' Roses and Aerosmith as attractive, shallow, dumb, promiscuous partiers and more often than not overlapping with stereotypes of the Valley Girl and images of the singer Madonna from the time. It went away completely with the rise of grunge rock in the '90s &mdash; not to mention the rise of alternative rock, which cemented the image of women in rock as musicians in their own right and not just groupies <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14lbk0');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note14lbk0" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14lbk0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which itself is pretty unfair, since there have been serious female hard-rock and punk musicians since at least the '70s (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Heart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Heart">Nancy and Ann Wilson</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PattiSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PattiSmith">Patti Smith</a>, and toward the end of the decade <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Blondie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Blondie">Deborah Harry</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRunaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRunaways">Joan Jett</a>), the '60s if psychedelic rock is considered hard rock (Janis Joplin, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeffersonAirplane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeffersonAirplane">Grace Slick</a>), or even the '50s if rockabilly is included (Wanda Jackson) </span> &mdash; although similar stereotypes about teenaged and college-aged women still surface. But at least the rock bimbo's look &mdash; long feathered hair, dark but skimpy clothing, and wearing lots of long necklaces topped by maybe a large crucifix &mdash; has long been a relic. Of course, even today you can attend some heavy-metal "throwback" concerts and see forty- or fiftysomething blond women trying to prove <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WereStillRelevantDammit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WereStillRelevantDammit">they're still relevant... dammit</a>.
<ul><li> This shaped the portrayal of Kelly Bundy and her friends on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren">Married... with Children</a></em> after the first couple of seasons.

</li><li> The song "1985" by Bowling For Soup is about a woman stuck in the past, namely the year 1985, who is described as being this trope ("Where's the miniskirt made of snakeskin?/And who's the other guy singing in Van Halen?").

</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>Not rewinding the tape gag</strong>: Another frequent gag of the 80s and 90s was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">Arson, Murder, and Jaywalking</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor">Felony Misdemeanor</a> type joke (along the lines of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MattressTagGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MattressTagGag">Mattress Tag Gag</a>) with the revelation that a villainous character had once returned a rented video without rewinding it.

<p></p></li><li> <strong>Teen girls' huge phone bills</strong>: Beginning in the 1950s and continuing into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValleyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValleyGirl">Valley Girl</a> in the 80s and 90s, part of the teenage-girl stereotype was having a phone in her room and jokes about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockinglyExpensiveBill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockinglyExpensiveBill">immense bills run up</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15c1j9');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note15c1j9" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15c1j9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">as if it were always a long distance call; high-schoolers were more likely to be speaking with a friend in the same town, or even a few miles apart, which would be a local call, no charge.</span> and the impossibility of anyone else getting a chance to use the phone line. The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_telephone">"Princess phone"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was actually <a class="urllink" href="http://www.beatriceco.com/bti/porticus/bell/telephones-princess.html#ATCA%20article">invented partly for the "chatty teen" demographic<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Thanks to cell phones and to the fact that since the eighties, long-distance charges have plummeted and then completely disappeared, with some help from Facebook and IMs, this has bitten the dust. Remnants still exist, such as in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Juno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Juno">Juno</a></em> (though this was mostly just to make a hamburger phone joke) and in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical">Totally Radical</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDecadesBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDecadesBehind">advertising</a> aimed at teens. For a time, this migrated to text messages instead of phone calls, but mobile plans with free texting becoming cheaper and more ubiquitous has made this uncommon as well. Again, this one has migrated (perhaps even into its own territory) with the rise of smart phones and their applications. With teens (of both genders) seemingly being glued to their phones at all times along with the rise of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllegedlyFreeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllegedlyFreeGame">Allegedly Free Games</a> full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevenueEnhancingDevices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevenueEnhancingDevices">Revenue-Enhancing Devices</a>, this idea has found new but distinct life. Instead of calls or texts running up the phone bill, it is in-app purchases.
<p></p></li><li> <strong>"Motherfucker" is a black word</strong>: The term "motherfucker" as a term used by African-Americans. It's noted by a lot of older folklore/analysis of humor books that it was an African-American-only term, and this stereotype turned up in jokes as late as the 1990s. For better or worse, it's become a mainstream curseword with no racial associations, beyond a strong association with black actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamuelLJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamuelLJackson">Samuel L. Jackson</a>, who says it a lot.
<ul><li> There's a joke to the effect that this would be the title of an African-American adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/OedipusTheKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/OedipusTheKing">Oedipus the King</a></em>.
</li><li> One episode of set-in-the-1920s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoardwalkEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoardwalkEmpire">Boardwalk Empire</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">shows its work</a> when black gangster Chalky uses the word and white protagonist Nucky has never heard it before.
</li><li> In the 1999 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreenMile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreenMile">The Green Mile</a></em>, a Cajun character screams the word in a fit of anger... in the setting of 1930s Louisiana. While it's true that some Cajuns were racially mixed, this one certainly didn't look like he could be. It's probably just a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresentDayPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresentDayPast">Present-Day Past</a>.
</li><li> Kept alive (and subverted) by comic Bill Burr, who notes that nobody has a problem with a black guy speaking of an "Asian motherfucker", but Burr is regarded as a bigot when he talks about a "motherfucking Asian".
</li><li> Educator James Herndon in <em>The Way It Spozed To Be</em> describes teaching in a segregated all-black school in California. The white men who ran things had a zero tolerance policy on saying "motherfucker". They believed it was such a terrible insult that it would automatically start a fight. What they didn't realize was that the worst thing you could call someone was not motherfucker, but <em>black</em>. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note163w2w');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note163w2w" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note163w2w');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This was about a decade before "Black" would be Beautiful and what you were spozed to call African Americans.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SlaughterhouseFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SlaughterhouseFive">Slaughterhouse-Five</a></em>, when Roland Weary calls Billy a "motherfucker", the narration notes that the word was "still a novelty in the speech of white people in 1944."
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>Evangelists in airports</strong>: Portraying airports as places where you could expect to be repeatedly accosted by evangelists, Hare Krishnas, political activists, and the like was rather common for a number of decades. This was because American airports were generally considered "public forums" for free speech purposes. A June 1992 Supreme Court ruling changed this, allowing airport authorities to make reasonable regulations to avoid congestion and disruption to air travelers. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">The War on Terror</a> and the increased security measures that came with it got rid of this type of airport annoyance for good.
<ul><li> While the scene is still funny, some of the vicarious thrill of Robert Stack's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeTossingCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeTossingCharge">Foe-Tossing Charge</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Airplane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Airplane">Airplane!</a></em> is lost on a modern audience. A 1980s traveler really <em>did</em> have to pass through similar gauntlets of airport attention-seekers, and probably wanted to handle them in Rex Kramer's no-nonsense fashion. However, even if the setting is unfamiliar, the behaviour itself is recognisable to anyone who's ever walked down a pedestrianized high street.
</li><li> There are even some episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> that get in on this. Homer makes fun of all the people imploring him to love his neighbor until the two at the end of the line persuade him to join a cult. Another <em>Simpsons</em> episode inverted the trope with two American missionaries in suits showing up in an airport in India and a Hare-Krishna muttering: "Oh, great... Christians."
</li><li> This was parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OsmosisJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OsmosisJones">Osmosis Jones</a></em>, where the Stomach is depicted as an airport full of arrivals. Near the bottom of the escalators where passengers get off are Hair Cell Krishnas. According to the commentary, test audiences got a kick out of them due to how silly they look and act but didn't really understand the reference.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>Inferior Japanese products</strong>: For a few years after World War II, there was the stereotype that any product made in Japan was very cheap and of poor quality. We can see this trope was alive as late as the 70s, (e.g., Miles Monroe shouting "Goddamn Japanese model!" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sleeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sleeper">Sleeper</a></em>). This is even referenced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartIII">Back to the Future Part III</a></em>, where 1955 Doc Brown doesn't seem surprised when a circuit failed since it was made in Japan (Marty then makes it clear that in his time, the best products are actually made in Japan; words that truly shock Doc Brown). Around the 80s, thanks to Japan's economic rise, this image changed, and cutting-edge technology and high quality are usually what people associate with Japanese products. Sure, maybe the idea of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapanTakesOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapanTakesOverTheWorld">Japan Takes Over the World</a> was a li'l too much, but it is still regarded as a super-power that excels in a lot of industries, specially cars and electronic devices.
<ul><li> In his book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveBarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveBarry">Dave Barry</a> Does Japan</em>, Dave expounds on this idea (<a class="urllink" href="http://www.sdss.jhu.edu/~szgyula/szabolcs/davebarr.htm">excerpt here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>) with "Back then, of course, we thought all Japanese products were cheap... The suggestion that Japan could make real cars would have been laughable." He then describes how slowly more and more quality Japanese products were being imported until it was too late and Americans were hooked.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodOmens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodOmens">Good Omens</a></em> takes advantage of this trope's fall from grace. Newton Pulsifer's car, the Wasabi, was created during the awkward period where Japanese manufacturing was transitioning between the old and new stereotypes. As such, the Wasabi apparently combines the worst aspects of Western cars with a host of spectacular and innovative design failures that made it the perfect template of what <em>not</em> to do going forward for all the major companies.
</li><li> The modern equivalent of this is technology made in China (specifically Hong Kong), where for a long time, products were made so cheaply, with such poor attention to detail, that many Westerners would outright avoid Chinese Manufacturers. This was unfair, as there are good manufacturers in China &mdash; it's just the best workers have worked for Western companies over there due to them being most profitable. The image is starting to improve, with such technology as Huawei phones being popular worldwide, and the low price points being a selling point.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>All Old Folks Like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Matlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Matlock">Matlock</a></strong>: A common joke in sitcoms and stand-up routines was to make fun of how old people like that show. Of course, nowadays is hard to find anyone not only using the joke, but even remembering the show at all. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a>: The elderly audience for the show in the 1990s are mostly dead now.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AlmostLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AlmostLive">Almost Live!</a></em> expanded this to include people in southern King County, which was a predominantly white, blue-collar, working-class area looked down upon as a bunch of uncouth hicks by urban <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Seattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Seattle">Seattle</a> during the show's run.
</li><li> This is a borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> with the old folks in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>. Abe loves the show so much that he demands that the Simpson's home be destroyed in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS6E5SideshowBobRoberts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS6E5SideshowBobRoberts">Sideshow Bob Roberts</a>" because it is blocking the route of the "Matlock Expressway".
<div class="indent"><strong>Lisa:</strong> How can you people turn on snakes after all they've done for you? <br><strong>Grampa:</strong> I'm an old man, I hate everything but <em>Matlock</em>. Ooh, it's on now.
</div></li><li> A bizarre variation of this trope happens in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/HowIMetYourMotherS9E03LastTimeInNewYork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/HowIMetYourMotherS9E03LastTimeInNewYork">Last Time in New York</a>" (originally aired in 2013). In that episode, the actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MandyPatinkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MandyPatinkin">Mandy Patinkin</a> is shown to be like catnip to the elderly, with the mere mention of his name attracting droves of them. The gag is quite similar to the older <em>Matlock</em> jokes, but it remains unclear why Mandy Patinkin of all people would work as a 2010s substitute for Matlock.
</li><li> A similar mentality used to persist regarding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameShow">game shows</a>, but a more youthful approach to the genre over the years (glitzier sets, younger and/or more attractive hosts, physically and/or mentally demanding gameplay formats conducive to 20- to 30-something contestants) has helped put this trope to rest. Also helping was the rise of game shows targeted at children, most notably <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoubleDare1986" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoubleDare1986">Double Dare</a></em>.
</li><li> The parody political cartoons from <em>The Onion</em> have one strip bashing internet-loving teens because "computers don't have Matlock".
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>Surrogate Cool Big Brother</strong>: Characters in anime and manga, that is, older characters who hung around with younger characters who weren't necessarily related to them, but went on exciting adventures with them anyway, were fairly big in the early days of Shonen demographic manga as well as some tokusatsu, such as Goro and Hiroshi in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsMegalon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsMegalon">Godzilla vs. Megalon</a>. This trope was killed for twofold reasons: The changing family dynamic in Japanese culture after the 70s were over, and the fact that adult men hanging around child characters in dangerous situations constantly is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt">frowned upon heavily</a>. In addition, the character dynamics of many, such as the aforementioned Goro and Hiroshi, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation">simply leads modern audiences</a> to think that the "big bros" are simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">a gay couple with an adopted child</a>. If this ever shows up in a modern work, expect the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdorablyPrecociousChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdorablyPrecociousChild">kid to be more mature</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">than the adult(s)</a>.
<p></p></li><li> <strong>The Fox Network as "a hard-core sex channel" (in the words of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">Marge Simpson</a>)</strong>: Well into the 1990s, media commentators would commonly refer to "the Fox edge" &mdash; the willingness of the "fourth" network owned by Rupert Murdoch to air programming depicting sex, violence, and general antisocial behavior with a frankness hitherto not seen on American television. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren">Married... with Children</a></em> set the template in 1987 with the sociopathic Bundy family, and they were followed soon enough by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> (who themselves weren't above poking fun at this trope). Indeed, later in the '90s when Fox premiered <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllyMcBeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllyMcBeal">Ally McBeal</a></em> (a show about a quirky female attorney), they joked that for once they were going to focus on a woman's mind instead of her body. Although by then, NBC and to a lesser extent ABC began relaxing their S&amp;Ps regarding sex, and CBS (the network most traditionally associated with "family values") caught up in terms of sensationalism in the early 2000s, primarily with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor">Survivor</a></em> (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a> for all the reality shows that followed), and after hitting a nadir in the mid-late 2000s, Fox toned down these aspects in tune with its competitors. Add to that how premium cable and on-demand services go even further than broadcast TV ever can, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny">how its earlier series seem less risqu&eacute; as time goes on</a>. The notoriously right-wing stance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FoxNewsChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FoxNewsChannel">Fox News Channel</a> has also made Fox's former image a little ironic (even though its commentators are more often hawkish or fiscally conservative, not puritanically conservative).
<p></p></li><li> <strong>Gay Men <em>Really</em> Love Their Mommies</strong>: In pop culture of decades past, there was a perceived correlation between a man being gay and having a very unhealthy attachment to his mother. Best seen in the novelization and a deleted scene from the movie of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture">Back to the Future</a></em>, where Marty, anticipating what might happen on his date with Lorraine, fears it might turn him gay (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveAGayOldTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveAGayOldTime">the punchline being the Doc being clueless about that usage of the term</a>). The 1990s changed this perception, with really late examples in 1993's <em>The Powers That Be</em>, in which the senator's illegitimate daughter, upon learning that a guest likes long walks on the beach with his mother, immediately asks if he's gay, and an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackBooks">Black Books</a></em> from 2000 where Fran, on a date with a closeted gay man, uses the fact that he calls his mother frequently as supporting evidence of his homosexuality. Now, this trope is so far forgotten that the writer of <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_22820_6-inappropriate-moments-wisely-cut-from-famous-movies_p2.html">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked">Cracked</a> article expresses genuine confusion in his discussion of the deleted <em>BTTF</em> scene.
<ul><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCritic">The Critic</a></em> has Duke assuming Jay is close to his mother, because he's gay. He isn't, and he <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother">isn't</a></em>.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <strong>The Check's In the Mail</strong>: Once a valid excuse as to why a debt for a loan or service has not been paid, it later evolved into jokes about said excuses. The joke was, of course, "the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnailMail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnailMail">mail is slow</a>, blame them". As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">technology improved</a> and the internet took off, however, there were numerous ways to transfer money instantly. As such, a "check's in the mail" joke is almost never used now.
<p></p></li><li> <strong>New fathers</strong>: Pacing anxiously in the waiting room as their wives are in labor and delivery. Most new fathers are right in there beside Mama these days, watching it happen. Also, no more gazing through the big glass window, with all the other new fathers, asking each other "Which one is yours?" Modern hospitals room the little sweeties in with the mothers, where dads and grandparents can visit. Only babies needing special care stay in the nursery, and for security and privacy reasons, viewing of the newborn nursery is no longer open to outsiders.
<p></p></li><li> <strong>Ringing twice</strong>: The practice of dialing someone's phone number, waiting for the phone to ring exactly once, hanging up, then immediately calling the same number again. This was done as a way to let the person receiving the call know that it was someone they knew on the other end of the line. It was common practice to let someone know you were going to do this beforehand, and the phrase "I'll ring you twice" was found as late as the 1990s in fiction. The advent of Caller ID <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeBreaker">killed the need to ring twice</a>, and the practice disappeared from fiction as a result.
<p></p></li><li> <strong>Thin Envelope, Thick Envelope</strong>: In stories where characters are applying to colleges, a bit of old lore is sometimes mentioned that a college acceptance letter will be nice and fat, containing all manner of information for the prospective student. A rejection letter, on the other hand, will usually be very thin as all the information required is a form letter informing the applicant of rejection. While this chestnut certainly did hold a certain amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> at one time, in the 21st century this has become less and less common as universities are moving towards using less paper and relying more on the Internet and other paperless methods to distribute information. Likewise, this trope is likely to continue to become used even less than it had been previously.
<p></p></li><li> <strong>Personal Computers Are Useless</strong>: The early years of personal computing had hobbyists and professionals being the focus of marketers and developers. Thus, we have the idea in fiction that a computer is little more than an overpriced, useless gizmo that does little more than simple mathematical calculations, and that people bought them not for their usefulness, but as status symbols. The period of time before graphic user interfaces also had them being incredibly hard to use, and jokes were often made to the expense of their limited application (balancing bank accounts, writing notes, keeping time). Of course, as personal computers grew in popularity, their utility became obvious... but that trope might be making a comeback as smartphones replace traditional computers in ease of use.
<p></p></li><li> <strong>Nuclear war</strong>: A big preoccupation of popular culture through the eighties was the idea that the US and the USSR would fight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII">World War III</a> with nuclear weapons, leading to massive destruction or perhaps even the annihilation of of life on earth. At the very least, a city that mattered to the writers would be nuked. When the Soviet Union collapsed, so did this trope.
