</p><p>In modern times, the term "star-crossed" is often unknowingly misused to mean lovers who are meant to be together. It means just the opposite&mdash;the stars (i.e. destiny or the heavens) have ruled <em>against</em> them, or "crossed" their plan. Compare the word <a class="urllink" href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=disaster">"disaster"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, which has the etymology "away; without" ("dis") + "star; planet" ("aster"). Then again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenThePlanetsAlign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenThePlanetsAlign">if the stars rule that much</a>, they probably decreed the love as well as the impossibility, making the stars capricious and cruel at the very least. It also refers to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo">destiny</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateDrivesUsTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateDrivesUsTogether">the inevitability of the two characters' paths crossing each other</a>. It usually, but not always, refers to unlucky outcomes, since Romeo and Juliet's affair ended tragically. Furthermore, it may connote that the lovers entered into their union without sufficient forethought or preparation, that they did not have adequate knowledge of each other, or that they were not thinking rationally (because they were being controlled by fate).

While it's difficult even today to have a relationship with someone from a very different background, in the old days, it was all but impossible: if you were from the lower class and courted your "better", you'd be treated with the vilest contempt and risk arrest and/or violence (possibly even death); meanwhile, a "better" who reciprocated would be disowned and possibly shut off in a nunnery, a monastery&mdash;or even an asylum.

The accepted practice for someone in love with a royal, at least in contemporary fiction, was to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtlyLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtlyLove">express that love through loyalty and duty</a> rather than presume to have a romantic relationship with them.

There are either natural disasters or human interventions that prevent him from reaching her, even during the times she <em>is</em> shown noticing him. It isn't until the current day, inside a convenience store at a gas station, that the same man we saw in all of these other time periods takes down an Axe product. He uses some body spray on himself and the long-pursued girl immediately is at his side. They leave together and, as they walk away, a truck crashes into the gas pumps and the station explodes: the intervention of the Axe product prevented another act of fate from keeping them apart.

<ul><li> A recurring theme of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MakotoShinkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MakotoShinkai">Makoto Shinkai</a>'s works:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VoicesOfADistantStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VoicesOfADistantStar">Voices of a Distant Star</a></em> features an almost literal example of this. The two main characters are light-years apart due to her fighting in space, and due to mankind having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel">Faster-Than-Light Travel</a> without a corresponding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubspaceAnsible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubspaceAnsible">Subspace Ansible</a>, her messages to him take years to reach; in the final act now-20 something him is receiving messages from still-15 her and as he remarks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, a message travel time of years might as well be forever. That said, the very last scene contains blink and you miss it allusions, made explicit in the manga adaptation, to his joining the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceNavy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceNavy">Space Navy</a> gearing up for a rescue mission, meaning there might be a chance they could get together after all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ThePlacePromisedInOurEarlyDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ThePlacePromisedInOurEarlyDays">The Place Promised in Our Early Days</a></em>: Hiroki and Sayuri struggle with their feelings for each other because the latter disappeared from the former's life and, by the time he finds her again years later, she is in a coma. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Even after she is awoken, she loses her memories of her romantic feelings for him. He vows to start over from the beginning and try to make it work; whether it does, we don't get to find out.</span>
</li><li> Takaki and Akari in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FiveCentimetersPerSecond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FiveCentimetersPerSecond">5 Centimeters per Second</a></em> are an interesting example; their parents' moving for work means they keep getting separated and their relationship unravels over the years as communication slows and ceases, but they still have <em>marginally</em> more of a chance at a happy ending than most examples. As far as poor Kanae is concerned, this too applies; after struggling with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut">Cannot Spit It Out</a> for much of the second act, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnguishedDeclarationOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnguishedDeclarationOfLove">Anguished Declaration of Love</a> is interrupted by the much-foreshadowed rocket launch and she decides to let it be instead, but the manga ending suggests that she eventually meets Takaki again and tries her luck once more.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheGardenOfWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheGardenOfWords">The Garden of Words</a></em>, not only is there a sizeable age gap between Takao and Yukari, but also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the potential ethical issues of a teacher-student romance; at the end, Yukari moves away to take up a new teaching position, but the possibility still exists that they might reunite in the future.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YourName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YourName">Your Name</a></em> carries on the tradition; not only are Taki and Mitsuha separated by spatial distance, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but by time and death too; in Taki's original timeline, the passing comet Tiamat - an almost literal falling star - 3 years ago split off a meteor that killed Mitsuha. That said, by the end of the film, they finally reunite, with the strong implication that they get together at last.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WeatheringWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WeatheringWithYou">Weathering With You</a></em> has Hodaka Morishima and Hina Amano. To elaborate, Hodaka is a runaway from an upper middle class family that physically abuses him and Hina is an atmokinetic pauper. What's more is that they're both living in Tokyo, which is doomed to sink from constant rainfall. The story also follows suit from two different angles: The first is the police trying to send Hodaka back to his island home while social services are trying to take Hina and her brother Nagi in due to their orphan status. The second is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hina's fate as the sunshine girl to be sacrificed in exchange for stable weather.</span> In the end, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">this is subverted; Hodaka rescues Hina heedless of the cost, and despite being caught and sent back to finish his high schooling afterwards, they eventually reunite.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Two of Adachi Mitsuru's manga series feature romances forbidden by feuding parents. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Rough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Rough">Rough</a></em>, the parents run rival confectionery businesses. In <em>Katsu!</em>, the fathers are former boxing rivals. In both cases, the girl's father is more rabid than the boy's father.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hiromi Oka and Coach Jin Munakata</span> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AimForTheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AimForTheAce">Aim for the Ace!</a></em>, mainly due to the fact <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he was dying of leukemia by the time they met and fall in love.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArashiNoYoruNi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArashiNoYoruNi">Arashi no Yoru ni</a></em>, Mei and Gabu seem doomed to part ways because their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance">Interspecies Romance</a> is frowned upon by both their kin. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Averted; they find one another again and stay together in the end.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Basilisk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Basilisk">Basilisk</a></em>, which is essentially a Japanese Tokugawa-era send up of "Romeo and Juliet", has its star crossed lovers: Gennosuke from the Kouga and Oboro from the Iga. They even make reference to the old belief that star-crossed lovers will be reborn as twin siblings.
<ul><li> Also, the beginning of the show shows another pair of star crossed lovers: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Koga Danjou and Iga Ogen, Gennosuke's grandpa and Oboro's grandma respectively.</span>

She dies in childbirth and refuses to become reembodied, and Finw&euml; eventually remarries, which means M&iacute;riel can never return since Elves are strictly monogamist. Finw&euml; is himself killed many years later, however, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy">chooses to remain dead so M&iacute;riel can become reembodied.</a>
<ul><li> Beren and Luthien are a subversion: Beren is a lord among mortal man, Luthien is the half-elven, half-maia (angelic being), princess of Doriath, daughter of Thingol and Melian. Upon first meeting Thingol, Beren swore that "Neither rock, nor steel, nor the fires of Morgoth, nor all the powers of the Elf-kingdoms" can keep him away from Luthien, which Thingol immediately turned into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngagementChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngagementChallenge">Engagement Challenge</a>, and tasked Beren with bringing him one silmaril from the crown of Morgoth (the Tolkienverse's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatanicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatanicArchetype">Satanic Archetype</a>), that the sons of Feanor, the creator of the silmarils, swore a terrible oath to not let anyoneelse, but them possess. Beren and Luthien in the end succeeded, but soon after Beren was killed by Carcharoth, the largest werewolf to ever live. Stricken by grief, Luthien died after him, and her soul went to Mandos, the vala of souls and fates, and she sang him such a beatiful song, it moved his heart, offering her two choices: be reincarnated by herself, and live-on as an elf forever in Valinor, the land of the gods, or be reborn, along with Beren as mortals, and live a short life together in Middle-Earth, and upon dying her soul would leave the world, and go where the souls of men do. She chose the latter. The subversion comes from the implication, that not only was their love destined, it was destined to succeed, since nothing in the world, not even the different afterlives meant for humans and elves, could keep them apart. Furthermore, they should't have been able to meet in the first place: the Girdle of Melian, a protective enchanment, was supposed to keep everyone out of Thingol's kigdom, that he did not allow to enter, and Melian even prophesied that someone sent by a higher power than herself would get around it.
</li><li> Another example in Tolkien's writing: Aegnor and Andreth, an immortal elf lord and a mortal woman. She will eventually grow old and die, while he will continue on, and even if he dies he will only be sent to the Halls of Mandos and eventually reembodied while her spirit will leave the world completely. They never marry, and ironically Aegnor dies long before Andreth does. He refuses to be reembodied because he can't live in a world without Andreth.
</li><li> And, of course, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> sees Aragorn and Arwen in a similar situation: the two do eventually marry (though only after a 39-year wait, and this after 27 years of unrequited love on Aragorn's end), but, of course, Aragorn is mortal; when he dies, Arwen returns to her mother's lands in Lothl&oacute;rien, where she dies of grief and loneliness. Fortunately, since Arwen renounced her immortality (and with it, her place on the last ship to Valinor and presumably her place in the Halls of Mandos), her spirit will leave the world as Aragorn's did; it may even be implied that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TogetherInDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TogetherInDeath">he waited at Cerin Amroth for her</a>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDecemberists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDecemberists">The Decemberists</a>' song "We Both Go Down Together" is about a common girl and a young man of rich means whose parents don't approve of his love to said common girl. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">They solve their problem in the classical manner, if you get my drift</a>.
<ul><li> There's also an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation">alternate lyrical interpretation</a> that takes the unlucky rich kid's somewhat patronising tone and extrapolates that rather than preparing to die <em>with</em> her, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">he's leading her on so he can murder her, possibly for being pregnant with his child.</a>
<ul><li> There's also also the interpretation that the rich male is actually a deluded rapist who believes that they are in love. The rape angle seems to make sense, but the leaving her for being pregnant fits in well with the theory that "We Both Go Down Together" and "Lesley Anne Levine" are interlinked. Possibly it's a bit of both.
</li></ul></li><li> "O Valencia", on the other hand, is spot-on for this trope; in fact, the first bit almost seems lifted from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet">Romeo and Juliet</a></em>: A young mobster (probably son of the Don/Boss/whathaveyou) falls in love with Valencia, the daughter of a rival Don; her sister rats on them; her brother confronts them; Valencia runs to her lover's side just as her brother is shooting, and gets hit instead; she dies in her lover's arms; the lover decides to go on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a>.

</li><li> The song "Barricade" by Stars is occasionally, and erroneously, taken to be about a pair of revolutionary lovers who are torn away from each other by The Man. It's <em>actually</em> about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">a pair of violent football hooligans</a> who are only being kept apart by the fact that one of them grows up and gets a job while the other stays a shiftless thug.

</li></ul></li><li> The song "Que no destrocen tu vida" ("Don't let them tear your life apart") by Los Prisioneros (also covered by La Ley) is about a person whose close friend and said friend's girlfriend are in this situation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">and is telling them to not give up on their relationship.</a>

The trope is even mentioned by name.
</li><li> The German folk song <em>Es fiel ein Reif in der Fr&uuml;hlingsnacht</em> ("A rime (or hoar-frost) fell in the night of spring") frames it succintly in four verses of three lines each: A boy loves a girl, they run away from home and <em>Sie liefen weit ins fremde Land, / Sie hatten weder Gl&uuml;ck noch Stern, / Sie sind verdorben, gestorben.</em> ("They ran far into the strange land, / They had neither fortune nor star, / They perished, they died.")
</li><li> The Finnish <em>P&auml;iv&auml;ns&auml;de ja Mennin&auml;inen</em> ("The Ray of Light and the Goblin") features a feminine mote of light that lingers behind for a little while as the sun sets below the horizon, long enough to have a chance meeting with a troll that rises from his burrow to wander the night. Though even looking at her burns his eyes, he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight">instantly dazzled by her beauty</a>, to the point of immediately proposing to her and offering to live with her down in his cave. She kindly declines, pointing out that the darkness would kill her - and on that note, that she has to quickly leave and follow the sun and her sisters before succumbing to the night. She is left pondering this encounter as the song ends, suggesting that the attraction was mutual to an extent.
</li><li> The Italian folk song <em>'O surdato 'nnammurato</em> (The Soldier in Love), is a very good example of this trope and is probably the most famous example of "canzone napoletana" - to the point Naples's local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball">football club</a>, SSC Napoli, has adopted it as its unofficial anthem.

</li><li> "Fresh Static Snow" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PorterRobinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PorterRobinson">Porter Robinson</a> is a somewhat more modern take on this, being about two people who could be perfect lovers who are implied to be able to connect with technology, but are ultimately doomed because they still may never meet each other.

</div></li><li> <em>Romeo &amp; Cinderella</em> by Hatsune Miku is about a schoolgirl who meets her boyfriend in secret because her parents don't approve of their relationship.
</li><li> <em>Prisoner</em> by Len Kagamine features a young prisoner who falls in love with a girl who communicates with him by paper planes. The girl eventually goes away on a long trip, during which time the boy is put to death by gas chamber after fighting with the guards; his last words wondering what her name was, as she never told him.

</li><li> The song "Catch the Rainbow" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rainbow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rainbow">Rainbow</a></em>'s debut album tells the story of a romance that's like catching a rainbow: a beautiful thought, but nothing but a dream which will be dispelled by the light of dawn. According to lyricist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RonnieJamesDio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RonnieJamesDio">Ronnie James Dio</a>, it's the story of a princess and a stablehand who meet at night in the stables to make love, despite knowing it can not last between them.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingArthur">Tristan and Iseult</a> (also known as Tristan and Isolde). The legend of Tristan and Iseult is an influential romance and tragedy, retold in numerous sources with as many variations. The tragic story is of the adulterous love between the lovers. The narrative predates and most likely influenced the Arthurian romance of Lancelot and Guinevere, and has had a substantial impact on Western art and literature since it first appeared in the 12th century. While the details of the story differ from one author to another, the overall plot structure remains much the same.
</li><li> Guinevere and Lancelot from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingArthur">Arthurian Legends</a>, which is also a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush">Bodyguard Crush</a>. Some stories have Guinevere not only cheating on Arthur (and Lancelot with Elaine), but have her plotting Arthur's downfall with Mordred. Ouch.
<ul><li> Merlin and Nimueh may or may not count; it certainly does for him, since she winds up locking him in crystal in most incarnations of the legends.

Deirdre, betrothed against her will to King Conchobhar of Ulster, has just reached marriageable age in Iron-Age Ireland (15 for women, 18 for men) when she falls in love with Naoise and they flee Ulster to Scotland with Naoise's brothers to escape the wrath of King Conchobhar. While their romance ends tragically, in some versions they are buried together and in many versions a yew tree grows from each of their graves and twine around each other, so that the lovers are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TogetherInDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TogetherInDeath">Together in Death</a>.
</li><li> Pelleas and Melisande (French: Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande) is a Symbolist play by Maurice Maeterlinck about the forbidden, doomed love of the title characters. A classical myth, was a common subject for art during the Renaissance and Baroque eras.
</li><li> Hero and Leander. It's a Greek myth, relating the story of Hero (Greek: &#7977;&rho;&#974;), a priestess of Aphrodite who dwelt in a tower in Sestos, at the edge of the Hellespont, and Leander (Greek: &Lambda;&#941;&alpha;&nu;&delta;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;, Leandros), a young man from Abydos on the other side of the strait. Leander fell in love with Hero and would swim every night across the Hellespont to be with her. Hero would light a lamp at the top of her tower to guide his way. When Leander drowned during a storm, Hero threw herself off the tower.
<ul><li> The same basic plot is told in the German folk ballad <em>Es waren zwei K&ouml;nigskinder</em> ("There were two royal children"). Here the three candles in the window are extinguished by a "false nun" (who in some versions is a Norn).

In some interpretations, she's seen as an outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbductionIsLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbductionIsLove">kidnapping victim,</a> especially since Aphrodite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods">promised her to Paris WITHOUT caring that she was already married.</a>
</li><li> Orpheus and Eurydice from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology">Greek Mythology</a>. When Orpheus&#146; wife dies from a snake bite on their wedding night, he does what any doting husband would do: he dives down to the depths of the Underworld to rescue her. After hashing things out with Hades, Eurydice is freed on the condition that Orpheus will not look at her until they return to Greece. It shouldn&#146;t come as a surprise that Orpheus fails. His beloved is sent back to the Underworld, leaving Orpheus to wander the countryside. In some versions, such as Gluck's opera <em>Orfeo ed Euridice</em>, Orpheus attempts suicide so he can return to Eurydice forever, only to be talked out of it and for his undying love to be rewarded by Eurydice returning to life anyway.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a> has several: Hero and Leander, Troilus and Cressida, and Aphrodite and Adonis.

As in, he physically holds them apart so they can't touch more than their toes and fingertips. One version has him trying to prevent the birth of the god Set.

</li></ul></li><li> Popocat&eacute;petl and Iztacc&iacute;huatl. It refers to a number of mythical and folkloric explanations of the origins of the volcanoes Popocat&eacute;petl ("the Smoking Mountain") and Iztacc&iacute;huatl ("white woman" in Nahuatl, sometimes called the Mujer Dormida aka "sleeping woman" in Spanish) which overlook the Valley of Mexico.
<ul><li> The most popular version of the myth says that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPrince">the warrior and nobleman</a> Popocat&eacute;petl went to war in Oaxaca to overcome the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalMarriageVeto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalMarriageVeto">Parental Marriage Veto</a> coming from his beloved Princess Iztacc&iacute;huatl's father; however, this was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit">Uriah Gambit</a> from her dad, and when it failed he told his daughter that her beloved boyfriend had died in battle and she succumbed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByDespair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByDespair">Death by Despair</a>. When poor Popocat&eacute;petl returned and found himself in the path of his girlfriend's funeral, he fell in despair and commited suicide on the spot; the Gods then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnowMeansDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnowMeansDeath">covered them in snow</a> and transformed their corpses in mountains, with Popocat&eacute;petl's angry and pained spirit transforming his new rock body into a volcano rather than a simple hill.
</li></ul></li><li> Layla and Majnun (by the Persian poet Nizami Ganjavi). It is a classical Arabian love story. It is based on the real story of a young man called Qays ibn al-Mulawwah from the northern Arabian Peninsula, in the Umayyad era during the 7th century. There were two Arabic versions of the story at the time. In one version, he spent his youth together with Layla, tending their flocks. In the other version, upon seeing Layla he fell passionately in love with her. In both versions, however, he went mad when her father prevented him from marrying her; for that reason he came to be called Majnun Layla, which means "Driven mad by Layla". To him were attributed a variety of incredibly passionate romantic Arabic poems, considered among the foremost examples of the Udhari school.

Star-crossed lovers Zhi Nu and Niu Lang are separated forever across the Milky Way. They may only reunite once a year when magpies form a bridge between them. This is the basis of the Chinese cultural equivalent to Valentine's Day.
<ul><li> <em>Tanabata no Matsuri</em> is the Japanese version, with Orihime and Hikoboshi as the star-crossed lovers.
</li><li> And <em>Chilseok</em> as the Korean version with Jik-nyeo and Gyeonwu.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em>Butterfly Lovers</em> of Chinese folklore, Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai. The Butterfly Lovers is a Chinese legend of a tragic love story of a pair of lovers, Liang Shanbo (&#26753;&#23665;&#20271;) and Zhu Yingtai (&#31069;&#33521;&#21488;), whose names form the title of the story. The title is often abbreviated to Liang Zhu (&#26753;&#31069;) and often regarded as the Chinese equivalent of Romeo and Juliet. The girl, Yingtai, convinces her father to let her disguise herself as a young man in order to attend school. She meets and becomes roommates and best friends with Shanbo, a nerd who doesn't pick up that his roommate is actually a girl. Eventually he figures it out and they fall in love. Unfortunately, Yingtai is betrothed to someone else; Shanbo becomes heartbroken and eventually dies. On her wedding day to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead">Romantic False Lead</a>, Yingtai visits Shanbo's grave.

</li><li> There's a Japanese belief that twins are star-crossed lovers reincarnated.
</li><li> The Spanish version is <em>Los Amantes de Teruel</em>, "The Lovers of Teruel": they were childhood friends but he was poor, she was rich, and he left to fight the Moors and find enough money to be allowed to marry her. When he returned, though, he found that her father had made her marry another man. He tried to get her to kiss him, but when she said she couldn't cheat on her husband no matter how much she loved him, he died of grief.

<ul><li> <em>Rom&eacute;o et Juliette</em> by Gounod is based on Shakespeare's famous play, so of course it deals with this.
<ul><li> Bellini's earlier opera <em>I Capuleti e i Montecchi</em> also tells the same story. However, in this version, Giulietta (Juliet) is engaged to a man named Tebaldo (Tybalt), who completely replaces Paris, but Giulietta is in love with Romeo, who is the leader of the Montecchi (Montagues). Just like Shakespeare's play, Romeo and Giulietta commit suicide at the end.

Violetta, a Parisian courtesan with tuberculosis, falls in love with a Alfredo, a poet, and abandons the world of glamour to live a simple life with him. However, Violetta leaves Alfredo at the request of his father Giorgio, resulting in Alfredo (who knows nothing about this) humiliating her at a party and then being shouted down by Giorgio. Eventually, Violetta's TB worsens, but she and Alfredo manage to reunite before she dies.

After Cavaradossi is arrested for hiding a political prisoner, the corrupt Scarpia forces Tosca to reveal the prisoner's hiding place by torturing Cavaradossi, which results in her lover's anger and political gloating before he is led to execution. Scarpia then gives Tosca the ultimatum that if she sleeps with him, he'd let her lover go. However, despite Tosca killing Scarpia, it turned out that he lied and Cavaradossi ends up killed, so Tosca also commits suicide to avoid arrest.

Enrico tries to force Lucia into marrying his ally Arturo after Edgardo leaves for France, but it ultimately culminates in Lucia going mad, murdering Arturo, babbling and singing madly in front of Enrico and others, and then dying of said madness. When Edgardo finds out, he commits suicide out of grief.
</li><li> Debussy's opera <em>Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande</em> tells the story of M&eacute;lisande, a young woman married to Prince Golaud, who falls in love with her husband's half-brother Pell&eacute;as. Naturally, this results in Golaud using their child to spy on the two lovers, and ends with Pell&eacute;as being killed by Golaud and M&eacute;lisande dying after giving birth to their daughter.

In the end, Rusalka is condemned to be a demon of death at the bottom of the lake, while the Prince dies after accepting Rusalka's kiss.

</li><li> This can happen all over the place in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>, unavoidably if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a male PC romances Morrigan, and possible if any PC takes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> at the end after pursuing any romance - or if Alistair takes it after <em>being</em> romanced</span>. There are also the origins - the City Elf will have to leave their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> candidate (and regardless of what <em>they</em> may have thought of them, said potential spouse seems to have a definite attraction to them), this comes into obvious play on at least one end (the other, of course, depending on whatever the player thinks their Warden feels) for the female Dalish Elf, and mage-hating Cullen has a crush on the female mage that, needless to say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">doesn't go too well for him</a>. Not to mention <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jowan and Lily, also appearing in the Mage origin</span>. To prove how prevalent this is, the dwarf noble origin can have it too, with a female PC and her second, Gorim. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This is portrayed as an established but probably ultimately doomed relationship, due to the nature of the dwarven caste system.</span>
<ul><li> Yeah, all of the Origin Story "romances" are doomed to fail. Let's see...
<ul><li> In the Human Noble origin, you can choose to have a sexual encounter with one of two certain characters. Regardless of which one of them you choose, they will be brutally slaughtered when the castle is ambushed that same night.
</li><li> In the Dwarf Noble origin, there appears to be something intimate going on between the female player and Gorim, seeing as the player has several suggestive dialogue options with him. But it is made fairly clear that they cannot marry because he is of a lesser caste. Later in the game the player can find him in Denerim, only to discover that he has already married another woman and is expecting a child with her, and he breaks off the relationship for good. A male player, on the hand, has the option of having a sexual encounter with two "noble hunting" women during the origin story; but it's quite clear that these ladies only want to sleep with him because of his status, for their own personal gain, because they want to have his child so that they can live in the palace. Gets even <em>more</em> star-crossed by the fact that if the player does choose to sleep with them, one of them <em>does</em> end up having his baby, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> because he got himself exiled the day after he slept with her, and because a child inherits their status from their same-sex parent</span>, the child is casteless and when the player encounters her again later in the game, she bitches at him and blames him for her misery and accuses him of ruining her life and all that. Go figure.
</li><li> In the City Elf origin, you're being forced to get married, but then a drunken human noble lord comes and ruins your wedding and kidnaps the women. If your character is female, then your fiance ends up being murdered by the lord's men. If your character is male, your fiancee ends up rejecting you after you rescue her from being raped and likely killed, claiming that "Grey Wardens can't have wives or families."
</li><li> In the Mage origin, it is quite obvious that the templar Cullen is infatuated with the female player, although if the player tries to proposition him for sex he'll get incredibly nervous and run away. Later in the game, when the templars are overthrown and the tower is taken over by rebellious blood mages, the player will find that Cullen is the <em>only</em> templar on the upper floors who has not been slaughtered - when the female mage player finds him again, he will outright reveal his infatuation for her, but because of the psychological torture he has endured, he has developed a burning, immense hatred for all mages and pretty much rejects the player because he doesn't care for her anymore, though in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> he gets better will speak wistfully of the Human Mage Warden.
</li><li> The Dalish Elf origin has, perhaps, the most heartbreaking conclusion. It ends with Tamlen missing and the player joining the Wardens. Later, during the Shriek attack on the camp, you find out that Tamlen has become a ghoul, someone corrupted by the darkspawn. He confesses his love to the female Dalish elf before she is forced to kill him.

The rulers of these two islands, the cello queen of symphony and the saxophone king of jazz, are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudingFamilies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudingFamilies">each disdainful of the other</a>; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlobsVersusSnobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlobsVersusSnobs">the king views classical music as highbrow and the queen sees jazz as lowbrow</a>. However, their respective children, the saxophone prince and the violin princess have fallen in love with each other, which leads to the prince being imprisoned by the queen and eventually an all-out war breaking out between the two rival countries. But when their children are both in danger, the feud ends with them all saved and not only their children marrying, but also their respective parents, and a new bridge, the Bridge of Harmony, built to link the two islands together.

</li><li> Steven Monjeza and Tiwonge Chimbalanga in Malawi. Their marriage was annulled because Tiwonge is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">trans woman</a>, they were jailed, then pardoned, then forced to move back to their respective home towns. Steven eventually married another woman.
</li><li> Peter Townsend (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho">no, not that one</a>) and Princess Margaret of Great Britain. Townsend was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Ace Pilot</a> and war hero, having flown Hurricane in the Battle Of Britain, and clearly had deserved the hand of princess and half the domain. Queen Elizabeth said "no" for their marriage; Townsend was a divorcee, and the Abdication still hung over the Royal Family. That broke the hearts of both. Townsend later revealed Margaret was his only true love.
</li><li> Jose Rizal and Leonor Rivera who are first cousins. When Rizal traveled overseas to pursue studies, the two kept on sending letters to each other, hiding coded messages since both their parents do not approve of their relationship (partly because Rizal is wanted by the Spanish authorities.) Leonor continued to be faithful to Rizal for six years despite not seeing him (and probably not knowing that Rizal had affair with numerous foreign women.) Rizal tried to marry her many times but their meeting is always prevented by their parents. In the end, Leonor was forced to marry an Englishman. The leading characters who are lovers in Rizal's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NoliMeTangere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NoliMeTangere">Noli Me Tangere</a></em>, Crisostomo Ibarra and Maria Clara, are inspired by the situation between him and Leonor Rivera.

As they attempted to cross the bridge over the Miljacka River, they were both fatally injured by snipers; Bosko died instantly, Admira crawled to his corpse and died next to him.

They met at the end of the war when he was sent to interrogate her father, they fell in love and lived together for a while until he was sent back to Russia. (Additionally, party officials told him he could be sent to a gulag if he did not end the relationship.) They managed to meet again 60 years later, now 80 and married to other people, and they decided to move in together, leaving their respective spouses.
</li><li> Mark Antony and Cleopatra.
</li><li> Either this or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicBromance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicBromance">Tragic Bromance</a> took place between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrederickTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrederickTheGreat">Frederick the Great</a> and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">best friend/possible lover</a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Hermann_von_Katte">Lieutenant Hans Hermann von Katte<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. They were inseparable despite their eight-year age-gap, to the point that they were rumored to <em>actually</em> be lovers by other Prussian nobles. Then-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelPrince">Rebel Prince</a> Frederick intended to run away from Prussia to Great Britain to get away from his abusive father, King Frederick William I, and Katte decided to help him. After the two were caught and imprisoned, the King was about to execute them both, but ultimately decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithhisHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithhisHead">have Katte beheaded</a> while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch">forcing Frederick to watch from a nearby window.</a> Frederick was about to fall into despair and tried to apologize, but Katte <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceDeathWithDignity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceDeathWithDignity">calmly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoOutWithASmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoOutWithASmile">smiled</a> and told him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamousLastWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamousLastWords">"For the sake of such a gentle prince, death is sweet!"</a> before being executed. Frederick was so broken after this that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">he was unconcious for at least three days</a> and, after waking up, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMourningAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMourningAfter">never spoke about Katte again</a>. It's speculated that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFirstCutIsTheDeepest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFirstCutIsTheDeepest">this ordeal</a> was at least one of the reasons why Frederick <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelibateHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelibateHero">never married and sired heirs.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HansChristianAndersen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HansChristianAndersen">Hans Christian Andersen</a> and opera singer Jenny Lind are said to have lived after this trope. Andersen developed feelings for her, but was nervous, clumsy and shy, and Jenny Lind was equally shy in private. Andersen wrote a number of letters to her, and their entire correspondence was later published, showing a sweet, caring friendship that never led to anything, because they were apart on journeys. Andersen saw to it that his travels matched hers to the best of his ability, and they had at least one new years eve together, but she married another man and died early. Andersen never forgot her. She always addressed him as her "dear brother", by the way, and Andersen left at least two stories devoted to her: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNightingale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNightingale">The Nightingale</a></em> is the most known. It refers to Jenny&acute;s nickname <em>The Swedish Nightingale</em>. <em>Under The Pine Tree</em> tells the story of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriendRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriendRomance">Childhood Friend Romance</a> that ends badly for the male protagonist. The girl in the story is named Johanne (which was Jenny&acute;s original name).
</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huisheng">Aisin-Gioro Huisheng<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was a Chinese noblewoman, daughter of Pujie (the younger brother of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastEmperor">Puyi, the Last Emperor of China</a>) and a Japanese woman, Aisin-Gioro Hiro (maiden name, Saga Hiro). In 1943, she was sent to Japan to live with her maternal grandparents and study there. She eventually met fellow student &#332;kubo Takemichi, son of a railway executive... but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalMarriageVeto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalMarriageVeto">her mother Hiro strongly opposed</a>, as Huisheng was considered as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">a potential bride</a> for future Emperor Akihito. &#332;kubo and Huisheng disappeared on 4 December 1957 and were found dead on Mount Amagi; Huisheng was found wearing a gold ring on her finger, laid with her head cradled in &#332;kubo's left arm, while &#332;kubo held a pistol in his right hand. Above their heads was a twisted piece of tissue paper containing snips of their hair and fingernails &#150; an element in the ritual of a Japanese love suicide. Huisheng and &#332;kubo's ashes were interred together at &#332;kubo's father's request; years later, Huisheng's ashes were taken to her family plot in Shimonoseki.
</li><li> In the German Empire, the ruling House of Hohenzollern had a rivalry with the House of Hannover ever since Prussia annexed Hannover in 1866. The engagement of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Victoria_Louise_of_Prussia">Victoria Louise<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, daughter of Kaiser Wilhelm II, and Ernest Augustus, heir to Hannover, was reported in the press to be a real life Romeo and Juliet, and their courtship was able to smooth things over between the two families. Their wedding was one of the last great social occasions in Europe before the outbreak of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>.
