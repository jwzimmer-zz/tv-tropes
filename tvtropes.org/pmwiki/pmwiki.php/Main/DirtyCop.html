<ul><li> Akai and Kanie from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Kite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Kite">Kite</a></em> use their status as homicide detectives to lead the investigation of a series of professional murders away from the true criminals. They are also the <em>employers</em> of the true criminals. And that's not all they're mixed up in, either. Akai in particular when it's revealed that he's been <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">raping and brainwashing Sawa, one of the child assassins he and Kanie employ</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a></em>:
<ul><li> It's quite plausible that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Triad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Triad">Triad</a> leader Mr. Chang was one of these as a cop. Chang is a darker take on several John Woo characters, but his past as a cop seems to allude to Tequila from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HardBoiled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HardBoiled">Hard Boiled</a></em>. Since Tequila fought gangsters and Chang is one, it stands to reason that he wasn't that honest of a cop.
</li><li> Chief Watsup, the Chief of Police in Roanapur. Not only on the take from the various cartels that run the city but has also used his authority to get an unfair advantage when collecting bounties put out by the cartels.
</li><li> When Revy was a girl living in a slum, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a cop apprehended her for the sole purpose of beating her up and then raping her</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Ginza of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpeedGrapher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpeedGrapher">Speed Grapher</a></em> is mostly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RabidCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RabidCop">Rabid Cop</a>, given her habit of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality">self-defensing</a>" people (she actually uses it as a verb), but she's kind of a dirty cop as well. She's shown essentially committing insider trading based on the crimes going on, and because of her jealousy of Kagura, she abuses her authority to obstruct Saiga, the hero. By the end of the series, she has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">Heel Realization</a> and ends up a better person.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MadBull34" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MadBull34">Mad Bull 34</a></em> is a bizarre example &mdash; as part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuddyCopShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuddyCopShow">Buddy Cop Show</a> dynamic, Officer "Sleepy" John Estes takes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Cowboy Cop</a>'s tendency to see justice done through venues outside the law to the extreme. He's running prostitution in his neighborhood, because the way he sees it, that stuff will always be there, and at least if he's in charge, he can keep it from getting out of hand and it keeps the girls safe. That said, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's all part of a larger <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a></span>. He's also <em>really</em> good at killing criminals. You won't want to watch him work, but you can't imagine what the city would be like without him.
</li><li> The title characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir">Noir</a></em> kill a few of these over the course of the series.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> pilot, the Inspector and his subordinate turn out to be one, killing Takashi, stealing the painting, and framing Naruto for both.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster">Monster</a></em> has two of these: the two detectives who are hired by Johan to kill Nina's adopted parents and the ones from Prague, Commissioner Hamrlik, Chief Detective Batella, and Detective Janacek.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NerimaDaikonBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NerimaDaikonBrothers">Nerima Daikon Brothers</a></em>, Gadget Detective Yukika tries to catch the eponymous group by cooking up a rumor that the chief of police is in league with the yakuza, and the money from their dirty deals is in a vault under the station, knowing they'll fall right into her trap. However, when the NDB tunnel in, they find that the chief of police actually <em>is</em> in league with the yakuza, much to Yukika's surprise.
</li><li> In the manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FAKE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FAKE">FAKE</a></em>, during Dee's backstory <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">we learn that the man Dee considered as his adoptive father <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">was a dirty cop</a>, and Dee resolved to become a better cop than he ever was.</span>
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gangsta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gangsta">Gangsta.</a></em>, crooked cops like Chad and Cody are honestly some of the most good-hearted people around. Yeah, they hire mercenaries to slaughter local troublemakers for the placation of powerful Mafia families, but at least they're doing so to keep the peace and prevent widespread slaughter. Less noble policemen are noted to accept bribes and clean-up unwanted corpses.
</li><li> Technically, he was a correction officer, not a cop, but if anyone in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em> qualifies, it was Takasu. Among the unpleasant tropes that could be applied to him were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully">The Bully</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain">Politically Incorrect Villain</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadLiar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadLiar">Bad Liar</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoreLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoreLoser">Sore Loser</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatersNeverProsper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatersNeverProsper">Cheaters Never Prosper</a>. In fact, he was such scum <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that his boss (Rex Godwin, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the first season) was disgusted with him, and fired him after his brutal treatment of inmates became known.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> naturally has a few in the Marines who extort their power over people, such as Nezumi in the <em>Arlong arc</em>, who is taking bribes from the titled villain to keep the Marines from answering the island's call for help, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vergo, a lackey of Doflamingo who infiltrated the Marines to cover Doflamingo's operations. He even made <em>Vice-Admiral</em>.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HeavyObject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HeavyObject">Heavy Object</a></em> a military unit checking ships for contraband was bribed to ignore a human trafficking ring.
<ul><li> An entire unit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePoliticalOfficer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePoliticalOfficer">Black Uniforms</a> was supporting a drug war against a foreign nation. As they conduct checks for contraband, the unit could give a clean report on the drug shipments and prevent any additional searches. When one shipment was discovered by ordinary soldiers the unit planned to incinerate them along with the evidence.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureVentoAureo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureVentoAureo">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Vento Aureo</a></em> has Leone Abbacchio. Before he became a member of Passione, he was a cop that became disillusioned by his job and began to take bribes. It came back to bite him later when one of the men he accepted a bribe from later shot and killed his partner.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter">City Hunter</a></em>: There are quite a few cops that work with the Yakuza. Also, Saeko: she may be an honest and competent cop, but, as pointed out by her sister Reika in one memorable occasion, Ryo is a criminal (and she had a few troubles for helping him when another cop decided to take down City Hunter), and she also helped to frame a terrorist for a murder he didn't commit.
</li><li> Dirty cops are omnipresent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em>. Jet Black was originally a cop but quit the force after a hit on him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> by his own partner</span> that was taken out because he was basically the only cop in the unit that <em>wasn't</em> dirty.
</li><li> The titular main character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kurokochi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kurokochi">Kurokochi</a></em>. Inspector Kurokochi is an incredibly corrupt policeman who knows every dirty secret in his prefecture, allowing him to blackmail pretty much all local politicians. They all reluctantly bribe him, and he's become quite wealthy as a result. However, he has a redeeming quality in that he also uses his influence to help bring corrupt politicians to justice.

This becomes a major plot point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GothamCentral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GothamCentral">Gotham Central</a></em>, a series set within the Major Crimes Unit of the GCPD, the only consistently honest branch of the department. Since its members are all personally selected by Gordon, they have a modicum of integrity and competence, but the universal corruption of the rest of their force makes even their simplest of cases difficult since the other units are stealing evidence, accepting bribes, and often committing the crimes themselves. This comes to a head in the <em>Corrigan</em> story arcs, where Jim Corrigan<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0yck3');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0yck3" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0yck3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSpectre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSpectre">that one</a></span> (<em>the</em> dirty cop of the series) is selling evidence on the black market, redistributing the heroin that is collected by the narcotics unit, and eventually starts personally murdering other cops that are trying to stop him. At the end of the series, though everybody <em>knows</em> he did it, his web of corruption <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadCopIncompetentCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadCopIncompetentCop">has spread so far</a> that the case against him is sabotaged and he gets off <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">completely free</a></em> until Infinite Crisis Aftermath, where it comes back to bite him in the ass. The one-time Internal Affairs and the MCU are actually able to build a case against him, they have to compromise their morals and let him go to save one of their own.
</li><li> Even the DCAU isn't immune. Harvey Bullock may have been more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Cowboy Cop</a> most of the time, but everyone agrees he went too far when he gave one of his Mafia connections information on a man in witness protection so they would kill him. The man in question shot Commissioner Gordon, but still. In his pre-Crisis origin, Bullock <em>was</em> a dirty cop, on orders from the mayor to sabotage Gordon's career, but then came to respect him.
</li><li> Bl&uuml;dhaven was even worse than Gotham. Criminals there who <em>didn't</em> share the profits from their crimes with the police were murdered. The police chief placed a bounty on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing">Nightwing</a>'s head. The only truly honest cop &mdash; technically &mdash; in Bludhaven was Nightwing himself, who, in his Dick Grayson identity, joined the force in order to bring it down. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(The city was eventually destroyed when the Secret Society of Super-Villains dumped the monstrous Chemo into the place; Nightwing, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries">Robin</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2000">Batgirl</a> survived because they were lucky enough to be out of town at the time, and Tarantula was later shown alive, and but pretty much most of the other residents weren't so lucky.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BatmanZeroYear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BatmanZeroYear">Batman: Zero Year</a></em>, Bruce assumes the <em>entire</em> GCPD is dirty; no exceptions. After all, when he was a kid, he got taken home in a police car and saw a young Jim Gordon get "given" the trenchcoat he always wears. He thought this showed everyone liked the police and only realised the truth later. (He later learns that Gordon keeps the coat as a reminder that it's easy to give in to corruption if you don't keep your guard up.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedRobin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedRobin">Red Robin</a></em> the murderous blackmailing GCPD detectives Roman Cavallo and Marcus Wise hire an assassin to kill Tim Drake when they realize he's going to publicly reveal them during a press conference for an outreach program he's overseeing. Tim was anticipating it though since he'd been researching their criminal activities and looking for a way to actually get them imprisoned despite their connection since he was still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries">Robin</a>.
</li><li> The <em>Batman Confidential</em> story arc "Wrath Child" reveals that the original Wrath's father, who alongside his wife was killed in a firefight with a young Jim Gordon, was one of the corrupt cops in the GCPD and that to save his own ass and that of his fellow corrupt cops, a then-Captain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanYearOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanYearOne">Gillian Loeb</a> covered up the incident and forced Gordon to go to Chicago.

</li><li> Dirty Cops are a big factor in Frank Castle becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a>. The criminals who killed his family worked for the Costa family, and Frank was able to identify every one perfectly; unfortunately, the cops &mdash; at least the ones he went to &mdash; were clearly being bought by said mob. (This is also a big reason why the Costa family is no longer a presence in the Marvel New York underworld; he went after them <em>first</em>.)

The FBI yearly analysis lists Hub City's police department as the most corrupt department in the country, and even the honest cops currently trying to improve the department have a bad history; the current straight-arrow chief only became a crusader for integrity because of what he encountered when he was out shaking down local criminals and businesses for the bribes they owed him.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstroCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstroCity">Astro City</a></em> "Dark Ages" story arc, Charles' partner Lannie takes weekly bribes from the criminals to overlook their activities.

The Archies are forced to do a concert to pay the fine, but manage to get back at the sheriff when Veronica spots her uncle, the state governor, in the audience, and tricks the sheriff into making an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngineeredPublicConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngineeredPublicConfession">Engineered Public Confession</a> while Uncle George is listening.

(<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, see below.)
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> series, this trope used to be endemic in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Ankh-Morkpork's</a> City Watch, but under its current leadership, the force has become much more professional.
<ul><li> The Watch's current Commander, Samuel Vimes, comes down heavily on major abuses such as corruption, but grudgingly lets smaller offenses of the free doughnut/pint/meal variety slide as a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessarilyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessarilyEvil">Necessarily Evil</a> because they often lead to useful information. He absolutely won't condone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality">Police Brutality</a>, though (however, he might <em>fake</em> it as a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpSweating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpSweating">Perp Sweating</a>), and has a reputation for being absolutely incorruptible, with attempts at bribery being a personal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a>: in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTruth">The Truth</a></em>, Mr. Slant, Ankh-Morpork's chief lawyer (and a zombie) remarks that the last person who tried to bribe Vimes "still does not have full use of his fingers."
<ul><li> For Vimes himself, being bribed is not the main problem; rather, he has to fight the temptation to go full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Cowboy Cop</a> &mdash; he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeLawfulOrGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeLawfulOrGood">views justice as "protecting the innocent"</a> rather than "obeying the law", but he's also perfectly aware that thinking like that/going outside the law can lead down some very dark paths, and purposefully uses the law as his personal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChain">Morality Chain</a> to control his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a> and ensure that he remains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFettered">The Fettered</a>. When Vimes <em>does</em> let 'the Beast' off the chain, he's proved to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">Implacable Man</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> capable of killing werewolves with his bare hands. Vimes is quietly terrified of succumbing to 'the Beast,' and the conflict between his 'stay within the law' and 'clean up the world' instincts is key to the plot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MenAtArms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MenAtArms">Men at Arms</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld">Night Watch</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Thud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Thud">Thud!</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Snuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Snuff">Snuff</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys">Sergeant Colon and Nobby Nobbs</a> are benign versions of this trope. Colon is the sort who will clamp the wheels of a bunch of horse carts next to a restaurant on trumped-up parking violations, in hopes that its owner will offer him a meal to deal with the problem, and maybe give some useful information while Colon eats. Nobbs is prone to petty theft of anything lying around, but a decent person aside from that &mdash; as Vimes notes, Nobby has "a criminal mind, not a criminal soul." These attitudes wouldn't be tolerated in the modern Watch, but Vimes keeps Colon and Nobbs on for a number of reasons: their experience and knowledge of the city and ability to read it is second only to that of Vimes himself (and possibly Carrot), their use as teachers for young Watchmen, their long service and old friendship, and above all, a shared inexplicable knack for stumbling across vital and useful information.
</li><li> <em>The City Watch Diary 1999</em> has a transcript of a speech by Vimes which gives his definition of a Dirty Cop, and why Colon is on the right side of the line:
<div class="indent">I know all the little tricks, all the caf&eacute;s that&#146;ll feed a copper for free, the places to stand out of the wind, the cushy jobs, the pubs where the uniform will get you a buckshee pint; I know the grease on which this city runs and I know the difference. I also know dishonesty when I see it and if I find you taking bribes your feet will touch the ground because I will cut you off at the knees, believe me.
</div></li><li> Between <em>Night Watch</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MenAtArms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MenAtArms">Men at Arms</a></em>, the Day Watch under "Mayonnaise" Quirke was just another city gang. The Night Watch wasn't even competent enough for that &mdash; and Vimes notes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld">Night Watch</a></em> that even if he stayed in the past and whipped the Night Watch into shape, they'd just be another gang under the corrupt Patrician of the time.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld">Night Watch</a></em>, it is stated that a major part of the reason why "Sammies" &mdash; modern, Vimes-trained Ankh-Morpork Watchmen &mdash; have such a good reputation is that they don't take bribes much, and the ones they <em>do</em> take are never larger than the occasional free pint and/or doughnut, which (as noted above) even Vimes thinks of as part of the grease that keeps the wheels of justice turning.
</li></ul></li><li> In the first book of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEchoCaseFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEchoCaseFiles">The Echo Case Files</a></em> series, the local police department is corrupt from top to bottom. Those cops not taking backhanders from organised crime are involved with a terrorist group.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EddieLaCrosse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EddieLaCrosse">Burn Me Deadly</a></em>, Gary Bunson, Neceda's law officer, is quite open to bribes. However, he's not particularly evil about it &#151; it's driven more by laziness and self-preservation than active greed, and while he's seldom useful, he doesn't do any harm. It briefly looks like he might break this pattern by hanging someone whom Eddie thinks is innocent (or at least, coerced), but it turns out that Gary didn't actually have that one wrong. Eddie still thinks Gary didn't deserve a medal for it, though:
<div class="indent"><strong>Eddie</strong>: Gary, the killer came to you and confessed. You basically did nothing. <br><strong>Gary</strong>: Yes, and I did it with alacrity and tact. I have a parchment that says so. <br><strong>Eddie</strong>: And your conscience is okay with this? <br><strong>Gary</strong>: (<em>trying not to laugh</em>) Eddie, I sold my conscience for a night with a trail whore when I was fifteen. Haven't seen it since, and wouldn't know what to do with it if it turned up. (<em>admires medal</em>). I also got a raise.

Chicago copper Otto Waterhouse accepts a ten-dollar bribe, discreetly wrapped around a sample of the product, to allow the Eris Tomato Juice Company to carry on giving out free samples without a license, immediately outside the convention of a Religious Right <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardian">Moral Guardian</a> group.

They have an established protocol for collecting bribes ("happy bags") from local businesses and will collect personal bribes frequently, but you're only supposed to do it for minor crimes rather than things like murder. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality">Police Brutality</a> is also acceptable (although it's supposed to be limited to the times that you're <em>really sure</em> it will help your inquiries) and Cage Dogs engage in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">Cold-Blooded Torture</a> during interrogations.

By the end of <em>White Jazz,</em> Exley is compromised, essentially having become the counter-<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Smith</span> within the department.

A small-town police department is run by a police chief frustrated about the crime rate and the perception that criminals get off on technicalities, so they kill the suspects after they are freed by the court. At one point, the crooked officers turn things up another notch when they throw a lighted cocktail into a prison bus, killing several prisoners and the guards and badly burning the driver.

<ul><li> The Strike Team can be seen as the poster boys for this trope, with the added twist of half the team (Curtis Lemansky and Ronnie Gardock) being good cops who fell in with the wrong crowd and largely stayed in the shallow part of the corruption pool, and Vic Mackey and Shane Vendrell, who killed fellow police officers in order to cover their own asses when they were in danger of being exposed. They also sell drugs they get from buy-busts, use torture to interrogate suspects and protect drug dealers they can control, all in the name of "keeping the peace". David Aceveda's description of him isn't the page quote for nothing.
</li><li> Captain Aceveda, although initially disgusted by Vic's tactics, sometimes tolerates them as he sees their effectiveness at keeping crime under control. He becomes more and more compromised as he cuts various corners to advance his political career.
</li><li> Claudette looks down on the Strike Team as well, but when she is temporarily put in charge of the barn she reluctantly tolerates their behavior once she realizes she can't get the same results with squeaky clean cops.
</li><li> Dutch is probably the cleanest of the main characters but even he succumbs to temptation, planting evidence in the house of a suspect that he knows, but can't prove, is guilty (although he has a change of heart and returns to remove the evidence before it's discovered).
</li><li> Kavanaugh, an internal affairs lieutenant, is assigned to investigate the Strike Team. He becomes obsessed with bringing down Vic, finally resorting to arranging for a false testimony and planting evidence in an attempt to bring him down.
</li></ul></li><li> Being a bad guy on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Damages" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Damages">Damages</a></em> seems to entitle you to at least one (and usually more than one) corrupt cop/FBI agent on your payroll who is willing to surveil, harass, or murder anyone who bugs you too much.
</li><li> They usually don't actually show up, but the existence of these is sometimes part of the reason why the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictimOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictimOfTheWeek">clients</a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice">Burn Notice</a></em> can't just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless">call the cops</a>. In "Unpaid Debts" they ran afoul of a group of them, and in "Question and Answer" Sam pretended to <em>be</em> one.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlueBloods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlueBloods">Blue Bloods</a></em>:
<ul><li> Danny Reagan is a borderline case. He's not the "plant evidence" or "kill unarmed criminals" type, but he <em>has</em> done illegal things that in real life would get him swiftly terminated from the NYPD, and has faced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">little comeuppance for his behavior</a>. Examples include <em>intentionally</em> stopping a medical tube for an old man because he <em>thought</em> he had information, threatening to put a bullet in the back of a robber's head &mdash; <em>when the said robber was cuffed and unarmed</em>, and putting a suspect in the trunk of his car and driving like crazy to get said suspect to talk. And the list goes on.
</li><li> Season 1 has the Blue Templar, a ring of crooked cops who were engaged in murder, narcotics trafficking, and money laundering. Their leader Sonny Malevski also killed Commissioner Frank Reagan's son Joe when he began to infiltrate them.
</li><li> Frank loathes dirty cops as a whole, considering them a disgrace to good police in general and the NYPD as a whole, due to the damage they do to public trust, and of course what the Blue Templar did to Joe. What's notable is how low-key he is about it. He doesn't raise his voice and his expression barely changes even though it's abundantly clear how furious he is. When he confronted the ones responsible for Joe's death at the end of the first season, it's almost terrifying how calm he looks during the entire exchange. He only loses his cool for a moment when he knocks some things off the top of a cabinet, which is also one of the few times he raises his voice. He's not shouting either, he raises it the way people do when they want to make sure they're heard.
</li><li> From season 1's "After Hours," there's Jimmy Burke, Frank's partner while stationed at the 27th Precinct who took a bullet for him. He was eventually promoted to Inspector and placed in command of the 15th Precinct. When he is up for a promotion to Deputy Chief as the Deputy Commander of Patrol Borough Manhattan South, Erin uncovers that Jimmy has been juking his precinct's COMPSTATS, misreporting felonies as misdemeanors to artificially lower the crime rates. After meeting with Jimmy, Frank allows him to retire rather than face demotion to Captain and reassignment to the 128th Precinct in Staten Island.
</li><li> In the season 2 episode "Critical Condition," the leader of a botched bank robbery turned hostage situation is Billy Flood, an ex-cop from a special unit that Frank ran in the 1990s.
</li><li> In "Thanksgiving," Sgt. Renzulli is revealed to be betting on horses on the side, and owes about $10,000 to his bookie. After hearing about it from Jamie, Frank bails Renzulli out but makes clear it's a one-time offer.
</li><li> In "Framed," Danny is investigating a bookie who has his clients assaulted when they're late paying him. Right as Danny's about to get a warrant to raid the bookie's house in search of a black book that will reveal a list of all the clients who owe him money, he's pulled over and busted for drug possession. It's obvious to the entire Reagan family the drugs were planted. Furthermore, Jamie finds that a baker Danny stopped at right beforehand<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note19iea');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note19iea" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note19iea');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">as he'd been reminded by Erin and by Linda repeatedly to do so</span> seems to have been intimidated into lying about Danny's whereabouts. As the investigation turns out, an Internal Affairs captain that had previously investigated Danny for a friendly-fire incident was among those who would have been outed as owing money to the bookie when the black book turned up. He framed Danny to get him out of the way, even proceeding to steal Danny's off-duty pistol to kill the bookie.

When she tried to leave him for a kind man, he murdered his daughter in front of her, causing her to give up her other daughter for the child's own safety and go into hiding. Forty years later, her boyfriend (also a cop) tearfully confesses that he and some of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">other cop friends took him behind an alley</a> and beat him in a back alley in an attempt to get him to stay away from her. ("That's how we dealt with abusers back then. Off the books.") Clearly it didn't work. The investigating detective comments that the abuser was killed in a shoot out with criminals shortly after the child's death, and the boyfriend (who spent all this time thinking both children and their mother had been murdered) all but admits he took advantage of the situation to kill him. The team's reaction when they hear this story? They sweep the original dirty cop's death under the rug without even a single thought. That's one straight example, then two extremely sympathetic examples within five minutes of each other.

<ul><li> Season 1 featured a corrupt sheriff who worked for a Miami drug cartel. He struck a deal with them so he could get revenge on a child killer. He is actually a fairly effective sheriff since he is able to crack down on illegal drug manufacture and sales in the county. The drug cartel is not interested in selling drugs in the county and helped him get rid of the local meth manufacturers who were their competition in other areas. Things go bad for him when the cartel asks him to help them kill Raylan.
</li><li> Season 3 had an election for sheriff where both candidates were in the pockets of criminals. The incumbent hardly hesitates before accepting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BriefcaseFullOfMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BriefcaseFullOfMoney">Briefcase Full of Money</a> from Quarles. When Boyd Crowder realizes that the sheriff works for Quarles he recruits his own candidate to run for the position.

</li><li> Season 4 had the Marshals searching for Drew Thompson, a fugitive from the FBI and the Detroit Mob who 30 years before faked his death. Raylan quickly discovers that the FBI agents assigned to the case are working for the Detroit Mob and as a result the US Marshal Office gets full jurisdiction on the case.

<ul><li> It was implied that Fontana was dirty, as he wore very nice clothes and flashed a big roll far too often for a simple detective. However, it was eventually revealed that Fontana was living off an inheritance, and not dirty at all, thus ultimately subverting the trope.
</li><li> Back when he was "on the sauce", Briscoe was implied to be dirty (or at least surrounded by a lot of other dirty cops). By the time he joins the 27th Precinct, after he had cleaned himself up and kicked his alcohol problem, he only <em>pretends</em> to be a dirty cop in order to get his informants to trust him.

There's a second level to this as well, as Dyson is actually more loyal to Trick (the former <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Blood King</span>, but in practice nothing more than the owner of a Fae waypoint) than he is to the Ash, the leader of the Light Fae, and both he and Hale are more than willing to turning a blind eye to Bo breaking Fae law (as much as Fae law actually applies to Bo in the first place).

The police force of the time were notoriously corrupt and for the most part acted as just a glorified street gang. When the detectives foil a bank robbery, there is a definite pecking order as to who gets to steal what from the crime scene. The informant gets to grab a few coins, the detectives get to stuff their pockets with some bank notes, the sergeant gets a pocket watch belonging to one of the dead robbers and the captain gets to deliver the remaining money back to the bank and decide how much he will keep as payment for the 'protection' his cops provided.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hustle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hustle">Hustle</a></em> would sometimes feature Dirty Cops who thought they could manipulate the crew for their own ends.

<ul><li> In season 1, practically half of the cops of the NYPD's 15th Precinct are in Fisk's pocket. Not only does Fisk use them to kill off associates who have become liabilities as well as his enemies (and ensure no NYPD investigations are opened into his activities), but they're so dirty that they're willing to actively murder fellow officers who aren't on the take or who have become liabilities themselves. In a touch of irony, it is one of these corrupt cops, Detective Carl Hoffman, guilt-ridden over Fisk forcing him to kill his partner and best friend Detective Christian Blake, who is responsible for giving up information that allows the FBI to apprehend Fisk and all of his top associates.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BullseyeMarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BullseyeMarvelComics">Benjamin "Dex" Poindexter</a>. Dex is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FBIAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FBIAgent">FBI</a> SWAT sniper on the detail that is assigned to protect Fisk after he makes a deal with Ray Nadeem to become an informant for them. After Dex saves Fisk from an assassination attempt, Fisk takes the mentally unstable agent under his wing, and slowly corrupts him into becoming a dangerous assassin who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeASonToMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeASonToMe">looks at Fisk like a father figure</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation">dresses up in a Daredevil suit procured by Melvin Potter</a> to commit crimes that tarnish Matt Murdock's reputation as well as kill people who pose a threat to Fisk, including Jasper Evans and Nadeem himself.
</li><li> Dex is just the notable standout in season 3. Because as Ray Nadeem finds out the hard way, <em>almost every other FBI agent</em> on the protection detail tasked with protecting Fisk while he's under house arrest in the Presidential Hotel is working for him, thanks to long-term emotional manipulation and actual blackmail.
</li><li> Tammy Hattley, the SAC to whom Dex and Nadeem answer to. Fisk killed one of her kids in a staged "hit and run" and threatened her daughter. She's been under Fisk's control for so long that not even her close colleagues know she used to have two kids. She and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilBrit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilBrit">Felix Manning</a> blackmail Nadeem into joining the conspiracy by killing OPR Agent Winn and making an audio recording painting Ray as the shooter, which will be released if he doesn't cooperate.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0tvwc');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0tvwc" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0tvwc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">After Dex kills Nadeem on Vanessa's orders, he's ultimately framed for it posthumously</span>
</li><li> Obviously, Ray Nadeem is the only agent on the detail who's not dirty, which is by Fisk's design. But even then, he's not entirely squeaky clean. His pride and desire to get a promotion to get a pay raise and get out of debt (thanks to a financial situation that Fisk orchestrated) lead him to blindly believe Fisk's "allegations" that Matt worked for him without bothering to think it suspicious that a member of the law firm that took Fisk down would secretly be working for him, and not take Karen seriously when she points out Fisk is using him as a pawn in a vendetta. His pride also keeps him from realizing Fisk is playing them all, and by the time he finds out about Dex's treachery, it's too late to back out. He ends up becoming a reluctant accomplice after Hattley blackmails him, though this only lasts for a short time. Being forced to be Dex's driver when Fisk sends Dex to Matt's church to kill Karen to avenge her murder of James Wesley, a hit during which Father Lantom gets killed taking a baton meant for Karen, ends up being the breaking point that leads to Nadeem finally growing a spine and making an effort to break with Fisk (with Matt and Foggy's help). It doesn't work, and he gets killed by Dex on Vanessa's orders, though not before making a video confession naming all of the dirty FBI agents in Fisk's pocket.

In season 1, he murders the last survivor of a three-man crew that robbed a gun deal of Cottonmouth's, Wilfredo "Chico" Diaz, when Chico tries to turn state's evidence on Cottonmouth, and then uses Chico's information to sell Luke out to Cottonmouth. Later, when informed that Internal Affairs has him under investigation, Lt. Perez tasks Scarfe with getting Cottonmouth's guns out of evidence, with the help of a property sergeant who's been bribed to falsify papers saying the guns have been destroyed. But being under investigation, Scarfe decides to blackmail Cottonmouth, demanding $100,000 in funds that he knows Cottonmouth doesn't have. This prompts Cottonmouth to attack him, get hold of his gun, and shoot him with it. Scarfe manages to last a full day before dying, but not before spilling the truth to Luke and Claire about everything he knows. Sadly, his death means that none of his information is usable in putting Cottonmouth away, which combined with the police department brass not being happy with another police corruption scandal on their hands just a year after the one with Wilson Fisk, means Cottonmouth walks.
<ul><li> Just because Scarfe dies halfway through season 1 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallRoleBigImpact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallRoleBigImpact">doesn't mean he no longer stops causing problems for the cast</a>. Season 2 has a subplot where Misty has to deal with the fallout from Scarfe's corruption. Some of it is in the form of ostracization from her colleagues (who are also mocking her amputated right arm). On top of that, a bunch of cases she worked on with Scarfe were found to be tainted. It turns out that as a patrol officer, he destroyed evidence that would've implicated Cottonmouth in the murder of his uncle Pete on Mama Mabel's orders, which proves problematic when Misty finds that the gun from that murder was also used by Shades to kill Candace and by Mariah to kill Bushmaster's uncle. It also turns out that he planted a gun to ensure the arrest of a domestic abuser and dice game runner named Dontrell "Cockroach" Hamilton, a conviction Cockroach has just gotten overturned on appeal prior to the beginning of the season.
</li><li> In the second season, Captain Thomas Ridenhour is a downplayed case of this. He's not corrupt, but a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeskJockey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeskJockey">desk jockey</a> in over his head. Ridenhour is using Comanche as a confidential informant to gather information about Mariah Dillard (and overseeing this investigation where he has a big conflict of interest, as he was a high school sweetheart of Mariah's). On top of that, Comanche is not very good at covering his tracks. Such so that they both end up being killed when a suspicious Shades follows Comanche to a meeting and catches them talking.

</li><li> During the C.B. radio craze of the mid-1970s, several country music songs played on the theme of corrupt highway patrolmen (and the then-prevailing 55-mph speed limit), using masquerades to lure unsuspecting truck drivers into speed traps. These included:
<ul><li> "<strong>The White Night</strong>" by Cledus Maggard and the Citizens Band. Written by advertising executive Jay Huguely (who recorded using the pseudonym Maggard), the song's antagonist was a Georgia highway patrolman who posed as a fellow truck driver who scouts for speed traps and, broadcasting there are no "smokies" in sight, the protagonist truck driver can drive as fast as he pleases... only to find out that it is a speed trap and that he was nailed for going 40 mph over the speed limit.
</li><li> "<strong>C.B. Savage</strong>" by one-hit wonder Rod Hart, where a highway patrolman hopes to break up a ring of convoys who were protesting the national speed limit by masquerading as a gay truck driver. He is quickly able to exploit the homophobia of the lead truck driver in the convoy, and shortly after he pulls into a truck stop (in an effort to get away from the non-existent gay trucker whom he believes is stalking him) ... the patrolman reveals his ruse and that five of the truckers in his convoy are in police custody. The gay-themed song, when played on the December 18, 1976, broadcast of the radio program <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/AmericanCountryCountdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/AmericanCountryCountdown">American Country Countdown</a></em> led then-host Don Bowman to do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat">beat</a> after his outro for the song, noting, "I don't pick them, I just play them."

Precinct and presumably also their leader, and seems outwardly to be a model cop. However, he is, in fact, a double agent for the Umbrella Corporation, and more importantly is intending to lure the S.T.A.R.S. Teams to their deaths at the hands of B.O.W's both to silence them and to give the B.O.W's battle data, and later games reveal that he was in fact also planning to betray Umbrella as well.

And by hints, we mean the <em>human skulls</em> in his secret taxidermy chamber. Made worse in <em>Outbreak</em>. One of the files in the first scenario notes that 8 blonde women, all ages 18-23, started disappearing and people were saying there were groans and screams in the sewers.

By the sequel, there are enough humans working in C-Sec that it was no longer a concern, so he was sacked.

<ul><li> LAPD Detective Ben McCall is on the lighter end of the scale; he steals petty cash from criminals to help pay for the medical expenses of the child of one of the many hookers in his jurisdiction that he's protecting, he otherwise has a very strong sense of justice (although he also has anger issues and is prone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Cowboy Cop</a> behavior as well as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackBauerInterrogationTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackBauerInterrogationTechnique">Jack Bauer Interrogation Technique</a>).

Still, his Battle Cry in the 2011 game is "Police brutality comin' up!" (Also, in that game, Stryker is unique in that he is the only character who appears to kill his opponent upon winning a match even if he does <em>not</em> successfully perform a Fatality; he throws a grenade offscreen, which results in an explosion, followed by a scream from the loser and a lot of blood.)

This was particularly notable in the Sodder Children episode, where the authorities located only a few miles away showed up hours after the house was set on fire, and in the episode about the Keddie Cabin Massacre, where it has often been theorized that the authorities were covering something up, due to the sheer negligence that was shown to the case.

Instances include:
<ul><li> Numerous episodes: Quagmire's repeated preying on and raping teenaged girls and women (drugging many of them via GHB); and Peter for showing strong, if not outright blatant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt">pedophiliac behavior</a>.
<ul><li> However in "Quagmire's Mom" Joe finally arrests Quagmire for statutory rape.
</li></ul></li><li> Numerous episodes: Peter repeatedly abusing Lois &#150; particularly in "The Courtship of Stewie's Father" &#150; and Meg (countless episodes).
</li><li> "The Road to Rupert": In addition to not only doing nothing to stop Peter, Quagmire, and Cleveland from annoying Meg during her driving test, he joins in the "fun."
</li><li> "Jerome is the New Black": Peter causing a fire at his new friend Jerome's house, this out of jealousy and hate when Peter believes that Jerome (a black man) is having an affair with Lois.
</li><li> "Family Goy": From his upstairs window, Peter shoots a gun at his Jewish neighbor Mort Goldman while he is at his mailbox (a scene emulating an infamous scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SchindlersList" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SchindlersList">Schindler's List</a></em>). Not only does Joe fail to arrest Peter, but <em><strong>he also shoots Mort with his gun</strong></em> (greeting him with a friendly hello to boot).
</li><li> "Burning Down the Bayit": Peter and Quagmire conspiring with Mort Goldman to burn down Goldman's pharmacy (to allow him to collect an insurance settlement). That last one was also an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal">It's Personal</a> moment when he remembers that his insurance company wouldn't pay for a surgery to allow him to walk.

Technically Joe is just a grade school hall monitor, but the story depicts him like this, Numbuh Two describing him as "a bad cop and a worse friend", and as it turns out, he's taking bribes from the true villain in the episode.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em>, a recently recaptured Lex Luthor asks the guard leading him to his cell how his family's doing.

<ul><li> Wiggum's badge has "Cash Bribes Only" written on it. Which is odd, as "I Love Lisa" implies that he got the Krusty 20th anniversary special tickets as a result of a bribe when he (unintentionally) caught Krusty in a porno theater.
<div class="indent"><strong>Lisa:</strong> That story isn't suitable for children. <br><strong>Wiggum:</strong> Really? I keep my pants on in this version.
</div></li><li> In an episode where prohibition is reintroduced in Springfield, Fat Tony and his mobsters openly drive trucks of illegal booze past City Hall, casually tossing a handful of cash at Lou and Eddie on the way.
<div class="indent"><strong>Fat Tony:</strong> You didn't see nothing. <br><strong>Eddie:</strong> <em>(counting the money)</em> I don't know why people are always badmouthing the Mafia.
</div></li><li> An inverted example involving Wiggum, he has also been willing to break the law for a very honorable reason: To help Homer's fugitive mother escape arrest, as her crime caused his asthma to be cured when he was younger. He has done so twice.
</li><li> Once, when Homer visited <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigRottenApple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigRottenApple">New York City in the '70s</a>, a police officer stole his luggage.

</li><li> Every cop in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> is either bigoted, completely useless, or both. They frame and arrest wealthy black men, react with admiration when they're told a preschooler is in a sexual relationship with his teacher, are completely oblivious to basic clues and forensic science, and usually end up killing/arresting a lot of innocent people when they investigate; and that's just for starters.
</li><li> Officer Mike Brikowski from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em> episode "Cop Out" is a jerk from the start, who's fired after falling asleep on the job, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">blames the Girls for it</a>, thinking he's being fired because the Chief wants to downsize because of them. After trying and failing to get rid of them (and his plan foiled by more honest cops) he claims this was a story of a "good cop gone bad", Blossom disagrees, calling him a "bad cop gone worse".

Over seventy police officers were implicated in misconduct, ranging from murdering suspects and planting weapons on them, to actively joining gangs like the Bloods, bank robbery, and other crimes. Essentially, what was intended to be an anti-gang task force became the most powerful criminal gang in the city. This went even further as the scandal led to the Police Chief, District Attorney, and the Mayor of Los Angeles all eventually being not re-appointed or re-elected (after allegations arose that the chief had tried to censor the lead investigators in the Rampart case, and one of these detectives resigned as a form of protest). Over 100 criminal convictions were also overturned as a result. This scandal is what inspired <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheShield">The Shield</a></em>, mentioned above under Live-Action TV.

Eppolito and Caracappa were given pay and responsibilities equivalent to "made men" in the Lucchese family, a status that they didn't <em>officially</em> qualify for on account of being police officers. Ironically, before he was caught, Eppolito had bit parts in a few movies such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoodFellas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoodFellas">GoodFellas</a></em> (where he played "Moe Black's brother, Fat Andy").

He was also an enforcer and hitman for the Chicago Outfit and a personal friend of its boss, Sam Giancana. After being drummed out of law enforcement for perjury in the mid-1960s, he operated as a full-time gangster, became an FBI informant in order to undermine his mob rivals (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">much like Whitey Bulger would do years later</a>), and was eventually assassinated when the Outfit bosses learned that he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">plotting to kill them and take over</a>.
</li><li> On the matter of Bulger, the reason he became so powerful was because of his relationship with his FBI handler, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Connolly_(FBI)">John Connolly<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, who had been raised in the same South Boston neighborhood as Bulger and had known him since childhood. As Bulger's handler, Connolly took whatever intelligence Bulger could provide on the Boston Mafia in exchange for aiding and abetting Bulger's violent takeover of the city's underworld. In 2008, Connolly was convicted of racketeering, obstruction of justice, and murder and is currently serving a 40 year prison sentence.

Over the course of his career (and afterward) Rogerson was accused of police brutality, drug trafficking, fabricating confessions, at least two murders, and attempting to kill a fellow police officer who refused a bribe to bury evidence in a case against him. Despite his infamy, he enjoyed a measure of celebrity thanks to his exploits.

The two became partners in crime, pulling people over and robbing them in Frank's squad car. They eventually committed a violent robbery of a Vietnamese restaurant where Frank worked off-duty as a security guard, in which Lacaze shot and killed Richard William, another NOPD officer moonlighting as a security guard for the restaurant, while Frank shot two of the owners' family, and tried to kill a third before other police arrived. Frank was convicted for her role in the triple-murder and was sentenced to death. After she was sentenced, it came to light that she'd killed her father about a year before the robbery and buried his body under her house, but the authorities chose not to prosecute her since she was already on death row.

He robbed up to thirty banks before his arrest, some of which he committed while on his lunch break and later revisited as the investigating officer. His escape from prison and subsequent exploits led him to become the focus of an international manhunt, ending when he was killed by police in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in 1984.
</li><li> One possible inspiration for the Sheriff of Nottingham in the Robin Hood legend is <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Marc">Philip Marc<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and the Royal Forests in the time of King John. There is a specific clause in the Magna Carta demanding his removal, along with other officials and their relatives accused of corruption.
</li><li> The argument of "dirty cop" and police relations with minorities was a highlight of the coverage of the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3137733/Jailed-policeman-charged-fatally-shooting-Walter-Scott-time-father-s-barred-holding-newborn-son.html">Michael Slager<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> case in which Slager shot and killed Walter Scott. According to Slager, he attempted to write up Scott for a traffic charge, only for Scott to run. Somehow, Slager chased him down and hit him with his Taser, but felt "threatened" and was apparently forced to shoot and kill Scott in self-defense... at least according to his police report. However, a video captured by an eyewitness showed Slager <em>shooting a fleeing, unarmed man in the back from nearly 20 ft away</em>. Furthermore, one of the details uncertain in the video is a black object dropped near Scott and later picked up by Slager once other officers arrived, which some interpreted as an attempt to plant evidence. He was charged with murder after <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6-jFQPu-yo">the video<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> went viral, and the police department was apparently investigated for ignoring complaints against Slager going back to 2013. Slager's trial ended in a hung jury, after which he was charged with federal civil rights violations and pled guilty in return for state charges being dropped. He was sentenced to twenty years in prison for it.

<ul><li> First was the Justice Department investigation into the Baltimore Police in the immediate aftermath, which concluded that a number of department policies were disproportionately targeting minorities, with one citation <a class="urllink" href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/file/883296/download">from the 164-page report<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> standing out.
<div class="indent">In some cases, unconstitutional stops resulted from supervisory officers&#146; explicit instructions. During a ride-along with Justice Department officials, a BPD sergeant instructed a patrol officer to stop a group of young African-American males on a street corner, question them, and order them to disperse. When the officer protested that he had no valid reason to stop the group, the sergeant replied, &#147;Then make something up.&#148;

When he initially turned up dead on September 1, 2015, he was thought to have been killed with his own .40-caliber service weapon by three unknown assailants. But two months of intense investigation led authorities to conclude that Gliniewicz had actually committed suicide because he found out that his long-term criminal activity faced imminent exposure from an internal financial audit that had been under his direct control. He had been embezzling and laundering money for about seven years from a youth program for prospective cops. He had even gone as far as to ask a prominent gang member to kill the town administrator who was conducting the audit, but the murder never took place. Further investigation discovered a litany of issues during Gliniewicz's career, including threatening an emergency dispatcher with a gun, allegations of sexual harassment, and numerous suspensions.
</li><li> The notorious 1960s scandal surrounding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ScotlandYard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ScotlandYard">Metropolitan Police's</a> Obscene Publications Squad, nicknamed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName">"Dirty Squad"</a>, who became notorious for persecuting hippies for making art depicting nudity, while taking money from gangsters to allow illegal hard-core commercial porn to be openly sold all over Soho. The open hypocrisy was eventually too much for politicians, leading to <a class="urllink" href="https://flashbak.com/the-schoolkids-oz-dirty-books-and-the-downfall-of-the-dirty-squad-56477/">a series of corruption inquiries and trials<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (warning: NSFW artwork reproduced on linked page) that exposed widespread corruption within many of the Met's specialist squads.
</li><li> This was by no means the first such scandal involving the Metropolitan Police: one of the biggest happened in the Victorian era, the so-called <a class="urllink" href="https://victoriandetectives.wordpress.com/2014/02/09/scandal-at-scotland-yard/">Turf Fraud Scandal<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, in which at least three of the force's highest-ranking detectives were convicted of taking money from confidence tricksters to protect them from arrest and prosecution.

</li><li> Jonathan Wild, a thief in London who posed as a public-spirited crimefighter entitled the "Thief-Taker General" in the early 1700s.
<ul><li> While appearing on the side of the law, Wild ran a gang of thieves who robbed from wealthy households, kept the stolen goods, and waited for the crime and theft to be announced in the newspapers. At this point, he would claim that his "thief takers" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BountyHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BountyHunter">bounty hunters</a>) had "found" the stolen merchandise, and he would return it to its rightful owners for a reward (to cover the expenses of running his agents). If the stolen items or circumstances allowed for blackmail, he did not wait for the theft to be announced. As well as "recovering" these stolen goods, he would offer the police aid in finding the thieves. The thieves that Wild would help to "discover" were actually rivals or members of his own gang who had refused to cooperate with his taking the largest cut. Thieves ran a great risk in fencing their goods, which Wild exploited by having his gang steal and then "recovering" their loot. He never sold the goods back, explicitly, nor ever pretended that they were not stolen. He claimed at all times that he found the goods by policing and avowed hatred of thieves. The harsh penalties for selling stolen goods allowed Wild to control his gang very effectively, for he could turn in any of his thieves to the authorities at any time. By giving the goods to him for a cut of the profits, Wild's thieves were selling stolen goods. If they did not give their take to him, Wild would simply apprehend them as thieves. However, what Wild chiefly did was use his thieves to "apprehend" rival gangs.
</li><li> While that went on, Wild presented a heroic face in public. He was the man who returned stolen goods. He was the man who caught criminals. In 1718, Wild called himself "Thief-Taker General of Great Britain and Ireland". By his testimony, over sixty thieves were sent to the gallows. His "finding" of lost merchandise was private, but his efforts at finding thieves were public. Wild's office in the Old Bailey was a busy spot. Victims of crime would come by, even before announcing their losses, and discover that Wild's agents had "found" the missing items, and Wild would offer to help find the criminals for an extra fee. However, while fictional treatments made use of the device, it is not known whether or not Wild ever actually turned in one of his own gang for a private fee.
</li><li> Thanks to his position of power, Wild held a virtual monopoly on crime in London. Legends arose surrounding the management of his "empire." Some said that he kept records of all thieves in his employ, and when they had outlived their usefulness, Wild sold them to the gallows for the &pound;40 reward. This supposed system inspired a fake or folk etymology of the phrase "double cross." It is alleged that, when a thief vexed Wild in some way, he put a cross by the thief's name; a second cross condemned the man to be sold to the Crown for hanging (this fabulous story is contradicted by the fact that the noun "double cross" did not enter English usage until 1834).
</li><li> Things fell apart for Wild in 1724, when London political life faced a crisis of public confidence. A wary public began to view authority figures with suspicion of corruption. After spending the year trying to eliminate a notorious housebreaker and regular jailbreaker (who was finally hanged in November), Wild was arrested in early 1725 trying to jailbreak one of his men. When it became clear to Wild's gang that their leader would not escape, they began to turn on him. Slowly, gang members began to turn on him, until all of his activities, including his grand scheme of running and then hanging thieves, became known. Additionally, evidence was offered as to Wild's frequent bribery of public officers. He was tried at the Old Bailey on May 15, 1725, on two indictments of privately stealing 50 yards of lace from Catherine Statham (a lace-seller who had visited him in prison on March 10) at Holborn on January 22. He was acquitted of the first charge, but with Statham's evidence presented against him on the second charge, he was convicted and sentenced to death, and was hanged a week later on May 24th.
</li><li> Wild had been preceded by Charles Hitchens, Undermarshal of London (what passed for top law enforcement official, a bought position) and leader of a gang called the Mathematicians. Wild got a leg up when Hitchens recruited him to temporarily run his organisation after Hitchens got caught in a corruption scandal and got told by city officials to take a break for a few years, at which point Wild pretty much took over entirely by being more competent &mdash; at both the corruption (Hitchens was a bit too blatant at blackmailing, often appearing in person or sending <em>signed</em> letters, and a bit too greedy, driving away allies) <em>and</em> the actual thief-taking (Hitchens didn't even really do much of it against rival gangs).
</li></ul></li><li> Similar to the above, the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macdaniel_affair">Macdaniel affair<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> had some thief takers led by Stephen Macdaniel fabricating false evidence against innocent men to collect the rewards for their convictions. This was to the point that they got these innocents wrongly <em>hanged</em>. Following the Wild scandal, this was in fact the main impetus for the British government to abolish thief-taking and set up a public police force.
</li><li> Fellow officers at the LAPD didn't think much of traffic cop William Earnest Leasure, so much so that he was nicknamed "Mild Bill". <a class="urllink" href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-10-27-tm-1150-story.html">The soft-spoken "Mild Bill" spent his off-hours running a criminal underworld that stole rich peoples' yachts and conducted contract killings<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. He got caught as a result of a sting that the Oakland Police Department were doing on one of his acquaintances, a paroled bank robber, and initially his boss and others thought it was all a cover for him to do undercover work in jail until the truth came out.
</li><li> Obviously, there are too many examples to count, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlCapone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlCapone">Al Capone</a>'s way of amassing control over the Chicago underworld and his bootlegging empire was to buy copious amounts of protection from the law, including paying off numerous cops on the beat, Prohibition agents, and even Chicago's mayor William Hale Thompson.
</li><li> Henry Hubbard Jr. was a San Diego police officer with an exemplary record, whom no one suspected also was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialRapist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialRapist">serial rapist</a> whom his department had been desperately trying to hunt down for months with no success. Naturally, he found it easy to evade capture by his colleagues initially, as he sat in on the briefings regarding the hunt. He was uncovered only when he'd failed in his attack on three young people (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharismaCarpenter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharismaCarpenter">Charisma Carpenter</a>), who got away while he left crucial evidence behind, such as his police-issue flashlight. Hubbard was hunted down, identified and convicted of the rapes, getting 56 years in prison. Carpenter was largely responsible for this, as she held onto the flashlight and turned it over to police, something many not have known about the actress.
</li><li> In 1997, a group of NYPD officers brutalized and sexually assaulted Haitian immigrant <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abner_Louima">Abner Louima<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. At least five cops ended up being convicted of involvement in the assault and/or attempting to cover it up.
</li><li> Michel Neyret of Lyon, France, started by paying informers with the drugs he seized before embezzling them for himself, selling them to earn money for both him and his wife. He also oftentimes gave confidential informations to some of his friends in the mob. He was sentenced to four years of prison on 2016.
