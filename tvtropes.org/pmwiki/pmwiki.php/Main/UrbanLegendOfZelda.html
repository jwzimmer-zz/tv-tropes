It's not hard to believe them, since the games often have real secrets and glitches that are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">so bizarre that they sound made-up</a>. But the rumor persists in spite of all the evidence against it.
</p><p>A common source of these is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay">April Fools'</a> issues of popular gaming magazines. After all, if it's in print, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVNeverLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVNeverLies">it must be true!</a> Other sources include mistranslated lines, aspects of the game being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingSecret">Missing Secrets</a>. The Internet doesn't help either; while it's quick to debunk rumors, it's also very good at generating them.
</p><p>A frequent motif in such rumors is that of a secret supposedly unlocked by performing some action in the game for hours on end, pulling off a difficult feat several times in a row, or just doing something complicated <em>exactly</em> the right way, which makes the rumor harder to verify and contributes to its longevity.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>These days, this has been becoming more and more a thing of the past, thanks to advancements in cracking physical copies of games to dump their ROMs online and allowing people to look through the game's code becoming easier and quicker with each generation. As such, a lot of these old rumors tend to come from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSixthGenerationOfConsoleVideoGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSixthGenerationOfConsoleVideoGames">the sixth generation and what came before it</a>, back before such advancements had become commonplace.
</p><p>Sometimes, the game's creators will include a character or a feature in a sequel because of these rumors. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme">Ascended Meme</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon">Ascended Fanon</a>.
</p><p>Some games have so many rumors that they can result in the creation of a "FWAK", a parody/troll <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Walkthrough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Walkthrough">walkthrough</a> containing intentionally fake "secrets". The most infamous of these is undoubtedly <a class="urllink" href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.games.final-fantasy/browse_thread/thread/4ade399b277a4111/fba20b93e706eddd?lnk=st">Eggnog's hidden character FWAK<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em>. FWAK stands for "<strong>F</strong>alse <strong>W</strong>isdom <strong>a</strong>nd <strong>K</strong>nowledge." And as a side note, that isn't his only FWAK guide either (there was also a Final Fantasy IV version, which is widely agreed to be where a widespread rumor regarding Palom and Porom originated), and just to garner the reader's trust, also contained just enough legit info for completing the games. And helping propagate things was that the guides were often mistaken for ones by a very prolific writer from the same era named <a class="urllink" href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/562865-final-fantasy-vi/faqs/4999">Mynock<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheNES" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheNES">Older Than the NES</a>: Numerous rumors surrounded the works of Ultimate Play the Game, later known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Rare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Rare">Rare</a>. Most famously, the cover of <em>Lunar Jetman</em> features a moon buggy towing a trailer. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoversAlwaysLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoversAlwaysLie">The game features the buggy, but not the trailer.</a> Or does it? Rumours abounded about what the player has to do to unlock access to the trailer. <em>Crash</em> magazine published a screenshot sent in by a reader showing that he had achieved this feat, but the screenshot was a fake &#151; the trailer doesn't exist.
</li><li> Due to a number of odd "clues" in the game, a number of people are searching <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfTheColossus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfTheColossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a></em> for hidden secrets and a "17th colossus" that keeps coming up in discussion despite absolutely no evidence or reason for it. Via emulation, glitches, hacks, and probably caffeine, a few members of the official forums have discovered some interesting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> sections of the map, but no 17th colossus.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BuckBumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BuckBumble">Buck Bumble</a></em> had a cheat actually published as legitimate cryptically called "Dark Stinger", which has you input a long button combination before the opening logos appear.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockRaiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockRaiders">Rock Raiders</a></em> has an annoying rumor of three cheat codes. Extensive searching and hacks have shown that they do not exist (though you can mod in what they are supposed to do), yet the rumor persists.
</li><li> An interesting example is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheArtOfTheft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheArtOfTheft">The Art of Theft</a></em>, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenCroshaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenCroshaw">Ben Croshaw</a>. As a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">Self-Imposed Challenge</a>, the player can put on a special outfit that makes them <em>more</em> visible to guards, thus making the game more difficult. There is a rumor that if you complete the bonus mission (all seven of the previous levels in a row) using this outfit, it unlocks a minigame. What you actually get is a message that assumes you heard the rumor already and encourages you to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotSpoilThisEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotSpoilThisEnding">continue telling people that the minigame exists</a>.
</li><li> Beating <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shift">Shift</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://armorgames.com/play/1846/shift-3">3<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> unlocks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FancyPantsAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FancyPantsAdventures">Fancy Pants Man</a> as a playable character; reviewers are encouraged by the game's ending message to identify the unlockable character as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelGibson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelGibson">Mel Gibson</a> instead.
</li><li> Players initially believed that the dormant volcano in the first area of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UruAgesBeyondMyst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UruAgesBeyondMyst">Uru: Ages Beyond Myst</a></em> can be entered somehow, allowing access to the D'ni civilization. This isn't true in the original game; the volcano isn't fully solid, and the attempting to climb it will dump you out of the level. A fan mod not only made the volcano climbable, but also imported data from <em>Myst V</em> to explore.
</li><li> The Commodore 64 graphic adventure game named <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastleOfTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastleOfTerror">Castle of Terror</a></em> gained a reputation for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> because it seemed to be impossible to kill Count Dracula at the end of the game. A gaming magazine published an account from a gamer who claimed to have been able to do it, but the gamer himself proved mysteriously uncontactable when attempts were made to verify his claims. Many years later, <a class="urllink" href="http://solutionarchive.com/grahame_willis/">the designer confessed the game was in fact UnwinnableByDesign and it was impossible to kill Dracula.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> More from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider">Tomb Raider</a></em> series:
<ul><li> There was a rumour going round that you can find the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderII">Dagger Of Xian</a> hidden away in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderTheAngelOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderTheAngelOfDarkness">Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness</a></em>. Apparently, one had to find a secret room hidden in the Aquatic Research Area to acquire it. Needless to say, neither the room nor the dagger exists.
</li><li> In <em>Tomb Raider 3</em>, the only way to get Lara's butler <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan">Winston</a> off her case (seeing as he follows her everywhere when she's at home, even when she tries to shower) is to lure him into the walk-in refrigerator and lock him in side. This has led to a few rumors that if you do that and leave him in there long enough, he'll be dead (or possibly frozen solid) when you <em>do</em> open it. Won't happen.
</li><li> For years, there were rumors of a cheat code in the early games that would let you play as Lara without any clothes. While the PC version <em>did</em> have a fan made patch that made it possible (which was taken down after a cease and desist order), there weren't any actual codes to achieve that effect. The rumor still had massive pop-cultural influence, enough to receive several references and parodies:
<ul><li> As <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/GamePlayersMagazine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/GamePlayersMagazine">Game Players Magazine</a></em> put it: "Nude Raider.

</li><li> An ad in an American game magazine around the release of <em>Tomb Raider 3</em> for the game said something to the effect of "We've improved on everything you asked about... but sorry, still no nude code."

Fighting games are especially susceptible to this sort of thing, because many have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a> to make up their fighting roster, and people like to speculate who might be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretCharacter">Secret Character</a>.
<hr><ul><li> An early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ElectronicGamingMonthly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ElectronicGamingMonthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a></em> April Fool's joke insisted that Simon Belmont of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em> games is a secret character in the NES port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtlesTheArcadeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtlesTheArcadeGame">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Arcade Game</a></em>. After they got called on it, they "promised" never to do something like that again &mdash; while showing a picture of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battletoads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battletoads">Battletoads</a></em> in the first NES <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoubleDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoubleDragon">Double Dragon</a></em> (which predated it by years). They couldn't know that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">later Rare really would</a> make a game called <em>Battletoads <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercontinuityCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercontinuityCrossover">and</a> Double Dragon</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sheng Long, a supposed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a>, is perhaps the most famous "fake" secret character. He's got a long history, which goes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen">Mondegreen</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon">Ascended Fanon</a>:
<ul><li> He was first mentioned in Ryu's win quote in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII">Street Fighter II</a>: The World Warrior</em>: "You must defeat Sheng Long to stand a chance." This is a mistranslation; "Sheng Long" is not a character, but rather the Chinese name for Ryu's Dragon Punch (or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shoryuken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shoryuken">Shoryuken</a></em>). The quote should be more like: "You must overcome my Dragon Punch to stand a chance against me."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom">Capcom</a>'s American division, not knowing what to make of this, used the name "Sheng Long" for Ryu and Ken's master. He was even given this name in the manual for the SNES <em>Street Fighter II</em>, under Ryu and Ken's profiles. Then in Japan, Capcom called the character "Gouken", and all subsequent mentions of the character in the U.S. were changed.
</li><li> In 1992, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ElectronicGamingMonthly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ElectronicGamingMonthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a></em> (of course) published this rumor as true as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay">April Fools' Day</a> joke. In their version, you have to play as Ryu and win every fight without getting hit once. Then you have to go ten rounds against M. Bison without <em>either</em> player landing a hit. At that point, Sheng Long will step in and challenge you; if you beat him, you unlock Sheng Long. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a>, and <em>EGM</em> knew it. (<em>EGM</em> would repeat the joke five years later for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIII">Street Fighter III</a>: New Generation</em>, <a class="urllink" href="http://fightingstreet.com/folders/variousinfofolder/shenglong/shenglong.html">complete with more doctored screenshots and even character artwork.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>)
</li><li> Not long after, the character Akuma made his first appearance in <em>Super Street Fighter II Turbo</em>. His appearance and abilities are very similar to those of Sheng Long, but Capcom would never confirm or deny that he was supposed to be Sheng Long. It was then revealed that Akuma is Gouken's brother.
</li><li> Capcom considered adding him to the arcade version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterTheMovie">Street Fighter: The Movie</a></em>; they even had a mo-cap actor picked out and established some backstory, but he was scrapped. The game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">lead designer</a> Alan Noon <a class="urllink" href="http://shoryuken.com/forum/index.php?threads/street-fighter-the-movie-broke-my-heart.21457/">discussed it here.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> Finally, for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay">April Fools' Day</a> 2008, the official Japanese development blog for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV">Street Fighter IV</a></em> teased Sheng Long as a playable character. By this point, most players cynically dismissed it as a joke. But a couple of weeks later, Capcom revealed that Gouken would become a character in the game (playable on the console version) &mdash; and in some form or another, he has <em>every move</em> EGM described back in 1992. As for Sheng Long himself, the blog had this to say:
<div class="indent"><em>Sheng-Long is still now, and always will be, truly a character of legend.</em>
</div></li></ul></li><li> <em>Street Fighter II</em> had a persistent rumor that the SNES port has a "Boss Code" that lets you play as the four boss characters. People extrapolated this from the ability to play as characters in their <em>Champion Edition</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">colors</a>, which can't be done in the arcade, and the bosses have those colors too. The only way to play as the bosses is to hack the game, as in <a class="urllink" href="http://bootleggames.wikia.com/wiki/Street_Fighter_II:_Champion_Edition">this South American bootleg version<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> Ryu and Ken's "Red Hadoken" in <em>Street Fighter II</em> was variously considered a glitch or an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a>; no one could really figure out how to perform it, though. (Akira Nishitani later revealed that it is indeed an Easter egg.) It's possible to do this deliberately in <em>Super Street Fighter II</em>.
</li><li> A common schoolyard rumor was of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a></em>-style fatalities in <em>Street Fighter II</em>; there is no such thing. The most popular was a move that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodyMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodyMurder">shoots blood</a> at the opponent, which will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> them if they have a different blood type.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha">Street Fighter Alpha</a> 3</em> had a rumor that it is possible for a fighter to purposely throw the fight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolLoser">in a unique way</a>, particularly Balrog the boxer (Mike Bison in Japan). Through various arcane controller inputs, you can have Balrog <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManBitesMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManBitesMan">bite his opponent</a> (as Mike Tyson had recently done in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>) until the fight is called. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV">Street Fighter IV</a></em> uses one of those inputs (full joystick rotation and all three punch buttons simultaneously) for Balrog's new Ultra Combo, which doesn't involve biting but does involve other things not allowed in boxing (stomping the opponent's foot, headbutting, and elbowing them in the face).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series has an incessant rumor mill regarding the character roster with each new release. This was especially true after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl">Brawl</a></em> introduced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Solid Snake</a>, the series' first non-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo">Nintendo</a> character. This is enough that after <em>Brawl</em>, communities sprang up just for hacking new characters into the game. Some of the rumored characters:
<ul><li> Veritable Urban Legend of Zelda factory <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ElectronicGamingMonthly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ElectronicGamingMonthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a></em> pulled yet another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay">April Fools' Day</a> joke claiming that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosMelee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosMelee">Melee</a></em> features <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic and Tails</a> as unlockable characters (and gave a very nearly impossible method to unlock them). None of this is true, but it was so hard to pull this off that few gamers found out the hard way before <em>EGM</em> came clean. The rumors carried over to <em>Brawl</em>; Sonic made it, but we're still waiting on Tails.
</li><li> Another <em>Melee</em> hoax had made the rounds suggesting that you can get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Toad</a> by shooting every single name during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniGameCredits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniGameCredits">Mini-Game Credits</a>, an incredibly difficult feat that absolutely no one has gone on record as having done. Needless to say this isn't true, and the only screenshots offered were (rather obvious) photoshops, but it did gain some traction in certain circles.
</li><li> It was rumored that it is possible to unlock the opponent-only characters in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros64">the original</a> <em>Smash</em> (Giant DK, Metal Mario, Master Hand, or the Fighting Polygons). You can use a Gameshark to play as them, but the game will freeze at the end of the match because none of them have an animation for the post-match "applause" screen. The same thing happens in <em>Melee</em> if you use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DebugMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DebugMode">Debug Mode</a> to play as any of its normally unplayable enemy characters (Giga Bowser, the Wire Frames, Master Hand, and Crazy Hand).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic">Mega Man</a> was rumored to be in <em>Brawl</em> alongside fellow third-party characters Snake and Sonic. When he didn't make it, scuttlebutt was that there was some sort of falling-out between Nintendo and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom">Capcom</a> that prevented it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeijiInafune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeijiInafune">Keiji Inafune</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">claims</a> Nintendo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDidntAsk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDidntAsk">never asked for permission</a> and that if they had, he would have allowed it in a heartbeat. Mega Man (and fellow Capcom character Ryu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em>) would make it to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU">Smash 4</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bomberman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bomberman">Bomberman</a> was rumored to be in <em>Brawl</em>; it was so pervasive that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a> removed a legitimate screenshot (at least in terms of roster) of the select screen <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Super_Smash_Bros./Archive_9#Japanse_screen_shot_of_Charcter_Select">because Bomberman wasn't on it.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Bomberman did not appear in <em>Brawl</em> or <em>Smash 4</em> at all, though he would later appear as an Assist Trophy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate">Ultimate</a></em>.
</li><li> Soon after <em>Brawl</em> was announced, there was a rumor that the head developer, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasahiroSakurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasahiroSakurai">Masahiro Sakurai</a>, had stated on a radio show that Mr. Game &amp; Watch, the Ice Climbers, and Young Link were going to be removed in favor of "Baby Bowser", Ridley, and "Wind Waker Link". Though this was false, Young Link was replaced by Toon Link in <em>Brawl</em>, and the Ice Climbers did end up being cut as playable characters in <em>Smash 4</em>, while Bowser Jr. was among the cast of newcomers. It's highly unlikely there's any sort of connection, though. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0e2jh');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0e2jh" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0e2jh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Ice Climbers were removed for the simple reason that the 3DS version's processor could not manage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssistCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssistCharacter">Nana</a> properly. Since they didn't want any differences in the roster, they removed the character(s) entirely.</span> Ridley is in <em>Ultimate</em> as well, but not only was it not at Mr. Game &amp; Watch's expense, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamMatchGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamMatchGame">all characters</a> (including Young Link and the Ice Climbers) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack">returned</a>.
</li><li> Speaking of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Ridley</a>, he was a long-rumored character even aside from the previous rumor, possibly helped by his appearance in the intro for <em>Melee</em>, but for a long time he did not make it in as a playable character; he was otherwise only a trophy in <em>Melee</em>, and nothing more than a boss in <em>Brawl</em> and <em>Smash 4</em>. Again, he's playable in <em>Ultimate</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rayman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rayman">Rayman</a> was initially purported to be joining <em>Smash 4</em> as DLC alongside Mewtwo thanks to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt">painstakingly faked</a> leak, before <a class="urllink" href="http://www.polygon.com/2015/2/16/8047305/super-smash-bros-rayman-fake-video">the leak's creator stepped forward and detailed the process<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> Before the reveal of the last characters in <em>Ultimate</em>'s base roster, an edited version of the group picture sprang up that appeared to depict characters such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog">Shadow</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Isaac</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask">Skull Kid</a>. Due to the image with the "full" group shot also including art of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGrinch2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGrinch2018">The Grinch</a></em>, this has been called the "Grinch Leak" and rumors were about that it was legitimate until the final pre-release <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/NintendoDirect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/NintendoDirect">Direct</a> happened, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Ken</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Incineroar's</a> confirmation debunking the leak.
</li></ul></li><li> IGN joked that an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Pack</a> for <em>Brawl</em> would be offered as part of a fake service called "Wii Expand". The supposed expansion in question is called <em>Super Smash Bros. Brawl X: Extreme</em>, and it was said to be geared towards an adult audience, with gore and decapitations abound. <a class="urllink" href="http://video.ign.com/dor/articles/969169/ign-april-fools-videos/videos/supersmashexx_bc_spc_jpn.html">Here is the footage of the supposed expansion pack in action,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> as well as <a class="urllink" href="http://wii.ign.com/dor/articles/968498/smash-bros-goes-hardcore-video/videos/supersmashexx_spc_jpn.html">an offscreen version.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> There are persistent rumours that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">otherwise useless</a> Goldeen will use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">Horn Drill</a> under certain conditions.
</li><li> <em>Brawl</em> was rumored to have Assist Trophies for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy">Rosalina</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3">Duster</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn">Sothe</a>. Either it was a hoax similar to an even more infamous one that would later pop up in <em>Smash 4</em> involving Chunky Kong (detailed below), or the people who reported their sightings may have mistaken other Assist Trophies for them (likely mistaking Gardevoir for Rosalina, and either Saki Amamiya or Isaac for Sothe).
</li><li> <em>Smash 4</em> has a fake screencap going around which shows Palutena saying that Pit in his debut looked like "a one-night stand between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">Missingno.</a> and a garden gnome." This kind of dialogue wouldn't appear in an E10+-rated game, and it's also in the wrong location. But enough people thought it was real that it got well over 10k notes on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Tumblr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Tumblr">Tumblr</a>.
</li><li> In the run-up to <em>Smash 4</em>, it was rumored that Chunky Kong from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64">Donkey Kong 64</a></em> would appear as an Assist Trophy, with his ability involving bananas raining on the stage (referencing the "this Kong's one hell of a guy!" scene in the DK Rap intro).
</li><li> After the discovery of the "landfallspecial" animation in <em>Melee</em> (used for characters landing at the end of the "helpless" animation), it was claimed that there are other animations in the code for the advanced technique dubbed wavedashing by the community, such as "superdashtechnique", "superdashattack", etc. This is false; wavedashing is entirely an exploit of the game physics, and there are no animations in the game code for it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a></em>:
<ul><li> Goro, Shang Tsung, and Reptile were the subject of many, many rumors to make them playable in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat1">the first game</a>. None of them work in the original. Goro, though, can be unlocked in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy">Game Boy</a> version, he's barely controllable through a glitch in the SNES version, and he's playable in practically every other game he appears in. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note17dvz');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note17dvz" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note17dvz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat9">the 2011 game</a>, where he appears in a one-off challenge where you can fight Kung Lao with him.</span>
</li><li> The first game also gives us the "ERMAC" glitch, in which all the characters wear red costumes while the words "ERMAC" appear over the life bar. People thought "Ermac" was a secret character of some sort. It's actually short for "Error Macros", and it's part of a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DebugMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DebugMode">Debug Mode</a>. The characters are all in red because that's the default color palette; the actors wore red when performing their moves so as not to clash with the green-screen. Nevertheless, Ermac would make his debut in <em>Ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat3">Mortal Kombat 3</a></em>. The red Kitana is more obscure, but she spun off into the rumored character "Skarlet", who would appear for real in DLC in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat9">Mortal Kombat 9</a></em>.
</li><li> The SNES version of <em>Mortal Kombat</em> is infamous for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodlessCarnage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodlessCarnage">removing the blood</a>, so naturally there were several rumors regarding how to get it back. Most of them involve some nearly impossible sequence of button presses. <em>NMS</em> magazine printed a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.digitpress.com/forum/showthread.php?p=419328">hilarious and widely believed article<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> suggesting you can do this by, among other arcane steps, taping a penny on top of the cartridge to weigh it down just right. The SNES version's ROM doesn't have the animations for the original fatalities, but you can hack it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">Palette Swap</a> the "sweat" back into blood.
</li><li> Another rumor sprang from the console versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat1">Mortal Kombat</a></em>: If you fulfill the conditions to fight Reptile in an endurance match and then defeat him, you can fight a green-tinted version of one of the other fighters. It's just a glitch, but numerous magazines hinted that these are secret fighters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat2">Mortal Kombat II</a></em> gave us the following rumors:
<ul><li> That Sub-Zero can turn into a polar bear. It was so pervasive that the developers added "Animality" transformations to the third installment &mdash; and yes, Sub-Zero turns into a polar bear.
</li><li> That Shang Tsung can transform into Kano, who was absent from the game for plot reasons. It arose from a counter in the arcade version's test mode reporting the number of "Kano morphs". It also led to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Memes/VideoGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Memes/VideoGames">fan meme</a> "I HAVE NEVER SEEN A KANO TRANSFORMATION".
</li><li> That the trees in the Living Forest stage can eat the opponent as part of a secret stage fatality. This one isn't true in <em>any</em> of the versions or remakes of this stage until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat9">Mortal Kombat 9</a></em>.
</li><li> That you can knock people onto the hooks in the Dead Pool stage. You can't.
</li><li> That there's a hidden character named "Hornbuckle", a reference to Jade's occasional line "Hornbuckle who?" Fans gave the name to the unnamed warrior fighting the fiery warrior in the background of The Pit 2 (Ed Boon claims that was supposed to be Liu Kang). Jade's comment is, in fact, a reference to one Leanne Hornbuckle, whose name appears in the game's end credits.
</li><li> That the female characters have "nude-alities". It actually sounded somewhat plausible at the time. <em>Mortal Kombat</em> had <em>already</em> pissed off plenty of parents, why not take it to the next level?
</li></ul></li><li> This is invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatX">Mortal Kombat X</a></em> during one of Cassie Cage's fatalities, in which she uploads a selfie of her with her defeated opponent, complete with a live feed of comments, reminiscent of Twitter. One of them is from Ed Boon, who asks if anyone has unlocked Fujin &mdash; a character who makes a cameo, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator">but is not playable in the game</a>. Fujin would return in a DLC expansion to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat11" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat11">the next game</a>, however.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em>MK</em> clone <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TattooAssassins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TattooAssassins">Tattoo Assassins</a></em> actually implemented "nude-alities" in reference to the above <em>MK2</em> rumors. However, it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> rather than titillation: nude-alities make the opponent's clothes poof away, leaving them humiliated and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandOrObjectUnderwear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandOrObjectUnderwear">trying to cover up</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KillerInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KillerInstinct">Killer Instinct</a></em>, one of Orchid's finishing moves is flashing her opponent &mdash; the player, of course, can't see anything. Rumors abounded on how to "fix" that; one suggest that you can see her breasts by positioning her in front of a mirror in a particular stage. There's no mirror in that stage.
</li><li> There is a cheat<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2q9fc');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2q9fc" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2q9fc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Hold Square, Down, L1, and R1 while the game is booting up</span> that was in some early online guides for the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear">Guilty Gear</a></em> on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> that unlocks Justice, Testament, and Baiken without having to beat the game all the way through. It turns out that it really just increases the game's difficulty in Normal Mode. In a subversion, however, the cheat code <em>does</em> unlock the three aforementioned characters - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegionalBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegionalBonus">but only in the Japanese version</a>. Western releases get the "harder story mode" version of the code.
</li><li> There was a rumor in Japan that if the player completes the Famicom version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KungFuMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KungFuMaster">Kung-Fu</a></em> 24 times (the number equivalent to the letter "X", a reference to the Japanese title <em>Spartan X</em>), the player will be forced to fight Sylvia (the hero's girlfriend) as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>. It turns out the rumor was a started by a gag in a video game manga titled <em>Famicom Rocky</em>, where the protagonist uncovers this secret after completing the game too many times. This is what inspired the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/NatrapsX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/NatrapsX">Natraps X</a></em> series of parody videos.
</li><li> There were persistent rumors that if you beat <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallZBudokai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallZBudokai"> Dragon Ball Z: Budokai</a></em> on the hardest difficulty, you will be able to play through the Buu Saga in the Story Mode, especially after people found Great Saiyaman as a playable character. However, no matter how hard you try, there is no such thing coded in the game.
</li><li> Rumor had it that the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XMen">X-Men</a></em> arcade game has a secret, more satisfying ending that will only be unlocked if you beat the game multiple times in a row on the same playthrough (since normally, a victory loops you back to start to continue your credit). Proving or disproving it required more time and more quarters than most kids could manage. The re-release makes it clear that it's not true.
</li><li> There are many (joking) rumors on how to unlock secret characters for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Scarlet Weather Rhapsody</a></em>, the most prevalent ones allowing you to unlock <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tykebomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tykebomb">Flandre Scarlet</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson">Cirno</a>. This was not helped by fans making their sprites for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MUGEN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MUGEN">M.U.G.E.N</a></em> based on the <em>SWR</em> spriting style; many of them emulate the look incredibly well, going so far as to modify SFX from the game to fit the fanmade sprites. (The Cirno rumors were officially killed with her inclusion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Hisoutensoku</a></em>, though Flandre fans are still left waiting.) A slight bone was tossed to Flandre's fans &mdash; one of Remilia's alternate color schemes is essentially Flandre. Flandre proper was eventually added to a later game, <em>Touhou Genso Rondo</em> (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">Bullet Hell</a> duel game) for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation4">PlayStation 4</a> that was even released in the West, making this the closest Flandre ever appeared playable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken">Tekken</a> 1</em> was rumored to have a nearly-unbeatable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> named "Dragon Fighting Jack" or "Dragonclaw", based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoversAlwaysLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoversAlwaysLie">a screenshot depicting "Dragon vs. Jack"</a>, the former of which was really <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BruceLeeClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BruceLeeClone">Law</a> (Dragon being his placeholder name), and a blue robotic character at the bottom of the front cover, which was the alternate costume for the boss <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoPrototype">Prototype Jack</a>.
</li><li> One of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Bosses</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CapcomVsSNK2MarkOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CapcomVsSNK2MarkOfTheMillennium">Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium</a></em> is God/Ultimate Rugal, the result of Rugal killing Akuma and absorbing the Satsui no Hadou. If you beat him, Akuma deems that Rugal isn't worthy of his power before seizing control of his body, becoming more Akuma-like in appearance before leaving. This led to some people believing that you could fight this Akuma/Rugal hybrid, but he only exists for this cutscene. It doesn't help that in an alternate version of the character select screen there's an empty square in the center of the screen that looks like a secret character could go there.

<ul><li> Supposedly, Konami and Upper Deck Entertainment have created several <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> cards that have never been released to the public, only allowing them to be played by R&amp;D employees at Upper Deck in specialized "Duel the Master" matches at tournaments. These include the Seal of Orichalcos, Power Balance, and alternate versions of the Egyptian God Cards. Since the only "proof" of these cards existing are proxies, there's no way of knowing if this is actually true.
<ul><li> The anime gives this a nod very early on, establishing that Pegasus' Toon monsters are one-of-a-kind cards that were never released to the public due to them being "too powerful". During the last parts of the KC Grand Prix arc, it's revealed that Pegasus' company routinely gives away copies of unsanctioned cards as prizes (a habit that the actual card game took up).
</li><li> This has been proven to be true, at least for <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/The_Seal_of_Orichalcos">the Seal of Orichalcos<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. As for the Egyptian God cards, alternate, tournament-legal "effect" versions have been released for <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Obelisk_the_Tormentor">Obelisk the Tormentor<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/The_Winged_Dragon_of_Ra">the Winged Dragon of Ra<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, and <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Slifer_The_Sky_Dragon">Slifer the Sky Dragon.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> The latter addition has prompted the creation of the long time anime-only <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/The_Creator_God_of_Light,_Horakhty">The Creator God of Light, Horakhty<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> as an actual card. It even has its own type, "Creator God". The Seal of Orichalcos too has been released legally, though obviously with a very different effect to that of the anime or the Duel the Master version. No word on Power Balance, though.
</li><li> Prior to the official release of Primal Origin, there were sources depicting "Starduston" as a fake "Duston" version of "Stardust Dragon". It also was claimed to have an effect highly reminiscent of "Stardust Dragon": During either player's turn, when a card or effect is activated that would destroy a card(s) on the field: You can Tribute this card; negate the activation, and if you do, destroy it. You can only control 1 face-up "Starduston".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the early days, when cardlists were not available and the first <em>big</em> expansion set (Legends) was coming out, a rumor was started among the then-nascent Internet about the card "Throat Wolf", a creature which supposedly has "firstest strike". It also was rumored to have the ability to attack on your opponent's turn. Usually guides on how to get the super rare card mention other non-existent cards, like the Clockwork Doppelganger.
</li><li> Of course, spoofed in the parody set Unhinged, which actually has a secret card that <em>only exists in foil</em> and is not listed in most spoilers. It's <a class="urllink" href="http://magiccards.info/uh/en/141.html">"Super Secret Tech,"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and its collector number is 141 out of 140.
</li><li> Unstable, the third parody set, made the long-fabled "Last Strike," (a creature that deals combat damage after both First Strike and normal damage), along with Triple Strike (a creature that deals First, Normal, <em>and</em> Last Strike damage).
</li><li> Unstable also kicked out a few Urban Legends of Zelda of its own by breaking the long-held rule that each card must have a unique name. The set features a number of cards with the same name and cards type but different stats, rules text, and/or art. This led to some very interesting discoveries in the time between the official "complete" spoiler of the set (which listed one version of each card) and the product's wide release a few weeks later.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKartWii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKartWii">Mario Kart Wii</a></em> was rumored to have a third Mii Outfit; this is based solely on there being an extra space in the character roster. There are some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> icons and a character model related to it (it's a Toad costume), but it doesn't work properly if hacked into the game.

Every single <em>other</em> boss is unlockable, and another super-secret character, Penta Penguin, can be unlocked through cheats. It was long assumed that since you get N. Tropy for beating all of his easier staff ghosts, you can get Oxide for being all of his extremely difficult ghosts, but doing that just gets you a shortcut to the scrapbook on the main menu. 20 years later, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashTeamRacingNitroFueled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashTeamRacingNitroFueled">Crash Team Racing: Nitro-Fueled</a></em> would make Oxide legitimately unlockable by beating Adventure Mode, or available off the bat to owners of the game's premium edition.

The extent of the car's presence is a tentative text string in the game files, before all the cars were licensed and modeled. The F1 car would make its debut in <em>GT4</em> and the road car in <em>GT5</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a> cannot be achieved in <em>GT2</em> because so much has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a>. The most prominent example is the Palm Strip (or the "Plam Strip", based on a description typo), a supposed drag strip. It was discovered that by executing a glitch on Laguna Seca, you can drive out-of-bounds and find a floating piece of land; although the game usually crashes before you can get close enough to make sure, it's often thought to be the original Palm Strip. (It's more likely remnants of the track loading up or the generic course that appears in the arcade modes' loading screens).
</li><li> Developers surprised everyone with the Formula 1 cars in <em>Gran Turismo 3</em>, which quickly sparked rumors of other unmentioned, wacky vehicles that would show up under ridiculous circumstances. The two biggest offenders are motorcycles and a 1,000 MPH Bloodhound SSC styled land speed record car.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LEGORacers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LEGORacers">LEGO Racers</a></em> has a supposed cheat where if you named a character "TRUCK DRIVER" and beat Rocket Racer with it, you would get some sort of super-secret car. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">Modding</a> has shown that this was never a consideration during development.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WanganMidnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WanganMidnight">Wangan Midnight</a> Maximum Tune</em>, the player can earn "dress-up" parts through winning Ghost Battles to change the visual appearance of their car (spoilers, decals, tires, neon lights, etc.). As stated on official pages and in operator manuals, these changes are purely cosmetic. Despite this, there are players who, after 10 years of the dress-up system being in existence, still insist that dress-up parts influence vehicle performance in some way.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon">Marathon</a></em>:
<ul><li> The original game was rumored to have hidden levels with wall-climbing invincible red Drinniols. It was started by the <em>Marathon Secrets Guide</em>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVNeverLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVNeverLies">everyone was inclined to believe them</a>. They were eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Defictionalization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Defictionalization">defictionalized</a> when the game was ported to the Aleph One engine.
</li><li> There were false rumors of a true 3D <em>Marathon</em> game called <em>Dr'At'Er</em>, and one website claimed to have <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020703004437/http://www.marathon.org:80/stomp/M4/">screenshots<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of it (which were actually <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeI">Quake</a></em> screenshots). The game's title is also "retard" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SdrawkcabName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SdrawkcabName">spelled backwards</a>.
</li><li> In 1998, an alleged Bungie newsletter briefly mentioned <em>Marathon Gold</em>, a collection of the canon Trilogy and a few well-known fan scenarios from the time. It was swiftly debunked.
</li></ul></li><li> Atari's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlezone1980" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlezone1980">Battlezone</a></em> and its revolutionary vector graphic system, in 1980, has the distinction of being the first example of this trope. It was rumored that you can drive to the edge of the "zone" and climb the mountains to the peak of the volcano, where there is allegedly a castle. Sadly, such exploration is not possible; it's far beyond the capabilities of the era. But it didn't stop people from looking for it in the game, to the point that arcade owners complained that people were hogging the <em>Battlezone</em> machines to look for it and not actually play the game. Atari responded by adding code in later versions that would make an instant-kill missile hit the player if they fail to kill anything in a reasonable amount of time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997">GoldenEye</a></em>:
<ul><li> A big source of rumors is an extra line at the end of the cheat menu, which implies that something was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a>. It was meant to be for "Line Mode", a cut cheat that can only be accessed by a button-press sequence. Many of the other cheats were rumored to have been meant to fill this spot as well.
</li><li> Yet another <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ElectronicGamingMonthly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ElectronicGamingMonthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay">April Fools' Day</a> prank described the "All Bonds" cheat, claiming that it is possible to unlock all the other actors from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> series. The game does have the data for the other actors, but Rare couldn't secure the actors' likenesses in time and had them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a>. Rare actively lied about there being anything like that in the game. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">ROM hacking</a> has allowed the fandom to <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoldenEye_007#All_Bonds">add them back in,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> albeit a tad messily.
</li><li> Rare also lied about a secret level known as the "Citadel". Like "All Bonds", it also exists but was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a>; it's an engine test level. It can be accessed with some serious hacking.
</li><li> An inaccessible island in the very first level fueled a lot of rumors, which range from it being the result of leftover testing artifacts to housing secret items of unimaginable power. It was later revealed that it was meant to be an integral part of the first mission; it was abandoned to make room for local multiplayer and for being uninteresting. What had been developed at that point was simply left in.
</li><li> There is a rumored third secret level, based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goldfinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goldfinger">Goldfinger</a></em> and/or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AViewToAKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AViewToAKill">A View to a Kill</a></em>, as the characters Oddjob and Mayday are in the multiplayer character list. Oddjob is in the game simply because Rare mistook him for Scaramanga's assistant Nick-Nack from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManWithTheGoldenGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManWithTheGoldenGun">The Man with the Golden Gun</a></em> (the real Oddjob was not in any way short), though it's not clear what Mayday is doing in the list.
</li><li> Ourumov's briefcase and key were the subject of some speculation, often held to be part of some method to access the above and/or the island on Dam. They're actually part of an abandoned level idea that would have taken place between Silo and Frigate.
</li><li> Some rumours talked about a secret weapon called the Skorpion or Spyder, believing it to be the weapon shown on the back of the box. In fact, the box image is the beta KF7 Soviet, while "Skorpion" and "Spyder" are both beta names for the Klobb - the former is its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AKA47" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AKA47">real world name</a>, while the latter is what it had been going by until Rare learned there was another real gun by that name. Part of the confusion is that the manual refers to the Klobb as the Spyder, as the second name change came <em>very</em> late during development.
</li><li> Arguably the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample">Ur-Example</a> of the Nude Code is the classic Australian magazine N64 Gamer. Then-deputy editor Narayan Pattison superimposed a topless picture of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElleMacPherson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElleMacPherson">Elle MacPherson</a> into a screenshot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997">GoldenEye (1997)</a></em>, with the caption "Write in and we may give you the nude code." The magazine received over 2000 responses from people asking for the nude code, and people were still asking for it over six months after the rumour was bluntly dispelled.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>:
<ul><li> Each game has rumors of a secret vehicle, like drivable Scarabs and the "Golden Warthog". The "Yellow Banshee" was rumored to be in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a></em>, and it may have influenced the heretic Banshee's design in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2">Halo 2</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3ODST" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3ODST">Halo 3: ODST</a></em>'s not-quite-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metroidvania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metroidvania">Metroidvania</a> style gameplay is ripe for this kind of rumormongering. Stories of hidden energy swords are pretty popular. Rumors of living Elites hiding somewhere in the city crop up from time to time as well. And those strange markings that pop up in VISR mode could be anything.
</li><li> A rumor says that if you look carefully through the Library level in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a></em> you'll find the mangled corpse of Marvin Mobuto, said in the novelization <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloTheFlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloTheFlood">Halo: The Flood</a></em> to have made his way through a decent part of the Flood-infested Library before getting overwhelmed by the monsters.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeI">Quake</a></em> was itself considered an urban legend, as it was first announced in April and people couldn't grasp the concept of a fully-3D <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter">First-Person Shooter</a>. During its development, though, it was rumored that another 3D shooter, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hexen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hexen">Hexen</a></em>, contains a hidden demo of <em>Quake</em> that can be unlocked by performing a very complicated sequence of actions in the first level.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> The fandom is rife with fake updates. Some, like the <a class="urllink" href="http://guarddog.50webs.com/">Guard Dog Update,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> are jaw-droppingly realistic, and are only given away by the obviously not Valve-sponsored URLs. Here's Valve's response it, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.teamfortress.com/1308.htm">in character as Saxton Hale.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> The Engineer was also long-rumored to have a "Golden Wrench" in his update, as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/NerfNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/NerfNow">Nerf NOW!!</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nerfnow.com/comic/335">demonstrates.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Valve eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme">actually created the Golden Wrench</a>. A mere 100 of them were given out to random players who crafted things during the event. A few players managed to cheat by getting their hands on a leaked list of the exact times wrenches would spawn (if you were the first to craft anything after that time, you'd get it) but Valve took back those wrenches and banned the players involved. There was no <em>legitimate</em> way to increase your chances of getting one, but naturally there were countless rumors.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2">Left 4 Dead 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Passing spawned rumors on the day it was released. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It was said that you can use the defibrillator on Bill's body to bring him back to life, but this rumor was extremely short-lived, as it was proven that the body is just a prop and not a dead bot; there is no red outline on the body when you hold out the defibrillator. Valve eventually acknowledged this one by adding a special line for attempting it, stating "Bill doesn't need to be revived".</span>
</li><li> People insist that healing each other instead of oneself makes the AI Director "reward" this teamwork action with more first aid kits in the maps. There hasn't been any hard proof that supports this theory, but enough people believe it that it's stated on the L4D Wiki.
</li><li> It's believed that in The Passing, giving the old Survivors pills or shots will make the bots of the old survivors aim better and give the players better items. The bots' aim cannot improve, since it is possible for the team to get wiped, even if you gave the other bots items beforehand. As for the items, they give you certain items based only on how well you're doing.
</li><li> Some believed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Church Guy</a> can become a Tank or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossdresser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossdresser">Witch</a> instead of the other Specials available. Valve didn't intend it, but <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B3pZiRvvu8">as demonstrated here,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> it isn't hard to <em>make</em> him one.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Carnivores" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Carnivores">Carnivores</a></em>:
<ul><li> Several websites state that the original game features two secret dinosaurs, the <em>Brachiosaurus</em> and the <em>Seismosaurus</em>, with the former said to be killed only by a shot in the rear while the latter is hostile and can only be taken down by aiming for the eye much like with the <em>T. rex</em>. The game's data files shows no trace of the two dinosaurs, though it should be noted <em>Brachiosaurus</em> does appear in the second game as an invincible ambient.
</li><li> Many previews for the second game said it would feature a secret, unlockable rocket launcher. Subsequent examination of the game's data files, and later its source code, have shown that there is no trace in the game of a rocket launcher, though one may have been planned early in development.
</li></ul></li><li> One persistent rumor among the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare">Modern Warfare</a></em> community is a program called "snfg.exe" and nicknamed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">"Sniper Frog"</a>. It supposesdly runs in the background and doles out "luck", like headshots and better kill-streak crates. There has never been a source for this beyond unnamed "hackers", and no one who believes it can agree on whom the program is supposed to benefit &mdash; some say it favors low-level players by encouraging them, others say it favors high-level players to keep them interested (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">and buying map packs</a>).
</li><li> Another rumor concerning a popular <em>Call of Duty</em> game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyWorldAtWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyWorldAtWar">World at War</a></em>. On the zombies map "Der Riese", there is a wall by the furnace that says "Help" (or "Hell", depending on your point of view). People assumed for months, if not years, that there was some way to get past the wall, like some kind of a door. This led to much conjecture on what steps it takes to do so, with the most prevalent being to earn 50,000 to 100,000 points in total, and that the player would be able to buy the wall. While a popular rumor, it is unfortunately untrue. There's nothing on the other side of the wall. With that in mind, "Shi no Numa" had its own rumor mill with Peter's hanging body. Many players would say that if you touch the body or manage to knock it down, it will severely affect the game with such things as one player or all players going down with game over, or one player dying and only being able to bleed out. There hasn't been any proof of such. There are various other rumors concerning the zombies gamemode, with the player being able to destroy the Moon on "Der Riese" if they shoot it with Ray Gun, or that there is a secret easter egg on "Kino der Toten", since knocking can be heard when standing next to the windows on the stage. On "Call of the Dead", of course, considering the easter egg, players assumed the Original Characters are indeed behind the locked door, which is not true. It's only their voices. With "Ascension", there were massive rumors concerning a hidden room only accessible through jumping off the lunar lander at a certain point. "TranZit" had the prominent rumor of having a second bus route, considering when the bus goes through the tunnel to the Diner, there appears to be a closed off lane to the right which is never accessible. "Nuketown" on Zombies had a popular rumor with the players having to do some convoluted easter egg in order to unlock the bunker, and find either a member of the new zombie crew, or a route to TranZit. Not only was it illogical, but noclipping proves there's nothing inside the bunker.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarusUprising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarusUprising">Kid Icarus: Uprising</a></em> has an interesting legend that involves donating Hearts, the currency you gain from monsters. The game outright tells you that you get no item rewards for doing so &mdash; it just brings the Goddess Palutena <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> or Viridi</span> closer to the screen. But some believe it leads to a higher chance for weapon discounts in the shop. The <em>real</em> reward is that if you donate enough hearts, you can unlock a few extra lines of dialogue from Palutena or Viridi.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em>: Rumors about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Octolings</a> becoming playable characters "soon" appeared constantly in the fandom, usually in October for the punny potential. While unused game data strongly suggests that it was considered for the first game, nothing has been officially said on that front. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2">sequel</a> would eventually add Octolings as paid DLC in the <em>Octo Expansion</em>, with it being a reward for clearing that new campaign.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CarnEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CarnEvil">CarnEvil</a></em>: Long after the game's release, there was a fairly popular rumor that the character Umlaut, the skull that appears and recites a rhyme before each level as well as serves as the penultimate boss, was voiced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankWelker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankWelker">Frank Welker</a>, however, there was no evidence to support this. The game's credits do list the voice cast, but it does not list the characters that each person voiced, and Welker is not on the list. Jack E. Haeger, who created the concept for the game and was one of the listed actors, later confirmed in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfHmUOsHwCs&amp;lc=Ugzw5eMi0fByhiSi_3x4AaABAg">a YouTube comment<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that it was him who voiced Umlaut, finally clearing up the confusion. Besides, it was very unlikely that they wouldn't have credited Welker for the role, especially considering that he's a big name in the world of voice acting.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em>: That you can get past the room at the end of episode 1 in the original game. (At the end of the episode, you have to enter a portal that teleports you to a pitch black room that's full of demons and has a damaging floor; once you are reduced to under 20 HP, the game cuts to the ending expository crawl.) While you <em>can</em> survive by using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodMode">God Mode</a> and killing all the demons, there is nowhere to go as the room has no way out (other than no-clipping) so you'll just be stuck in a room full of corpses with nothing to do (other than turn off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodMode">God Mode</a> and let the floor kill you to end the episode).

Although this rumor proved false, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII">Diablo II</a></em> the developers put in an actual cow level in homage to the rumor; similarly, a secret Cow quest was added to the third-party expansion Hellfire, although it isn't a genuine "cow level". The phrase "There is no cow level" is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassicCheatCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassicCheatCode">Classic Cheat Code</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starcraft">Starcraft</a></em> and a loading screen tutorial tip in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>.

</li><li> In the Battle.net chat interface in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII">Diablo II</a></em>, there is a gem that can be clicked on to toggle lit and unlit states. It appears to do nothing else, although it will occasionally give a message, such as "Perfect gem activated." Hundreds of rumors about the gem's actual, secret function have spawned. All <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BlizzardEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BlizzardEntertainment">Blizzard</a> would say about it is that it is "Working as intended."
<ul><li> The official site for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII">Diablo III</a></em>, specifically the home page, has its own chat gem. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">troll</a> on the Battle.net forums started a rumor that if you click on it a certain number of times, it unlocks the playable version of the gameplay demo seen at release. The matter was laid to rest when someone looked in the source code of the site, decompiled the flash that operated the chat gem, and determined that its only purpose is to change colors, changing the gem from "on" to "off".

The series' well-documented design history reveals that it was very common for content planned in one game to be left out due to time constraints, and usually, a future game would feature it somehow. This in turn means most speculation these days is about <em>how</em> the powers would have been included, rather than how to unlock them on the presumption that they're still accessible without hacks.

<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG">MMORPGs</a> tend to develop a ton of rumors due to their fluid and ever-changing nature.
<hr><ul><li> One of the earliest MMO urban legends, there are still people who will insist that eating food will improve your skill gain in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaOnline">Ultima Online</a></em>.
</li><li> In early beta versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonsAndDragonsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonsAndDragonsOnline">Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online</a>: Stormreach</em>, there was a bug where using your "diplomacy" skill on a treasure chest caused it to give better loot. Although this bug was fixed well before the game went live, the rumor that using diplomacy on a chest gives better loot still remains, despite repeated debunkings by the game's developers on the official forums.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI">Final Fantasy XI</a></em> is a magnet for this:
<ul><li> The game has a ton of dead-end caves, background details, and sealed off portions of the world, which were placed to give possible expansion areas. The latter, in particular, draw a lot of rumors. Sealed-off portions (presumably abandoned due to most of them being in the "old world") include the Mithra-only part of Kazham, the ship port in Norg, the Galka-only part of Bastok Mines, and the roped-off stairway in Tenshodo headquarters.
</li><li> The Beastmaster job was rumored to take XP from other party members when in a party, leading to their exclusion from parties. This persistent rumor comes from a description in a Prima strategy guide.
</li><li> Some classic ultimate weapons from other <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> games were rumored to be in <em>FFXI</em>. One big example is the Ultima Weapon, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> of the series. Others include the infamous Vulcan's and Jupiter's Ring, complete with "screenshots". Many claim that the weapons exist in the game's database but just haven't yet appeared in the game proper.
</li><li> Countless crafters believe - for no other reason than because they heard it from another crafter - that crafting success can be influenced by facing in a certain direction depending on what kind of crystal is being used. Crafters who have a background in statistics, have logged hundreds of crafting attempts, and performed the appropriate analysis have mathematically determined that this theory is complete bullshit; they generally go ignored. But this is a huge source of controversy in <em>FFXI</em>, leading to many arguments (and even a <a class="urllink" href="http://ffxi.lokyst.net/timer/crafttimer.html">nuclear clock<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>). The developers at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SquareEnix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SquareEnix">Square Enix</a> were asked about it at Vana Fest, but their answer was convoluted, and it seems <a class="urllink" href="http://ffxi.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=10&amp;mid=1169758710113967020&amp;howmany=50">nobody can even remember what they said.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> The only real reason to follow the directions is because crafting is so goddamn hard in the first place, people are willing to do nearly anything to sink just a little less time and money into it.
</li><li> Absolute Virtue is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>. Its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable">difficulty</a>, as well as the dev team's habit of changing the fight if someone beats him, has spawned numerous strange theories about how to bring him down.
</li><li> Many players were convinced that certain items (e.g. 4-Leaf Mandragora Bud, Millionaire's Bed) passively had an effect on the "Treasure Hunter" buff (or a supposedly hidden Luck stat) if kept in your inventory. The fact that for years the mechanics of "Treasure Hunter" were kept secret and the fact that many items <em>did</em> have invisible passive effects only added fuel to the fire. Later patches which made the effects of "Treasure Hunter" more explicit largely killed these rumours off.
</li><li> There were often rumours of rare enemies which have near-impossible spawn conditions existing in the game, usually just to screw with people or to hide how to get certain sellable items. Famous examples being a weapon NM which spawns under the invisible status and a Taisai that dropped the newly added "Refresh" spell. Both of them were later added by the devs as a result of the rumours. (Though the Taisai one only spawns if you <strong>don't</strong> kill any Taisai, most likely as a gag by the devs.)
<ul><li> Averted with certain rare enemies such as Voluptuous Vilma and Almighty Apkallu, which were considered by many to only be rumours but have been found to in fact exist and their spawn conditions really are <em>that</em> insane.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> spawned many rumors and theories over how to quickly obtain the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareDrop">Atmas</a>, items needed to power up your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a>. Some believe that you have to complete a FATE during specific times (in the Japanese time zone), while others believe doing the events in a specific order boosts the drop rate. Despite the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> stated that the Atma drop rate is pure RNG, many people refuse to listen and cling to the hope that any theory will reduce the time needed to farm.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Ashbringer is the game's biggest rumor fountain. The developers left <em>just</em> enough in the game to make people believe they could actually get (or cleanse) the legendary sword. It was supposed to appear in the original game, but was pushed back to <em>The Burning Crusade</em> and then to <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em>. The hints in the game are meaningless, and the backstory given in Blizzard's four-issue comic miniseries doesn't address those hints. There's enough evidence to suggest that it had something to do with the legendary <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em> fisherman Nat Pagle; rumor is that he hid a secret message regarding Ashbringer's location in his fishing guides.
<ul><li> Part of the problem is that the Corrupted Ashbringer, when carried around, did some very strange things (at least before <em>Burning Crusade</em>). It sometimes even talked to you, giving you cryptic messages. It was only added to begin with as an attempt to unify the previous scattered references to the sword; the overwhelming response to <em>this</em> version caused Blizzard to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retcon</a> most of its lore and make it more plot-important.
</li><li> Players finally got to wield the Ashbringer as the Retribution Paladin artifact weapon in the <em>Legion</em> expansion. In a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon">Ascended Fanon</a>, there's a questline to unlock a skin for the Ashbringer that makes it looks like the Corrupted Ashbringer that incorporates several of the old Ashbringer-related Urban Legends of Zelda in itself.
</li></ul></li><li> Some quests are rumored to only be attainable while in ghost form. While some quests do require you to be a ghost, and a GM has given a cryptic response suggesting that those are not the only quests of that type, no such quest has yet been found. This is related to a rumor that you can stay in ghost form and revive anywhere else there is a restoration spirit; this mechanic existed very early in the game's history but was removed shortly after launch.
</li><li> There used to be a way to get to GM Island, and a weird rumor suggests that if you make it there, you'll be crowned an in-game GM. The truth is that if you were to get to GM Island, you'd most likely just be suspended.
</li><li> There are many areas and places that either don't exist or haven't yet been opened that you can supposedly reach. In particular, it's rumored that you can find a secret merchant if you go all the way out into the ocean in Seal Form as a druid, not far from Duskwood.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Sword of a Thousand Truths</a>, initially made up for a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> episode, was rumored to be an in-game item almost as soon as the episode aired. Due to fan demand, they planned to put it in <em>Burning Crusade</em>, but it was changed to become the Gladiator's Slicer. They did put it in <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em>, and although it's now called "Slayer of the Lifeless", it does reference the episode in several ways (such as the description reading "Foretold by Salzman" and the name being a reference to the Sword of a Thousand Truths defeating a player with "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasementDweller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasementDweller">no life</a>").
</li><li> The unmarked grave in Stormwind Cemetery. It has no statue or plaque, but does have a Lordaeron symbol. Who's buried there? Fans have some theories. Some think the remains of Arthas Menethil (as in, the Lich King) are buried there, which would explain the symbol. (When this was asked at BlizzCon 2011, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod">Chris Metzen said he's not sure if that's true or not</a>, but it is an interesting idea.) It was also theorized that it's an empty plot intended for Varian himself when he dies, given its proximity to the grave of his wife, but this was debunked following his death in <em>Legion</em>.

<ul><li> For <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay">April Fools' Day</a> 2009, a quest involving an airship was implemented in <em>zOMG!</em> Of course, the airship never went anywhere, instead crashing the game if one tried to fly in it. And being the first of April, it was natural that users would come up with their own pranks. So it was only a matter of time before someone decided to come up with some insane method to get the airship to fly. When someone finally did, people <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gaiaonline.com/forum/zomg-gaia-s-mmo/airship-and-airshark-guide-omg-april-fool-d/t.48633513/">ran with it,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> with dozens of people contributing "information" about the new area. Though very few, if any, players fell for it, the prank was popular enough to turn the Airshark into a minor meme.
</li><li> The Airshark (which in itself is a parody of the infamous "Landshark" boss) was so popular with the staff that they actually added it into the game as a Random Event.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheMatrixOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheMatrixOnline">The Matrix Online</a></em> has a long-running example of this trope in the form of "Hack the Ground Smash". The rumor states that using a fake ability called "Hack the Ground Smash" at a certain location will cause the ground to break away, and you'll fall into "Morpheus' secret hideout" where Neo and/or Morpheus are waiting for you. The fake ability apparently has its roots in a very, very old video of the game during its pre-beta days which shows a player using a Hacker ability that involves smashing an energy-charged fist into the ground. This ability never made it into the live game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MapleStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MapleStory">MapleStory</a></em>
<ul><li> The introduction of several boss characters was accompanied by rumors on how to get them to appear and/or weaken them. The best example would be several versions of the same "method" to get pushover boss Mano to appear, which involve either killing certain enemies, letting certain enemies spawn, or both at once. In truth, the boss spawns every hour from when it is killed.
</li><li> One popular schoolyard legend about the game in South-east Asia (area run by Nexon) was that to become a GM, all you need to do is to create a clean account for 6 months, after which if you're lucky a GM will send you a PM to fill in a form at a hidden URL. Sketchiness aside, it is said that if you succeed they will send you one heckuva high end workstation PC with three monitors.

<ul><li> Killing the hermit (a certain shopkeeper), with a multitude of ways (supposedly) abounding to defeat him. At the time the rumors began there was no way to even fight a shopkeeper, let alone kill them. A much, much later item, the Deck of Every Card, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon">makes it possible to fight the Hermit</a> (as a nod to the rumor), but not kill him. This is lampshaded in multiple items these days, and amongst the veteran players, "killing the hermit" has come to refer to a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms">different</a></em> kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank">Fan Wank</a>...
</li><li> Rumors can turn up due to certain players having access to certain NPC "character accounts" and using them in mail and chat rooms to create plot which may not match what the game developers have in mind at all.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tibia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tibia">Tibia</a></em>: Thanks to the developers tendency to be very quiet about what they include in updates, a lot of these have been generated over the years.
<ul><li> The probably most famous are the so called <em>Sword of fury</em> of the Rookgaard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenHillZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenHillZone">starting island</a>. A spike sword<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3dj80');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3dj80" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3dj80');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> A relatively weak sword on the mainland, but strongest that would exist on Rookgaard </span> found on an inaccessible island with a sign that says <em>Only the worthy may touch the sword of fury</em>. Through a very specific order of events, you can actually make it disappear from the island, but how (if it's even possible) you can get it remains unknown to this day.
</li><li> A related myth is the <em>Labyrinth Of Fury</em>, a blocked of hole found in the Premium only goblin cave also on Rookgaard, with a sign that gives it its name. Whether it has anything to do with the sword is also unknown.
</li><li> The Serpentine Tower "quest". If you go deeper into the magic guild of Ankrahmun you will find three cages containing a fire elemental, a vampire, a behemoth as well as a basement containing a green djinn blocked by energy walls. By trying to turn on a lamp in the tower you can set the fire elemental free, which allows you to free the djinn by pushing a lever in its now empty cage and then.... nothing. So far, no player has ever been able to free the vampire or the behemoth and move further in the "quest". Rumor has it that if one does manage to ever complete it, they will be able to fight an additional pharaoh boss and possible even be able to get the mysterious "soul ruby" required to make the helmet of the ancients upgrade permanent.
</li><li> <em>The Excalibug</em> A legendary sword whose origins harbour back to the early days of the game, when a player accidentally found an extremely powerful sword (Simply called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself">''sword''</a>) supposedly hidden by a map editor, presumably for personal use. While he immediately reported the find to the developers. The strange events surrounding the story has made a lot of players wonder in hindsight if it really was an accident, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">"Excalibug"</a> still is somewhere in the game, waiting to be found again. (A rumor that the developers has somewhat encouraged by giving many NPC's unique dialogue if you ask about it)
</li><li> A myth that has actually been solved is the <em>999 door</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheWorthyMayPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheWorthyMayPass">A gate of experience</a> found in deeper Banuta requiring the insane level of 999 to pass. Since it was introduced though, several players has actually hit 999 and revealed that it leads to the so called <em>Schr&ouml;dingers Island</em>, essentially just a place where players who reached this achievement can hang out.
</li><li> There was also rumored for years that there was a way to open up the Pits of Inferno and fight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonLordsAndArchdevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonLordsAndArchdevils">the Ruthless Seven</a>.

<ul><li> A player swore Bob the Cat had spoken to him about some recipe or something that no one else ever heard him say. Jagex was coy about it and implied it was a hint at a later event in game.
</li><li> There is a rumor about Jagex hiding a secret item in the free version of the game and leaving an incredibly cryptic trail of clues in random junk items. Supposedly, anyone who finds it will get a free lifetime membership.
</li><li> There is another pervasive myth, dating back to 2001, about an underground farm that can be accessed by using a sapphire on a particular tree. Later versions of the myth swap the sapphire for a herring. The farm is generally rumored to contain fantastic new armor; the herring era whispered of a place where the then-rare rune armor can be found scattered on the ground. One early resurgence of the story can be found <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020512023931/http://runetipit.board.dk3.com/viewtopic.php?topic=26759&amp;forum=1&amp;24">here.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> It's been said that this was the inspiration for the city of Zanaris.

</li><li> For a time, the clothing store in Varrock listed a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonplaceRare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonplaceRare">Red Party Hat</a> among its stock. It was always out of stock, which led players to wait in the shop for <em>hours</em> on end hoping that it would restock. It ended up spawning all kinds of rumors about when/if the shop would ever restock. Ultimately, Jagex removed the item from the stock listing.
</li><li> There was (and still is to some degree) a persistent rumor that if you deliberately kept the water level in the boat during the <em>Fishing Trawler</em> miningame high, you would get more fish when you completed it. Jagex employers has denied this multiple times though.

It's granted as an optional quest reward in Volume III of the Epic quest. The horseshoe is a "pocket item" which can be equipped, but gives no stats. However, it displays a buff on the player with a horseshoe icon and tooltip text that reads "Some people believe that horseshoes bring good fortune." Rumours as to the horseshoe's function have proliferated over the years, mostly revolving around the ability to affect loot chances or other randomness-based effects. In an interesting twist, the Horseshoe <em>definitely does</em> do <em>something</em>, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>. Only two of the Horseshoe's functions have been explicitly revealed, with hints that more undiscovered functions still exist. However, most of the loot-based theories thrown out by the community have been explicitly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed">Jossed</a>, so those still qualify for the trope.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ClubPenguin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ClubPenguin">Club Penguin</a></em> had an iceberg, and there was a rumor that if enough people drilled on it something would happen. Became true when the game was about to shut down and drilling on it would cause the iceberg to flip over revealing a dance floor and a message from the game&#146;s creators.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest">EverQuest</a></em> generated a lot of these due to the heavy secrecy that Verant maintained regarding the mechanics of the game behind the scenes. Verant was adamant to ensure that the actual number of XP points gained and the formulas used in combat calculations were completely hidden from players, leading to numerous guesses and false rumors about the system's functionality:
<ul><li> It was long believed that the game only checked your dual-wield skill when your mainhand weapon swung. This led to the practice of always keeping the faster weapon in the main hand thinking that it would give the offhand weapon more opportunities to swing. In reality, the dual-wield chance is checked every time the weapon should be swinging, and both hands work independently of one another.
</li><li> Due to the game's tick-based timing system that processes all effects in blocks of six-second intervals (to reduce bandwidth in a time where most people still used dial-up), it was believed for a long time that the Harmony spell cast by druids and rangers increased mana regeneration. This was because casting the spell on a player would force their client to update their current mana level, sometimes ahead of a meditation "tick," giving the illusion that the Harmony spell itself had increased the target's mana.
</li><li> The game's experience-sharing system and classes with XP penalties were the source of a <em>ton</em> of theory-crafting leading to mountains of false assumptions. In reality, no class or race had a penalty imposed on gained XP. Instead, certain classes and races required more XP per level than others. Furthermore, the way that XP was split amongst the party was based on total current XP, not level, so while it was true that certain class/race combinations received a larger chunk of the share, the actual percentages were usually grossly overstated. However, because Verant so vehemently hid the mechanics from the players, this led to many players falsely believing that those classes were imposing an experience penalty on the entire party, which in turn made those classes and races less likely to be invited into groups.
</li><li> Many players for years believed that performing certain actions in Castle Mistmoore, such as killing specific NPCs at specific times of day, using stealth to turn in certain rare quest items to specific hostile NPCs, or even peforming quest actions in completely different zones would cause Mayong Mistmoore, a dark elven vampire that's mired in EQ's lore, to spawn in the throne room of Castle Mistmoore. In reality, Mayong Mistmoore only appeared as part of GM events run by Verant's event staff, and is not an NPC that can normally spawn in-game.

However it supposedly still spawned occasionally and/or you could do something to make it show up. One rumor was that if you swam all the way to the end of this really long underwater tunnel in the lake you could flip a lever down there to make it show up. Alas, there was no such lever. Perhaps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag">as a result of such rumors</a> the Veil of Alaris expansion has a water based zone with both a kraken and a megalodon as rare monsters.

<ul><li> "Stop 'n' Swop" is an unlockable feature that displays special items you collect. The plan was for these items to be used in the sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoTooie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoTooie">Banjo-Tooie</a></em> (as hinted at by Mumbo Jumbo in the ending cutscene, even).

A fansite eventually had to release codes that allowed you to collect them; many of these codes are incredibly obtuse and as ridiculous as any rumor. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Rare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Rare">Rare</a>'s original plan was for the items to be transferred between cartridges by swapping them out while the game was running (hence the name "Stop 'n' Swop"), but this proved to be beyond the Nintendo 64's capabilities<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4k6vl');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4k6vl" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4k6vl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">early designs for the console stored game data in RAM long enough for players to swap the cartridges, but later versions reduced this time significantly, making the mechanic unfeasible</span>. <em>Banjo-Tooie</em> had to add in those features into the game itself (through items that resemble <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em> cartridges). Further rumors suggested that there are totally "legit" ways to get these items without using passwords (which suggests the only reason you don't get rewards for these items is because you used passwords to get them).
</li><li> For the Xbox Live re-release, Rare gave <em>Banjo-Tooie</em> its own "Stop 'n' Swop II" feature, which spawned its own rumors.

Additionally, Phoenix Magnion in <em>Zero 2</em> has an attack that summons four images based on <em>Mega Man X</em> antagonists, two of which are shaped like Vile from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX1">the first game</a> and Colonel from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX4">Mega Man X4</a></em>, who could be mistaken for Sigma's first phase from <em>X1</em> due to them both using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserBlade">Laser Blades</a>.

<ul><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metroid1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metroid1">Metroid</a></em> has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PasswordSave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PasswordSave">Password Save</a> system that accepts certain interesting combinations. "NARPAS SWORD" (followed by blanks or zeroes) is one of the most famous of them, and it was put into the game intentionally. However, fans took this to mean that there was a "Narpas Sword" of some kind in the game; there isn't. It's really supposed to be "NAR PASSWORD", and there are different theories as to what "NAR" means. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0uhed');"><sup>It's actually...&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0uhed" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0uhed');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">a reference to Tohru <strong>Nar</strong>ihito (who converted the game to cartridge format from the Famicom Disk System version, thus giving it its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PasswordSave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PasswordSave">Password Save</a> feature).</span>
</li><li> <em>Metroid</em> also lets you see Samus in a bikini if you finished the game in less than an hour, and certain passwords will let you play the whole game with her in that state. This led to rumors that you can see her naked if you beat it in an inhumanly possible time, which is not the case. One such password that works is "JUSTIN BAILEY", which people thought was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Meaningful Name</a> (but really just coincidentally looks like someone's name); the strangest is the idea that "bailey" is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AustralianSlang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AustralianSlang">Australian Slang</a> for a swimsuit (which it isn't).
</li><li> The suitless Samus rumors continued with later games like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid">Super Metroid</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em>; all of them let you see her without the suit if you beat them fast enough, but none of them actually let you play without the suit (or in any state of undress, really). The desire to play suitless in <em>Super Metroid</em> has led to various fan-made hacks that let you do so.
</li><li> One site discussed a myth that you could play as boss Kraid if you beat <em>Metroid</em> fast enough.
</li><li> <em>Metroid</em> actually caused an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invertedtrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invertedtrope">inversion</a>; many gaming magazines pointed out the statue room as a shortcut to Tourian, akin to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarpZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarpZone">Warp Zone</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em>. They presented it as a secret of some kind, when in fact it's the <em>only</em> way to get to Tourian. This then led to rumors that there is a longer, "legitimate" way to get there which doesn't exist.

There were quite a few rumors about ways to obtain this form of Spyro in the actual game. They're all false, of course. The dragon is one of the first rescuable dragons in the game.

No matter what, it is impossible to glide or otherwise get to it, and you will lose lives in the process. Of course, rumors spread about what is on this island, such as another egg or a secret level. Eventually, it was discovered through hacking that the island contains three life butterflies, and that's it. The game artist claimed that it was originally supposed to be where the Super Bonus Round stage was located, but it was moved to a different location, and the original island was never removed. Somebody did manage to <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v84tOqL0fd0">recreate the whirlwind that was initially supposed to take the player there.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>

At that time, only two games had them, and they usually got the benefit of the doubt, since accessing them was based more on luck (using an otherwise inoperable teleporter late at night in a specific level). Typical instructions were usually to do something challenging like reaching the end of a bridge that gets destroyed in the first level you can never go back to. With <em>A Crack in Time</em>, the museum is unlocked more predictably (beating an extra boss, or a pre-order bonus), and the claims mostly died out.

First, people argued over whether or not it even exists (emulator hacks and cheats were eventually developed that prove it does). Then people argued over how to access it legitimately (still unknown).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ToyStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ToyStory">Toy Story</a></em>, naturally, had a rumor that you can play as Buzz via cheat code. No such code was ever discovered, and the only known cheats are level skipping and invincibility.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ToyStory2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ToyStory2">Toy Story 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> Cheat websites will tell of "Woody's Workshop" which can supposedly be accessed if you collect 100 coins on the first level "Andy's House" and then go and see Hamm. Supposedly, if this was done, he would take you to "Woody's Workshop", a secret area which gave you cheat-codes to the game, special power-ups (such as an infinite green laser), and level shortcuts. However, there are only 97 coins on the first level, making it totally impossible. Despite this, you can still find "Woody's Workshop" listed on every possible cheat website that <em>Toy Story 2</em> is listed on.
</li><li> Another rumour was that if you beat the final level without giving Mr. Potato Head back any of his missing body parts after collecting them, you'll unlock a secret level named "Potato Head Island" wherein you have to fight a giant Mr. Potato Head seeking revenge on Buzz for stealing his body parts. Once again, this level does not exist. The final level can be beat without giving back Mr. Potato Head's parts, but in order to complete the entire game, the parts need to be collected in order to obtain every single Pizza Planet Token.
</li><li> There was another claim on some websites that beating the game would let you unlock a two-player mode, with the second player being Woody, Jessie, Bullseye, and in some claims, even Zurg himself. This, much like "Woody's Workshop", is totally untrue. Beating the game only unlocks an extra movie clip or two.

This is a cheap trick to get you sent back to the starting chamber when you're about to win.

It is possible, but <em>very</em> difficult, to score over 6 million in all four fan sequels (<em>Level Packs 1-4</em>). The official sequel, <em>Chip's Challenge 2</em>, makes it easier for having 200 levels (the first game and the fan sequels all have only 149 each).

It doesn't help that there is a line later in the game (in Suldanessellar) that suggests the character was originally planned to stick around through the later acts, as well as a line in <em>Throne of Bhaal</em> where you can attempt to ask the Fates to resurrect him (but they refuse to do this for plot reasons). There <em>is</em> a global override variable in the game that allows you to get past this (albeit one so profane and so obscure that it was likely only intended as a developer in-joke) and a manner of exploiting the game to keep him in your party, but no such plot-related reason allows you to keep him past the midway point of the plot.

Some players tried everything; trying to drop it in front of bosses, locations, characters and bonfires, or seeing if it unlocks special dialogue or interactions with the game's covenants. He later revealed that he was just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator">playing a prank</a> by leading people to pick a starting gift that does nothing at all.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsI">Dark Souls</a></em>, there are various rumors on how to progress through the game without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerPunch">having to kill Sif</a>. For example, when Sif's health gets low enough, it starts limping and becomes unable to swing its sword; one rumor claims that during this time, you can hit the sword to break it, allowing you to win the fight while sparing Sif. In fact, no such method exists; you have to kill Sif to complete the game.
</li><li> Shortly after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls2">Dark Souls 2</a></em> was released, a rumour spread that there is a form of copy protection present in the game files that, when activated, will throw a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare">Jump Scare</a> at the unsuspecting player. Anyone who played the game immediately figured out that it's a hoax, as a certain NPC mentioned in the story doesn't actually exist. <a class="urllink" href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/236430/discussions/0/558754259728970660/">Here's the thread.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigimonWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigimonWorld">Digimon World</a></em> has many rumors about "secret" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mons">Mons</a> not listed in the Digimon chart, particularly those that are known to exist in the game but aren't normally available. For example, Metal Etemon and Gigadramon function more or less properly, as do their digivolution items, but there is no way to obtain them without the help of a cheating device. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait">The "hints" you can find around the Internet</a> tell a different story.
</li><li> A specific example spawned from the normally-unobtainable Digivolution items is the Moon Mirror, which is supposed to digivolve your partner into WereGarurumon but actually does nothing. According to rumors, the item actually partially worked in the original Japanese release of the game, but only when used on a Garurumon (<em>none</em> of the Digivolution items in the game are restricted to a single Digimon, barring the Numemon-only Monzaemon suit which is less a Digivolution item and more a plot device) and even then only WereGarurumon's feet would be visible, and doing almost anything other than walking around supposedly crashed the game. Dissecting the game's code shows that the only remains of WereGarurumon in there are Digivolution stats, an incomplete finishing move, a 2D sprite for tournaments, and the Moon Mirror itself - no version of the game contains any kind of model or animation data it would need to actually appear in-game.
</li><li> The Prima guide for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigimonWorld2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigimonWorld2">Digimon World 2</a></em> hints that a secret Digimon, Kimeramon, can somehow be found in the game, but doesn't give any explicit instructions on how to find him. Data for him exists in the game, and he is fully functional, but the only way anyone knew how to get him was with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GameShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GameShark">GameShark</a>. In the years that followed, various rumors about how he can be obtained surfaced (mostly revolving around the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a>, Tera Domain, and how he has a small chance of spawning on one of its floors), and people posted stories claiming to have found him, but no evidence of it ever surfaced. Years later, it was discovered that, in the Japanese version of the game, he can be obtained via the use of a PocketStation and a separate game, via an NPC in the Coliseum. Since the PocketStation was never released outside of Japan, this NPC was cut in the NA version of the game, giving credence to the idea that the Prima guide is mistaken, and that Kimeramon was simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a>. Some people in the game's small community remained so fixated on the issue despite this that they data-mined the game and found more and more evidence that he really cannot be obtained, such as him being absent from the game's encounter list, which all but debunks the myth.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigimonWorld3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigimonWorld3">Digimon World 3</a></em> continued the series tradition with rumors about secret partner Digimon you could add to your party by fulfilling some obtuse tasks and Digivolutions for existing partner Digimon who, naturally, required absurd stats to unlock. A notable example of the latter was the nonexistent "Kaseidramon", who was supposedly only unlockable on Veemon and was originally from a "Japan-only" Digimon movie. There even used to be a multi-page document floating around the Internet which detailed his backstory, explaining how he was originally conceived for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a></em> but had to be axed due to his considerably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> nature not sitting right with Toei Animation.

This myth went un-busted until September 2014, when Dragon's Den, the largest English-language <em>Dragon Quest</em> fan site, tracked down a video of a play-through where the player marries Nera and none of this happens. Dragon's Den proceeded to trace the source of the rumor and found it originated as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">dark joke</a> in one of the first online FAQs for the game, which predates even the first fan translation; since this FAQ was many Western players' first experience with <em>DQV</em>, it was taken at face value, and thus nobody married Nera to verify the claim.

</li><li> Also in <em>Fallout 2</em>, many rumors abounded regarding Sulik's sister Kurisu and methods for actually finding her in game. Such is the frustration at not eventually rescuing her that some mods have placed her in the game. The planned <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutVanBuren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutVanBuren">Van Buren</a></em> version of <em>Fallout 3</em> planned to tie up that dangling plot by including her with an explanatory backstory, but it was never realized due to the project's cancellation. The only way the story can genuinely be given closure is if you download the Restoration Project, which will add a quest where you can find Sulik's sister at a slavers camp and then free her as well as the other slaves.
</li><li> Numerous <em>Fallout 2</em> walkthroughs stated that a street boy named Cody from New Reno will show you the crashed alien ship location like in <em>Fallout 1</em>, and give you the Alien Blaster &#151; a powerful beam weapon. They came with photoshopped screenshots. There is no such location, but the Alien Blaster is available elsewhere. It is possible to talk to Cody and give him food, but he is very easy to scare off, making this rumor hard to disprove.
</li><li> Because of New Reno residents remarking that the Chosen One should have used his mutated toe on Horrigan after the end of the game, many <em>Fallout 2</em> fans believed that the mutated toe could be used as a device to kill the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> instantly. In the game, the toe is not enough to kill Horrigan or bring any serious harm to him, though it lowers his HP (like it does to any other creature, including the Chosen One) from 999 to 996. Chris Avellone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed">Jossed</a> the rumor several times in <em>Fallout Bible</em> and confirmed that the remark of New Reno residents was merely a bad joke.

The origin is a two-frame animated gif which shows Dogmeat shooting lasers from his mouth, and this encouraged fans to expend hours of time and go to great lengths &mdash; up to and including killing Dogmeat &mdash; in an attempt to get him to use the Wazer Wifle.
</li><li> Also from <em>Fallout 3</em>, rumors claimed that under the right circumstances, Galaxy News Radio would turn into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumbersStations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumbersStations">number station</a> that would diffuse both dates and messages in Morse code refering to several events in the real world. Such events include an unknown man confessing the murder of Abraham Lincoln and framing of John Wilkes Booth, Britney Spears winning an Oscar in 2023 and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a> after a failed scientific experiment in 2027.

A trailer full of radio equipment which holds little to no interest (the location designer confirmed it was added only as a nod to a personal anecdote) but unproved rumors about either a unique NPC wearing wolf pelts appearing there or the radio equipment diffusing children's screams, starting a quest to track and stop a serial killer, exist. Likewise, a rumor about a ghost at Nellis AFB (allegedly inspired by the story of a servicewoman who commited suicide while on duty there) or spooky noises and whispers in the Goodsprings Cemetery are not unheard of.
</li><li> There was once a rumor that the canon ending of <em>New Vegas</em> was confirmed by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> to be the NCR ending. The rumor was so prevalent that even people on this site were making entries based on it. The main supporting evidence for the rumor was the Kellogg's memory sequence, which mentions a rapidly-expanding NCR. Many players took this to mean that the NCR has defeated the Legion and is expanding unopposed. However, what these players forgot was that Kellogg is way too old to have been a child around the time of New Vegas. Plus, since Kellogg is revealed to be a 100-year-old cyborg, his memory actually takes place all the way back in <em>Fallout 2</em>, when the NCR was indeed expanding rapidly. No actual mention to the NCR by the time of New Vegas is made in the game. Another supporting evidence for the rumor is some alleged dialogue from western traders that states the NCR wins, but said dialogue is never found.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Kingdom Hearts II</a></em>, it was rumored that one can unlock King Mickey as a summon by finishing Jiminy's Journal, returning to Disney Castle, and entering a newly-created door/portal in the area. In there, the player will have to clear the entire room of Heartless alongside King Mickey before he gives Sora the King's Charm, which can summon him. According to the myth, the King's Charm costs "four bar of Guard"(?). Interestingly enough, one version of this myth requires the player to beat the Lingering Will to obtain it.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaIIRiseOfTheSinistrals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaIIRiseOfTheSinistrals">Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals</a></em> has a locked door in the final area that was rumored to be openable if all the Iris Treasures were obtained from the Ancient Cave. The woman who stores them for you hints that something may happen if they're all gathered, a major character <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who is one of the Sinistrals</span> is named Iris, and the Iris Treasures are <em>extremely</em> time-consuming to collect (one can only be obtained through a boss battle that's all but rigged, while the others are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops">random drops</a> in a 99-level dungeon). For years, gamers looked for an explanation beyond them just being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">Bragging Rights Rewards</a> until the rumor was finally killed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> &mdash; which really pissed off the fans who essentially wasted fifty hours of their lives on this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarEternalBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarEternalBlue">Lunar: Eternal Blue</a></em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaCD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaCD">Sega CD</a> has a weapon in the game manual called the Dark Scimitar which is not included in the final release of the game. Many fan communities went wild trying to find out where the Dark Scimitar is located (believing that if it was in the manual, it <em>had</em> to be hidden in the game somewhere). A fan finally found a way to get it (along with many other unusual items) through a glitch that's created when characters, specifically Lemina (the glitch is called the Lemina Bug for that reason), leave your party.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic">Might and Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Might &amp; Magic VI</em> has its share of rumours, being the most successful of the series. There were rumours of a white goblin and an elaborate "flute quest" which originate from the fact that there is a flute quest item in the game, only it doesn't do anything; it's probably a leftover from a removed quest.
</li><li> The map for <em>Might &amp; Magic VII</em> includes a frozen landmass to the northwest of the main continent named "Vori". Absolutely no mention of it is made in-game, and there is no way to travel there &mdash; which, of course, didn't stop some people from claiming that you can.
</li></ul></li><li> Lots of rumors surround Giygas, the final boss of <em>Mother 2</em> (<em>a.k.a.</em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em>) &mdash; specifically, that it's meant to represent a fetus. It was claimed that you can see an image of a fetus if you look in the background at a very specific time, and that you can hear Giygas crying for help when you defeat him (busted <a class="urllink" href="http://herbaldrink.deviantart.com/art/VGMythBusters-Giygas-67655728">by this guy<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, and that sort of thing is beyond the SNES's sound capability anyway). It doesn't help that the boss arena resembles a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WombLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WombLevel">Womb Level</a>, and that the battle takes place in the past. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3">Mother 3</a></em> didn't help matters when it revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the world of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em> was destroyed, and you are living in a different world with all the survivors</span>; this led to another theory suggesting that this happened because killing Giygas in the past causes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalParadox">Temporal Paradox</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MysticArk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MysticArk">Mystic Ark</a></em> was long held up as an actual sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/The7thSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/The7thSaga">The 7th Saga</a></em>, rather than a mere <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a>, until someone finally started work on translating the game and discovered right off the bat that their stories are entirely unrelated.
</li><li> A bunch for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em>:
<ul><li> There were some rumors revolving around how to get the "true ending", due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">the last game in the franchise</a> having a "normal ending"/"true ending" split. Most involve <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Goro Akechi, with the original theory saying you needed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelUpAtIntimacy5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelUpAtIntimacy5">max his Confidant</a> to save him from his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BolivianArmyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BolivianArmyEnding">Bolivian Army Ending</a>.</span> This one was jossed after players verified that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his Confidant ranks up automatically, and you cannot hang out with him.</span> The next theory involved maxing out <em>all</em> Confidants and visiting the protagonist's school on the last day after giving your notebook to Sojiro, which will unlock <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Goro's Palace.</span> While this was ultimately proven false, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> shadow negotiation dialogue implies that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Goro was planned to have a palace</span>.
</li><li> Another common rumor around the time of the game's release, likely due to their on-screen chemistry, was that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PairTheSpares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PairTheSpares">Ryuji would hook up with Ann if you didn't romance her</a>. This isn't true.
</li><li> A few rumours about the bad endings of certain palaces also became widespread after the game was released, with the most notable one being that failing to complete <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Futaba's Palace on time would result in her commiting suicide, and her family suing both Sojiro and the protagonist over it, as well as Haru's fiance Sugimura personally suing the Phantom Thieves should Okumura's Palace not be completed on time as well</span>. After the game was released in English, some fans began claiming these bad endings were changed for the localization. In actuality, the bad ending for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Futaba's Palace</span> has the protagonist arrested for coercion, blackmail, and suspicion for being a phantom thief, while <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Okumura's Palace</span> has the protagonist being arrested after an anonymous tip is sent in claiming he is the leader of the Phantom Thieves, and both of these are identical between the English and Japanese versions.
</li></ul></li><li> In a case of a rumor coming true in a later revision of a game, players were finally allowed to legitimately reverse <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nei's death</span> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">remake</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarII">Phantasy Star II</a></em>. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">extremely hard and time-consuming</a> to pull off, and it also requires <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus">a save file from the remake</a> of the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStar">Phantasy Star</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment">Planescape: Torment</a></em> has a few persistent rumors about alternate ending animations (based on the unused evil/neutral ending songs on the soundtrack), a proper romantic subplot with Fall-From-Grace (originally intended but removed for budget/time constraints), the ability to read Fall-From-Grace's diary, and an opportunity to have sex with Annah if you keep her invisible "morale" stat at maximum level at all times. She does come onto you at one point, describing in good detail the things she plans on doing to you, but any further dialogue choices will result in her backing off and claiming she wasn't serious.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecretOfMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecretOfMana">Secret of Mana</a></em>, there was a rumor that both the Girl and the Sprite can receive another elemental since they only have seven each, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingSecret">there are eight elemental slots</a> (when you look at their magic descriptions). However this rumor can easily be dispelled by the fact that while each character only gets seven summons, there are eight <em>total</em> &#151; only the Sprite gets dark magic, and only the girl gets Light. Naturally, the Girl has an empty space where dark magic would be; likewise the Sprite for light magic.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia">Tales of Vesperia</a></em>'s GameFAQs board started a minor rumor about getting into Estelle's room. You can't, except in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">the PS3 version</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a></em>:

It wasn't until twenty-odd years later that anyone had the courage to debunk it, when the head of Aeon Genesis, the team who fan translated the game, Gideon Zhi declared the rumor false on Twitter.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegamiTenseiII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegamiTenseiII">Megami Tensei II</a></em> had a few of its own:
<ul><li> Normally, you can only create Good and Neutral demons through fusion, but rumor had it that there was a way to create Evil demons too. The guy in the first town even mentions that he's working on a way to fuse demons that can't normally be fused. Unfortunately, it can't be done without a cheat device, leaving potential <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game Breakers</a> like Tiamat and Girimekhala unusuable.
</li><li> There was also a rumor that you could finish the game without siding with the Partner and abandoning the Friend, either in the original or in the remake. This, again, is impossible without cheating: you can't finish the game without the Water Seal, and you can't get that without the Partner in your party.

Despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> that such a device is not in the final game, screenshots of it are actually printed on the back cover of the game, and it wasn't until the source was released that it was confirmed to be absent. Likewise for the secret code that makes the Pkunk Fury ship immortal.
</li><li> There's also the legendary Black Spathi Squadron, a splinter faction of the Spathi composed of brave warriors who fly Eluders painted jet black and fight bravely throughout the universe! They're not actually in the game, of course.

One is that you have to get to Stage 99 to do it. Easily the most straightforward example of wish-fulfillment on this page, and a good chunk of <em>Duck Hunt</em> hacks let you do just that. It's entirely possible in the arcade version, but only in the bonus round &#151; if you accidentally shoot the dog, the bonus round immediately ends and the dog walks out in bandages and on crutches to admonish you to "SHOOT THE DUCKS, NOT ME!"

There was an urban legend about there being a run-and-gun shooting level taking place in a graveyard. Completely bogus...although it may have led to the addition of the third-person shooter levels of the second PS2 game. There were also rumors of a flying level, which actually appears in <em>Super Spy Hunter</em>, although that's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DolledUpInstallment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DolledUpInstallment">Dolled-Up Installment</a>.

</li><li> In the original <em>Neoquest</em> game there exists a door that's locked and has no apparent means of opening it. For years people tried various means of unlocking the door or obtaining the key, to no avail. To make it worse, the staff hasn't revealed whether it's actually possible to open the door.
</li><li> The Neopets Team has a somewhat haphazard approach to how they build new features on the site, which can lead to confusion and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">Wild Mass Guessing</a>. The Discarded Magical Blue Grundo Plushie of Prosperity, for example, was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">a page with a discarded magical blue Grundo plushie</a> and nothing else. The sticking part is the "prosperity" part, as it seemed to do absolutely nothing. Rumors abounded on how to make it pay off, from the standard blatant lies about achieving impossible conditions resulting in a reward of rare items to more placebo effect-driven claims that it increases the frequency of Random Events. The truth? TNT just hadn't had the chance to activate it yet. Years after it was programmed in, they added the option to talk to the plushie, which can result in various good or bad effects (which is just part of an overhaul of the world it resides in).
</li><li> New players can get this from the veterans, as the Neopets world is rife with old, inactive features and locations left over from previous events.
</li><li> There's also the infamous Bonju avatar (avatars being essentially the Neopets equivalent of "achievements", rewarding you with little icons for your user lookup/forum posts for completing specific tasks around the site), which had players puzzling for <em>three years</em> over how to unlock it, and was the subject of countless wild rumors. TNT finally caved in and revealed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">ridiculously obtuse</a> solution in one of their editorials. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mix a Blumaroo Steak, Gourmet Cooking for your Pet and Orange juice at the Mystery Island Cooking Pot - NOT Bonju's cooking pot.

On one forum, a lot of rumors spread about how to open the door and what you'll get. In actuality, it's just a piece of leftover code that was blocked off rather than removed.
</li><li> The numerous rumors that sprung up about acquiring the animals that hung around Forget-Me-Not Valley, which all wear neckerchiefs like the one that the player's dog wears. Carter's and Flora's Chihuahua are especially popular. Despite all rumors, the only pets you can own are the initial dog and a cat that Romana later gives you.
</li><li> All those rumors for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonFriendsOfMineralTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonFriendsOfMineralTown">Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town</a></em> and its female counterpart about how you can get your dog to have puppies. This one's likely because you can do so in <em>Back To Nature</em>, which <em>Mineral Town</em> is a remake of.
</li><li> One that runs throughout the series &#151; in the games where you can marry the Harvest Goddess, your child will possess farm-improving magical powers.
</li><li> That leaving your dog in your greenhouse in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon64">Harvest Moon 64</a></em>, <em>Back To Nature</em> or <em>Mineral Town</em> will keep it from being destroyed by storms. This persists even after people posted video proof that it doesn't work.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonMagicalMelody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonMagicalMelody">Harvest Moon: Magical Melody</a></em> has the "Rival marriage" system that was apparently left out of the international versions. The supposed "marriage pictures" are fanworks.
</li><li> There are often single characters who are well-liked, such as Carter from <em>More Friends of Mineral Town</em> and Flora from <em>A Wonderful Life</em>, who have rumors on how to marry them. They're never courtable.
</li><li> Doctor from <em>Friends of Mineral Town</em> is named "Tim" and reveals this in an event. In reality, he is only ever called "Doctor". His name is <em>Trent</em> according to the DS games. This rumor is likely mixing him up with a dog named "Tim" from <em>Back to Nature</em>.
</li><li> In <em>Back to Nature: For Girl</em>, there's a reoccuring rumor that you can keep playing if you marry Gray. That's not true. Even with him the game ends after marriage.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory">Rune Factory</a> 2</em>, there are two: One where there are methods to find the rumored ghost that haunts the clinic at night - never mind that Jake specifically tells you that he started that rumor as a joke. The other is a way to unlock a so-called "third generation", presumably with the child of Aaron/Aria and his/her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodMarriagePromise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodMarriagePromise">"betrothed"</a>. Mentioning this on an HM forum is a good way to start a chain of mocking replies regarding the ridiculous things that will "unlock" the third generation (i.e. feeding Herman every recipe, even the stuff he hates, or fighting Douglas, Gordon and/or Jake in a duel)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing">Animal Crossing</a></em>:

He is claimed to move in if you neglect your game for too long, speaks and sends letters in binary, and has a house full of nothing but fish that crashes after entering it. He apparently leaves the town after just one day. Everyone who claims to have seen him has either misplaced their cameras or had him...mysteriously disappear as they were getting ready to snap a photo. The one "screenshot" available on the internet is clearly edited.
</li><li> Then there were the numerous other rumors of what Resetti does to you if you continue to reset long after he nearly has a stroke trying to hammer in "RESET THE GAME <em><strong>NOT</strong></em>!" into your head. Without going into the more gory or "colorful" outcomes that are blatantly false, one particular (and common) variant to this rumor is that if you reset over 60 times, Resetti will finally get fed up and dig like crazy underground, migrating all the neighbor's homes up a hill from below and causing all the neighbors to be mad at you for a week. Less outrageous (but just as false) is the rumor that his joke about erasing the player's save data stops merely being a joke at some point (this also tends to be claimed to be triggered by a certain amount of resets). The reality is, after a certain number of resets, the game simply loops through the last six conversations.
</li><li> There was one rumor floating around for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube">Nintendo GameCube</a> version that if you open your file every day and talk to the same neighbor (again, every day) for a straight year, you'll have the option to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance">marry that neighbor</a>.

</li><li> When the series was new, gamers didn't know what could and could not be done. There were various rumors on how you could date or even marry villagers, add new buildings (like libraries) to the town, start those clubs that villagers mention, and get your own car similar to Gracie's. These rumors died out by <em>Wild World</em>.
</li><li> The release of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossingNewHorizons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossingNewHorizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> has caused new rumors to emerge. Claims spread when the game first came out that the island (both the one you live in and the ones you visit on mystery tours) would be procedurally generated and no two islands will be the same. Data miners have proven this false and released topology maps of all the islands encoded into the game as proof. Later, claims spread on social media that if you use the joy command in the airport until Orville the dodo starts blushing, your chances of getting flown to a rare island increases. Data miners and regular players alike have also proven this false, with data miners who reverse-engineered the code remarking that the island would be statistically chosen and then encoded into the ticket at time of redemption.

Of course, this was proven untrue both by the fact that none of the houses in Pleasantview <em>even have</em> basements, and because she cannot be found in Sim PE, which a deceased character would be able to be.
</li></ul></li><li> An old rumor was that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SimCity2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SimCity2000">SimCity 2000</a></em> contained a secret "Lost Arcology", with several convincing-looking screenshots floating around (the inclusion of one such screenshot in a licensed strategy guide implied that it may have been present in early versions of the game). Accessing it was typically said to be via ridiculous, impossible methods (like having your city reach a population of 100 trillion, when the limitations of the game put the maximum theoretical population somewhere in the double digit millions).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nintendogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nintendogs">Nintendogs</a></em> has had its fair share of these over the years:
<ul><li> The most common one is that your dogs can breed. This is despite the fact they're puppies who can't be more than 3-to-5 months old aren't old enough to breed. Numerous videos exist "proving" this can occur.
</li><li> To go with the above, your puppy never grows. Many fans cite their dog aging into adulthood but that's not true.
</li><li> Despite rumor, your dog or cat cannot die or permanently run away. The manuals specifically mention that your puppy will not die.

To put it simply, the enemy monsters are a Boss monster that is unable to be unlocked for yourself, with the exception of Japan-only White Mocchi. Didn't stop thousands of rumors about them, though.
</li><li> There have been rumors of dead animals in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZooTycoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZooTycoon">Zoo Tycoon 2</a></em> turning into ghosts as an Easter egg.

</li><li> New players to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X">X-Universe</a></em> games are often enjoined to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnipeHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnipeHunt">go look for the UFO base</a>, a station that's supposedly the source of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingSaucer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingSaucer">flying saucers</a> you occasionally see flying around and sells every item and ship in the game dirt cheap.

Shortly after its US release, a rumor cropped up asserting that the Japanese version has a bug to allow same-gender marriages, and that it had been patched out despite player requests to leave it in. No such bug actually exists, though, and any screenshots of an apparent same-gender couple are due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeLooksLikeALady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeLooksLikeALady">Dude Looks Like a Lady</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLooksLikeADude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLooksLikeADude">Lady Looks Like a Dude</a>. This can be exploited, of course, by deliberately giving one Mii the wrong gender so they can marry someone of the "same" gender, but that's possible in all versions and in no way a bug, since there's no imaginable way to detect whether a player is doing this.

There's still no way to control Snake during the actual Big Shell Incident, however.
</li><li> Also rumours of a FAMAS being available on the Tanker chapter; these are based on early trailers, and the weapon itself doesn't show up in the final game. This was further fueled by the flashback footage showing Snake using the FAMAS against the guards on the Tanker.

Some of the biggest include:
<ul><li> That there was something planned with all the unused level space outside Camp Omega in <em>Ground Zeroes</em>. Various videos showcase all of the buildings and terrain outside Omega itself via clipping through the gates, including detailed textures and far more space than what is normally visible inside the camp. While this may have been intended to be part of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus">Old Save Bonus</a> that would have transferred to <em>Phantom Pain</em>, nothing appears in the final version and the only remnant of Camp Omega is in a <em>Metal Gear Online</em> map, now cloaked in fog and called "Black Site".
</li><li> That the "Classified Intel Acquisition" tape found in a Side-Op in <em>Ground Zeroes</em> is actually a secret audio recording that <a class="urllink" href="https://www.msx.org/forum/msx-talk/general-discussion/metal-gear-solid-5-cassette-tape">contains untranslated data from the MSX game system<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. There was rampant speculation as to its true purpose, including claims that it might be a secret message from Kojima himself or used to unlock additional content in <em>Phantom Pain</em> (and there is an additional MSX-related tape that could be found in that game). It was eventually discovered that the MSX data is an incomplete ROM for the game "The Portopia Serial Murder Case" (which inspired Kojima when he was younger), and that there is no hidden secret to be found.
</li><li> That there is an alleged missing chapter of the game, referred to as "Chapter 3", which was removed prior to the release of the game and was/is intended to be released as a content patch. Fans often refer to this missing content due to the unfinished nature of some plotlines (notably, Eli and the child soldiers steal Sahelanthropus from Mother Base and fly away to parts unknown). Evidence pointing to this includes a supposedly-unused entire ending detailing Mother Base celebrating global disarmament (in actuality, it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">difficult-to-unlock ending that requires the online FOB mode</a>), the existence of an unused and incomplete mission called "Kingdom of the Flies" (which appears in a pre-viz/animatic form on the Collector's Edition extras disc) and supposed hints in-game that there is more content to be discovered. This even <a class="urllink" href="http://gamingbolt.com/metal-gear-solid-5-producer-responds-to-secret-chapter-questions-as-fans-rally-to-unlock-it">got the attention of producer Ken-ichiro Imaizumi<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, who stoked the fires by claiming that he "couldn't tell" the fanbase what needs to be unlocked. It even inspired <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NeverBeGameOver">an entire sub-Reddit forum<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> dedicated to datamining its secrets. Although there are aspects of a "Chapter 3" still on-disc (namely, text files referring to a number of scrapped missions that are all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardModeFiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardModeFiller">Hard Mode Filler</a> of missions from earlier in the game) and a "Chapter 3" title card, it appears that nothing new was intended and most people have given up on waiting for the alleged content patch.
</li><li> There were also <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/3kbjuq/spoilerish_somethings_coming_on_911/">rumors<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that an alleged content patch would be unlocked on September 11, 2015. This is in reference to an image of the World Trade Center towers that appears at the end of the unused "Kingdom of the Flies" mission with Liquid Snake's famous line ("It's not over yet!"), as well as a site called Ingsoc.org that referred to an unrevealed game called "Black Hound". While the "Black Hound" game is a real title (though not developed by Kojima or Konami - it's developed by an individual coasting on the uncertainty and confusion around <em>Phantom Pain</em>), no such content patch ever arrived.

<ul><li> There's an underground graveyard level called the Bonehoard. You have a rough map of this place, which insinuates the existence of an area called "The Alarus Extension", which players tried for <em>years</em> to find. Not only is the extension sealed off, but it doesn't even exist in the level! Additionally, <em>Thief</em> players love to spread the falsehood to newbies that within this non-existent area exists a Bow Upgrade, along with complicated instructions on how to get into the extension. It often takes the gullible neophytes hours, if not days, to realize they've been duped. What doesn't help is that the Bonehoard level is one of the most frightening in the game, which puts players on edge right from the start. So you'd assume that, if you couldn't find it, you just weren't looking hard enough, and were being distracted by all the eerie noises and creepy rooms
</li><li> Many of the numerous fanmissions for the series like to make reference to one or the other, as well, either because the author thought it was funny or because s/he was deliberately messing with people's heads.

</li><li> Around March or April 1999, <em>Play</em> magazine were very excited over the discovery of a hidden gate in <em>Resident Evil 2</em>, opposite the police station. Speculation was that after going up to it, you can find some way to go through it, find <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil">Rebecca Chambers</a> fighting zombies, then play as her. Rebecca is likely a result of using a cheat cartridge or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">PC skin.</a> You can find the gate, but there is no way to go through it.
</li></ul></li><li> Rumors leading up to the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Remake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Remake">Resident Evil 3 (Remake)</a></em> claimed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">Nemesis</a> could chase you into safe rooms.

<ul><li> Many have claimed that the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill1">Silent Hill</a></em> game has an "Ambulance Ending" in which Harry rampages through the town in an ambulance This rumor often revolves around the bottle of distilled water in the alternate school. Supposedly, you can somehow use it build a bomb of some kind, which will allow you to blow open the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsurmountableWaistHighFence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsurmountableWaistHighFence">traffic gate</a> in front of the Alchemilla hospital. This is probably due to confusion with <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WivDg4oAXM8">a budget Japanese video game called<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <em>Zombies vs. Ambulances</em>.
</li><li> A common piece of joke fanart is the so-called "lost" UFO ending for <em>Silent Hill 4</em> (which doesn't have one).
</li><li> In the first <em>Silent Hill</em> you can allegedly "commit suicide" by nonstop running &#151; running until Harry dies from a heart attack. Which is odd, considering <em>James</em> is the heavy wheezer.
</li><li> Long ago, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a> items in Midwich Elementary such as distilled water and glucose were also the source of rumors that Cybil Bennett was originally supposed to be a playable character in an alternate scenario, and that the items were for her to use.
</li><li> There's an engine in the Shell station. Rumors say it can be installed in one of the cars, despite how the setting offers plenty to contradict this; too many paths are collapsed/caved in to travel freely by car, and protagonist Harry is a writer by trade, who is <em>highly</em> unlikely to know how to install an engine by himself.
</li><li> The boat cabin wheel is also a subject of discussion; it doesn't do anything in-game, but Harry has dialog for it. Current opinion holds that it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">part of a cut ending</a> involving boat travel a la <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2">Silent Hill 2</a></em>.
</li><li> Now there are claims that you can <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cheatmasters.com/new_cheats/2782/Silent_Hill_cheats.html">save Lisa and get an "Excellent" ending<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5ndgv');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5ndgv" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5ndgv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is possible in one of the routes in Silent Hill Play Novel, where Harry refuses to leave Lisa and the two goes deep into Nowhere.</span>.
</li><li> Rumor persists of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill3">Silent Hill 3</a></em>'s mysterious "secret" level inside the hospital (which is impossible to get to because even with hacking, there is just a big empty building with no textures) on the PC version. There are mods out there that can "make" the hospital, but there is no official way.
</li><li> At one time it was a pretty common rumour that completing extreme mode 10 would unlock Alessa's dress as an alternate costume. What you actually unlock is the God Of Thunder outfit.
</li><li> Another rumor comes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillOrigins">Silent Hill: 0rigins</a></em> (a.k.a. ZERO), where you can use the otherworld <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicMirror">mirror trick</a> to bypass the apartment level and head straight into the hotel. There is no normal way to do this even using the described trick because the apartment is <em>necessary</em> to trigger the events in the hotel.
</li><li> There existed rumors of a monster who stood on two legs and yelled much like a person when struck. You'd find them littering the streets, and they weren't terribly aggressive. Supposedly they would be found around Silent Hill, and could be encountered after beating Alchemilla, but before entering the Sanitarium, and were found frequently in houses. The truth is that these monsters existed in the beta and never made it into the full game.
</li><li> Shortly after its release, rumors existed of being able to play as The Bogeyman in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillDownpour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillDownpour">Silent Hill: Downpour</a></em> after completing the game multiple times. Supposedly one had to use every pre-order code in the game on the lockers at least once, and had to do so on a single file, meaning one would have to play through the game several times and look up all the codes. Of course, this is entirely false, as the codes were for <em>pre-orders</em> of the game. The code you got differed based on where you bought it, so people were never supposed to have these codes unless they pre-ordered the game, and were certainly never supposed to have all of them.
</li><li> Another one for Downpour focused on getting a special series of outfits that mimicked Harry's clothes, James clothes, Vincent's clothes, Henry's clothes, Travis's clothes, and Alex's clothes. You would have to finish every sidequest in the game in a single playthrough while also not dying at any point. While this is very doable, it doesn't give any rewards mentioned.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ClockTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ClockTower">Clock Tower</a>: The First Fear</em>, the game features multiple endings, many of which are determined by whether or not each of Jennifer's friends are killed off during the game, bar a few exceptions, some varying on what Jennifer does in the last few screens, while others are determined by acts unrelated to the girls. Out of those endings, many players have speculated on what would happen if Lotte survives, Anne <em>and</em> Laura survive, or all three girls live alongside Jennifer. Due to a mass number of glitches, it actually <em>is</em> possible to achieve these (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesJustHiding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesJustHiding">or in the former's case, technically count this by chalking it up to "if I don't see it, it didn't happen"</a>), but unlike the rumors which imply that all the girls can potentially be saved to earn the best ending possible, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight">the designers had partially anticipated this enough to automatically lead to ending F</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> which involves Jennifer being killed in the elevator; it's triggered if she had, at minimum, not witnessed either of Lotte's deaths. Note that it is also legally impossible without exploiting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">unpredictable</a> glitches to have both Anne and Laura survive.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a></em> franchise is so saturated and inundated with false rumors that <em>legitimate events</em> ingame have been confused for hoaxes in the past. Most infamous of these are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Shadow Freddy and Shadow Bonnie, rarely appearing animatronics who were introduced in the second game and originally received as hoax photoshops of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">recolored characters</a>.</span>
</li><li> Beating the first six nights in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a></em> unlocks a customizable seventh night that allows the player to set the difficulty of the Animatronics from "1" to "20". Naturally, this kickstarted a rumor that entering the numbers "1-9-8-7" will trigger either a cutscene, or will unlock a supposed "8th night". Neither are true, and putting in the "1987 code" causes Golden Freddy to jumpscare the player and crash the game. It turns out developer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ScottCawthon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ScottCawthon">Scott Cawthon</a> was well-aware that people would attempt this and added in the "1987 code" as a joke on the players.
</li><li> Another rumor that persisted in the early days of the game's release was that of "Sparky the Dog". The rumor was that Sparky is a hidden 6th Animatronic that either appears randomly, or if the player performs some form of various convoluted step-by-step instructions. Sparky is then said to appear in the "parts and service" room before vanishing. It turns out that Sparky doesn't exist in the game and is merely a fancharacter someone photoshopped into a screenshot of the game.
</li><li> The belief that, when you ran out of power, you could keep perfectly still to delay Freddy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare">Jump Scare</a> and hopefully buy enough time for the clock to roll over to 6AM has <em>consistently</em> persisted, and is even cited as fact on numerous pages of this very site, despite having been proven to be false by <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujg0Y5IziiY">this data miner<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> who analyzed the code of the game's AI. The belief was started by Phone Guy's suggestion to "play dead" if you ran out of power and simple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfirmationBias" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfirmationBias">Confirmation Bias</a> from merely getting lucky, when in fact how long he takes to jump scare you is entirely dictated by random and nothing in the game checks to see if you're moving the mouse.
</li><li> A rumor that that began spreading shortly after the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys2">Five Nights at Freddy's 2</a></em> centered around supposedly encountering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">the Purple Guy</a>. There are supposed screenshots and even video of the event showing players being attacked by the murderer. However, this also turned out to be a hoax. The screenshots were photoshopped images of Toy Chica combined with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Shadow Freddy</span>, and the videos were created by people who hacked into the game to create custom renders.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldisBasicsInEducationAndLearning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldisBasicsInEducationAndLearning">Baldi's Basics in Education and Learning</a></em>, the game plays out like a normal (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">and shoddy</a>) educational game until you begin getting "glitch" questions consisting entirely of scrambled gibberish that the player is forced to get wrong (and thus invoke the wrath of their easily angered teacher Baldi). When the game became unexpectedly popular, naturally rumors began flying around that there actually <em>is</em> one correct answer to Baldi's gibberish questions, and getting the questions correct would enable the player to complete the game without ever angering Baldi. If such an answer actually exists, it hasn't been discovered yet.

<ul><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a></em>, the normally peace-loving Gandhi was noted to start threatening players that "our words are backed with NUCLEAR WEAPONS!" around the time democracy and uranium became available, which was put down to an interaction of his Aggressiveness rating of 1 with the Democracy government lowering it further, causing an overflow glitch that "lowered" his Aggressiveness to 255. Years later, "Nuclear Gandhi" became a meme that was even acknowledged in <em>Civilization V</em> and <em>VI</em> by making the leader's AI fond of nukes. But when <em>Civ</em> creator Sid Meier released his memoirs in 2020, he explained the whole thing was bupkis - there was no overflow glitch, and Gandhi's threats were the same as other nuclear-powered civs in the first game, and making them was his AI's way of deterring war. That whole "glitch" story only got started in 2012, long after <em>Civilization I</em>'s release, when it was edited into a website called TV Tropes.
</li><li> There was a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em> rumor that gained a bit of momentum but died with the growth of the internet - that evidently, you can recruit Olan into your party. Part of the reason this had momentum was because hackers discovered he actually doesn't glitch the game out, implying that he <em>might have</em> been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">intended to join or return as a guest.</a>

It says that if you dismiss all of your clan members and do the mission "Wanted: Barmaid", Luso will become one.
</li><li> There are several from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> series.

<ul><li> A rumour that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil">Canas</a> could upgrade to a Dark Druid (the class of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>), due to the class appearing in the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttractMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttractMode">Attract Mode</a>.
</li><li> That all heavy weapons give more Weapon Exp. (They don't; many heavy weapons do tend to have higher wexp yields to compensate for the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">you won't be striking as often with them</a>, but this isn't always the case.) The weapon weight rumor was very popular during the early days of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance">Path of Radiance</a>, when people noticed that forging allows players to increase the weight of weapons. Since heavier weapons in the GBA games usually have higher Weapon Exp gains, people assumed that increasing the weight would increase the exp gains, and the rumor spread from there.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fire Emblem Fates</a></em>:
<ul><li> A very persistant rumour is that Azura and Silas were originally planned to be the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayOption">Gay Options</a>. This has no direct evidence or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> to back it up, and while a placeholder name for a support between the Female Avatar and Azura's children as siblings exists, there's no evidence of the Female Avatar having an S Support with Azura at any point in development. Also, the rumor about Silas being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayOption">Gay Option</a> can very easily be debunked by the fact that there were <em>never</em> any placeholder supports in any of the appropriate areas. Not only did Silas and a male Avatar not have an S-Rank at any point, Sophie and a female Kana never had any sibling supports, either.
</li><li> <em>Fates</em> had quite a few rumors about the plot flying around during the early days of fan translations as well. One of the biggest ones were the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CureYourGays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CureYourGays">Cure Your Gays</a> accusations aimed at Soleil's supports with a male Corrin (in fairness, the former's bisexuality is not well-conveyed in the original and really only comes up during their S support), which were at least partly responsible for the chain being completely rewritten for the English release. Another was that the ending of Revelation changed if the Avatar was married to Azura.

First, in <em>Gaiden</em>, Genny/Saber was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple">Fan-Preferred Couple</a>, because they were the only two characters whose endings said they got married without specifying who their spouse was. However, they were <em>never</em> officially stated to be a couple. This became important when <em>Echoes: Shadows of Valentia</em> rolled around. Many fans assumed that Genny/Saber had gotten <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking">sunk</a> due to the age gap (data mining revealed that Genny is 15 and Saber is 34), and a few other characters getting similar marriage endings. However, there was nothing to be sunk, as they were never canon in the first place.

</li></ul></li><li> A popular claim on various cheat/FAQ sites is that in the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShiningForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShiningForce">Shining Force</a></em>, if you use an exploit to get outside the town of Guardiana (by forcing an NPC to move into the path of a guard blocking the exit from the town), continue on to the first battle at the Gate, and proceed to clear it using only the player character/"Max", you will unlock something called "Shining Influence". It is never explained what this glitch would do, and some speculated that it would give an additional boost to the other party members for the rest of the game. It was later proven that no such item or glitch unlocks after completing the first battle solo &mdash; if anything, it's a major drawback because the player is subsequently unable to recruit the first four (normally mandatory) members who join you after speaking to the king for the first time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em>
<ul><li> A game mechanic example: all units (allied or enemy) throughout the franchise are classified as either a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealRobot">Real Robot</a>" (accurate and agile) or "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobot">Super Robot</a>" (strong and tough), yet some players have noticed there are certain units in some installments who don't belong in either classification (eg. a real dealing more damage than a super, or a super being more evasive than a real), deeming these units as "hybrid" robots (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Evangelions</a> being an example<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7qg2k');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note7qg2k" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7qg2k');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Despite the nature of their home series, Evangelions are treated as real robots in any <em>Super Robot Wars</em> appearance</span>). Most players insist there's no such thing as "hybrids": a unit is either a "real" or "super" - there is no in-between.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsDestiny">Super Robot Wars Destiny</a></em> has the infamous "armor bug", which is actually the result of enemy units packing far greater firepower than most other games provide them, such that the normally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable">Nigh-Invulnerable</a> super robots that rely on tanking hits through strong armor instead lack enough durability to survive through this method. This is such a radical departure from the norm for the franchise, which usually strongly favors super robots, that rumors began of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">Game-Breaking Bug</a> by players who didn't run the calculations.
</li><li> One persistent rumor sees fans claiming that Mist Rex, protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsK">Super Robot Wars K</a></em>, will be appearing in whatever game is upcoming. This is simply a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">Troll</a> joke, since Mist is hands-down the <strong>least</strong> popular protagonist who's ever appeared in <em>SRW</em> (details on <em>K</em>'s page) and is done to elicit angry reactions from fans not savvy enough to realize it's a joke.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TacticsOgre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TacticsOgre">Tactics Ogre</a></em>, you were said to be able to recruit Lans Tartare, Balzepho, and Volac. However, battle data for Volac does not exist in the game, and as it turns out you can't make the three join you unless you hack them in, or any of the Dark Knights for that matter. Not to mention, saying those three are recruitable carries an implication that Balzepho would actually join forces with Haborym - which, given their history together, would end in disaster. The fact that younger Lans Tartare was the incredibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist">idealistic</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">sympathetic</a> protagonist of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaidenGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaidenGame">his own game</a> probably helped this along. However, the remake actually <em>does</em> make one of the Dark Knights recruitable &mdash; instead of one of those three, it's <em>Ozma</em>, who has become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Ascended Extra</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Worms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Worms">Worms</a></em>:
<ul><li> Team17 mentioned in passing to magazine PC Zone that a mission pack was coming out for a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Worms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Worms">Worms</a></em> game (<em>Worms 2</em>) that would make worms babies and set missions at night.
</li><li> Then, of course, their most infamous claim, made on April 1st, was the **spaceman** cheat, which supposedly summons a UFO in <em>Worms 2</em>. Many people tried it before the official announcement at Noon that day that it was an April Fools joke.
</li><li> Team17 had a bit of fun with this when they made an announcement regarding <em>Worms 4: Mayhem</em> on April 1, claiming that in this game you would be able to use the ninja rope to pull crate drops closer towards you. This turned out to be absolutely true.
</li></ul></li><li> An interesting case in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCom">X-COM</a></em>. The original game, <em>UFO Defence/Enemy Unknown</em> (the name was changed in certain countries) had a bug in which the difficulty of the game would always be set to the easiest, regardless of what difficulty you actually picked. This is not an Urban Legend of Zelda, because the bug actually existed. What <em>is</em> an Urban Legend of Zelda is that the sequel, <em>Terror From The Deep</em> had the same bug in reverse, locking the player into the hardest difficulty regardless of the original difficulty choice. This is not true, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">it's not hard to see why people thought that.</a>
</li><li> Soon after the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM2">XCOM2</a></em>, a rumor appeared that characters gain a hidden 5% bonus to their Hack stat for every successful hack on security towers. This may have appeared due to Specialists gaining 5 points to Hack every level-up, and XP for hacking towers, but the rumor explicitly claims the hidden bonus can't be seen on the promotions screen. Looking through the source code shows no such effect, but people still enjoy encouraging people to take risky hacks even if they don't want the reward.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em> series has enough of these that there exists <a class="urllink" href="http://gta-myths.wikia.com/wiki/GTA_Myths_Wiki">an entire wiki<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> devoted <em>just</em> to the myths, rumors, and urban legends that the games have spawned. Among the more famous ones:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoViceCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoViceCity">Vice City</a></em>, there were claims that there are ways to make the military submarine submerged off the north coast of the east island surface, up to and including talk of a secret ending where you can nuke the city.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas">San Andreas</a></em> was the first game in the series to be hit with rumors on a large scale. Perhaps not coincidentally, it's also the first game in the series to feature a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontGoInTheWoods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontGoInTheWoods">widespread countryside</a> to explore.
<ul><li> One of the big ones was that there exists a Sasquatch (Bigfoot) character somewhere on the map, which was "proven" by some people with Photoshopped images. There's no Bigfoot in the game code. However, a Sasquatch not only <em>does</em> appear in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption">Red Dead Redemption</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalloweenEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalloweenEpisode">Undead Nightmare</a> DLC, but that game lets you <em>kill and skin him</em>. And the achievement you get for doing so? "Six Years In The Making". Undead Nightmare was released six years after <em>San Andreas</em>, to the day. The final bonus mission in <em>GTA V</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">also has Franklin being enlisted by a man who'd been looking for Sasquatch for nine years (the amount of time between the releases of <em>San Andreas</em> and <em>V</em>) to help him hunt one. It turns out to be a guy in a Sasquatch suit, though.</span>
</li><li> Another was that there are "ghost cars" that spawn in some precise locations and drive around without a driver. These "ghost cars" are just abandoned, wrecked cars that the game spawns in hilly areas. Since new cars don't spawn with their parking brakes on, they'll sometimes just roll down the hills.
</li><li> There were also rumors about zombies being in the game, fueled by a rather <a class="urllink" href="http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/Zombotech_Corporation">mysterious corporate<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> building in San Fierro.
</li><li> Another common rumor that there are aliens, UFOs, and other extraterrestials in the game, which are partly true, sort of. Two of the Truth's missions have some interesting content that may or may not be caused by aliens <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">One of them has you stealing some green goo from a heavily armored train, and another on a plane the enemies call you "carbon based life form"</span>. A glitch in the game can cause the lights of planes to spawn, but not the plane itself, creating what technically is an unidentifiable flying object in the sky.
</li><li> <em>San Andreas</em> also has a single mission where you fly to Liberty City and have a shootout in the Italian restaurant which features prominently in <em>3</em>. There are an enormous number of rumors suggesting that there is a way to unlock all of Liberty City. Hackers figured out how to get there, either getting outside the mission area or returning later; a surprisingly large part of the city is actually present (about 70% of Portland), hovering in the air miles above northeast Los Santos, but is useless because there is no collision detection except in the area used in the establishing shot.
</li><li> Many similar rumors abound, such as the existence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws">Jaws</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note839ik');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note839ik" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note839ik');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Sharks, along with other wildlife, would show up for real in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV">Grand Theft Auto V</a></em></span>, the Loch Ness Monster, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTexasChainsawMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTexasChainsawMassacre">Leatherface</a>, etc. Most of these have been officially refuted.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV">Grand Theft Auto IV</a></em> has a whole bunch as well:
<ul><li> Lola the prostitute is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyNotAppearingInThisGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyNotAppearingInThisGame">featured on the PS3 box art</a> and has a page on the police archives (accessible if you use the computer in the police vehicles), so there are rumors that she's in the game.
</li><li> One piece of fan rumor turned out to be correct. In <em>IV</em>, you receive an achievement called "Impossible Trinity" after completing a mission in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. After it was revealed that Johnny Klebitz (who appears in that mission) is the playable character for the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Pack</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIVTheLostAndDamned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIVTheLostAndDamned">The Lost &amp; Damned</a></em>, players seized upon the achievement name and predicted that Luis Lopez (who also appears) would star in his own DLC. Sure enough, he's the protagonist of the second expansion, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIVTheBalladOfGayTony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIVTheBalladOfGayTony">The Ballad of Gay Tony</a></em>.
</li><li> There is also the "Ratman", which is similar to the <em>San Andreas</em> rumors about Bigfoot. Supposedly, there is a humanoid monster that lives in the subways and attacks other NPCs and the player. It's faster than other NPCs and attacks by swiping at Niko, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmAHumanitarian">chewing on his corpse</a> when it kills him. Extensive searches in-game and through the game's code have dismissed this claim, and any "proof" of the Ratman has been proven to be hoaxed.
</li><li> The abandoned Sprunk factory in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Joisey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Joisey">Alderney</a> is widely rumored to be haunted, thanks to a scream that some people claim to have heard when wandering through the factory (usually after firing off a round). More likely, it's just one of the bums that spawns inside.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV">Grand Theft Auto V</a></em>
<ul><li> This game is home of the possibly biggest mystery of the franchise, nicknamed simply as the Mount Chiliad Mystery. It all begins with a simple mural on a wall of a shed having its place on Mount Chiliad, containing a crude drawing of supposedly a mountain, a flying saucer, a cracked egg, what looks like a person flying a jetpack, five red X's, weird lines inside that mountain, thunderbolts, and more. More so, after reaching 100% completion of the game, the player is able to trigger a total of three (four if counting a broken one underwater) <em>actual</em> flying saucers, all in different places hovering in the air with no real purpose. After uncovering the existence of these things, the Internet has since then gone crazy about this. What is the purpose of this mural, or of the saucers? Can the player unlock a flyable saucer, a jetpack, or something different? <em>Is</em> there actually a mystery, considering Rockstar never really confirmed it? Incredible theories and even valid finds have been popping up since then, like an actual alien egg inside the game files, weird green lights on bunkers, theories about a hidden karma meter inside the game, even more unreadable murals inside the game, and much, <em>much</em> more, even years after the game's release, stating clearly that there isn't just a mystery inside the game, it is more like a game around the mystery. While it isn't clear if this mystery is solveable, Rockstar has been taunting players cryptically to "continue the search for the truth", and have even released <a class="urllink" href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/61201/New-Alien-Survival-Series-and-The-Western-Rampant-Rocket">alien-themed DLC<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in the form of Survival missions where players take the role of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion">alien invaders</a> fighting off human counterattacks. The hunt is ongoing to this day, with many hunters trying out new and continuously more unusual theories to maybe solve this giant thing one day.
</li><li> It was often believed that you can manipulate the stock market outside of specific missions by blowing up property belonging to one company, causing their stocks to fall and their competitor's to rise. This is not true, and was likely started by the assassination missions having a similar system.
</li><li> Another widespread rumor popping up for <em>V</em> is that the police will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Profiling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Profiling">racially profile</a> Franklin for arrest in situations where Michael or even Trevor would get a pass - even going so far as to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality">open fire on sight</a> in rich, white neighborhoods. This was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed">Jossed</a> by Rockstar after complaints that the game was perhaps a little <em>too</em> realistic for its own good.
</li><li> There are consistent rumors of there being an entire "triangle" of paranormal and unexplained activity in the game in the Tongva Hills region, appropriately named the "Tongva Triangle". Roughly <em>twenty</em> individual myths can be found there alone.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Speaking of Rockstar, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption">Red Dead Redemption</a></em> has its share of supposed secrets.
<ul><li> One of the most prominent after the game's release was the rumor that you can find a ruined DeLorean hidden in the mountains in a reference to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartIII">Back to the Future Part III</a>.</em> No one's ever discovered it.
</li><li> Another persistent rumor states that the town of Tumbleweed is haunted. There are certainly strange things that go on in that area (and that area only), but nothing has ever been officially confirmed.
</li><li> The DLC <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemptionUndeadNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemptionUndeadNightmare">Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare</a></em> has spawned the ever resilient myth that there is a werewolf somewhere in the game, with most sites claiming it to be somewhere in Tall Trees and only coming out during the full moon. Extensive searches have turned up nothing, and reported screen shots of it have been proven to be fake. Other sightings have been dismissed as just a wild horse, usually the American Standardbred, <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9wkdt');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note9wkdt" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9wkdt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> the black horse, which is found in this part of the game</span> rearing up and giving the illusion of a bi-pedaled werewolf.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption2">Red Dead Redemption II</a></em> has a few as well, although players are slowly starting to believe that most of the mysteries were either intentionally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutShort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutShort">Cut Short</a> to keep people searching or just the result of cut content.
<ul><li> The game has 2 meteorite fragments that the player can find, but their description always says "x out of 3", which has caused all kinds of speculation. This number stays at 3 even if the satchel is upgraded so it's not the default item count cap either. Supposedly finding all three would increase the player's tolerance to cold weather. If a glitch is used to obtain a 3rd meteorite from the same spawn points as the first 2<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10ag69');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note10ag69" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10ag69');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Entering the epilogue respawns some items into the world</span>, nothing happens.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Some believe that Arthur Morgan's tuberculosis can be cured by performing an extremely specific series of actions that often have no real connection to each other.

The PC version includes an unused model for her which stopped some theories - mostly those that claim she's *Insert any female NPC here* but those still pop up randomly.
</li><li> An NPC named Nigel can be found looking for someone named Gavin, another NPC which appears nowhere in the game. While it's likely a reference to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AchievementHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AchievementHunter">Achievement Hunter</a></em> (Gavin was intended to lend his voice to the game but never showed up), PC players digging through the game's files discovered that Gavin does in fact have a character model. It's the exact same as Nigel's. This has lead credence to the popular theory that Gavin is, in fact, Nigel's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality">Split Personality</a> and that due to Gavin from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AchievementHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AchievementHunter">Achievement Hunter</a></em> never showing up to record his lines, the revelation that Nigel and Gavin were the same person had to be scrapped at the last minute, thus leaving the entire side story unfinished. Despite this, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> of claiming that "X is Gavin!" is still popular in the fandom as of 2020.
</li><li> The Legendary Channel Catfish is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost">The Ghost</a> in the game and game files revealed later its model is unfinished (When spawned in air it's huge and low-res, and when spawned on land it breaks apart), but before the PC release players kept coming up with ways to catch it, including human bait, very specific time/weather circumstances and more.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> Herobrine, the supposed dead brother of the game's creator, known for creating strange structures and being elusive. Several ways have been rumored of to "summon" him, and many bogus symptoms of his appearance in your world (trees spawning with no leaves, long 2x1 pregenerated passages through stone, an abundance of redstone torches, glowstone towers, weird messages left on signs, etc.) have been spread through various forums and communities. Seeing as none of these things actually <em>occur</em> ingame, these seem less like cases of ingame behavior/bugs being attributed to the urban legend, and more like they were intended to spook children and teenagers in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Creepypasta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Creepypasta">horror stories</a> or falsified <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> videos.
<ul><li> Rendering spasms can give the impression that Herobrine's face appeared on the screen. It is awfully uncomfortable to witness this happen.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has jossed the rumor, but the creators like to poke fun at it:
</li><li> Almost every update has a line that says "removed Herobrine" or something similar.
</li><li> Herobrine is often featured in promotional art for the game, often whenever it features an ensemble cast of characters and monsters from the game.
</li><li> The message that displays the cause of death if a player is killed by a snowball or an egg is said to be from Herobrine. This is because both projectiles are harmless and thus cannot kill the player, meaning the only way to see this message for yourself is to mod the game.
</li><li> One of the Christmas Skin Packs includes a "Holiday Herobrine". Basically, Herobrine with a Christmas Sweater.
</li></ul></li><li> On 9 March 2012 at the GDC, Notch mentioned that "there is one [recipe] people haven't found yet", this happening about a week after two unused textures for hieroglyphic-covered blocks mysteriously appeared in the texture file. This sparked a huge number of rumours and speculation.
</li><li> It's long been believed that if you empty out a deposit of dirt or gravel underground, you'll always find an ore vein. While a typical player could go a long time without having this disproven, it's because both of those things are abundant enough and large enough that, by sheer probability, they're going to intersect most of the time. There's nothing in the code forcing them to generate adjacently.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Blockland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Blockland">Blockland</a></em>
<ul><li> "The Golden Brick" which supposedly exists in the Slate map, and, upon clicking it, you apparently unlock <em>Blockland Adventure Mode</em>. It's untrue, but it's still thought to be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleofCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleofCool">such a cool idea</a></em> that many players pretend that it's real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun">just for fun</a>.
</li><li> The Renderman, an apparition not unlike Herobrine from <em>Minecraft</em>. It's supposed to appear when you take a screenshot on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsEvil">dark map</a>, and in DOF screenshots(basically screenshots taken while your character shakes violently, to produce a very blurry image) he appears <em>very close to the player</em>. Many pictures have been provided of him to 'prove' his existence. He was revived in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolidayMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolidayMode">Halloween Update</a>, where a 'new form' of Renderman appeared: Preppers, flashing red ASCII Terror Faces ("&deg;&#1044;&deg;") which were claimed to randomly appear on dark maps. Combined with the usual presence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier">Nothing Is Scarier</a> in dark maps, many didn't want to load these maps for fear of encountering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoMustNotBeNamed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoMustNotBeNamed">HIM</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype">[PROTOTYPE]</a></em>: Even before the game's release, the developers touted information that you can unlock a new character and secret mission if you have met certain criteria and found a hidden severed leg. A few weeks after the game's release, a member of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GameFAQs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GameFAQs">GameFAQs</a> community found the leg, and was disappointed to find that nothing happens. The developers even acknowledged that people had found the severed leg, but they refused to give further information. Rumors now focus on things such as all the crazy things you have to do to get the leg to work, and some believe that there's another leg out there and that this leg is just a red herring.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustCause2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustCause2">Just Cause 2</a></em>, it has been rumored that there is some sort of UFO that can appear and blow you out of the sky in a simple blast. This is actually the electrical tower that becomes a focus for a side mission.
</li><li> Some <em>Spider-Man</em> games have a few.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderManTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderManTheMovie">first movie tie-in game</a> allowed playing as the Green Goblin, so people claimed that you could play the sequels as their respective villains.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpiderMan2">Spider-Man 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> According to some, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneSideQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneSideQuest">reaching 100%</a> would add a "Change" icon to play as Doc Ock somewhere on the game. There's absolutely no footage of this.
</li><li> Humorously, one persistent rumor on a few gaming sites said that jumping off of the Statue of Liberty 30 times will let you play as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMuppets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMuppets">Kermit the Frog</a>. Sadly, this does not happen.
</li><li> There's apparently also a few ways to unlock the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> Governor's Island. Again, no footage. Additionally, there's supposedly a costume store hidden in the city, opening its doors at X time of day.
</li><li> As Lizard was originally planned to appear, several people claim that he is still in the game. Usually, the theories say that he's in the sewers, accessible through a certain manhole after a certain requirement has been met.
</li></ul></li><li> There was a rumor that you could play as Venom in the PS2, PSP, and Wii versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan3">Spider-Man 3</a></em> tie-in game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProblemWithLicensedGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProblemWithLicensedGames">(The not-so-good version)</a>. As collecting 50 Spider-emblems after the final mission unlocks the black suit for unlimited usage, people latched on the idea that collecting 100 meteorite fragments would unlock Venom as a playable character. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">Turns out that it doesn't</a>. All footage about it is just very blurry footage of the black suit.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Subnautica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Subnautica">Subnautica</a></em> has a persistent rumor about Reefbacks (giant alien whales with whole ecosystems growing on their backs) being one possible species that you could find <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhaleEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhaleEgg">eggs for and hatch</a> in the Alien Containment Unit. While this was possible in the pre-release versions with implemented assets and data that let players breed their own captive Reefbacks and they are still obtainable via console commands, it was ultimately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> for release and the assets re-used for another much smaller species. This doesn't stop the occasional odd rumor though, since people swear up and down that random eggs occasionally 'glitch' during the world-gen process and still allow baby Reefbacks to hatch from them. You can still find a version of the original Reefback egg in the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Primary Containment Facility</span> at the end of the game, which is a GIANT version of the eggs you've been finding out in the wild. Far too big for the species of fish that currently hatches from them, but just right for the baby Reefbacks. Unfortunately, it's just a prop and cannot be scanned or interacted with in any meaningful way.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder20');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardware&nbsp;</div><div id="folder20" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Naturally, while the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VirtualBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VirtualBoy">Virtual Boy</a> was on the market, there were persistent rumors that color graphics are indeed possible through the use of cheat codes, system modifications, and what have you. There are even mock-ups circulating the internet of VB games with colorized graphics. This was in spite of the fact that Nintendo themselves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">unapologetically proclaimed</a> that the Virtual Boy's internal graphics processor has only a two-color palette, and thus more colors would've been physically impossible given the hardware specs. Needless to say, these rumors died when the VB did.
</li><li> Owners who poked around with their NES found a port on the bottom of the console covered by a piece of plastic, and there were many rumors as to what this was for. In reality, this is where the Famicom Disk System would go, but no NES equivalent was ever released. There are converters that let you do this, though, albeit through the cartridge slot.
</li><li> There was a rumor that the original Xbox One included a secret second GPU based on a revised AMD architecture that MS would activate when AMD announced the update with the apparently weaker GPU (12 CUs v 18 in the original PS4) being an (incredibly expensive given that many versions of the rumour had this supposed secret being stacked on the processor and the difficulties that would present for manufacture and cooling) ruse by MS to fool Sony. This persisted for a surprisingly long time even after the XB1' release.
