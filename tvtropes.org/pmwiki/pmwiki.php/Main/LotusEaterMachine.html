</p><p>Sometimes the lotus-eater has no idea it's all fake. Sometimes they do know but don't care.

</p><p>Because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchrodingersButterfly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchrodingersButterfly">nature of this trope</a>, it often lends itself to doubts after the characters 'escape'.

This can range from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">Epileptic Trees</a> theories by a handful of viewers, all the way up to extreme canon cases of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamWithinADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamWithinADream">Dream Within a Dream</a>. In this tone, a particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">Fridge Horrific</a> ending for a villain (or a hero) may see them fall under the spell of the Machine, but only for a second before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShatteringTheIllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShatteringTheIllusion">Shattering the Illusion</a>, defeating their enemies, and re-making the world in their image.

</p><p>The trope name comes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOdyssey">The Odyssey</a></em>, where Odysseus meets a society living off narcotic plants, to the extent that anyone who eats of the lotus no longer cares about anything else, including going home.

Contrast with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychologicalTormentZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychologicalTormentZone">Psychological Torment Zone</a>.

<ul><li> Suzumi gets put under one that mentally returns her to a happier time, when her husband was still alive and the two were excitedly awaiting their first child. While the machine is destroyed, she willingly remains behind because she is happy. It isn't until Yuuhi forces her to remember that Kazuma is dead that she gets shaken out of her stupor, also remembering how she chose to continue to live to take care of her brother-in-law.
</li><li> Aya gets put into one before a microchip is supposed to be implanted into her brain, which would make her more compliant to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Kagami</a>'s plan, and appease the Ancestor. Touya saves her before the microchip is installed and Alec helps the two escape, stating that Aya should awaken within a few hours. If she doesn't, she will remain trapped inside her nightmares. Said nightmares involve her reliving the moment of Touya regaining his memories and forgetting about her, but Ceres manages to break through to her. She tells Aya to wake up, since the real Touya has been calling out to her for some time. Aya manages to wake up and the two are finally reunited.
</li></ul></li><li> In the penultimate episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">MaloMyotismon</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, uses an illusion mist attack that places the Chosen Children in worlds where their greatest dreams came true: TK sees his family together and happy, Kari is in a world where humans and Digimon coexist happily, Cody is reunited with his deceased father, and Yolei is an only child with all the perks including a large number of sweets. On the flip side, Ken, who suffers from insane guilt for his actions as the Digimon Emperor, sees his Emperor self being tortured by the Digimon he abused. It takes their Digimon partners to snap their respective humans out of their illusions. Incidentally, the only child who wasn't affected was Davis, who has no serious desires or problems with his life, much to MaloMyotismon's surprise.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GregoryHorrorShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GregoryHorrorShow">Gregory Horror Show</a></em> has a weird variation. The hotel run by Gregory is the embodiment of the desire to escape from reality, and Gregory and his inhabitants will try their damndest to drive you mad and keep you there. You can escape, but of the two people we've seen escape, both eventually end up coming back and becoming one of the hotel's twisted inhabitants.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AngelSanctuary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AngelSanctuary">Angel Sanctuary</a></em>:

He is awoken by the desperate crying for help of Kira, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who actually is the spirit of his sword, who actually is Lucifer</span>, while the dream Sara tries to convince him to stay in the dream.
</li><li> When Setsuna and Kato try to break out of Uriel's realm, a part of Enma-o's body places an illusion on Katou where he sees his family and himself as a little child, his sister (played by Enma-o) asks him to put away the bat because he doesn't need it here; even his father <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who isn't his father at all, only the husband of his mother</span> is nice and kind and tells him that he got that short temper from him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Then, he stabs Enma-o with his staff and breaks the seal on the cauldron.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> Episode 178, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ichigo is trapped within a special technique created by Saiga, a bakkoutou weapon used by the assassins of the Kasumi-Ooji Clan. He is trapped within a memory of his childhood where his mother dies, and he is alone, waiting by the river at the spot she was killed.</span> Upon breaking out, Ichigo pulled out his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Visored mask</a> and promptly delivered an ass-whupping to his tormentor.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> gives this trope a twist by having the Lotus Eater Machine actually be a highly addictive <em>drug</em>, called Refrain. It's popular amongst the conquered Japanese (and may have been developed specifically as a weapon against them), since it causes the user to relive happy memories.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog">Sgt. Frog</a></em> episode 3: After trying various methods to disguise Keroro so he can go outside, Tamama tries the plant "Dreaming Alpha", which sticks its tentacles into Keroro's head and makes him hallucinate that he's in a wonderful field of flowers, but almost instantly drains his body away. (The plant itself is oddly similar to the one in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Homage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Homage">Alan Moore</a> story.) In the English dub, it's explicitly referred to as the 'Keronian Purple Mercy Lotus-Eating Lotus'.

Nova's intention is that Gally's personality will be altered by the experience, and she'll find herself unable to kill him after he releases her from the simulation. However, this backfires in two ways &mdash; Gally recognizes that it's only a dream from the start and plays along, relishing the chance to briefly live a normal life; meanwhile, having genuinely come to love Gally/Alita as a daughter during his time in the simulation, Nova can no longer bring himself to shoot her in the real world. (Later in the series he becomes more-or-less a good guy, but his motives were always so obscure anyway that it's impossible to tell if it's a direct result, and he actually claims to have no memory of this incident due to the way he resurrects. He just backs up his mind and downloads to another body, but only backs up at certain time periods.)

Little by little, though, the dream Krypton becomes a heartbreaking nightmare of the planet sliding into a self-destructing mayhem, spurred by Superman's embittered father. After it was removed from Superman, it fell on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a>, and he also experienced his greatest fantasy &mdash; that his parents were not murdered.

Unfortunately, Wolverine's heart's desire was to remember every day of his life: he knew the world was fake and was the one to try to revert it.

When he has children in his Lotus Eater world, they only appear to him when he thinks of them.

The City becomes ghastly place: the controls have been lost, reduced to prayers. And this fishbowl world just doesn't have enough memes in the end to stave off madness...

When humans get a hold of these, they quickly realize that an eternity of thinking is not enough for a human. The environment inside a logr looks and feels real. It is formed from the person's memories. However, since the mind has no body at this point, there are no emotions either (they're caused by chemicals, after all), just raw memories all recalled with perfect clarity, which can turn each person's paradise into hell if he or she wasn't a nice person in life. While it is possible to copy a dead person's mind back into a cloned body, this is specifically forbidden by the Logrians who fear immortality (with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityImmorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityImmorality">good reason</a>).

The banquets, garden, and female companionship were, of course, all set up in advance by the cult's leaders, the better to ensure the recruits' compliance with their often-suicidal tasks as assassins. (Better understanding of Nizari beliefs about the afterlife, plus the conspicuous absence of any such garden in or near the real sect's historical base of operations, have helped to debunk this account.)

Outside the illusion, lonely figures wander the ruins of a city, blissfully unaware that the friends and family they imagine are either dead or lost in dreams of their own.

The only way to get out is to do the one thing you can't do at the beginning, enter Engineering. Since there is no memory of entering it, the illusion is broken.

The first part is that it's a dream world and that unexpected things break in and ruin it such as Shiki's nightmare of himself as a murderer. The second part is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Len thinks she's doing it for him, but Shiki figures out that deep down she's doing it for herself. The thing is that it's actually something more like <em>her</em> idea of a perfect life: To Shiki it's nice, but nothing special. For Len it's something she's never had before, and she's dying. The dream does not end (though it could have if he wanted to and would have done so eventually anyway) until Shiki saves her through making a master/familiar contract.</span>

Steve and Hayley decide to do the same, which upsets Francine since she thinks the family can't stand each other; at this point Stan and the kids resolve to give her a real vacation with an ocean cruise. Unfortunately, the cruise is a little <em>too</em> idyllic and Francine assumes they're still in the goo, which results in her personally wrecking everything.

In the end, the machine is put on the villain, and, in a rarity for this trope, this villain is left aware of this and miserable. It's later revealed that the KND scientists kept the device to use for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">Secret Test of Character</a>.

No imaginary worlds or anything are involved; it's just <em>that comfy</em>. The episode ends (like most serious examples of this trope) with the villain getting trapped in her own Lotus-Eater Machine.

Brock gets trapped inside and we get a frightening vision of his apparent deepest desires. Using tinfoil hats, teenage limerence, and a urine soaked t-shirt, the boys are the ones that get Brock out. It's interesting to note that while the device does make an attempt to fulfill one's desires through hallucination, these fantasies appear to be horribly distorted in some way and all together surreal. Of course we're dealing with some fairly screwed up users here, so I'm guessing that point is moot.

<ul><li> For many people with Dissociative conditions such as <a class="urllink" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/maladaptive-daydreaming">Maladaptive Daydreaming<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, your own brain can do this to you. Maladaptive dreamers regularly become entirely lost in their own vivid daydreams for minutes, hours, or longer. It sounds awesome, but the huge downside is how highly addictive it is. That, and it doesn't always happen when you want. When a regular person gets distracted by a daydream on the job it lowers their concentration. When a Maladaptive daydreams they can get totally lost in their own world for so long and so deeply that they flat out lose that job because they spent half of it liberating the One Ring from Skeletor. It isn't clear what causes Maladaptive Daydreaming, but anecdotes range from oppressive boredom during a long chidhood illness to 'just born this way'.
