Often tied to the dislike of a specific arc, but can also befall <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonFluidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonFluidity">episodic shows.</a> In some cases, a new director takes over and pulls the series in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWelding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWelding">different direction</a>; this can give the impression of Seasonal Rot to those who liked the old way, but may also bring in new viewers who prefer it like this (in other words, a change in tastes or audience).

</p><p>There are some ways to avoid, and especially cure seasonal rot. The first way is to temporarily cancel/postpone the series, take a break, and then come up with more ideas at a slow pace, or, just come up with some inspirations. Another way, at least when the series is already in jeopardy, is to replace the episodes in a season by creating better ones to take their place along the way, and then resume the series. Moreover, just because the series is suffering seasonal rot, doesn't necessarily mean that they are now of bad quality, since past seasons/episodes is what keeps the shows from getting into bad quality, no matter how poorer the quality is season/episode wise.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em>: Pretty much everything after Kanto has a fair share of detractors, with the most common complaints being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledScript" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledScript">recycled plots</a> or lack of major character development for Ash and Team Rocket. The eras most commonly accused of this, however, are Johto (too much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">Filler</a> resulting in poor pacing, Brock and Misty's characters began to stagnate, and Ash's Johto team, aside from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">Bayleef</a>, wasn't very well-fleshed out in comparison to his original Kanto team) and Black &amp; White/Unova (Ash lost all his character development and reverted back to being a na&iuml;ve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">Idiot Hero</a>, Cilan and especially Iris were poorly received and viewed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorMansSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorMansSubstitute">inferior copies</a> for Brock and Misty, the League storyline was mishandled, the Team Plasma story arc was too short, Charizard's return was a wasted opportunity, and Decalore Islands was essentially an entire arc of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">Filler</a> that made Johto look eventful). Funnily enough, despite both Johto and Unova generally being considered the show's weakest eras, <em>where</em> the rot sets in for them is the opposite. For example, while Johto's beginning and middle sections are widely perceived as uneventful and moving at a snail's pace, the last third (featuring well-received moments like the Larvitar arc, Ash defeating Gary at the Silver Conference, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Ashachu</a>, and the original trio's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">emotional</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFellowshipHasEnded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFellowshipHasEnded">farewell</a> in <em>Gotta Catch Ya Later!</em>) is widely viewed as an improvement. In contrast, Unova is widely considered to <em>start out</em> as promising, addressing many fan complaints (Team Rocket's incompetence, Ash not catching enough Pokemon) head-on, but it starts squandering this potential around the middle, so that by the time of Decalore Islands the season was viewed by many as irredeemable.
</li><li> The third season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MonsterRancher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MonsterRancher">Monster Rancher</a></em> was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason">Post-Script Season</a> significantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> than the rest of the series, having villains that are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenserAndWackier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenserAndWackier">Denser and Wackier</a>, no real stakes until the end, a fair amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler</a>, and a rushed (if still epic) climax. It doesn't help that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">some popular characters are reduced to one-episode appearances</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact">Holly becomes mostly useless</a>. It definitely still has a lot of fans though, with many saying that while the overall story is weaker the season still contains some of the best episodes in the whole anime and gave the series a more satisfying conclusion.
</li><li> <em>Rockman.EXE Stream</em>, the fourth season of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MegaManNTWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MegaManNTWarrior">MegaMan NT Warrior</a></em> anime, is looked down upon for turning the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mon">Mons</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSPACE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSPACE">on the internet</a> premise into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sentai">Sentai</a> show revolving around an ever-growing team of main characters with the ability to turn their Navis into super suits. The transition started with the previous season, but at least that mixed those segments in with segments that actually focused on Rockman.
<ul><li> The main villains' (Duo and Slur) status as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleVillain">Invincible Villains</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Karma Houdinis</a> was quite annoying.
</li><li> Supposedly the whole Cross Fusion business came about as a result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, as the show's <em>Axess</em> timeslot onward was right before an actual Sentai show, and having resources and budget being shifted around to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>, not to mention incorporating said movie into the plot of the TV series itself, was probably responsible for the mostly abysmal art and a story that didn't know what to do with itself. That still doesn't excuse them for <em>throwing out the entire purpose of the series</em>, however.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManStarForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManStarForce">Mega Man Star Force</a></em> anime had this to a lesser degree in that there was virtually no plot in episodes 31 on until the end of the first season. So it was more like half-seasonal rot. A condition which continued into the second season, with the addition of discarding almost <em>every</em> aspect of the game it was purportedly based on, up to and including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">The Rival</a> becoming the <em>polar opposite</em> of his game self.
</li><li> <em>NT Warrior</em> also ran into this during its second season. First it threw in a ridiculous amount of filler before remembering it had a plot, then it wrapped up the plot before the season was even over, and then it filled out the rest of the season with more filler because they had literally run out of plot.
<ul><li> The last episode was particularly notable for this, being a blatant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Ghostbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Ghostbusters">Ghostbusters</a></em> and famously consisting of, to quote a fansite, "twenty minutes of filler, a minute of eyecatches, and the entire plot crammed into the ending theme." To say nothing of the episode a few earlier that was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpeedRacer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpeedRacer">rather gimmicky race...</a>
</li><li> The last episode had the most insulting thing of all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">anime</a> &mdash; the last boss of the first game randomly pops up and it's defeated <em>in less than a minute</em> with barely any introduction.
</li><li> <em>Beast</em> is widely considered by fans to be a huge improvement over <em>Stream</em>, but the sequel <em>Beast+</em>, the last series of the anime, is unfortunately this, as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason">Post-Script Season</a>. While the first series, <em>Axess</em>, <em>Stream</em>, and <em>Beast</em> adapt the main series games, <em>Beast+</em> attempts to adapt all of the spinoff material, such as <em>Network Transmission</em> and the cell phone games, but it is sloppily done, thanks to poor writing and pacing. The length of each episode was also reduced to ten minutes and the time slot was changed to give it a shared spot with another anime. Worst off, while each of the previous series had endings to their arcs, <em>Beast+</em> just ends. As the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManStarForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManStarForce">Shooting Star Rockman</a></em> anime was announced that it was going to be released before the game version, obviously they needed to wrap up <em>EXE</em>, but it really couldn't have been done worse.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em>, after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a> of a third season (which <em>still</em> proved to be entertaining regardless), had the abysmal fourth season, which tried (and failed) to top the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MandatoryTwistEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MandatoryTwistEnding">Mandatory Twist Endings</a> of the previous season, and supposedly explain away the loose ends from the first season without actually doing so. The fact that they made the main villain a secondary character's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Superpowered Evil Side</a> with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot">ridiculous agenda</a> didn't help matters any. It is quite telling that when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment">4Kids Entertainment</a> chose not to touch this season in their dub, many fans weren't upset because that made it even easier to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity">pretend it doesn't exist</a>. Some may even call it one of the dub's <em>saving graces</em>.
</li><li> Season 4's main failing seems to have been the case of it being rushed for the sake of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">a new series installment</a>, not the fact that it wasn't properly planned-out to begin with. It managed to wrap up things quite nicely in regards to what would happen to the main characters (by making them search for their own paths and identities, without having to rely on Judai at every turn) and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s ploy was not all that different to the conclusion reached by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">a well-known show</a> who got nowhere near the amount of flak that <em>GX</em> did for the very same plot-point. Its characterization of Judai as a considerably more mature and responsible person after his third-season <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> (complete with a more attractive redesign) was also widely acclaimed, to the point of people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustHereForGodzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustHereForGodzilla">watching the season just to see where all that art of Judai looking badass comes from</a>.
</li><li> Season 2 also receives a lot of flak. Transitioning from a (mostly) light-hearted first season into the very dark next two, this season is a weird in-between, poorly balancing a serious overarching plot of an evil destructive cult and silly filler duels between kabuki fans and curry lovers.
</li><li> The first two arcs of the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em> get this kind of flak, with the Road to Destiny arc being composed of almost nothing but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">Filler</a> and the WRGP arc containing numerous examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotInducedStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotInducedStupidity">Plot-Induced Stupidity</a>, as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement">Product Placement</a> almost at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhTheMoviePyramidOfLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhTheMoviePyramidOfLight">Pyramid of Light</a></em>'s level. The concluding arc, Arc Cradle, was with the exception of one specific plot twist much better-received. This may in part be because the first season's Fortune Cup and Dark Signers arcs, widely regarded as high points not just of this series but also of the entire franchise, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughActToFollow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughActToFollow">tough acts to follow</a>, though.
</li><li> Depending who you talk to, some or all of the filler of the original series, especially the fourth season ("Waking the Dragons"), which is nothing <em>but</em> a filler arc. Promptly lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YuGiOhTheAbridgedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YuGiOhTheAbridgedSeries">Yu-Gi-Oh Abridged</a></em>:

ARC-V</a></em>, the only question for most fans is when the rot started, with every arc being seen as a step down to some degree from the last one. After a well-regarded first 52 episodes, the once-brisk pacing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue">crashed to a stop</a> with the Synchro arc, which put a lot of people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">at best</a>. Then the Xyz arc, in addition to being incredibly rushed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">forgot all of Yuya's development</a> and made him out to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero">Invincible Hero</a>. The Fusion arc was largely disliked for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">predictable plot</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl">complete mismanagement of its female cast</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleVillain">overlong final boss fight.</a> And then the show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndingFatigue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndingFatigue">continues for another eight episodes, during which nothing interesting happens.</a>

</li><li> Many consider <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a>: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2</em> a step down from the first season due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Asspull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Asspull">increasingly absurd plot twists</a>, the vast majority of the old cast being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a>, plot threads going unresolved or just dropped entirely, and an increased focus on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">mecha battles</a> at the expense of the strategic interplay that characterized much of the first season (and main character Lelouch).
</li><li> It's generally agreed upon by fans that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em> took a noticeable decline in quality after the conclusion of the Hokuto Brothers arc, which served as the major focus of the manga's story. While the Jakoh, Shura, and Bolge arcs weren't terrible, they're seen as mediocre compared to what came before it as a result of it being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason">Post-Script Season</a>, and the arcs between the Shura and Bolge arcs are heavily considered the nadir of the storyline in terms of quality. To elaborate, the arcs after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Raoh's</span> defeat relied mainly on rehashing previous story elements, hastily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconning</a> several elements of the manga, placing increasingly greater emphasis on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil">Sorting Algorithm of Evil</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation">Ki Attacks</a> (though not to the extent that other shonen comics such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> took it), and in the arcs after the Shura one, relegating Kenshiro to the sidelines so that he could give an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anvilicious</a> moral lesson to the villains and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">pull a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> moment</span> at the conclusion of the Bolge arc. Because of this, most adaptations of the manga only go up to the end of the Hokuto Brothers arc, with only <em>Fist of the North Star 2</em> and several video games touching what came after (and even then, <em>Fist of the North Star 2</em> ended with the Shura arc rather than adapting anything past that).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em>:
<ul><li> For a lot of fans, the third season of the anime, <em>Slayers TRY.</em> What would've been an intriguing story was bogged down by poor characterization (the four heroes are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> and have no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, a stark contrast to the previous season), a convoluted plot, stale humor, and too much focus on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolierThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolierThanThou">Holier Than Thou</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember">Guest-Star Party Member</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, and his mooks. Even Hajime Kanzaka, who created the series, admits to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">disliking the TRY arc.</a>
</li><li> <em>Revolution</em> and <em>Evolution-R</em> serve as little more than nostalgia fuel, adding nothing different or interesting to the franchise, <em>Revolution</em> deserves special mention, for stretching Lina's vices to borderline unlikeable levels.
</li></ul></li><li> The second season (of three) of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AkazukinChacha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AkazukinChacha">Akazukin Chacha</a></em> is best not watched. Or, at least have the remote handy to fast-forward through the several minute-long transformation sequences (yes, multiple in a row...).
</li><li> The second arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>, especially in the manga. After a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> Light got two new opponents called Mello and Near, setting up a three-way cat-and-mouse duel. Unfortunately the story falls prey to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy">Darkness-Induced Audience Apathy</a>. Light comes across as a one-note villain and it's hard to cheer for Near, due to his spoiled ungrateful nature and his whole character being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy">blatant copy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">of L with no unique traits</a>. Mello is interesting but is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> half the time, making the Light vs. Near conflict awfully similar to Light vs. L. The Shinigami appear less and less and there are insane levels of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallsOfText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallsOfText">Walls of Text</a>. The biggest contributing factor was the fact that the author wanted the series to be exactly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredEight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredEight">108</a> chapters long, but didn't quite have enough material to fill that amount, so the story ended up severely dragged out and padded. For comparison, the anime adaptation stuffed the <em>entire second half</em> of the manga from Near and Mello's introduction onward (a whopping 59 chapters) into just 11 episodes.
</li><li> With <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em>, general consensus holds that this applies to three specific series:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em>: Apart from the fans' disappointment with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a>, the series seemed to change plots as often as someone changes clothes. This is especially poignant in the small (yet important) Holy Stones arc. These world-shattering sacred rocks were never mentioned until Mummymon casually talked about it in a 10-second conversation. There was little foreshadowing, and once they were all eliminated they never came up again. This also apparent with the Holy Ring; despite the first episode making such a big deal about Gatomon losing it, it's never brought again until hallway through the series, only to them forget about it until the last episode. Additionally, most revelations about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan">The Man Behind the Man</a> seemed to come out of nowhere, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChiakiKonaka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChiakiKonaka">Chiaki Konaka</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory">Cthulhu-esque</a> guest-writing episode &mdash; originally intended to set up another subplot &mdash; went completely unexplained, was almost never referred to again, and comes off as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment">Big-Lipped Alligator Moment</a>. Not helping matters: the older cast (except for Takeru and Hikari) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">were brushed to the side</a>, Daisuke was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StaticCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StaticCharacter">Static Character</a>, the final battle was one sided in the heroes' favor, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a> pulled most of its futures out of nowhere.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier">Digimon Frontier</a></em>'s main problem was the Royal Knights mini-arc (episodes 38-47, more or less). Almost ten episodes of the same formula (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">knights decide to absorb a certain area, kids try to stop them, kids are defeated, all of the kids are shown to be digital except Koichi, next episode</span>). Minimal plot advancement, minimal character development, just... endless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">curb-stomp</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding">padding</a>. Secondary problems include the near-complete disregarding of the basic concept of the franchise, and the strangely high amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler</a>, even before the Royal Knights arc, which is particularly unusual in that <em>Digimon</em> is historically (and has since continued being, save the below example) pretty good at avoiding filler or at least giving it tangential relevance.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWarsTheYoungHuntersLeapingThroughTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWarsTheYoungHuntersLeapingThroughTime">Digimon Xros Wars: The Young Hunters Leaping Through Time</a></em> quickly developed a severe reputation for this, despite being somewhat promising in premise. Not only was Tagiru the most obnoxious hero the franchise has ever seen, but the show derailed fan favorites from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWars">Digimon Xros Wars</a></em> like Nene, who had become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Idol Singer</a> by the time of her cameo. Worst of all, <em>it consisted of almost nothing but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">Filler</a> with nary a plot in sight</em>, compounded by being the shortest series at only twenty-five episodes and thus giving itself no time to pace things out or get things started. Furthermore, much disappointment was voiced over it promising a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover">Crisis Crossover</a> setup starring prior heroes, then giving only the briefest tease twelve episodes in before seeming to <em>completely forget about it</em>; then having it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot">in the last four episodes</a>, with nearly all the prior heroes being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a> the episode after so that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Tagiru</a> can end up saving the day with <em>everyone else acting as a power-up for him</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> has the two final seasons that are regarded as weaker than the others; SuperS and Stars:
<ul><li> <em>Sailor Moon SuperS</em>, is usually regarded as one of the weakest of the series even though it has some of the best animation. In addition to leaving out the highly popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Outer Senshi</a> introduced in the previous series, it consisted of mostly comedic filler episodes and deviated from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">manga</a>'s corresponding and dramatic "Dream" arc. It also didn't help that a series titled <em>Sailor Moon</em> spent much more time on ChibiUsa than on its main heroine.
</li><li> The final season, <em>Stars</em>, wasn't much better and by this point the series ratings had plunged, though they naturally recovered for the entire series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>. Fans are generally at least a little warmer to the season than <em>Super S</em>, though it mostly depends on how much they like the gender-bending Sailor Starlights (which is a mix of hating new characters, hating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping">Shipping</a> that arose because of them, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">hating transgender individuals.</a>) It also left out vast chunks of the manga compared to previous series, and many, many manga characters did not appear at all in the <em>Stars</em> anime. The fact that the Outer Senshi were returned only to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a> and turned into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">The Load</a> rather than an asset didn't help.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>
<ul><li> The later parts of the Arrancar saga are considered this. Common issues cited include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">poorly implemented plot twists</a>, many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimax">anticlimactic fights</a> and an extremely painful case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue">Arc Fatigue</a>.
</li><li> The Lost Agent Arc is considered a very problematic part of the canon storyline. Initially well-received as a chance to allow the human characters to shine, the new characters were unconvincing, the new powers introduced were considered confusing, and the arc ended with the Shinigami saving the humans in an extremely rushed wrap-up of the arc. This was predicted by the fandom but still caused huge disappointment. The arc is regarded as nothing more than a poorly designed plot device to give Ichigo back his powers; even the fans that like the arc regard it as a good example of how Kubo starts an arc really well, but cannot sustain the quality to the end.
</li><li> The filler arcs created by the animation studio are regarded as sub-quality storylines with villains that are usually a rehash of canon villains.
<ul><li> The Bount arc borrows from canon Quincy and Mod-Soul back story to create the Bount. It was excessively long, introduced too many characters that were either poorly characterised (the Bount villains) or regarded as extremely irritating (the Bount Mod-Souls). The plot was a run-of-the-mill "turn against the creators" storyline and had a predictable ending.
</li><li> The Gotei 13 Invasion Arc completely rewrites even important canon to justify a predictable and lack-lustre "take revenge against superiors for an ancient personal slight" plot. A filler character who turns normally comedic Kon into her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> and the hero of the show reduces the main characters to shilling roles. She takes a single day to develop from powerless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a> to more powerful than even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower">Yamamoto</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleVillain">Aizen</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero">Ichigo</a>. The poor filler characterization, marginalization of main characters, and extremely unbalanced power levels all contribute to make it the most poorly received anime storyline within the fandom.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> If things can be divided by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">story arcs</a> for this, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OtogiZoshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OtogiZoshi">Otogi Zoshi</a></em> noticeably suffers in its second arc. The pacing is poor compared to the first, the artwork (generally quite nice to look at for the first half) has a considerable quality drop, plot points don't link as clearly to the conclusion, and much of it slips into predictable mystery of the week stuff. If the page for <em>Otogi Zoshi</em> itself is to be believed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> in the form of a tight schedule, tight budget, and the presence of 14 directors is very likely to blame.
</li><li> The second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em>. Want to know a good way to introduce Seasonal Rot? Make eight versions of essentially the same episode with the only differences being the characters' outfits and the numbers mentioned in the exposition in a fourteen episode season. It's not like this was done for budget reasons, as each episode has unique animation. Especially when the original novel didn't do this, they simply told the story once, period. Like anyone sane and non-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">trolling</a> would do.
</li><li> The filler arcs of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> very often make fans think it's ruined.
<ul><li> In particular, the massive block of over 80 filler episodes that made up the space between <em>Naruto</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Timeskip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Timeskip">Naruto: Shippuden</a></em> is not well regarded. Besides the immense length of time, the episodes themselves simply tended to be lower quality or have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot">Idiot Plots</a>.
<ul><li> There <em>were</em> some good arcs among all the drivel, but the fact remains that it was a massive block of wasted space which didn't contribute to anything (especially after the epic "Sasuke Retrieval Arc"). The lack of character consistency (especially with Sakura) didn't help. Likely as a way to avoid this, <em>Shippuden</em> spreads <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">Filler</a> out more across the storyline, rather than shoving it together the way the original series did; however, they went back to the original pre-Shippuden formula after the Pain arc. Not only that, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">emphasized filler to the point</a> that a certain 6-episode arc had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBump">a quality of animation</a> usually reserved for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">the movies</a>, while the canon arc directly following it used the standard show animation. Meanwhile, the manga is 80 chapters and several major events ahead. To make matters worse, the usage of filler really kicked off on the climax, interrupting key moments such as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Obito's reveal, Obito's defeat, Naruto's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath">Disney Death</a>, and the Infinite Tsukoyumi</span> with either entire filler arcs about Obito's past or padded-out episodes that are only canon for the first/last minute or two (the rest consisting of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling">Obito's past</a>). To add insult to injury, instead of doing an entire filler block that fans can simply use to take a break from the series, Studio Pierrot has been slowly interluding between an increasing Filler:Canon ratio to the point where entire 20-episode arcs are separated by <strong>one or two canon episodes</strong>, making it a far more unpleasant experience for manga fans than the pre-Shippuden filler block ever was.
</li></ul></li><li> The manga itself suffers from it in it's last arc, <em>The Fourth Shinobi War</em>, for a chunk of the fanbase. The reason being its length, some divisive choices (like Obito being Tobi) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExNihilo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExNihilo">the sudden introduction of Kaguya</a> with an expansion of the lore deemed unnecessary by many.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em> suffers from this. Most fans agree that the high point of the series was the Dark Tournament arc. Some think it was the Chapter Black arc. Despite this, most people agree that the Three Kings Saga was bland by comparison. It didn't help that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">The Lancer</a> of the main four was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a> after spending a third of the previous arc being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassInDistress">Badass in Distress</a> and the first third of the arc being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal">Brought Down to Normal</a> and thus useless. Said character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">stays in school instead of joining his friends on their last adventure and isn't shown outside of flashbacks between the time his friends leave and the last episode.</a> Fans also hated that the show went from saving the world to participating in Demon World Politics. No one was necessarily evil in the final arc, which made fans feel mixed about who to root for. In the end, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> none of the protagonists even make it to the final round in the tournament. The antagonist beats Yusuke, but was too beat up from that fight to defeat the next opponent.</span> The sudden drop of Kuwabara combined with the anti-climactic final battle and the fact that the heroes weren't doing anything as heroic as they normally would makes most fans complain about the final arc.
</li><li> <em>Medabots Spirits</em>, the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Medabots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Medabots">Medabots</a></em>. After the confusing yet satisfying ending of the first season, fans dislike <em>Spirits</em> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">putting over half the original cast in a bus</a>. It doesn't help that the aforementioned series does have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">Canon Discontinuity</a> of its own that it's not even mentioned in dialogue &mdash; what happened previously not only with the final, but the exclusion of part of the cast.
<ul><li> The first <em>Medabots</em> had as one of its strong points, its pacing &mdash; it managed to insert a lot of plot and character subplots in few episodes, and yet never felt (too) rushed. <em>Spirits</em>, on the other hand, stuck with a single plotline (Kam's) through its entire run, and suffered dearly for it, as episodes had to constantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">reinforce the status quo</a> to stop the plotline from ending, thus advancing the plot ever so slowly for its 39 episodes. The exclusion of most of the original cast helped to make that more apparent &mdash; with less characters, episodes had to focus exclusively on Ikki, Erika and, sometimes, new character Zuru, making stories less varied. <em>Spirits</em> did away with the first series' strengths, and played up its weaknesses.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em> is an example of a good series that could REALLY do without the filler. While the earlier fillers were brushed off as the series had stayed consistent for most fans, many consider the dropping point to be what came after Kyoto. It was filler, endless amounts of filler. Much like Naruto's and to a lesser extent Bleach's it relied on poor plots and managed to drive fans away.
</li><li> While many are divided on whether or not the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Freezing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Freezing">Freezing</a></em> had its problems, the season that came after it is very much agreed to have lots of them. The most reviled of the bunch is the meshing of the Siblings and E-Pandora arcs, as it not only disrupted the story's flow, but managed to make Satellizer and Kazuya much less endearing in the process.
</li><li> Many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em> fans consider the <em>Fairy Dance</em> arc as a down part of the series, especially since it nullified the previous arc's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TearJerker/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TearJerker/SwordArtOnline">emotional</a> conclusion. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Asuna was reduced to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a>, and the romantic aspects were focused on Suguha and her feelings for Kazuto/Kirito. The fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation">the anime version removed any evidence that</a> Liz, Silica, Agil and Klein were also in the game, didn&#146;t help matters either. In addtion, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a>, Suguo, was much less intersting than the previous villain. When Episode 21 hit, the arrival of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TentacleRope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TentacleRope">Tentacle Rope</a> had the fanbase screaming and Episode 24's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape">Attempted Rape</a> of Asuna in front of Kirito sent most who had stuck with the show until that point nuclear.</span> As a result, quite a few people that had previously praised SAO have switched to bashing the series by the arc's end, and while <em>Phantom Bullet</em> and especially <em>Mother Rosario</em> have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinBackTheCrowd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinBackTheCrowd">improved things immensely</a>, some fans just can't let it go.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Buu Saga is seen as this by some fans. Most of the issues pointed are the story being more over-the-top than ever with examples such as the Super Saiyan 3 form, Piccolo being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a>, Buu in his Super form being almost the same as the previous villain Cell but lacking any solid motivation, Vegeta making a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice">Senseless Sacrifice</a> despite an attempt to develop him, Goku and Vegeta being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">Spotlight-Stealing Squad</a> <em>again</em> when the series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyProtagonist">appeared to be focusing on Gohan</a>, the divisive characters of Goten and Trunks, and the anticlimatic and sudden ending. Although, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericansHateTingle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericansHateTingle">this seems more in the West</a>. In Japan, Buu was a more popular villain than Cell (who was seen as a step down from Frieza) and Japan's audience wanted Goku back (he was ranked #1 on a fan poll) so they didn't mind him taking over the last leg of the arc along with Vegeta (who ranked #2 on the same poll).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">Dragon Ball GT</a></em> tried to recapture the charm of the pre-<em>Z</em> series but failed to emulate it. It then switched back to the <em>Z</em> style but became too convoluted story-wise and filled with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole">plot holes.</a>
</li><li> The first two arcs of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> were this, to many fans' annoyance, since they are remakes of the movies <em>Battle of Gods</em> and <em>Resurrection of F</em>, but unlike those two movies, the animation quality was infamous for how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel">Off-Model</a> and amateurish it was to the point many fans lost hope in the series. Out of the two arcs, <em>Resurrection of F</em> is considered the worst for having the worst climatic fight in the franchise as a whole, a far cry from its movie counterpart that was praised specifically for the animation in the fight scenes. While the animation still had problems, by the time of the third arc involving the Tournament with Universe 6, the show managed to recover part of its fanbase, and by the time of the Future Trunks saga, it is agreed the show grew the beard entirely.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Ai Mai Mii: Mousou Catastrophe</em>, the second season of the relatively obscure anime <em>Ai Mai Mii</em> (we don't even have a TV Tropes page for it!), lacked the fast pacing and rapid-fire gags that made the first season entertaining. Many fans found the episodes slow and boring, and the attempts at serious drama fell deep into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">Narm</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShamanKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShamanKing">Shaman King</a></em> (manga version), many readers felt like it went through this after the end of a long hiatus. Instead of becoming more interesting, they found that characters (both heroes and villains) grew much more unsympathetic and preachy. The fact that the manga ends on a condescending, defeatist note about the nature of normal humans and the future of humanity has caused some to accuse the author of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">misanthropic ranting</a>, given how little the manga actually does to refute Hao's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">anti-human views.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShugoChara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShugoChara">Shugo Chara Party!</a></em> was seen as a major downgrade compared to the previous seasons and was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseKiller">Franchise Killer</a>, and for good reason. The live action segments were seen as annoying and jarring, a mini-anime focusing on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidAppealCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidAppealCharacter">the guardian characters</a> took up a third of each episode with its unfunny gags, and the actual anime only took up <em>twelve minutes</em> of screentime, and even <em>that</em> had a whole new slew of problems. The season went through an unexpected <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift">Genre Shift</a> from a magical girl show to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> slice of life comedy. Amu is pushed to the side for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner">Canon Foreigner</a> Rikka who has a special ability that renders Amu completely irrelevant, and when her Heart's Egg actually does hatch it turns out her Guardian Character is little more than an Amulet Dia clone. And Ikuto is absent for almost the whole series only to come back for the last episode just to resolve the series' love triangle. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity">Most people like to pretend it never existed.</a> It's even believed to have had a hand in the manga ending earlier than expected, which should tell you a lot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DogDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DogDays">Dog Days</a></em> has its second and third seasons, which are generally too busy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage">stripping the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">female cast naked</a> to focus on the cute and charming characters or the overarching plotline that made the first season so enjoyable. This can be especially uncomfortable for some viewers given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoliconAndShotacon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoliconAndShotacon">how young most of the girls look</a>. One reviewer even compared the first season to a serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualNovel">Visual Novel</a> with the latter two being the bonus discs with all the pervy extra content.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars">Food Wars!</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Tootsuki Reformation Arc is considered this for a number of reasons. Among them is the tone of the arc being too serious for a manga relying on over-the-top cooking competitions, but without any actual depth to it. Having basically every character aside from Erina, Soma and their fathers fall <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> was also not a welcome decision in the eyes of many fans. Furthermore, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue">Arc Fatigue</a> set in as the pace slowed down to a gruesome crawl that led to the arc taking two and a half years to finish (slightly bettered by having small mini-arcs within it, but still), leading to a rushed resolution that many found anti-climatic.
</li><li> The previous arc had already left the manga with a mixed reception, but it was immediately followed by the even more poorly received Les Cuisiner Noir Arc, which introduced a group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Scrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Scrappy">Scrappies</a> as the villains with implausible cooking gimmicks (that the author tries to pass off as superpowers) and egregiously destroying the previously established status quo regarding abilities of the characters. This came at the expense of ignoring the already established ensemble which contained more likeable characters. It also derailed Soma and Erina's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> in order to set up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> in a convoluted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor">Romantic Plot Tumor</a> between them and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, and forces a number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">Ass Pull</a> twists in order to set up the villains and move the plot forward. Also, in the climax, the author prioritized Erina's family issues over resolving Soma's progress and goals&mdash;which was the original premise of the manga.
</li></ul></li><li> Many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatch">Yo-Kai Watch</a></em> fans believe the original anime suffered from this in it's later episodes (especially in the third season) and is responsible for the decline in viewership of the show, with the increase of recurring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">Scrappy</a> characters, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumor">Toilet Humor</a>, the mischaracterization of several popular Yokai from the games, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderization</a> of several characters, and, in the case of the English dub, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">changing of the voice actors</a> for the third season.
</li><li> When this started happening to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> isn't quite agreed on by fans, but the general census is that the Magic Tournament arc is where series dipped in quality and never recovered from. From wasting several characters such as the entirety of the Raven Tail guild, to the large amount of anti-climatic fights such as Erza's fights with Minerva and Kagura being disappointingly easy fights for her or Sting losing to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfFriendship">Power of Friendship</a> despite his smart plan to fight the heroes after they were worn out, and the wasted usage of the finale being a fight against several Dragons with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> that has almost no personality, its seen as the start of the decline of the series. The next several arcs all attempted to recapture fans, and for a bit the Tartarus was seen as the best arc in the story, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue">Arc Fatigue</a> quickly set in and people lost interest in it. By the time of the final arc, many felt the series no longer was enjoyable.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Spider-Man</em> comics were consistently popular and well-received for over 30 years until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga">The Clone Saga</a> of 1994-1996. The storyline initially featured decent sales figures, but by the end, not so much. The negativity was largely because the Clone Saga <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndingFatigue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndingFatigue">just wouldn't end</a>. After it was all over, the newer storylines were seen as an improvement, but the harm was done with sales still in deep trouble. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> led to those storylines being cancelled, two of the four titles being outright cancelled, the remaining two being rebooted and a deeply unpopular era overseen by Howard Mackie and John Bryne.
</li><li> The JMS run is generally agreed to have started out very good, with some cool new additions to Spidey's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery">Rogues Gallery</a> and the introduction of a solid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a>. But then Editor in Chief Joe Quesada began <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">ruthlessly meddling</a> in nearly everything, which led to horrible plot twists and storylines like <em>Sins Past</em> and <em>One More Day</em>, turning the Myth Arc into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChrisCarterEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChrisCarterEffect">a tangled mess</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/OneMoreDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/OneMoreDay">One More Day</a></em>/<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BrandNewDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BrandNewDay">Brand New Day</a></em> has the wider rot problem of the sales of the franchise going straight into the toilet, even with Marvel cancelling all satellite Spider-Man books and upping Amazing Spider-Man to three times a month publication. Marvel hyped <em>Amazing Spider-Man #647</em> as "the end of Brand New Day," but in truth simply changed the release schedule to twice a month in a desperate effort to save the comic, as the unpopular new direction was causing it to hemorrhage readers at that point. At that point, Dan Slott's "Big Time" arc began and his run was well-received, however...
</li><li> Declining sales and conflicting opinions of the fans about the quality of the writing may have played a part in the decision to axe <em>Amazing Spider-Man</em> and relaunch the book as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan">Superior Spider-Man</a></em>... complete with the divisive gimmickery of Doc Ock possessing Peter Parker's body to give the book a meaty hook. Needless to say, fans were <em>steamed</em>, sending death threats Dan Slott's way before the book even hit stands. Sales stabilized for a time, but some research indicates cracks are beginning to show again.
</li><li> Slott's run itself, once praised as a return to form with the well-received <em>Big Time</em>, <em>No One Dies</em>, and especially <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderIsland">Spider-Island</a></em> storylines, is widely considered to have gone through this as well. Some say that the aforementioned <em>Superior</em> was the starting point, especially since in order for the story to work Slott flat-out ignored that Spider-Man's supporting cast have traditionally been among the best normal humans at playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotTheImpostor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotTheImpostor">Spot the Impostor</a>, but that book built up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic">cult following</a> of its own. By contrast, almost nobody likes the relaunched <em>Amazing</em> title with Peter back in the mantle. It got off on a bad foot to begin with by having all of Peter's previous love interests dump him so he could be paired with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Silk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Silk">Silk</a>, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalCharacter">Original Character</a> of Slott's widely derided as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sue</a>, then continued with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderVerse">Spider-Verse</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatFamilyCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatFamilyCrossover">Bat Family Crossover</a>, which consisted largely of various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> Spider-People being brutally killed, some of whom died in ways that got fans speculating that Slott was <em>trying</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity">to piss them off</a>. Slott did his own case no favors by revealing himself to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimaDonnaDirector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimaDonnaDirector">prima donna writer</a> on social media, to the point that even those fans who like his writing won't defend him as a person.
</li></ul></li><li> While the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/XMen">X-Men</a></em> books have had their share of up and down periods, it could be said that the former flagship title <em>Uncanny X-Men</em> experienced a decline in quality starting with 1998's "Hunt for Xavier" arc, from which it did not recover fully until the end of Chris Claremont's third run on the title in 2007, when Ed Brubaker took over the book.
<ul><li> Another common view is that the franchise became a directionless mire of unresolved storylines, inconsistent characterization, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TangledFamilyTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TangledFamilyTree">tangled family trees</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">alternate universes</a> and angst shortly after the end of Claremont's first run. 1998 did indeed mark the beginning of a severe creative decline that exacerbated these issues and alienated both dedicated and new readers. Either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a> is said to have heralded a brief return to the quality and relevance of the mutants' heyday.
</li><li> There was also another period of rot that ended in 2011, though fans are divided on when it <em>started</em>. Some place the beginning as far back as 2005 and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HouseOfM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HouseOfM">House of M</a></em>, the aftermath of which left mutants a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingRace">Dying Race</a> and the "struggle for survival" aspect of the comic being played up repeatedly and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anviliciously</a>. Others are more generous and say the rot didn't kick in until 2009, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattFraction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattFraction">Matt Fraction</a>'s run (often considered the second-worst in the book's history) and the "Utopia" storyline. Thankfully, things seem to be getting back on track; the return of the Xavier Institute, gone since 2008, has been particularly praised.
</li><li> There's a dissenting opinion that the whole arc from House of M to Second Coming or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersVsXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersVsXMen">Avengers vs. X-Men</a></em> was a strong arc with the mutant race saved in a satisfying manner, but the period after had direction and resolution issues one after another, with the Revolutionary Cyclops storyline starting strong but petering out, the 'should we send back the O5?' story being answered in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BattleOfTheAtom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BattleOfTheAtom">Battle of the Atom</a></em> with no judgement calls needed or possible, and finally the Inhumans plot being where the main conflict was a blatant rehash of the Decimation arc of Mutant Kind itself in jeopardy, plus Cyclops was treated in-universe as a reviled name for stopping a poison cloud from killing thousands. This culminated in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InhumansVsXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InhumansVsXMen">Inhumans vs. X-Men</a></em> which was itself a rehash of Avengers vs X-men but deeply suffers from attempting moral equivalence in a conflict where one side is trying to stop genocide by negligence and the other side's stance is it's okay if <em>some</em> people get poisoned as long as they can keep producing super powers. While <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvX">Av X</a> had flaws, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IvX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IvX">Iv X</a> had the inglorious position of being a combination of "two" storylines that'd been done better soon before, leaving fans scratching their heads as to the editorial's and writer's grasp of the moral situation they'd set up.
</li></ul></li><li> Depending on who you ask, the seasonal rot for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> started either after issue #50 (the appropriately-titled "Endgame" arc, which was intended as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> but was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">changed at the last minute</a>, which caused problems for the writers), #125 (the end of a then-highly contentious arc, which led to a few issues in space followed by a one-year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>) or after issue #200.
</li><li> This seems to be happening with the "second season" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderManLovesMaryJane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderManLovesMaryJane">Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane</a></em>, since the writer <em>and</em> the artist both left and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">they subsequently hired new people</a>. The writing and art style shift is... jarring, to say the least.
</li><li> The "Reads" arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CerebusTheAardvark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CerebusTheAardvark">Cerebus</a></em>, largely due to consisting mostly of an extended <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster">Author Filibuster</a>.
</li><li> The first half of 2009 issues of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> Season 8 comic is vastly considered to be the weakest point of the entire series so far. The second half of 2009 is also considered sub-par by many, though not to the same extent.
</li><li> When Claremont took over writing duties for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Exiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Exiles">Exiles</a></em>, it was with the editorial edict passed down upon him to get rid of the mainstay characters and replace them with variations of his pet characters (such as a spoiled brat version of Rogue, a gender-flip version of Mystique, a generic teenage version of Shadowcat, etc.) Needless to say it didn't take well with fans.
</li><li> Robert Kirkman's run on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UltimateXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UltimateXMen">Ultimate X-Men</a></em> is generally thought of as a bit of a low point for the series.
<ul><li> Many readers consider the series to have been at its absolute worst during <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AronColeite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AronColeite">Aron Coleite's</a> run.
</li></ul></li><li> The common fan consensus is that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WITCH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WITCH">W.I.T.C.H.</a></em> started going downhill after Orube got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> following Cedric's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath">Redemption Equals Death</a>.

"New Power" and everything after that is often treated as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity">Fanon Discontinuity</a>, especially when they decided that having a plot be about a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice">Mr. Fanservice</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteHairBlackHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteHairBlackHeart">White Hair, Black Heart</a> and his romance with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientistsBeautifulDaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientistsBeautifulDaughter">Mad Scientist's Beautiful Daughter</a> (who uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousJapanese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousJapanese">Gratuitous Japanese</a>) would be a good idea.
</li><li> See if you can find a fan of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Marvel1602" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Marvel1602">Marvel 1602</a></em> who admits that the sequels were of the same quality. We'll wait. Granted, the original series had <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a></em>, and that's a hard act to follow.
</li><li> Most fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em> will tell you that the series started to decline in quality immediately after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianKVaughan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianKVaughan">Brian K. Vaughan</a> left, but the rot really started to set in when the series was rebooted under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryMoore">Terry Moore</a> and Humberto Ramos. Moore had a limited grasp of the characters' personalities and couldn't find the proper balance between comedy and drama, and Ramos' cartoonish style was not very flattering to the non-white members of the cast and did not mesh very well with a story arc that saw Karolina and Xavin being accused of genocide (and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Xavin ultimately handing themselves over to the antagonists to answer for their supposed crimes</span>.) Things improved when Moore and Ramos left, but the series was eventually cancelled in 2009.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix">Asterix</a></em>: After the death of script writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ReneGoscinny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ReneGoscinny">Ren&eacute; Goscinny</a>, artist Albert Uderzo took the difficult decision of continuing the series alone. Though the art work of these comics were still top notch and the stories OK on their own terms, Uderzo lacked the wit of his genius script writer. Many <em>Asterix</em> stories after 1977 are far less clever and funny and more fantastical and melodramatic. It essentially became more geared at children than before, with the atrocious <em>Asterix and the Falling Sky</em> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0m4xv');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0m4xv" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0m4xv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> where science fiction elements are mixed in </span> as the final sign that Uderzo just didn't care anymore. He quit drawing the strip after that and new artists have continued the series.
</li><li> Seasonal Rot has been noticeable in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuskeEnWiske" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuskeEnWiske">Suske en Wiske</a></em> ever since the series started using standard Dutch and moralistic endings in the 1960s. The decline of the series sank even lower after their creator Willy Vandersteen got less and less involved. After his death in 1990 the comic strip predictably went for the worse, with storylines that have less and less to do with the original set-up. It only shows that Vandersteen's genius for comedy and storytelling was really unique, as his successors were unable to follow in his footsteps.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDandy">The Dandy</a></em> of the latter half of the 1960s and 1970s, while considered a golden age for the comic by some, is often seen as a weak point in the comic's history by many due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDecadesBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDecadesBehind">how badly the comic fell behind the times</a>, with outdated strips like Black Bob and Winker Watson running in an era where other comics had more relatable, down to earth strips like Dennis the Menace. To add to this, most people drawing the strips were veteran artists who had started with comics in the 1940s or before. If an artist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">died</a>, then more often than not their strips were reprinted, rather than replaced or given a new artist. Little effort was made to remedy this until Albert Barnes, who had been the <em>Dandy</em> editor since its inception in the 1930s, was finally replaced... <em>in 1982</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattFraction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattFraction">Matt Fraction</a>'s run on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">The Mighty Thor</a></em> was heavily criticized for mischaracterization, drawn-out stories with no payoffs and abrupt endings, and ignoring any history that was not absolutely vital to the title. The shoddy quality is very noticeable since it followed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski">JMS</a>' critically acclaimed run.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Venom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Venom">Agent Venom</a></em> ran into this after Rick Remender left the comic and Cullen Bunn took over as full-time writer. While there were some good points (as well as the introduction of Mania, a <em>huge</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a>), in the end the comic just wasn't the same with a far less interesting main villain, less panel time for Flash's supporting cast and established foes, and a general decrease in the characterization that had been the comic's strong point. The book limped on for a bit before being cancelled midway through the resolution of its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a>.
</li><li> Almost the <em>entire</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate Universe</a> went through this, as all the writers except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianMichaelBendis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianMichaelBendis">Brian Michael Bendis</a> either treated it like a part of the company where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity">continuity doesn't matter</a> (creating tons of plot holes and character derailments) or seemed to think its purpose was to be as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy">overly dark and angsty as possible</a>. The only books that haven't been struck with this are <em>Ultimate Spider-Man</em> and the books directly linked to it. The Ultimate Universe rotted to the point where it was officially destroyed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretWars2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretWars2015">Secret Wars (2015)</a></em>.
</li><li> The original run of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RogueTrooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RogueTrooper">Rogue Trooper</a></em> should have ended, in the opinion of many fans, when Rogue dealt with the Traitor General. The Friday reboot and subsequent merging of both continuities only made things worse. Newer Rogue strips are, as a result, set during Rogue's heyday.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLeagueOfExtraordinaryGentlemen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLeagueOfExtraordinaryGentlemen">The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a></em>: Volumes I and II are very well-regarded due to having very strong plots which support a plethora of literary references and dirty jokes. However, in Volume 3 and <em>Black Dossier</em> the plot really takes a backseat to the references, which become increasingly obscure, and the jokes, which become increasingly dirty. What began as a fun comic any moderately well-read individual could enjoy became a nigh-incomprehensible tour of all the weird books <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a> wants you to know he has read. The <em>Century</em> mini-series also gets this reaction quite a bit, due to it both continuing several of the aforementioned issues regarding plotting and unnecessarily obscure references while also gradually becoming an extended <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">Author Tract</a> on why Alan Moore hates all twenty-first century pop culture and especially <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>.
</li><li> To many, Scott Snyder's <em>Batman</em> work is affected by this. It started off strong with the "Black Mirror" arc in <em>Detective Comics</em>, which was a largely low stakes story with Dick Grayson as Batman, and a more classic take on the franchise while Grant Morrison was doing his typical experimental and trippy stuff. He also had the <em>Gates of Gotham</em> miniseries, which is liked for using underutilised characters while also doing some good world-building for Gotham. Then came the "Court of Owls" arc, which is generally liked for a neat conspiracy angle and some more world-building, although it's considered overly long and wordy by some. And now is where the rot may or may not set in, depending on who you ask:
<ul><li> "Death of the Family", an incredibly divisive arc which featured the return of the Joker and loads and loads of death, violence and gore, with the Joker himself hitting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleVillain">Invincible Villain</a> levels, and things get wordier.
</li><li> Then came "Zero Year", a story meant to give readers Batman's new origin that has been unfavourably compared to the acclaimed "Year One" by Frank Miller, while also suffering from a huge case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue">Arc Fatigue</a> (it ran for an <em>actual</em> year, not including the zero issue) that led many to stop reading the series. People came back for Snyder's "Endgame" arc, which is also divisive for the weird attempt at retconning the Joker to be some immortal spirit... thing. Also, wordy.
</li><li> Many fans agree that the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batman">Batman</a></em> storyline "Superheavy", is this for Scott Snyder's entire run on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheNew52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheNew52">The New 52</a>. The storyline saw James Gordon play a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a>-riding Batman when the real Batman vanished after the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanEndgame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanEndgame">Batman: Endgame</a></em>. A lot of it had to do with the fact that Gordon was a real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> most of the time and many readers were just waiting for Bruce to finally decide to hop back in the saddle. At the same time, the story focused way too much on the idea that Jim had to be Batman <em>his</em> way, which is a story idea incredibly overdone not only within the superhero genre as a whole, but also within the Batman franchise. In fact, "Superheavy" did little aside from deal with Jim's insecurities and Bruce returning to the role, with an utterly forgettable villain in the centre. And even the Bruce stuff was generic, with it just... happening the way you'd think it would after the first issue. The series concluded, and by the time Tom King came on as a new writer and Snyder was put onto <em>All-Star Batman</em>, a sigh of relief was had by all...
</li><li> Until <em>Dark Nights: Metal</em> happened! It's an incredibly divisive event for how it runs off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a> and attempts to pull some very... odd retcons, like having all the immortals in the DCU be connected, a strange retcon to Hawkman and Hawkgirl's origins that makes them weird immortals who still die, as well as it's interpretation of Barbatos. While Snyder's early Batman work was loved, these days, he's divisive at best.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Earth2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Earth2">Earth 2</a></em>: There's some disagreement on when it set in, but general consensus is that, by the time it ended, it was a mercy killing.
<ul><li> Some say the series had an immediate drop in quality once James Robinson left, with the original premise, that it was the place where the Justice Society and other discarded characters could flourish, was scrapped in favour of more Superman and Batman. This was also accompanied by constant conflict and conflict, with no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherEpisode">Breather Episode</a> to let the characters or readers catch a break.
</li><li> Others feel it was the <em>Worlds End</em> run that did it, with the writer blatantly not doing his research (or remembering his own writing in the case of Dick Grayson's son changing names multiple times) and telling drawn out, grimdark stories that just went nowhere. And of course, the constant, unending fighting went on.
</li><li> And yet <em>others</em> feel that <em>Society</em> is what finally killed it, with the distrust of heroes being pushed to an unbearable extreme, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConflictBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConflictBall">Conflict Ball</a> being the default trope, and obvious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> at play as stories were retreaded time and again &mdash; sometimes a story will be heading in one direction then suddenly stop... only to basically be retold! And then the Justice Society was announced as returning to the main DCU, and it seemed like the series just existed to waste time by that point.

Then Chester Gould dropped out of the production and was replaced by Max Allan Collins, who helped the series regrow by killing off most of everything that the jive era created in the comic until 1992, where more artists took over and the series degraded to this point.

However, fall and winter of 2011, and spring of 2012, only brought videos in which the heroes spout some one-liners. None of them exceed two minutes, either. Fans find this especially frustrating because the arc that began in December 2009, "Zero Hour", didn't have a proper conclusion until 2013. Summer 2012 saw new blockbuster movies for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises">Batman</a>, but circumstances beyond ItsJustSomeRandomGuy's control prevented him from making videos about them.

Add to that the absence of Jonathan Frid as fan favorite character Barnabas Collins (though Frid <strong>had</strong> been in the first film, and the second featured the as popular David Selby as an alternate version of his regular Quentin Collins character) and the fans stayed away in droves.

But everyone agreed 2013's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AGoodDayToDieHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AGoodDayToDieHard">A Good Day to Die Hard</a></em> was a low point. Despite the film's return to a hard R, it was criticized for "how terrible [it] looked" compared to the previous films. The plot barely felt like <em>Die Hard</em>, McClane was reduced to a sidekick, and the "super cop" tendencies he exhibited in <em>Live Free</em> were Flanderized even further.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScaryMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScaryMovie">Scary Movie</a></em> series started to get this in 2003, due to the absence of the Wayans Bros., and the fact that the traditional/significant R-rating was omitted. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScaryMovie5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScaryMovie5">fifth installment</a> in 2013 actually gets it worse than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScaryMovie3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScaryMovie3">3</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScaryMovie4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScaryMovie4">4</a></em>. Mostly due to the absence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnnaFaris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnnaFaris">Anna Faris</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AshleyTisdale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AshleyTisdale">Ashley Tisdale</a> taking her place for this one (mostly by people who have only seen Ashley in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighSchoolMusical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighSchoolMusical">High School Musical</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSuiteLifeOfZackAndCody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSuiteLifeOfZackAndCody">The Suite Life of Zack and Cody</a></em>). The comedy was also attacked, and the fact that it was also a PG-13 rating did not help this installment either. All of this before it was released. After all that it got an 11 on Metacritic.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OurGang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OurGang">The Little Rascals</a></em> was hit by this in 1938, when the series moved to MGM. Fans of the shorts have criticized the MGM years for growing progressively unfunnier, removing the charm that the Hal Roach shorts had, and becoming moralistic, preachy and patriotic.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurelAndHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurelAndHardy">Laurel and Hardy</a></em>:
<ul><li> When the main characters permanently moved from making short comedies to feature films, producer Hal Roach insisted on stronger stories for the team, often featuring a romantic subplot involving characters that were barely related to Stan and Ollie. To this day, fans feel that the side stories nearly slowed the films down to a complete halt.
</li><li> Things grew worse when Laurel and Hardy left Roach in 1940, and signed contracts with both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TwentiethCenturyFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TwentiethCenturyFox">20th Century Fox</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MetroGoldwynMayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MetroGoldwynMayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a>. While some fans feel the quality of the Fox movies gradually improved, for the most part fans agree that the team's later entries don't hold a candle to their films produced by Roach. This is largely due to the fact that the duo were given scripts that didn't suit their characters.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges">The Three Stooges</a></em>:
<ul><li> The films began to rot around 1945, when signs for Curly Howard's failing health were all too noticeable. Curly clearly lacked the energy he had in his prime, and was unable to do the improvisation that help make his character funny. Things picked up considerably when Shemp Howard replaced Curly in 1946. Unfortunately, the quality of the Stooges' films began to slip again around 1952 when producer Jules White took full control of Columbia Pictures' shorts department. As a way to cut costs, White had the Stooges remake several of their older films, using tons of stock footage from the new films' predecessors. There were times in so much stock footage was used that it only took White and the Stooges a day to film the new material. This method continued after Shemp's death in 1955. In this case, the new footage would consist of either Moe Howard and Larry Fine acting as a two man team (they briefly considered renaming the act <em>The Two Stooges</em>), or Moe and Larry with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeShemp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeShemp">Fake Shemp</a> Joe Palma. The series didn't improve much when comedian Joe Besser joined the act as Shemp's replacement the following year. Besser's obvious lack of chemistry with the veteran Stooges made him seem like a third wheel, rather than a team member.
</li><li> Besser was replaced by Curly Joe DeRita in 1958. The Curly Joe films were marketed as children's films, featuring family friendly story lines, slower pacing (likely due to the Stooges' advanced ages), and noticeably little slapstick violence. Furthermore, DeRita lacked a familiar screen persona that could make him stand out individually. The reason the Stooges weren't as violent in their later films was due to complaints from parent groups who feared the trio's brand of humor was a poor influence on children. Initially, only certain gags were removed from the act, such as the Stooges' trademark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyePoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyePoke">two-finger eye poke</a>. This is even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in <em>The Three Stooges Go Around the World in a Daze</em>, when the Stooges turn a trio of Chinese officers into Stooge clones. Moe's clone gives a Chinese general the famous eye poke, but Moe tells him, "Uh-uh. That's Number 21. We don't do that anymore."
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamRaimi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamRaimi">Sam Raimi</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan3">Spider-Man 3</a></em> and Marc Webb's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan2">The Amazing Spider-Man 2</a></em> have both been panned by critics and fans of the franchise. Both films have been accused of having too many sub-plots, horrific tonal shifts, poor characterizations of series villains, and plot holes that you could fly a jetliner through. However, both films do have their defenders, who will spend a lot of time arguing which film did it worse.
</li><li> The quality of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/UniversalHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/UniversalHorror">Universal Horror</a> films took a general dive during the mid-1940s. Most fans would agree that the franchise's golden age lasted from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dracula1931" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dracula1931">Dracula (1931)</a></em> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWolfMan1941" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWolfMan1941">The Wolf Man (1941)</a></em>, a decade that contained a few duds but was mostly undisputed classics. 1942's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGhostOfFrankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGhostOfFrankenstein">The Ghost of Frankenstein</a></em> marked the franchise's transition from A-movies to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BMovie">B-movies</a>, and the films that followed generally had uninspired plots, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">unpopular replacements</a> of actors who had defined iconic roles in the previous decade, and a failure to take any real advantage of the novel idea of monsters showing up in each other's movies (for example, Frankenstein's monster and the Wolf Man both appear in 1945's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HouseOfDracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HouseOfDracula">House of Dracula</a></em> but neither of them actually share any scenes with Dracula, or each other for that matter). 1948's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AbbottAndCostelloMeetFrankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AbbottAndCostelloMeetFrankenstein">Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein</a></em> was more well received that what came before it, and 1954's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CreatureFromTheBlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CreatureFromTheBlackLagoon">Creature from the Black Lagoon</a></em> was a massive success, temporarily stopping the rot before its own sequels turned out to be disappointments.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla">Godzilla</a></em> series has had some rough periods during its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">very, very long</a> history.
<ul><li> The films made from 1954 to 1965 are seen as the classic series' golden age. The rot began with 1966's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EbirahHorrorOfTheDeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EbirahHorrorOfTheDeep">Ebirah, Horror of the Deep</a>,</em> which moved the action from urban Japan to a more budget-friendly deserted island, featured very silly monster fights, and in general was a much less compelling film than its predecessors. With the exception of the fan favorite <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DestroyAllMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DestroyAllMonsters">Destroy All Monsters</a></em>, the rest of the films made until the classic series ended in 1975 tended to follow suit, increasingly relying on tricks such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage">reusing footage</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouLookFamiliar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouLookFamiliar">casting the same few actors over and over again</a> to stretch the ever-shrinking budgets. Some fans enjoy how far-out and wacky the films got during this period, but most see it as a dark age. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AllMonstersAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AllMonstersAttack">All Monsters Attack</a></em> is considered the absolute low point of the series, due to basically being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow">Clip Show</a> of pre-existing monster battles edited together with footage of some kid dealing with school bullies.
</li><li> The series was rebooted in 1984, and this new string of films is fairly well-liked, but 1994's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsSpaceGodzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaVsSpaceGodzilla">Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla</a></em> is universally seen as its weakest link due to its incoherent tone and rather underdeveloped story.
</li><li> The series was rebooted <em>again</em> in 1999, lasting until 2004, and fans tend to think that most of the films from this period are at best, forgettable, and at worst, horrible. The <em>only</em> well-liked film made in those years is the unfortunately titled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaMothraKingGhidorahGiantMonstersAllOutAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaMothraKingGhidorahGiantMonstersAllOutAttack">Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack!</a></em>. Common criticisms of the others are that they lacked originality and relied on emulating the older movies and popular anime at the time too much (with only one entirely new monster being introduced), refused to build up any sort of coherent continuity, with each film taking place in its own self-contained version of the Godzilla universe, and made Godzilla far too powerful, to the point of there being no doubt at all that he would win every battle.

The lone exception is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FinalDestination4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FinalDestination4">the fourth film</a>, which is unanimously held to be by far the worst in the series, on account of its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DullSurprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DullSurprise">Dull Surprise</a> acting, blandly-written characters, a general lack of suspense, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure">Special Effect Failure</a> leading to fairly crappy kills and an unimpressive opening disaster, and abuse of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeDMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeDMovie">its 3D gimmick</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FinalDestination5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FinalDestination5">next film</a>, fortunately, is generally seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinBackTheCrowd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinBackTheCrowd">a return to form</a> that sent the series out on a high note; unfortunately, it wasn't able to shake the poor reception of its predecessor, and its low domestic box-office returns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseKiller">ended the series</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeARomero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeARomero">George A. Romero</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LivingDeadSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LivingDeadSeries">Living Dead Series</a></em> is often held as having produced three outright classic, genre-defining zombie horror films, 1968's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightOfTheLivingDead1968" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightOfTheLivingDead1968">Night of the Living Dead</a></em>, 1978's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DawnOfTheDead1978" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DawnOfTheDead1978">Dawn of the Dead</a></em>, and 1985's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DayOfTheDead1985" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DayOfTheDead1985">Day of the Dead</a></em>. Romero's return to the zombie genre in 2005, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LandOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LandOfTheDead">Land of the Dead</a></em>, didn't receive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughActToFollow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughActToFollow">the praise of its predecessors</a> but was still seen as a welcome comeback from the pioneer of zombie horror. His 2007 follow-up <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DiaryOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DiaryOfTheDead">Diary of the Dead</a></em>, however, did not meet the same positive reception, being widely criticized as a failed attempt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">cash in</a> on the emerging boom in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoundFootageFilms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoundFootageFilms">Found Footage Films</a> that didn't understand how that genre worked. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SurvivalOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SurvivalOfTheDead">Survival of the Dead</a></em> in 2009 indicated to many fans that Romero's spark had finally faded, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorKiller">he retired from filmmaking afterwards</a>.
</li><li> Fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream">Scream</a></em> love the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream1996" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream1996">original 1996 film</a>, and many approve of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream2">the second film</a> as well, to the point where there's a small but vocal chunk of the fanbase that thinks it's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBetterSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBetterSequel">Even Better Sequel</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream3">The third film</a>, however, lost the original writer Kevin Williamson, could only get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeveCampbell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeveCampbell">Neve Campbell</a> (who played the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalGirl">Final Girl</a> Sidney) for a few days of shooting due to her schedule, and had to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistancedFromCurrentEvents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistancedFromCurrentEvents">heavily rewritten after</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Columbine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Columbine">Columbine</a> massacre in order to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">tone down the violence</a>, producing a film that many fans regarded as feeling less like its predecessors and more like the many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">Follow the Leader</a> teen horror films that proliferated in their wake. Fortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scream4">the fourth film</a>, made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelGap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelGap">eleven years later</a> and riding on nostalgia for the original trilogy, brought back Williamson and is generally felt to be a worthy sequel, if not as good as the first film then at least up there with the second. Fans of the films don't think particularly highly of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ScreamTVSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ScreamTVSeries">spinoff TV series</a> that came after, but since that's its own separate continuity, it can be, and often is, easily ignored.
</li><li> Fans of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Saw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Saw">Saw</a></em> series may debate which of the first three films was the best, but most will agree that, after that, the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> turned into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot">Kudzu Plot</a> as the studio sought to keep its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise">Cash Cow Franchise</a> going even though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseZombie">its creators only ever intended to make three films</a>.

Some readers are even more harsh, and will claim the rot started even earlier, with <em>The Fires of Heaven</em> or even <em>The Shadow Rising</em>, which is the largest novel in the series, and the one where several of the more-hated aspects really came to the fore. Either way, <em>Knife of Dreams</em> was a significant improvement, resolving several plots and paving the way for the final book with, by WoT standards, barely any padding at all, and the last four books feature a drastic acceleration in the plot.

Shortly after introducing us to the world of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStand">The Stand</a></em> (a storyline with promise), all we get is a flashback sequence that doesn't flesh out the narrating character any more than the previous books had. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorStopper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorStopper">Six hundred pages later</a>, we return to the story, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> which culminates in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimax">Anti-Climax</a> as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> was reduced to a gibbering lunatic with a handful of grenades, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Dragon</a> was offed by his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardBastard">actual bastard</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">Scrappy</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">ultimate fate of the protagonist was left uncertain</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot">but hopeful.</a></span>
<ul><li> What makes <em>Wizard and Glass</em> so painful is the focus of the story. Two stories are happening during the flashback: The War and The Town. One is about the huge shadow-war that is being fought between the armies of the Crimson King and the Gunslingers. This is the one about mythical battles and powerful artifacts being brought to bear against nightmarish demons and mechanical abominations as the world is quickly being brought to the cataclysm that framed the past three books. The other is about Roland's first girlfriend. Guess <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString">which gets the book</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome">which gets the chapter.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Naked Empire</em>, the eighth book of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth">Sword of Truth</a></em> series, is commonly thought to be the weakest part of the series by even people who like it as a whole. Yes, this is the book with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter">evil pacifists</a></em>. Afterward, the series gains back some of its momentum in the three last books.
</li><li> Jean M. Auel's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EarthsChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EarthsChildren">Earth's Children</a></em> series
<ul><li> Book 5 <em>The Shelters of Stone</em>. Boring repeats of the same kind of issues the characters have faced in the past, no real drama or storyline to carry through the book, retconning... Basically a boring read about two characters who have the same discussions with people as they've had for two books already. The fact that it was published more than a decade after book four might have had something to do with Auel losing her style.
</li><li> <em>The Land of the Painted Caves</em>, last installment of the series, manages to be even worse than <em>Shelters</em>. Specifically, it had the same conversations repeated almost word for word about six times throughout the novel &mdash; every time Ayla met someone new, the same conversation went on about how she acquired Wolf. <em>Plains of Passage</em>, with the whole story being one long journey and a six page sex scene every five pages, got pretty boring, too.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaximumRide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaximumRide">Maximum Ride</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first three books were all well done, engaging action-y novels, if increasingly showing the fact that the author doesn't so much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette">have a plan</a> as more that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot">making it all up</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy">as he goes along</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InDeath">In Death</a></em> series: A number of readers would argue that this has occurred for this series, but where did it happen is debatable. Still, the book <em>New York To Dallas</em> has a number of reviewers feeling that the series is going to come to an end soon.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SisterhoodSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SisterhoodSeries">Sisterhood Series</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FernMichaels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FernMichaels">Fern Michaels</a>: This trope most certainly occurred after the book <em>Free Fall</em>. The author herself said that she was only planning on writing 7 books for the series... at first. Then she decided to write more books. This resulted in 13 more books, and the storyline eventually just dragged on. That, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseOriginalSin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseOriginalSin">a number of flaws that had been present in the first 7 books</a> became glaringly obvious, and the final book <em>Home Free</em> did have an ending that likely left readers feeling that the series ended not with a bang, but a whimper!
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a> novels get varying levels of this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThrawnTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThrawnTrilogy">The Thrawn Trilogy</a> (which began the modern EU) is usually very well-received, while the quality is considered to have gradually slacked off across Bantam's run as publisher (with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCrystalStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCrystalStar">The Crystal Star</a></em> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Callista Trilogy</a>) often singled out as particular low points. When Del Rey took over the contract, their initial output was the epic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NewJediOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NewJediOrder">New Jedi Order</a></em> saga which was incredibly polarizing. However, the next big series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegacyOfTheForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegacyOfTheForce">Legacy of the Force</a></em>, is profoundly disliked among the fandom, and the subsequent <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FateOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FateOfTheJedi">Fate of the Jedi</a></em> is only considered marginally better.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnCarterOfMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnCarterOfMars">John Carter of Mars</a>: <em>John Carter and the Giant of Mars</em> (the first of the two short stories that make up the eleventh book) is considered by a lot of fans to be weaker than the other Barsoom stories, and is generally considered something of an afterthought. The fact that it wasn't actually written by Edgar Rice Burroughs himself but rather by his son John "Jack" Coleman Burroughs doesn't help either. Further, it was written as a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Little_Book_series">"Big Little Book"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, a format that <em>required</em> a captioned illustration opposite each page of text, and which were intended for children, unlike the original John Carter novels.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a></em> series, the fourth arc, <em>Omen of the Stars</em>, is generally considered to be the least popular. Some of the most common complaints are the main characters having superpowers and plot points being reused several times (such as forbidden romance).
</li><li> None of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Flashman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Flashman">Flashman</a></em> books are hated per se, but <em>Flashman and the Tiger</em> is the least well-regarded. For one, Fraser uses three short, unconnected novellas instead of a single narrative; for another, he inserts Sherlock Holmes and Watson into one of his stories. This and ongoing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay">Badass Decay</a> have led to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">heated arguments among ''Flashman'' fans</a> over <em>Tiger</em>.
</li><li> Sergey Sukhinov's <em>Emerald City</em> decalogy (see <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfTheMagicLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfTheMagicLand">Tales of the Magic Land</a></em>) is hit <strong>very</strong> hard by this. The series started superb, with carefully crafted plot, well-thought characters (heroes and villains alike) and very compelling story. Things started to turn sour after book 5, where the plot started to get strange, the books produced one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">Ass Pull</a> after another and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot">ran some previously very promising arcs into the ground</a> (Corina's redemption, for example). It went From Bad To Worse since the middle of book 8, which featured massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment">Character Derailment</a> of many previously very consistently portrayed characters, resulting in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot">Idiot Plot</a> in turn. The books than started to get weirder, suddenly veering into huge flashbacks in the middle of action, and introducing science fiction elements in what was before a fairy tale or fantasy story. This all culminates in the last book, which reveals that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> and his cronies are "Star Legionnaires of Darkness" (sic!), alternates between extreme silliness and taking itself way too seriously, and finishes with the all-decisive fight between the heroes and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> ending with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainExitStageLeft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainExitStageLeft">the Big Bad suddenly fleeing in the middle of fight</a>, while most plot lines concerning minor villains and heroes are simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftHanging">Left Hanging</a>, and the epilogue, set five years later, never mentioning them. All in all, an <strong>extremely</strong> disappointing ending to a series that began so very promising.
</li><li> Quite a few people think that with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HisDarkMaterials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HisDarkMaterials">His Dark Materials</a></em> trilogy, the last book "The Amber Spyglass", is considerably weaker then the others as a lot of it is an uncomfortable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">Author Tract</a> on how bad all religion is. Add to that the implied sexual relationship between children and the fact the big battle takes place off-screen...
</li><li> Many consider the later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall">Redwall</a></em> books to have fallen into this. It varies depending on who you ask but most agree it started with <em>Triss</em> if not earlier. Yet <em>The Sable Quean</em> revived the awesomeness that the series is known for, bringing quite a lot of the fan-base back. Tragically Brian Jacques died after writing one last book after that.
</li><li> R.L. Stine's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Goosebumps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Goosebumps">Goosebumps</a></em> waxed and waned in popularity, but the <em>Series 2000</em> reboot alienated both longtime fans and potential new readers alike, being cancelled by Scholastic after just 25 books. These books combined a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> tone with outlandish plots (including increasingly frequent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding">Gainax Endings</a>), more extreme violence and gross-out content, and unlikeable characters. The books were simultaneously too graphic for younger readers and too silly for older fans to embrace. <em>Series 2000</em> was so unsuccessful that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseKiller">it killed the franchise for eight years</a>, until the <em>Horrorland</em> series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCancelled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCancelled">began in 2008</a>.
</li><li> Book 4 and Book 5 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em> have been accused of this. Not only did the books sprawl massively (going from 10 POV characters in <em>A Storm Of Swords</em> to <em>22</em> POVs, forcing what was supposed to be one book into two volumes, split by POV), but there was a lot more padding than in previous books, with far more travelogues and focus on world-building at the expense of plot movement. It didn't help that many new plotlines and characters were introduced, while previous fan-favourite characters were left spinning wheels. Finally, the planned climax of <em>A Dance with Dragons</em> was pushed forward to the as-of-yet unreleased sixth book, leading to the feeling that nothing was achieved. The fact that <em>A Feast for Crows</em> took five years to come out, and <em>A Dance with Dragons</em> took <em>six</em>, did not help matters.
</li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Alternate History</a> fans find the 3rd and 4th series (<em>American Empire</em> and <em>Settling Accounts</em>, respectively) of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryTurtledove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryTurtledove">Harry Turtledove</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Timeline191" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Timeline191">Timeline-191</a></em> to be way too long on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllohistoricalAllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllohistoricalAllusion">Allohistorical Allusions</a> and way too short on the actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Alternate History</a>. While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HowFewRemain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HowFewRemain">How Few Remain</a></em> and <em>The Great War</em> really delve into how the USA and CSA would interact as members of the great power community, <em>Empire</em> and <em>Accounts</em> are pretty much just taking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> from our timeline and slapping on the new one (Confederacy = Nazi Germany, UK = Fascist Italy, Jake Featherston = Hitler, genocide against blacks in the Confederacy against instead of against Jews in Germany, etc.)

<ul><li> Critics and early fans pegged <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSoundAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSoundAlbum">Gold Against the Soul</a></em> as this, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">Creator Breakdown</a> lyrics of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArtIsAngsty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArtIsAngsty">The Holy Bible</a></em> and subsequent disappearance of Richey Edwards overshadowed the failure. The first post-Edwards album was <em>expected</em> to be this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">but instead became the band's most critically acclaimed album and the one that brought them to mainstream status</a>. Critics and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar">fans were less kind</a> to subsequent releases, as well as to the band members themselves. The release of <em>Journal for Plague Lovers</em> was a reaction to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">the decay heard in</a> <em>Lifeblood</em> and <em>Send Away the Tigers</em>.
</li><li> Within the fandom, there are many who believe the last good album was <em>The Holy Bible</em> or <em>Everything Must Go</em>, and regard all post-Edwards albums as the work of a different band. Some see the rot beginning with <em>This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours</em> while others think <em>Know Your Enemy</em> qualifies for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">Vindicated by History</a> status. Other fans regard work <em>prior</em> to <em>The Holy Bible</em> as not worth consideration. Except for <em>The Holy Bible</em> and <em>Everything Must Go</em>, there is no album that cannot be considered the product of this trope, thanks to the band's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">Long Runner</a> status and numerous changes in sound.
</li></ul></li><li> Very few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM">R.E.M.</a> fans would argue that there isn't a point at which this happened for the band. The band smoothed out its sound as early as its fourth album, 1986's <em>Lifes Rich Pageant</em>, but most of the early fans stuck with them for that one. However, just about every album after that lost them some fans, even though some of them gained them far more. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Document" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Document">Document</a></em> followed with a "bigger" sound and two top ten hits and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Green" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Green">Green</a></em> marked the jump to a major label and the songwriting and production no longer resembled that of their IRS albums. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OutOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OutOfTime">Out of Time</a></em>'s first single "Losing My Religion" marked the point at which everybody in the first world had heard of R.E.M and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AutomaticForThePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AutomaticForThePeople">Automatic for the People</a></em> marked the band's commercial peak with 8 million sales in its first year. Then <em>Monster</em> was almost universally panned due to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Grunge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Grunge">grunge</a> sound and sold only one million copies in a year (though has since been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">Vindicated by History</a>), <em>New Adventures in Hi-Fi</em> passed by mostly unnoticed and <em>Up</em> drew criticism because it was hard not to notice the change in sound that the loss of drummer Bill Berry brought about. The divisiveness of the next four albums is mostly over which ones, if any, are <em>relative</em> returns to form and which ones are just bad.
</li><li> You're generally not going to get much argument from fans of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBand">The Band</a> if you say that their first three albums (<em>Music From Big Pink</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBandAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBandAlbum">The Band aka The Brown Album</a></em>, <em>Stage Fright</em>) are much better than anything they released after.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMonkees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMonkees">The Monkees</a>: their final original-run album (<em>Changes</em>) and the two latter-day reunion albums (<em>Pool It!</em>, <em>Justus</em>) are usually considered to be their weakest music.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RascalFlatts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RascalFlatts">Rascal Flatts</a> have their first three albums produced by Dann Huff: <em>Me and My Gang</em>, <em>Still Feels Good</em>, and <em>Unstoppable</em>. While <em>Me and My Gang</em> lead-off single "What Hurts the Most" was a well-received smash, the rest of the Huff era was lambasted for over-the-top <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerBallad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerBallad">Power Ballads</a> with ridiculously bombastic production and grating vocals. After their label Disney-owned Lyric Street Records) closed, they moved to Big Machine Records, albeit with Huff still serving as producer &#151; and he apparently listened to the complaints about his production, as their first two Big Machine albums were less over-the-top and somewhat more well-received than the latter-day Lyric Street albums. With their third Big Machine album having only one track produced by Huff (and the rest by either the band itself or pop producer Howard Benson), the group appears to have fully reversed the Seasonal Rot.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlakeShelton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlakeShelton">Blake Shelton</a>, ever since he switched to producer Scott Hendricks on 2009's <em>Hillbilly Bone</em>, has been heavily derided for playing a lightweight country-pop sound and lyrics that switch between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeDiabetes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeDiabetes">vapidly saccharine</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyLoveSongs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyLoveSongs">Silly Love Songs</a> and overdone "country boy" songs about hot girls, rednecks, and drinking that are already a dime-a-zillion in Nashville. While the purportedly "blander" material has spawned a monstrous streak of #1 hits, many fans feel that Shelton has all but sold his soul to become an A-lister. It also doesn't help that he has a high-profile gig as a judge on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVoice">The Voice</a></em>, an unusually commercial move for any country singer.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Mayhem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Mayhem">Mayhem</a> is considered to have entered one with <em>Grand Declaration of War</em>. While nothing could have possibly lived up to <em>[De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas</em>, the combination of <em>War</em>'s highly experimental nature, the lack of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">Euronymous</a>, and the replacement of the singer doomed the album to derision from unhappy fans. Whether the band has left the Rot behind is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">the subject of much debate</a>.
</li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a> fans feel that Big &amp; Rich got worse with every successive album. General consensus is that <em>Horse of a Different Color</em> is great, <em>Comin' to Your City</em> is mixed, <em>Between Raising Hell and Amazing Grace</em> is awful, and <em>Hillbilly Jedi</em> (their first release after a four-year hiatus) is still a step up from <em>Grace</em>, but still below par for them. This decline may or may not be combined with Rich's many production and songwriting gigs that he held during the creation of the second and third albums, plus a perceived increase in his ego. It seems that the trend finally reversed, as <em>Gravity</em>, their first release after leaving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBrosRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBrosRecords">Warner (Bros.) Records</a>, has been fairly well-received due to them deciding to make it all ballads.

Even a good chunk of their fanbase seems to agree that the quality of their work after their peak period took a nosedive.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveDeathMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveDeathMetal">Progressive Death Metal</a> band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BetweenTheBuriedAndMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BetweenTheBuriedAndMe">Between the Buried and Me</a>'s <em>The Great Misdirect</em> gets this from a large portion of their fanbase, mainly because <em>Colors</em> was praised for its large amount of experimentation, and people were disappointed when the next album's direction was more just straightforward prog death.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica">Metallica</a> entered one in between <em>Load</em> and <em>St. Anger</em>, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">some fans</a> extending the Rot to include <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfTitledAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfTitledAlbum">Metallica</a></em> and even <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AndJusticeForAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AndJusticeForAll">And Justice For All</a></em>. They are generally have considered to have recovered with <em>Death Magnetic</em>, only to return three years later with <em>Lulu</em> (their collaboration with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LouReed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LouReed">Lou Reed</a>, himself no stranger to ups and downs &mdash; though sadly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">this ended up being his last down, and last career move in general</a>). From what we have heard of <em>Hardwired... to Self-Destruct</em>, however, they seem to be leaving this failed experiment behind.
</li><li> Most musical critics seem to be in consensus that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GarthBrooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GarthBrooks">Garth Brooks</a>'s song quality declined from <em>Fresh Horses</em> onward. His sales did likewise.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan">Bob Dylan</a> has a couple contenders though two of them were only for an album (<em>Self Portrait</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChristmasInTheHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChristmasInTheHeart">Christmas in the Heart</a></em>) during periods that otherwise yielded great albums. From after <em>Desire</em> (1975) up until his comeback with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TimeOutOfMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TimeOutOfMind">Time Out of Mind</a></em> (1997) though there's a definite slip in quality from what came before though which albums are bad, which are underrated and which are just plain weird (<em>Empire Burlesque</em> is on the verge of being disco) is up for debate other than the consensus that <em>Oh Mercy</em> is the only real masterpiece of this period and that <em>Knocked Out Loaded</em> and <em>Down in the Groove</em> being the absolute worst.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a> went through this after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LetsDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LetsDance">Let's Dance</a></em> (1983), which was nevertheless a huge bestseller. Throughout the rest of the decade and the early 1990s he seemed to have lost it. With <em>Black Tie, White Noise</em> (1993) he made a comeback.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jazz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jazz">Jazz</a> guitarist Wes Montgomery's rot started with his later Verve albums, which were becoming more pop-friendly. The trend accelerated when he move to A&amp;M, where his albums sold well, but became more pop-instrumental and less jazz. Sadly, Montgomery died suddenly in 1968, before he could rebound artistically.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MartinaMcBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MartinaMcBride">Martina McBride</a> hit this in many country fans' eyes around the time she put out <em>Emotion</em> in 1999, due to a serious case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IssueDrift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IssueDrift">Issue Drift</a> and an increasing reliance on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MelismaticVocals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MelismaticVocals">Melismatic Vocals</a>.
</li><li> While it wouldn't be the first divisive album that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBlackDahliaMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBlackDahliaMurder">The Black Dahlia Murder</a> released (<em>Everblack</em> was also polarizing, but had a lot of fans who liked the heavier, darker direction), <em>Abysmal</em> definitely picked up the most flack of any album of theirs in some time. While it has its defenders and most fans can agree that it does have some great songs, the general consensus is that it's a warmed-over retread of <em>Miasma</em> with a bunch of throwaway tracks.
</li><li> Critics and some fans (who stuck around after she officially switch from Country to Pop music for the release of <em>1989</em>) consider <em>reputation</em> to be the weakest album <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift">Taylor Swift</a> produced yet, considering a majority of the songs to have poor hooks and lack her trademark descriptive lyrics. This reflects heavily in the 2018 Grammy, where neither the album nor any of its singles are nominated, something that Swift had never had a problem with ever since <em>Fearless</em> in 2008. <em>Lover</em> ended up winning most of the crowd back, though many were worried by the first two singles.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JethroTull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JethroTull">Jethro Tull</a> has suffered this, though just when depends on who you ask. Their major mainstream success ended after <em>Warchild</em> (1974), but the group maintained a significant fan base. That fan base was splintered after the big lineup change and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSoundAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSoundAlbum">New Sound Album</a> <em>A</em> (1980). <em>Broadsword and the Beast</em> (1982) was the best received of the "electronic" albums (it remains the band's best-selling album in Germany), but <em>Under Wraps</em> (1984) pushed the electronic sound so far that many fans were turned off. The fact that Ian Anderson suffered throat problems that most of the tour had to be cancelled didn't help things, either. <em>Crest of a Knave</em> (1987) brought back the hardcore fan base, but the band hasn't come close the success it had even in the late 1970s.
</li><li> While fans of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ultravox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ultravox">Ultravox</a> are split between whether or not the John Foxx-led incarnation of the band or the Midge Ure one was better, everyone agrees that they fell into a perpetual rut upon the release of <em>U-Vox</em> in 1986, which was universally panned despite being a commercial success. The band broke up a year later, only to be reformed by keyboardist Billie Currie in 1992 with a vastly different lineup and a pop rock sound far removed from the Foxx lineup's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostPunk">Post-Punk</a> and the Ure lineup's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewRomantic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewRomantic">New Romantic</a>. The album this lineup produced, <em>Revelation</em>, was seen as generic and forgettable, as was <em>Ingenuity</em>, which was released under <em>another</em> completely different lineup&mdash; again, save for Currie's inclusion. Ultravox then went dormant two years later, only for the Ure lineup to reform in 2008 with a reunion tour, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot">which received much acclaim from fans and critics.</a> However, the album they put out in 2012, <em>Brill!ant</em>, was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">extremely divisive</a>, with fans and critics split on whether it was a second <em>Vienna</em> or a second <em>U-Vox</em> quality-wise. Unfortunately, this was the last album the band released before dissolving for good&mdash; a rather sour note to go out on.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewOrder">New Order</a> fans tend to see the band's post-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Republic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Republic">Republic</a></em> albums as this, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalDissonance">critics tend to view them more favorably</a>.

<ul><li> Parodied in a 1982 issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Mad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Mad">MAD</a></em> detailing the devolution of the fictional sitcom "Idle Hours".<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note39mfu');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note39mfu" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note39mfu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The parody is most overtly inspired by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllInTheFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllInTheFamily">All in the Family</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays">Happy Days</a></em>, and their respective trees of spinoffs. The introduction even ponders if the readers remember when Archie Bunker had a wife and daughter and worked on a loading dock (by 1982, he was a widower with an adoptive daughter and worked in a bar), or when the title characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LaverneAndShirley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LaverneAndShirley">Laverne &amp; Shirley</a></em> (a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays">Happy Days</a></em> spinoff) lived in Milwaukee and worked at a brewery (by 1982, they lived in Burbank and worked in a department store).</span> Originally about a trio of high school boys in 1946 Indiana, the show deteriorates thanks to pointlessly "zany" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AVerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AVerySpecialEpisode">socially conscious</a>" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CousinOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CousinOliver">new</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy">replacement</a> characters, the loss of established characters (especially to spin-offs), guest stars, and nonsensical plotlines. Just to summarise some of the forms of seasonal rot the article spoofs:
<ul><li> The original focus is on high school seniors Nipsy, Conrad, and the Horse. The actor playing the Horse quits after two seasons, and the actors playing Nipsy and Conrad quit after another two, so over half the series' run features none of the original main trio, although members of their families &mdash; the Horse's psychopathic cousin Mangler (added in the second season), Conrad's sexpot sister Buffy-Lu (an original cast member) and alcoholic, widowed mother (added in the fourth season), and Nipsy's pre-teen brother Pooky (added in the third season) &mdash; remain for much longer.
</li><li> Improbable romances and weddings run rampant, with Pooky romancing and eventually marrying bowling alley owner Elsa even though he is in middle school and she is in her late 40s, and local mortician and Mangler's employer Mr. Ferndipper courting and also eventually marrying Conrad's mother (the wedding furnishing material for an hour-long episode in the seventh season).
</li><li> Characters are spun off into their own series almost every season. The original cast includes gym teacher Mr. Faunce, who gets a spin-off after the original main trio graduate high school (after three years as seniors). Elsa's partner in the pool room she buys after selling her bowling alley, Emilio, gets a spin-off after the sixth season with his fourteen younger siblings (introduced the previous season). Mangler gets a spin-off after the ninth season, and most of the remaining established cast members get spun off early in the tenth season.
</li><li> The series moves from Indiana to Hollywood for the eighth season (justified by having Buffy-Lu get a screen test that includes room and board for the rest of the cast), complete with new characters from the film industry (a sleazy agent and a talentless actor) and a parade of guest stars including Conway Twitty and Annette Funicello when the focus shifts to a small-town radio station bought by Mr. Ferndipper in the ninth season.
</li><li> The series makes stabs at social relevance by introducing the Mangler in the second season to counter accusations that it is too saccharine, and having Pooky and Elsa adopt a Korean war orphan in the fifth season. After Elsa dies of chalk dust inhalation in the seventh season and Pooky is subsequently written out, the Korean war orphan is adopted by Mr. Ferndipper and Conrad's mother, and after they are spun off in the tenth season, the Korean war orphan is the last remaining cast member, and the writers try to establish him as a seven-year-old truck driver with a pet ape. (This proves to be one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReTool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReTool">Retool</a> too many, and the plug is pulled <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">thirteen weeks into the season</span>.)

Every edition has brought its ups and downs, and every edition has had its vocal critics. Third Edition, Fourth Edition and Fifth Edition merely came about in the internet era, where complaints can be more easily made (though Fifth edition has been the most well received by far). Of all the editions, Fourth Edition is considered the worst example because it very nearly ended up being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseKiller">Franchise Killer</a> due to the design choices made during it, as it currently sits as the shortest supported time of the games lifespan.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia">Paranoia</a></em> started off as a darkly humorous award-winning game with a few awkward mechanics, which was refined into mindless fun in the highly-acclaimed Second Edition. Rot started when publisher West End Games started releasing game modules in interconnected <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arcs</a>, especially the Great Crash and subsequent Reboot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsYourFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsYourFriend">Friend Computer</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">Things got worse</a> with the release of the "5th" Edition; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> replaced the dark humor with cheap satires of pop culture, while poor artwork, poor production values, and the near-total departure of the original writers doomed the series. After West End Games went bankrupt, the series was resurrected as <em>Paranoia XP</em>, whereupon the (original) writers promptly declared everything from the story arcs onward as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">Canon Discontinuity</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> had this in its 7th edition rules set. Initially everything was fine with the Orcs and Goblins and Empire releases and while people started to cry foul during the High Elves release, the crunch was essentially accepted. Problems started to creep in with the 7th edition Vampire Counts book, which had several absurdly broken abilities and rules, and became an easy go-to army for people who wanted to win tournaments. Then Daemons of Chaos came out and everything went straight to fucking hell. Daemons were, put simply, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">unstoppable.</a> Even the widely accepted 2nd place army (Dark Elves, released soon after) and 3rd place Vampire Counts couldn't begin to compete with them. Every new army book that was released <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThisIsSpinalTap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThisIsSpinalTap">ramped up their abilities to 11</a> to try and compete, but nothing was working and this began to leave older armies increasingly in the dust. Eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GamesWorkshop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GamesWorkshop">Games Workshop</a> decided 'Fuck it' and after an incredibly underpowered Beastmen release, grabbed the rules set and shook it so hard that 8th edition came out. 8th edition completely revamped a lot of rules, such as how breaking, charging and magic worked, and while far from perfect, at least managed to restore a lot of the balance. Of course a lot of players <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase">still hate 8th Edition.</a>

The former for cranking up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimDark">Grim Dark</a> dial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> to the point that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy">Darkness-Induced Audience Apathy</a> was starting to form, as well as for introducing the (at the time) poorly thought out and overpowered Necrons and Tau. The later for being the home of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanboy">Matt Ward's</a> much hated <em>Space Marines</em> and <em>Grey Knights</em> codexes, several questionable rules, as well as in general being considered really unbalanced.
</li><li> Depending on who you ask, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> entered this during any number of points across its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">20+ years</a>: <em>Chronicles,</em> which was the first set to reprint cards from older sets, therefore diminishing their value to older players and collectors; <em>Sixth Edition,</em> which changed the original rules drastically; <em>Eighth Edition,</em> which changed the card frames and "dumbed down" certain cards so the game could be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPopularNowitSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPopularNowitSucks">more accessible to a greater fanbase of new players</a>; <em>Time Spiral,</em> which drastically changed how planeswalkers worked and retooled a number of existing story elements; <em>Tenth Edition</em> and <em>Magic 2010,</em> which both altered the existing rules further and streamlined the game significantly; or <em>Zendikar,</em> which is where many players felt the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep">Power Creep</a> of MTG really began skyrocketing. Despite all the discontent, however, the franchise is still going very strong and shows no signs of slowing down, in part thanks to an R&amp;D team that is made of many former players and listens to its fanbase.
<ul><li> Due to Magic's reliance on the Standard format (consisting of a small number of recent sets that are still in print) to manage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep">Power Creep, Power Seep</a> and the game having dozens of tournaments a year with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a> prizes (typically around the $30,000 mark), whenever a new set is released with a lower power level than the previous, accusations of this tend to crop up. Thus far, it's happened multiple times:
<ul><li> <em>Urza's Saga</em> block was so overpowered it resulted in a time called "Combo Winter," home of multiple turn 1 combo decks. The running joke was that the coin flip was the early game, players taking mulligans was the midgame, and turn 1 was the endgame. The block was followed with <em>Mercadian Masques</em> block, the only major block to not include any keywords and of noticeably lower-than-average power level&mdash;made all the more obvious by the way-above-average power level of its predecessor. Both blocks have come to be widely loathed.
</li><li> Five years later, <em>Mirrodin</em> block saw the largest number of cards banned in Standard since <em>Urza's Saga</em> block. Its follow-up block, <em>Champions of Kamigawa</em> was underpowered like <em>Mercadian Masques.</em> It's worth noting that a version of <em>Mirrodin's</em> headliner Standard deck is now considered top-tier in the "Modern," format, where every card from 2003 onward is legal, and the Modern version is actually <em>less powerful</em> than the Standard version because 6 cards from the original are banned in Modern.
</li><li> The power of a handful of cards in <em>Zendikar</em> block led to 2010 being the first time since the <em>Mirrodin</em> bannings in 2004 that a card was banned in Standard. The deck in question, Caw-Blade, was considered traumatic enough that its key cards were pre-banned when the Modern format was created a year later. Unlike the <em>Mirrodin</em> deck that was allowed to enter Modern in a more conservative form, Caw-Blade was and remains completely illegal in the format.
</li><li> In the Standard format of 2012-2013, manafixing became very strong, with 3 colors being the default setup, and all 3 color pairs being equally well supported. The following season saw a deliberate de-emphasis on manafixing, to the point that the most powerful decks in the 2013-2014 season were a single color.
</li></ul></li><li> Most three set blocks have a black sheep set of dramatically lower power level than the other two. To help counteract this trope, Wizards of the Coast announced that the set printing procedure, block structure, and the nature of the Standard format would be altered starting with 2014's <em>Khans of Tarkir</em> block. The much-maligned third sets and beginner-level Core Sets would be phased out, switching the yearly release schedule for a three-set block and a Core Set (two sets of which were usually examples of Seasonal Rot) with two two-set blocks a year. In turn, Standard would switch from 2 years' worth of sets to 18 months' worth, with rotation happening every 6 months instead of every year.

<ul><li> The 2005 "Toa Hordika" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">story arc</a> tends to come up as the worst year in discussions; at least it's more universally disliked than some other unpopular years, such as 2009 and 2010. Even the writer himself feels it felt tacked on &mdash; which it basically was. So much effort was put into designing the 2004 setting (Metru Nui) that the guys at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LEGO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LEGO">LEGO</a> wanted to do more with it, even though the story was already fully wrapped up in the previous year. Thus along came the second Metru Nui arc, during which the protagonists turned into hideous beasts (whose toys were also quite unspectacular and bland), the story got needlessly dark and confusing, and due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, the main hero had such a sudden <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment">Out-of-Character Moment</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">the writer detests his part of the story to this day</a>. The only good things to have come out of the story were the character Roodaka (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy">who quickly became a fan-favorite</a>) and the book <em>Time Trap</em>, but only because its plot was completely unrelated to the bigger arc. That, and it was the last year to get a DVD special before the fourth one in 2009.
</li><li> While the franchise slowly waned in popularity after 2006, the 2008 "Karda Nui" toyline is where many of the line's problems were on full display.

Variety mainly boiled down to exactly what designs were used, which resulted in figures having awkward proportions and inconsistent aesthetics.</span>", but the figures were even more hit-or-miss than before, something compounded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDontLookLikeYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDontLookLikeYou">them being meant to represent the Toa Nuva</a> from the franchise's original arc. The impulse sets were notoriously simplified; the limbs and body were each a single piece with very little customizablity. What really doomed things was an ill-fated redesign of the ball-cups which was off by a few millimetres, causing them to <em>get stressed and eventually break in as little as one use</em>. At least the corresponding story fared better, being the conclusion to the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> and containing several huge reveals, the biggest of all being a fondly-remembered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureScene">Signature Scene</a>.

The Action Masters of 1991, though, tend to be seen as the low point, largely for ditching the franchise's original main gimmick in favor of increased posability and screen-accuracy (while still not being very posable or accurate), so much so that they were widely labeled (most likely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisBlamed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisBlamed">Mis-blamed</a>, but still) as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseKiller">Franchise Killer</a>.

The following lines disregarded these developments entirely, and focused on creating more ridiculous-looking sets and pressing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a> on the plot after each year. The final line, <em>Invasion from Below</em>, was perhaps better regarded for trying to spice up the toy designs by having the Heroes be Minifig-scaled, but the companion episode was even more badly received. Some suspect that this may have had to do with LEGO diverting their efforts to the <em>BIONICLE</em> reboot, which was coincidentally planned since 2012.

Other criticisms include infrequent-but-sometimes-game-breaking glitches, confusing level design, and a dearth of ancillary activities and non-playable characters despite having a larger open world than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity">Batman: Arkham City</a></em>.

</li><li> When the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic">Mega Man (Classic)</a></em> series hit this varies.

Only with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan9">Mega Man 9</a></em> is the series considered to have climbed out (incidentally, it returned to a "retro" 8-bit presentation). The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX">Mega Man X</a></em> series is almost universally regarded as entering seasonal rot after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX5">Mega Man X5</a></em>, especially because Keiji Inafune had moved on to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZero">Mega Man Zero</a></em> series, though some felt that the series got some mojo back in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX8">Mega Man X8</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManXCommandMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManXCommandMission">Mega Man X: Command Mission</a></em>.

When exactly it began to happen is unknown. Some fans think it's when you got the ability to revert, making landing too easy. Others say it's when you got the ability to get off your board to end combos easily, and also the ability to ride other vehicles. Others say that it is after Tony Hawk's American Wasteland, which was a notable step down in effort from the previous games. EA's Skate series became popular and Project 8 and Proving Ground struggled to follow it up. One thing most fans agree on is that the inability for many people to play Shred and Ride (due to it requiring a special peripheral that required you to be an exact distance from the console) killed the series. Then...<em>Pro Skater 5</em> happened, which was a horrendously buggy and lazy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AshCanCopy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AshCanCopy">Ash Can Copy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseKiller">that caused the franchise to bail spectacularly and not get back up again</a> until the remakes of the first two games by Vicarious Visions were released in 2020 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinBackTheCrowd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinBackTheCrowd">to critical acclaim</a>.

The next expansion <em>Mists of Pandaria</em> had a major of content then, this was followed by 5.4, which led to another content drought lasting 13 months and its story was no better, getting rid of the things in the setting that were original by making the formerly heroic Horde <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil">Stupid Evil</a> and the Alliance <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid">Lawful Stupid</a>. It was then followed by the lackluster <em>Warlords of Draenor</em>, which had one content patch, and <em>then</em> a content drought that lasted 14 months.
</li><li> <em>Legion</em> was considered a return to form that brought players back, thanks to a better plot and far more content. Unfortunately, <em>Battle for Azeroth</em> essentially slashed that, removing all the good will <em>Legion</em> built. The game was bogged down with unfun RNG-based gear and what many players consider a worse progression system than the previous expansion had. Plot-wise, previous fan favourite Sylvanas was turned from an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> to an almost cartoonish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">Card-Carrying Villain</a> and the Alliance were again made the main good guys, repeating a lot of the mistakes from <em>Mists</em>. It was thankfully improved by several huge content patches, but BfA is still WoW's lowest point for player count.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stronghold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stronghold">Stronghold</a></em>: It's a matter of debate among fans whether <em>Stronghold</em>, <em>Stronghold Crusader</em> or <em>Stronghold 2</em> is better, but at least all three are widely praised as good games. From <em>Legends</em> on, however, the series has been almost universally panned, by both critics and gamers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/RatchetAndClank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/RatchetAndClank">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a></em> suffered from this with the three games released after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankFutureACrackInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankFutureACrackInTime">A Crack in Time</a></em>, primarily the first being a linear co-op title and the second focusing on tower defense mechanics, driving away existing fans and tanking its relevance to gamers at large. While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankIntoTheNexus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankIntoTheNexus">Into the Nexus</a></em> returned to traditional gameplay, it wasn't until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank2016">the 2016 game</a> that the series hit its stride once more and resonated beyond its hardcore audience.
</li><li> It's generally agreed that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> went through rot at some point, but there's considerable debate amongst fans regarding where the rot started. To summarize: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstInstallmentWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstInstallmentWins">the first game is widely considered excellent</a>, the second is either better than the first or slightly inferior <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContestedSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContestedSequel">depending on who you ask</a>, and the third is a case of divisiveness. A surprisingly large number but the drop in quality ten minutes from the end of the third game. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda">The spin-off</a> is an oddity, in that the fanbase seems to almost universally agree that it's a big step down <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughActToFollow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughActToFollow">from the original series</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> series is generally considered to have hit this point sometime after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5">Resident Evil 5</a></em>, which, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContestedSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContestedSequel">somewhat divisive</a> (particularly due to the introduction of Co-Op and often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">frustrating</a> endgame, but also due to coming after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em>, considered to be one of the best games in the series) finally ended the series-long enmity between the heroes and Umbrella. The games that followed, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilOperationRaccoonCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilOperationRaccoonCity">Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil6">Resident Evil 6</a></em>, were considered fairly lackluster and showed very little direction after killing the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, which wasn't helped by the gameplay changes not really gelling with the previous games in the series. It wasn't until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil7Biohazard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil7Biohazard">Resident Evil 7 Biohazard</a></em>, alongside the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic">well-liked</a> <em>Revelations</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilRevelations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilRevelations">spinoff</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilRevelations2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilRevelations2">titles</a> that many people felt the series was getting back on track, due to putting focus back on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivalHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivalHorror">Survival Horror</a> rather than the more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionizedSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionizedSequel">action-based</a> direction the series had gone.
</li><li> The reboot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> was met with critical acclaim and the first expansion pack <em>Heavensward</em> only made the praises sing louder thanks to the expansion pack's developed/developing characters and the story being focused on bringing an end to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar">Forever War</a>. The second expansion pack, <em>Stormblood</em>, wasn't bad by any means, but many fans felt that the overall story and characters were lackluster (likely due to the story covering two major arcs at once) compared to the ones introduced in the previous expansion.
</li><li> Longtime fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em> feel that the installments of the main games from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Pok&eacute;mon X and Y</a></em> onward aren't as good as the previous ones. The most common criticisms are the lack of post-game content compared to the 2D games, the Gen I pandering, the difficulty of the main story being made easier, the 3D models of the Pok&eacute;mon being lifeless compared to the sprites and, most infamously, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">Pok&eacute;mon Sword and Shield</a></em> actively removing half the Pokemon from previous games with no way of using them at all.
</li><li> After an excellent run of quality in story segments <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">beginning with Camelot</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder">Fate/Grand Order</a></em> had the Agartha chapter, generally regarded as one of the lowest points of its run. Absurd sexism, deeply unlikeable characters, repetitive story elements, gaping plot holes, swathes of writing that seemed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal">only to justify the writer's femdom fetish</a>... it's got it all. It's one of the few cases where the North American localization rewriting chunks of it was seen as an improvement. In a 2018 survey asking over a thousand players about their favorite arc, Agartha got <em>one</em> vote, outclassing even the typical "worst chapter" candidate of the very early Septem. Fortunately, the following Shimosa chapter (though not without its critics) was seen as a return to form.

All this leads to the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sequelitis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sequelitis">colossal failure</a>, and is today considered a cautionary tale for new developers on how <em>not</em> to handle a revival. As of August 2020, there are no sequels in development, and fans are now asking for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheCreatorDoesItRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheCreatorDoesItRight">original developers</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SuckerPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SuckerPunch">Sucker Punch</a> to soft-reboot the franchise.

However, Season 3 has not been as well-received as its predecessors, with <em>Dante vs. Bayonetta</em> and <em>Bowser vs. Ganondorf</em> being harshly criticized for their analyses.

In comparison, Season 2 had results that were considered to be consistently accurate, barring a few black spots, and had better 2d animations, which were made by a team that left <em>en masse</em> before Season 3 over payment disputes. They seem to have pulled out of this with the most recent episodes of <em>Ken vs. Terry</em>, <em>Amy vs. Ramona</em>, <em>Hulk vs. Doomsday</em>, and <em>Zoro vs. Erza</em>, which have all received critical acclaim, but some feel they came too late (the last four episodes before the season finale).

After many epic multi-season arcs, it was a self-contained story with lesser stakes that tried to have more of the goofy comedy of the early seasons. Still, aside from the jokes, the writing was uneven and filled with wasted potential. The follow-up season, The Shisno Paradox, faced even more criticism, particularly from viewers who didn't like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenserAndWackier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenserAndWackier">Denser and Wackier</a> route.

It took what should have been a a very short, sweet explanation and turned into into a one year plotline that constantly stopped the action because it had to cram in as much exposition as possible about the cosmology. For many people, the comic never recovered from it. Others like to just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDisContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDisContinuity">pretend it never happened</a>.

Unfortunately, forcing it upon the readers with only a tangential relation to the rest of the canon was not a smart move on Pete's part. And "Oceans Unmoving" would have been a great thing to release <em>all at once</em>, say as a book. It drew more resentment because it came at the expense of the regular cast, and the cool concepts weren't well served by a one-day-at-a-time schedule. People forget that a <em>lot</em> of Sluggy stories felt overlong and tedious at the time, but read well in the archives.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/RedString" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/RedString">Red String</a></em> began to fall into this during its last year, due to the author having become pregnant and taking several other projects on the side. This caused a decrease in the art quality and some rather hasty plot conclusions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck">Homestuck</a></em>: While the webcomic is generally considered to have grown the beard by Act 5, Act 6 featured completely new characters that <em>weren't</em> as overall fanbase-expandingly popular as the trolls were and generally even more divisive, very very long sub-acts (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">sub-sub acts</a>!) causing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndingFatigue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndingFatigue">Ending Fatigue</a>, a very long <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumour">Romantic Plot Tumour</a> causing unnecessary drama between the new kids, and more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleVillain">villains that are so powerful they make you consider</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy">whether these kids even have a ghost of a chance</a>, as well as a bunch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny">jokes that were either too dark to be humourous or just plain considered to be in bad taste</a>. It took years for the original kids to finally meet up with their new counterparts, and even when that happened it took many more months in real time for them to actually get on to fighting these new villains. Its ending animation and the following Act 7 were both well received visually<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9xkne');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note9xkne" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9xkne');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The former for being an action-packed, 18 minute long fighting sequence and the latter for its very high-quality visual details and smooth animation</span>, but also got some story-related criticism <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">for leaving a lot of plotlines to seemingly end abruptly</a> (something the author intends to fix with an additional epilogue) and for the eventual victory for the heroes to have just been brought on by anti-climactically <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">making a new timeline, wherein an intentional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter">Base-Breaking Character</a> was brought back and, along with some of the other characters, lost all their character development, and everything went almost perfectly according to plan</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/DarthsAndDroids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/DarthsAndDroids">Darths &amp; Droids</a></em> is generally seen as going through this around the time it reached the Original and Sequel movies. While the comic is still funny and clever, it lacks the biting satirical edge that made it stand out from other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampaignComic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampaignComic">Campaign Comics</a>. As many have noted, when the series was mocking the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> franchise's own rot, it was a brilliant and unique satire; once it had to tackle the actually good parts of the franchise, it started running out of things to seriously criticize and devolved into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoOkayItsAverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoOkayItsAverage">just another comic, without anything special going for it</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DominicDeegan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DominicDeegan">Dominic Deegan</a></em> had a few weaker arcs a couple years into its run. Specifically...
<ul><li> The "War in Hell", criticized for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment">Character Derailment</a> of Siegfried and the controversial orc storyline, to the point that "orc rape" is still the (disturbing) rallying cry among its detractors.
</li><li> "Snowsong", where Dominic's planning and controlling hit their peak, mixed with a badly-timed burst of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal">Author Appeal</a> in the form of Mookie's love of superheroes resulted in Greg briefly turning into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Shazam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Shazam">Shazam</a>.
</li><li> The "March Across Maltak" for its heavy focus back on the orcs and long length of over a year.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ExploitationNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ExploitationNow">Exploitation Now</a></em> hit this in the later half of Act 3. While the first half has some solid backstory and a bit of development of Bush and Jordan as well as setting up some possible threads for Bimbo and Ralph, the latter half is an extended cliche tentacle monster/magical girl parody connected more to the ultimately unused Babylon Jones while Bimbo and Ralph mostly just complain about their lack of panel time. It does have its humor, but in terms of plot progression, nothing of importance happens.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic">The Nostalgia Critic</a></em>:
<ul><li> Some people have this opinion towards <em>NC</em> after the series was uncancelled, due to more controversial statements (including a review of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> that was absolutely <em>drenched</em> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a>), actions and criticisms people feel are hypocritical when old reviews are taken into consideration, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anvilicious</a> tone, sketches that go nowhere, an over-reliance on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCritic">Straw Critic</a> and the fact that his character arc's resolution was undone.
</li><li> Some of the people who liked the revived series began to quit it come mid-2014, where they felt that the Critic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass">had become more mean-spirited, more hostile towards anyone or anything he doesn't like to the point of insulting people who disagree with him</a> (some even feeling he's become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCritic">Straw Critic</a> himself), had skits that overstay their welcome, and ridiculous amounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiasSteamroller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiasSteamroller">Bias Steamroller</a>.
</li><li> 2015 has been even worse. In addition to several of the above problems persisting, many have been turned off by several of the videos being little more than an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">Author Tract</a> rather than an actual review, spouting off viewpoints that are clearly supposed to be Walker's rather than the Critic's in-character, and the Critic now getting much worse when it comes to reviewing very recent material, including breaking his previous restriction and looking at <em>Jurassic World</em>, <em>Pixels</em>, and <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em> while they were still in theaters, leaving the "Nostalgia" part as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle">Artifact Title</a>.
</li><li> In 2019, the decline has continued. Since the #ChangeTheChannel scandal, the Nostalgia Critic has increasingly become the target of ridicule in many internet circles. His review of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWall">The Wall</a></em> was so widely hated that it became a meme in and of itself. The episode's lacking quality also led viewers to start becoming more critical of future episodes, and even reflect on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseOriginalSin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseOriginalSin">the flaws of past episodes initially given a free pass</a>. The "Maybe he was transitioning" line from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Venom2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Venom2018">Venom</a></em> review wasn't received well in certain circles, either. This year, Doug seems to have abandoned his TV vlogs, editorial series, and other side projects, instead focusing only on Nostalgia Critic and occasionally doing a short vlog on a movie currently playing.
</li></ul></li><li> Some say <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAngryVideoGameNerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAngryVideoGameNerd">The Angry Video Game Nerd</a> went through this between James <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">contracting major burnout</a> in early 2010 and the filming of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AngryVideoGameNerdTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AngryVideoGameNerdTheMovie">Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie</a></em> in mid-2012. He had noticeably less energy and passion during this time period, and his "anger" (the defining trait of his character) was quite a bit more restrained. After the movie was released, many hoped that he would break out of the rot. However complaints continued to come. The criticism only got worst around late 2017-2018, where he started to commonly use cheesy greenscreen effects, and the volume always stayed the same. This made him feel even less "angry".
</li><li> A significant section of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked">Cracked</a> readers believe that the site started going downhill sometime around 2013. There are many reasons offered for this, including:
<ul><li> An emphasis on click-bait titles. To make it worse, for many articles the titles will change several times within hours of them being originally published, often in ways that don't really reflect the article content, apparently just to find a title which is going to get the most clicks. Starting in early 2016, certain article titles began to eschew the number of entries or even critical elements of the article itself in favor of vague statements or casual remarks/questions addressed directly to the reader (e.g. "Mind If We Explain (And Then Ruin) Your Favorite Songs?"), which many have noticed skews even closer to the BuzzFeed style of click-hungry writing that Cracked itself was once critical of. It's also telling that instead of articles confined to one page, they are now spread across at least two, meaning more ads will appear as you read through one single article.
</li><li> The site's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IssueDrift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IssueDrift">Issue Drift</a> and new-found <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">preachiness</a>. The site has increasingly eschewed a focus on comedy in favour of more articles that are either philosophical and opinion-based treatises, expos&eacute;s on an often unsettling aspect of human existence (this particularly applies to articles which Robert Evans is involved with) and/or possessing a clear focus on social justice issues. Many existing readers tend to find these articles pretentious, condescending, ill-informed, inaccurate, self-righteous, hypocritical, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy">unbearably dark and depressing to read</a> or some combination thereof. As of mid-2016, readers noted a sharp increase in political articles especially, all with an even stronger social justice bent than in years past; and even pop culture articles (such as those <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">deconstructing</a> Marvel and DC universes) are laced with unsubtle political barbs. Despite what appeared to be a brief return to form throughout late September and much of October 2016, the election results prompted a glut of purely political articles.
</li><li> Conversely, many readers tend to find those remaining articles which are intended to be humourous and / or informative, as in the site's previous style, to be rather lazy, inaccurate and unfunny.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">An influx of unpopular regular contributors</a>. These include, but aren't limited to, Adam Todd Brown, J. F. Sargent, Luke McKinney, Auntie Meme and Nicholas Pell.
</li><li> The site's editors can also be perceived as aggressive and dismissive towards their readers and their complaints, particularly when any of the above points are raised. While the site's comment sections and forums aren't entirely free of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">Fan Dumb</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDumb">Hate Dumb</a> either, even well-meaning and constructive criticism can be met with unnecessary hostility &mdash; for example, <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181030021956/http://forums.cracked.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=83873">this post<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> expressing polite reservations regarding the site's approach towards "Photoplasty" articles, only to be met with a highly sarcastic and rather snide response from the site's executive editor.
</li></ul></li><li> Depending on who you ask <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/MarbleHornets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/MarbleHornets">Marble Hornets</a></em> may have fallen into this during its second half, as the creators created <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChrisCarterEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChrisCarterEffect">way too many questions and subplots than they could handle</a>. This is <em>far</em> from universal however.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheJerrySeinfeldProgram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheJerrySeinfeldProgram">The Jerry Seinfeld Program</a></em>, in which <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em> went on for 21 seasons (with another five planned.) Elaine and Kramer left (with Jerry and George pretending they never existed) the show truly became about nothing once Jerry ran out of ideas, and has devolved into nothing more than a series of internet shorts lasting about a couple minutes long at most since the show somehow managed to achieve a Nielsen rating of less than .1 and yet is still going, in an extreme case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdoredByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdoredByTheNetwork">Adored by the Network</a>. The show eventually devolves into Jerry and George having existential crises on-set, begging to just let the show die already <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> before finally committing suicide.</span>
</li><li> It's implied that this would happen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> had the characters not resolved the plot within the sixth episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DontHugMeImScared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DontHugMeImScared">Don't Hug Me I'm Scared</a></em>. The previous lessons had been Creativity, Time, Love, Technology, Nutrition, and Dreams, but it was shown <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> by the machine-generated Teachers</span> that the lessons most likely would go on to include Space, Sports, Magnetism, Digging Holes, Canoe Buying, Files, Traffic, Gel, Smoking, and Music. This can be read as another criticism of childrens' media, focusing on topics that become more inane over time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/StupidMarioBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/StupidMarioBrothers">Stupid Mario Brothers</a></em>: The series is agreed to have gone into this after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>. The only well liked part of this period is the Interactive Adventure. Common criticisms include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">tone deaf stories</a>, characters holding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a>, wasting time on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">Filler</a>, less funny jokes, and the characters becoming unlikable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheMusicVideoShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheMusicVideoShow">The Music Video Show</a></em> had gone through this in seasons 5 through 7. The jokes had become repetitive, the running gags had been run through the ground, episodes blended into each other and the host <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkAss">took several notches of unlikable behavior.</a> Unlike many examples, he made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">an apology</a> video, stating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">anger, depression and suicidal thoughts as the cause</a>, pointing to Season 5 as the worst cause.
<ul><li> Seasons 9 and 10 have gotten a case of this, specifically season 9. Instead of the usual 25 episodes, these seasons go for 50, with the misses outweighing the hits. Without the 3 month break between seasons like before, the jokes are less thought and some episodes seem halfhazardly put together. Downplayed with season 10 as, despite similar problems as 9, the season got better and, as it was the last season of the show, it ended on a good note with its 300th episode.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebSite/ScrewAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebSite/ScrewAttack">ScrewAttack</a></em> went through this not long after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/DeathBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/DeathBattle">Death Battle</a></em> really got popular. Whilst that show got better the rest of Screwattack's content seemed to suffer with the humor becoming stale and overdone, top tens becoming really generic, and Stuttering Craig becoming much too prevalent in each video (which many fans felt is what caused the first problem). Some fans think the rot may even happened earlier after many key members left and with the shut down of Hard News. It seemed Screwattack actually realized this and eventually put all resources into Death Battle... which as shown above sadly underwent seasonal rot of its own.
</li><li> After a strong start and a groundwell of support from fans, the "MK3" era of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ClassicGameRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ClassicGameRoom">Classic Game Room</a></em> came to be seen as a low point for many fans. Common complaints include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverusedRunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverusedRunningGag">running gags being driven into the ground</a>, too much video time spent on Patreon backer credits and promotion of Mark's other projects with the resulting split effort harming the production, low effort content (most notoriously the #WhoDefeatz videos) paired with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DearNegativeReader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DearNegativeReader">Mark's confrontational attitude toward those who criticized those uploads</a>, a more niche and less timely choice of games to review (despite the fact that most of the show's most popular episodes were about current games) and generally feeling tired. The loss of popularity was such that <em>Classic Game Room</em> went from having one of the biggest Patreon account with nearly 10k donated monthly at its peak to Mark announcing the show's end in the comments of an Instagram post without the wider internet really noticing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/DivaDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/DivaDirt">Diva Dirt</a></em> started going this way in 2015-2016. Melanie, one of the original writers and eventual editor, left the site and was shortly followed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a> Bobby when he was too busy with college work. This led to the less popular Jack taking control of a lot articles; he became infamous for jokes that weren't funny, getting the names of moves wrong and some oddly selective favoritism when it came to certain women. Then the rest of the site's writers left, and were replaced with people they'd found in the comments - giving it the feeling that it had gone from legitimate news site to blog with multiple contributors.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/FeministFrequency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/FeministFrequency">Feminist Frequency</a></em> experienced a lot of backlash once the 'Tropes vs Women' series moved onto video games. The research mistakes that had been at a minimum in her previous videos increased to an absurd degree (despite Anita's claims that they were "double and triple checked"), and there were soon enough videos pointing out the mistakes to make up an entire subgenre with <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgement">wildly varying quality of critiques</a>. Many gamers and critics outside of the pool of misogynists that made up the project's hatedom began to highlight several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">problematic statements</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">Anita's own critiques</a> - such as her disdain for sex workers, claims that any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girls</a> were inherently misogynistic and dismissing any large breasted or scantily clad female characters as a "fighting f*** toy". She drew large amounts of controversy for a video where she casually suggested that gamers would be turned on by violence towards women in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WatchDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WatchDogs">Watch_Dogs</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LianaK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LianaK">Liana K</a> released a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O0JvjKEuF4">five-part<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> video series disputing many of Anita's more problematic statements, and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgvYJ9Ei90Y">others identified<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeEditing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeEditing">Manipulative Editing</a> at play where Anita appeared to have taken footage from other YouTubers without crediting them. Although she released another series of videos in 2016, she soon ended the project and it was rebranded as a non-profit podcast. She later revealed that the corporate sponsorship they had benefitted from in the beginning had lost interest and withdrawn their funding.
