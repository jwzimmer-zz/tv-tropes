Such power needs to be respected, and it shouldn't be surprising that there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GunSafety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GunSafety">various obvious safety rules in place when using a gun</a>, that anybody who wants to use a firearm should know. Even then an expert can conceivably make a serious (and possibly fatal) mistake when handling a gun. There is even a saying among gunsmiths that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreTwoKindsOfPeopleInTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreTwoKindsOfPeopleInTheWorld">There are two types of gun owners.</a> Those who <em>have</em> had their guns discharge accidentally, and those who <em>will</em> have their guns discharge accidentally."
</p><p>Many writers, actors, artists, and directors, however, ignore these rules. What results from this are scenes where characters are doing things they shouldn't, such as placing their fingers on the triggers of their weapons when not about to fire, or pointing their weapons at people whom they are not trying to shoot; one particularly common example is foolish officers making routine arrests (e.g. drunk driving or check fraud) at gunpoint for no real reason. This is particularly troublesome when these people are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">supposed to be</a> experts with lots of experience with their weapons.

</p><p>The Four Rules of gun safety:
</p><p></p><ol><li> Treat every gun you encounter as if it is loaded, until/unless you personally verify otherwise.
</li><li> Never point a gun at something you do not <em>intend</em> to shoot and <em>destroy</em>.
</li><li> Keep your fingers away from the safety and the trigger until you are in position and ready to shoot.
</li><li> Always be aware of what is around and behind your target.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds">7 Seeds</a></em>
<ul><li> Averted by (most) of the Team Summer A candidates. Part of their education included guns and how to properly use and maintain them, with most of Team Summer A itself following the rules well. Botan, from Team Summer B, is also very concerned about gun safety and knows the rules, due to being a former police officer. There are some candidates that took gun maintenance not that seriously and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fingore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fingore">paid the price</a>.
</li><li> Played straight during the <em>Minor Heat</em> arc, when the Summer teams are exploring an old army ship. Semimaru decides to hold onto one of the guns and thinks of himself as looking really cool with it, although the guns have been lying around, abandoned and rusting, for an unknown amount of time. When he shoots the badly maintained gun in a reflex situation <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the bullet almost falls out of the shaft and doesn't actually get fired, meaning he just barely avoided shooting Ryo</span>. He learns his lesson fast.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl">Gunslinger Girl</a></em>: The girls are noticeably lax about gun safety, and handguns show up in a few waistbands, but the focus is given to the importance of proper handling in the scene that is the current page image. Henrietta is in a firing range when her pistol jams after a misfire, and she looks down the barrel of her pistol to investigate the issue &mdash; which is extra bad since her cyborg implants leave her eyes as basically her only weak points. Raballo grabs the gun away and chews her out, and then switches to berating Jose for not training her properly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Appleseed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Appleseed">Appleseed</a></em> averts this and invokes physics: when (cyborg) Briareos leaps building to building. In-story, Deunan (whom he carried) is temporarily blind from the G-forces. In his notes, he calls attention to Briareos carrying his enormous gun with his finger outside the trigger guard while leaping (proper procedure). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShirowMasamune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShirowMasamune">Shirow Masamune</a> averts this trope frequently.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Aversion:</a> The members of the SSS in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelBeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelBeats">Angel Beats!</a></em> practice admirable gun safety, especially considering they died as high school-aged teenagers in a country where private ownership of handguns is illegal, and owning a long arm requires lots of paperwork and licensing that takes years to sort out (as well as being an adult). Doubly impressive considering being shot is only really a mild annoyance in their realm. Perhaps it wonders into Fridge Brilliance territory, they've accidentally shot themselves enough times to have learned how not to do it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShirowMasamune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShirowMasamune">Shirow Masamune</a> shows proper <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GunSafety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GunSafety">Gun Safety</a> again. This time noting how stupid the cops are. Situation: enemy mook is surrounded on all sides by the cops. He notes that should they all fire at the target, they would probably kill each other. Surrounding your opponent and aiming for him is not a bright idea, kids!
</li><li> This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invoked</a> in a first-season episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em>. A character is shown running around waving his gun wildly with his finger on the trigger. This act is uncharacteristic enough to show how unhinged the case is making him.
</li><li> However, it's later averted in <em>2nd Gig</em>. When the police move in to arrest Gouda, they trap him in the middle of a hallway. The cops at one end are armed, while the cops on the other end are wielding armored riot shields to block the hallway and protect themselves from stray bullets at the same time.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalPanicFumoffu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalPanicFumoffu">Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu</a></em> plays a too-literal adherence to this trope for laughs: S&#333;suke is playing an arcade light gun game, and doing quite well until the video game gun runs out of ammunition. S&#333;suke immediately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowAwayGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowAwayGuns">pulls his very real personal pistol</a> and blows the game away. When it's explained to him that you're supposed to shoot away from the screen to reload, his response is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">that would be horribly unsafe</a>.
</li><li> S&#333;suke notably always observes proper gun safety, even demonstrating proper trigger discipline in the anime's eyecatches, and indeed takes pains to introduce Kaname to the basics in an episode of <em>The Second Raid</em>. He just has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">No Social Skills</a> &mdash; no concept of the idea that civilian life and open battlefields have different social standards for when it's acceptable to pull a loaded firearm on someone, and, as shown in the previously mentioned example, little to no ability to make any separation in his mind between a video game's toy gun and the real thing.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster">Monster</a></em> averts this: Tenma's training strongly emphasizes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GunSafety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GunSafety">the rules</a>, and he later handles guns with the responsibility and care you'd expect of a surgeon.

It's all well and good until you spot loaded rifles up in the air with the helmets...
</li><li> In one episode, Kanata cleans her rifle while oblivious to the fact that's it's <em>pointed right at Kureha's face.</em> Kureha, oddly enough, doesn't seem to notice, and she definitely doesn't get out of the way.

Jet, a freaking <em>former cop</em>, fails to comment. Downplayed, at least, in that his finger wasn't on the trigger. He also <em>scratches his hair</em> using the muzzle of his gun in episode 2.

Played straight in that one of the main characters uses one of the girl's stomach and breasts as a stand/shock-absorber for the girl's battle rifle, firing at the horde of zombies surrounding another member of their group. Justified in that he only did it because the rifle's carrying strap was stuck and she couldn't get it off, nor maneuver it into a position to fire it herself; the constant recoil also left her with bruises in some sensitive areas.

In episode 6, she waves a revolver in Kio's face with her finger on the trigger, and that it was unloaded is no excuse. She does it again later, when she loads the revolver and waves it around in a fast-food joint, once slamming it down on the table while pointed at Aoi.

The targets? <em>Balloons floating just above their heads.</em> Granted, the girls are anthropomorphized guns and aren't all that affected by gunshots beyond minor bruising, but it's still jarring, considering all the other ways in which guns are depicted accurately. The halls of the school have proper firearm safety posters around; other than that characters generally have their fingers outside the trigger guard when not shooting, the obedience level is about what you'd expect from middle school students, which actually makes a (probably unintentionally) good case for why people that age <em>should not</em> have access to guns.

Gaston declares his intent to marry Belle by pointing his gun at her. Not a good idea. It is true that his blunderbuss had recently been discharged and should have been empty, but later in the film, he demonstrates that his blunderbuss is fully automatic, which is another problem entirely. This is in addition to the fact that his first scene shows him birding in the middle of town, where any missed shot could end up hitting someone down the street (Lefou claims that Gaston never misses, which would make this safer in theory, but in practice any gun user should allow for possibility of missing and make sure there isn't anything they don't want hurt or damaged in the general direction they're pointing the weapon, no matter how good a shot they are). It's a mystery why he's considered the local paragon of manliness rather than a public menace.

Nite Owl does this by severing the support struts on a water tower on the roof of the building. With a minigun. The movie does not address the possible implications of firing <em>a fucking minigun</em> in the middle of a city.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tremors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tremors">Tremors</a></em>: Averted in the original. Burt Gummer, a survivalist and gun-enthusiast, always follows proper weapon safety. At one point he gives a revolver to teenaged waste-of-space Melvin Plug, to get him moving to a safe-point. Despite <em>knowing</em> that he'd deliberately handed Melvin an unloaded gun, when Burt takes it back from Melvin he <em>still</em> flips it open and re-confirms the chambers are all empty... which is exactly what you're supposed to do any time you pick up a weapon. There is one minor instance of it being played straight &mdash; when the Gummers are making use of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallOfWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallOfWeapons">Wall of Weapons</a>, the flare gun hanging on the wall is already loaded.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tremors2Aftershocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tremors2Aftershocks">Tremors 2: Aftershocks</a></em>. Burt is called out multiple times by the others for either "improper" safety, or for using a grossly oversized weapon and ending up damaging their expected getaway vehicle. Burt usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">calls them out</a> when they say he's doing something the wrong way or forgetting something, either saying he was given bad info or that he was, actually, doing it right. As for the oversized weapon? He was armed to shoot 30-foot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandWorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandWorm">subterranean monsters</a>, not 3-foot tall <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a> screamers. And he really <em>couldn't</em> have known that the car was going to be damaged; the bullet passed through <em>three</em> concrete or sheet-metal walls before wrecking the engine. It <em>was</em> an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">anti-tank rifle</a> after all. For the most part, though, gun safety is followed. In the scene when Burt arrives, he gives Earl a double rifle to replace his M-16. Before handing it over, Burt checks to ensure it is unloaded. He then hands it to Earl, who <strong>also</strong> checks it. Burt also makes a point of cautioning them to make sure they properly brace the rifle against their shoulder before firing "or they'll break your collarbone." Earl tells Burt he will ensure Grady is capable of handling it before letting him use it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackHawkDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackHawkDown">Black Hawk Down</a></em>: During the barbecue scene, the Ranger unit CO calls out a <em>Delta Force operator</em> for wandering around with a loaded M4 carbine hanging from his neck with the safety catch off. The operator then laughs in his face (and says "this is my safety", holding up his trigger finger). This was based on a real precise incident described in a book by journalist Mark Bowden. In contrast, standard procedure for most American military personnel is for the weapon to remain on Safe until they are about to fire<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1lwvt');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1lwvt" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1lwvt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Not for US Air Force personnel ... or pilots at least, who fly with their pistol safeties off; fumbling around with it after a crash could cost previous seconds when there are hostiles approaching</span>.
<ul><li> In this particular instance though, the book details how the operator in question <em>did</em> clear the weapon by removing the magazine, ejecting the chambered round, and pulled the trigger so the hammer was down. The M16 rifle and its derivatives actually are mechanically incapable of being put on safe with the hammer down. But the officer in question had no way of knowing that, hence the confrontation.

He clearly knows something about guns when he removes the magazine and chambered round from the pistol in the courtroom. On the other hand, he points an unloaded pistol at a criminal to get him to talk, which is still against gun safety rules (and is called out on it by Batman). Once he goes crazy, you can bet that whatever safety measures he ever followed are gone.
</li><li> The Joker, being who he is, naturally doesn't think "gun safety" means shit, and at one point causes several accidental discharges while stumbling around in a daze, but it only makes him laugh.

Clear?" During Chris Rock's (hilarious) rant at Joe Pesci for asking "Who's the perp?" Rock is pointing his gun directly at Pesci with his finger on the trigger.

This resulted in a burst of bullets narrowly missing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a> superior officer. The Marine is punished by doing laps for miles, with his rifle held over his head, till he falls down in exhaustion. This was considered somewhat cruel by the other members of his platoon; if this happened in real life, hell would rain down on this guy for time out of mind.

<ul><li> In a firing range exercise early in the film, J is rationalizing his choice of targets to Z while waving a loaded gun around. He points it at Z at least twice. Note that J is a police officer for the NYPD, and should know better about proper gun safety.
</li><li> The novelization tries to handwave it by changing the scene so the firearms only have one shot chambered into each &mdash; which is good, except that the movie scene has the military men firing <em>repeatedly</em> at the targets.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note218k8');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note218k8" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note218k8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though even having the pistol click empty wouldn't excuse such behavior for a trained shooter &mdash; remember, <em>treat <strong>every</strong> gun as if it were loaded.</em></span>

First, K shouldn't have given J a gun that he didn't know how to use. (Supplementary material explains that senior agents give Noisy Crickets to new agents as pranks.) Second, J protests at being handed such a wimpy-looking weapon and points it at K's head. K turns, flinches, and points the gun away from the both of them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">And then walks away right through the line of fire</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>:
<ul><li> Lightsabers in general seem to be <em>immense</em> safety risks in quite a few ways. The design of basically every lightsaber we have seen in canon is a metal cylinder with every relevant button and switch sticking out of it. And it is clipped to the belt like a carabiner so it swings freely, as opposed to being stored in a holster. And there is no trigger guard and (apparently) no safety on the activation switch. See if you can spot the problem here. Granted, Jedi and Sith can probably use the Force to prevent the blade from activating until they need it to. But that doesn't make nearly as much sense as a mechanical safety or trigger guard that won't fail the moment the owner of the lightsaber loses concentration for a moment... Or takes a nap... Or is knocked unconscious... Or dies... And that does nothing to explain lightsaber users who can't use the Force, like General Grievous.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em>, Obi-Wan Kenobi hands a Luke a weapon without first explaining how it works. A weapon that will instantly kill or maim you and/or anything and everything else in the room if you even <em>slightly</em> mishandle it. Luke immediately points it at his own face and stares down the business end.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3e2ig');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3e2ig" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3e2ig');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">And an instant later ignites the thing, very nearly putting it through both his and Obi-Wan's head.</span>
</li><li> Later, Obi-Wan has Luke being shot at by a little droid (which makes Luke flinch in pain every time he was hit) then intentionally puts a blinding face mask on him, even though Luke is only standing a couple feet away from Chewy while holding a plasma sword of death. Even worse is that most expanded universe material and a scene from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones">Attack of the Clones</a></em> indicates <em>this is how the entire Jedi Order trained their <strong>youngest</strong> apprentices</em> back before the time of the original films &#151; though at least then they have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponJr">lower-powered "training" sabers</a> so the kids can't accidentally maim themselves and/or everyone nearby.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em>, while on Endor, Leia demonstrates terrible trigger discipline to the extent that she could have easily killed Wicket through a negligent discharge &#151; all due to her having her finger in the trigger guard. She could have easily shot herself when holstering her weapon as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens">The Force Awakens</a></em> has Han Solo give a blaster to Rey, without giving instructions concerning how to handle it responsibly. Rey clearly states she knows nothing about firearms other than "you pull the trigger".

The recruits take the course in teams, with the next sent directly <em>behind</em> the previous! Then, the characters must face off against targets that shoot lasers at their training vests, which give the victim an electric shock. This causes one soldier to clamp down on the trigger and fire wildly in all directions, killing another. Rico is blamed for taking the recruit's helmet off, when the whole scene was a disaster waiting to happen. This was definitely intentional on the part of the director, who was satirizing military culture. Contrast the original book, where the protagonist is nearly drummed out of the military for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">firing a simulated (harmless) weapon without following all protocols</a> even when he was dead certain it would land in a safe place.
</li><li> One of the propaganda films has a group of soldiers pass their rifles to a bunch of kids, who immediately begin to do exactly what you'd expect of a bunch of idiot children given a cool new toy to do. The guns are obviously loaded, since there's a visible magazine near the back.
</li><li> Another sequence shows the troops surrounding one of the giant, acid-breathing bugs in a circle and closing in on it while firing away with extreme prejudice. Rifftrax had a field day pointing out that shooting that much ammo ("Good thing our guns hold 200 bullets!... 500 bullets!... 1,000 bullets!") in close quarters directly facing your squadmates is probably not the best of tactics.

He runs out to escort Karen from her car to the door. He holds the firearm in a very strange position, as if he were palming it, where the trigger might snag as he physically hauls Karen into the house. The muzzle rakes across Henry's chest so it might or might not enter and exit obliquely. Then the bullet would hit <em>Karen</em> straight in the side of the torso, cutting along from just under one armpit to exit out the other side of her chest. During that sequence, if the gun discharged, Karen's <em>heart</em>, aorta, both lungs, liver, stomach, and spleen were all right about at the right level to be hit.

</li><li> Early in the film, Henry gives Karen a bloody, loaded revolver to hide. Karen (presumably) has no experience with firearms at that point in the film. It's good practice to unload and clear a firearm before passing it to someone else. When passing it over, make sure it's open so the recipient can check to make sure it's not loaded.

At that point Pike gets so exasperated that he takes the gun away from the agent (he can do it because they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandyCuffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandyCuffs">handcuffed him wrong</a>), states that "it would be embarrassing to get killed by that guy" and hands the gun over to the other agent in the hopes that the second agent will be more competent and allow him to die with some dignity. Amazingly, the other guy manages to <em>top</em> the first by answering his cell phone while he's holding the gun, and eventually winds up holding the phone to one side of his face while pressing the loaded, ready to fire gun against the other side. At this point even Lynch, who is something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild">Psychopathic Manchild</a> and is constantly criticized by nearly every character in the film for being a desk jockey with little to no real world experience, looks seriously disturbed by the morons on his team.

<ul><li> Played straight in that some of the students with guns end up sticking them into the waistbands of their skirt or pants... justified, since they <em>are</em> in a dangerous situation where having instant access to your gun and not having to fiddle with safety may decide whether they live or die.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarshipTroopers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarshipTroopers">Starship Troopers</a></em>: Averted: Rico is punished for a firearms safety protocol violation <em>that doesn't result in anyone being hurt</em>, and which he only does because he <em>knows</em> it can't <em>possibly</em> result in any harm in that particular case, since it is just a smoke bomb (playing the part of a nuke; had it been an actual nuke, one soldier would've been caught in the blast). He's flogged because he didn't follow the safety procedure. It's a partial inversion, as the punishment is designed to make the point to him that you <em>always</em> follow the rules, even when you're <em>absolutely sure</em> it would be safe not to. Lt. Robert Heinlein (ret.) knew a thing or two about weapons and the military.
<ul><li> Played straight when the recruits are taught how to take cover while their instructors fire blanks at them with an occasional live round mixed in (it's stated that if their progress is unsatisfactory, the ratio of live rounds to blanks will rise). One of the recruits is actually shot in the rear; the recruits are told that the instructors would never intentionally aim at the head or heart.
</li></ul></li><li> Taken to almost hilarious extremes in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OldMansWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OldMansWar">Old Man's War</a></em> 'verse. Colonial Union firearms technology has almost as much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> dedicated to making the gun safe for its owner as dangerous for the enemy. A prime example of the resulting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justifiedly</a> casual attitude is the incident in which a drill instructor demonstrates this by taking a recruit's gun, pointing it in the recruit's face, and pulling the trigger.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DiaryOfAWimpyKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DiaryOfAWimpyKid">Diary of a Wimpy Kid</a></em>. When Gregory joins the swim team, nobody told him that the referee's gun only fires blanks so he was more worried about where the bullet was going to land than actually trying to win the race.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQueensThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQueensThief">The Queen's Thief</a></em>. Eugenides is held in contempt by the Attolian soldiers for treating his wooden sword carelessly; like the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarshipTroopers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarshipTroopers">Starship Troopers</a></em> example, they believe that even a "non-dangerous" weapon should be treated with caution, so no mistakes are made later. Eugenides casually replies "In Eddis, we're taught to keep track of the weapon we have in our hands." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He then snatches the sword out of the air with his bare hands and uses it to beat up the soldier trying to kill him. <em>Further subverted</em> when the other soldiers point out that he couldn't have done so with a real sword, and therefore he technically lost the duel. Eugenides reveals that he had, in fact, used the same move on an assassin earlier in the book.</span>

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Defied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Defied">Defied</a> by the Rebel Alliance. The <em>New Essential Guide to Weapons and Technology</em> mentions that Rebel soldiers were well known for practicing safe firearms usage, including modifying every blaster that came into their possession to have a safety if it didn't already.
</li><li> Verbally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed">deconstructed</a> in the novella <em>Side Trip</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimothyZahn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimothyZahn">Timothy Zahn</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelAStackpole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelAStackpole">Michael A. Stackpole</a>, which features a customized weapon called a "hotshot". This is a blaster with the <em>trigger guard cut off</em>. Supposedly the idea is along the lines of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangstaStyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangstaStyle">Gangsta Style</a> (looks cool but is a bad idea), but the narrator mentions that anyone who knows anything about gun safety can see why taking off the trigger guard is unbelievably stupid.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HanSolosRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HanSolosRevenge">Han Solo's Revenge</a></em>, with a scene where Han (who is an experienced gunman) deliberately removes the trigger guard from his weapon. He was heading into a hazardous situation where he might need his pistol and <em>would</em> need environmental gear, but the glove of the environment suit was so thick that his finger would not fit inside the trigger guard.
<ul><li> This is an actual real-world technique, as some weapons intended for use in cold climates can have the trigger guard removed or an oversize "winter" trigger that just below the guard fitted, to allow use while wearing bulky gloves.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragaera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragaera">Dragaera</a></em> novels have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyGunControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyGunControl">Fantasy Gun Control</a>, but Vlad still lampshades this trope when he watches a crowd of armed political protesters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Teckla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Teckla">Teckla</a></em>, and notices one of them <em>hugging</em> another while holding a razor-sharp sickle. It was blind luck the man didn't cut his fellow activist's throat.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InCryptid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InCryptid">InCryptid</a></em>, Antimony always uses throwing knifes rather than guns because she sometimes uses rollerblading and circus arts in combat and can't trust that her guns wouldn't misfire. (Her dancer sister Verity also prefers knives; although she never mentions it, this is probably why.) Also, whenever characters who are usually noncombatants are drawn into action, they will be handed knives rather than guns because there isn't enough time to teach them proper gun safety.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThisImmortal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThisImmortal">This Immortal</a></em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerZelazny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerZelazny">Roger Zelazny</a>'s novelization of his short story "And Call Me Conrad": The master assassin Hasan disassembles, cleans, and reassembles a rifle only for Conrad to notice that little by little it has been pointed right at his alien visitor, whom Conrad suspects Hasan has taken a contract to murder. Conrad can't <em>prove</em> Hasan did it on "accidentally on purpose".
</li><li> A running theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/REAMDE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/REAMDE">REAMDE</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NealStephenson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NealStephenson">Neal Stephenson</a>. Many of the POV characters have gun handling experience, so whenever someone handles a gun in the story, which is <em>often</em>, we hear about whether they're using proper or improper gun safety. Stephenson even credits someone in the acknowledgments as his gun safety resources.
</li><li> In <em>War of the Rats</em>, about the siege of Stalingrad, Vasily Zaitsev aims his (unloaded, but see Rule One) rifle at one of his new sniper students to prove some kind of point. The recruit leans away. Vasily follows him with the muzzle. Perhaps excusable in the situation, but any instructor, civil or military, who pulled a stunt like that now would be jumped on and beaten near to death for attempted murder since you don't aim a firearm at anyone you don't intend to kill.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RepairmanJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RepairmanJack">Repairman Jack</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>The Tomb</em>, Jack hands a woman a firearm, telling her that since it's double action, it needs to be cocked before it will fire. In reality, double action means the opposite of this; the two actions are cocking and releasing the hammer, both accomplished by a single trigger pull.
</li><li> In the novel <em>Hosts</em>, Jack's arms-dealer friend Abe, shown to be very knowledgeable about all things weapons related, makes the same mistake.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThisBookIsFullOfSpidersSeriouslyDudeDontTouchIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThisBookIsFullOfSpidersSeriouslyDudeDontTouchIt">This Book Is Full of Spiders: Seriously, Dude, Don't Touch It</a></em> lampshades the trope a few times due to extremely incompetent people carrying guns around.
<ul><li> When John anticipates that getting into an elevator with David and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">Creepy Child</a> was a bad idea, he runs up the staircase instead and positions himself in front of the door with a shotgun in case she's turned into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> during the ride up. When the doors open, he's pointing his gun directly at David's face.
</li><li> Amy tells the zombie movie geeks that they have no business carrying guns around because they keep unwittingly pointing them at each other. One of them has a camera mounted to the barrel of his gun, and he points the gun to his face to deliver a message to the camera. At another point, Amy mentally notes how he's pointed his combination gun/camera directly at the back of the head of the person in front of him.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> is in the habit of using the wall of his (rented) living room for target practice. While the VR (Victoria Regina) he has shot into the wall is nicely patriotic, the walls of a typical civilian residence are not guaranteed to be sturdy enough to be an effective backstop, and no mention is ever made of Holmes having the wall reinforced. Oddly, retired Army surgeon Watson only mentions this as part of a list of examples describing how messy Holmes' quarters are, with no reference to the dangers such a habit might bring to anyone in the next room. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6fl6u');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6fl6u" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6fl6u');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Also, might we suggest you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran">don't fire guns randomly around someone who's been in a war zone recently</a>? </span>
</li><li> Young gang member Fitz from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GhostStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GhostStory">Ghost Story</a></em> needs to dispose of several assault weapons, quickly. He decides to hide them in a huge snow mound &mdash; but he still takes some precious seconds to remove the magazines, so that if someone happens to find the guns, they won't get hurt by accident.
</li><li> Explicitly called out and completely averted as a plot point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeanJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeanJohnson">Jean Johnson</a></em>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheirsNotToReasonWhy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheirsNotToReasonWhy">Theirs Not to Reason Why</a></em>.

Conveniently, Ia happens to be such a powerful precognitive, and uses this as a persuasive argument as to why she is uniquely qualified to command the ship which carries the laser.

</li><li> 2:39-2:45, the gangsta style foreshadowed in the open &mdash; though actually <em>averted</em> in the final scene with Gackt as, before firing, he brings them into proper position and aims. This is possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a> in that Gackt <em>actually does</em> have firearms training in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder9');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Web Animation&nbsp;</div><div id="folder9" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Mostly averted thanks to a glitch in the game engine in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/RedVsBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/RedVsBlue">Red vs. Blue</a></em>, a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> machinima. To keep the characters from looking like they were pointing guns around while talking to one another, the creators were able to exploit a glitch in the first game in which a character would be looking down but would appear to be looking straight ahead, making it appear they lowered their weapon. In subsequent games, Bungie actually deliberately put in the ability to lower your weapon <em>without</em> having to stare at the ground for the use of machinima makers. Despite that, everyone still carries around multiple weapons and fire them off for little to no reason on occasion. Perhaps the most egregious example is Tex using Caboose as target practice in her first appearance (shooting <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeOutline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeOutline">around</a></em> him, not <em>at</em> him). Although she's a highly trained fighter and an excellent shot (as well as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an A.I., so she theoretically should have perfect aim... if we ignore the example of Church</span>) and she's only a few feet away from him, it's still an insanely dangerous thing to do. Granted, at that point in time Tex is mildly crazy thanks to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the other A.I. in her head</span>. Considering who we're talking about, it may not have been <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">O'Malley's</span> fault, but rather just her.

Maxima demonstrates the intimidation value when she points first her finger, which she can zap things with, then a handgun at Sydney, who then immediately runs for cover. In the next strip, it's lampshaded that you're <em>never</em> supposed to point a gun at something you don't intend to shoot; even if you know it's unloaded, you might be wrong (even more so in a world with teleportation and other weird powers). Maxima only gets away with it because if by some improbable sequence of events the gun does go off, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">she can catch the bullet before anyone is hurt</a>. With everyone else in Archon, it's explicitly stated that until recruits have demonstrated the ability to maintain and safely handle a firearm, they are not allowed access to ammunition (and are only allowed to handle the unloaded guns while supervised).

A couple of the writers appear to be gun enthusiasts and/or soldiers of one stripe or another. Big deals are made in-universe of the times when people don't follow the rules &mdash; while several students <em>do</em> behave recklessly with firearms (Tinkertrain and Flashbang come to mind, as does Buck Swift), the school authorities invariably land on them like an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">anvil</a> if they catch them at it.

They also have their regular Gun Gripes series, in which they go on for some time about safety problems, be it with badly maintained guns, lack of training, lack of common sense, lack of responsibility, and utter horror stories of people handling guns dangerously <em>right in the presenter's faces</em>.
<ul><li> Federal agents have actually been known to pick up guns at ranges and point directly at the floor right in front of them and put a big hole in the floor... Wall... Ceiling...
</li><li> There are always people in the darker corners of American gun culture which will claim to have been former military or police, or simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissFishersMurderMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissFishersMurderMysteries">"shooting rabbits since I was 12."</a> They typically have the muzzle discipline of a five-year-old.
</li><li> A detective was carrying a 1911 cocked and locked, with a round in the chamber, and had to use a public restroom. He hung his pistol up on the coat hook on the door by the trigger guard. He didn't notice the safety had been pushed off, so when he retrieved the gun he grabbed it by the butt and ended up pushing the trigger against the coathook, the pistol bump-fired and emptied itself into the ceiling.
</li><li> Host Eric was being harassed by a higher-ranking soldier during a tour in Iraq, while his unit had set up in a penthouse. The officer wanted a round in the chamber of the LMG that Eric was in charge of, but it was an open-bolt weapon, meaning that it would only have a round in the chamber when the trigger is squeezed. Eric now admits he shouldn't have, but he decided to demonstrate. Putting a couple of holes in the wall.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan">Sym-Bionic Titan</a></em>: Galaluna's military academy has the worst security imaginable. To wit, Baron, who admittedly had the best record at the school, is able to take fully charged laser weapons to try to kill Lance without having to go through any security or check out procedures. They're kept in an unlocked cabinet. It gets worse when they enter the training wing, where both boys are able to hijack <em>fully-armed</em> (and <em>loaded</em>) battle mechs without so much as a security code. The only way to deactivate these things is a shutdown switch built <em>on the mech</em> rather than in a remote station since they are training devices. Another possibility is that the control console was too far away to reach in time to keep the people nearby safe.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em>: Elisa is, at one point, seriously injured when Broadway accidentally shoots her while playing with her gun. Elisa, an NYPD detective, had left her sidearm, holster <em>and</em> gun belt <em>unattended</em> in another room from where she was (she admits later that she should have known better). For the rest of the series, she is shown either unloading her weapon (when not in use) or storing it in a gun coffer.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em>, during the "Daria Hunters" episode, several characters are shown playing paintball without safety goggles on. Granted, Paintball guns are not necessarily deadly weapons, but they still hurt and can inflict <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">Eye Scream</a> if they hit an unprotected face. Sandi even calls Quinn, Tiffany, and Stacey out on this because the rules of paintball state you're supposed to wear goggles.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer">Archer</a></em> actually averts this surprisingly often for a spy parody.
<ul><li> While Archer is keen to just play around with his gun and ignore proper ear protection (often to comedic effect) and Cyril can't seem to pick up a gun without accidentally shooting someone, Lana's often seen handling her guns the right way. Heck, when Cyril accidentally shoots someone, she takes his gun, clicks the safety, ejects the magazine, <em>then</em> ejects the round from the chamber.
</li><li> In another episode, two of Woodhouse's squadron mates from the Royal Flying Corps visit him, one of whom brings the commander's revolver and points it directly at Woodhouse's face to show him the bore wasn't pitted.
</li><li> The show also averts this by showing the consequences of Archer's ignorance of proper ear protection. He has temporarily deafened others by firing too close to their ears and has developed tinnitus as a result of his own actions or other people firing near his ears in revenge. It does play it straight in some instances, however, with most everyone being more than happy to aim loaded weapons at each other for even the slightest of arguments.
</li><li> Subtly played with the episode "Lo Scandalo": Malory, a spymaster and experienced former spy herself, points her recently fired weapon <em>at her own neck</em> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">demonstrate the difference between a catsuit and a zentai.</a> Lana is predictably alarmed and takes the gun from her, checking to make sure it isn't loaded. Considering Malory had just witnessed assassins murder a long-time lover in her own apartment, one could understand her being too shaken up to observe proper gun safety rules. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">That is until we discover that Malory, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bitch</a> that she is, made the whole thing up; she killed the man herself and only faked her BSOD and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecklessGunUsage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecklessGunUsage">Reckless Gun Usage</a> to divert Archer and Lana's suspicions and manipulate them into helping her get rid of the body.</span>
</li><li> Lampshaded when a pregnant and angry Lana says "This is all I need right here" and points at her belly...with her loaded pistol. Even Archer gives her a "Seriously?" expression, and she realizes what she just did.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS9E5TheCartridgeFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS9E5TheCartridgeFamily">The Cartridge Family</a>", which starts with a soccer riot leading to complete chaos in Springfield, Homer buys a gun to protect the family. He then proceeds to violate every gun rule in existence, including pointing the revolver he wanted to buy at the salesman and repeatedly pulling the trigger (although obviously it wouldn't be loaded and he seems to be doing it for fun), pointing the gun at people at random, using it to shoot light bulbs rather than switch them off, shoot open cans of beer, and even to <em>change the channel on the TV</em>. He's such a menace that Marge tells him that his recklessness has caused her to literally fear for their lives, and when Homer displays this behavior in front of the NRA members of Springfield, they're so completely shocked by his actions, they strip him of his membership on the spot. While the members depicted in the episode are ludicrous with their guns (such as modifying one gun into five guns), they at least are aware of the fact that owning a gun is a serious thing.
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS5E10Springfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS5E10Springfield">$pringfield</a>", after hearing Lisa's nightmare about the Boogeyman, Homer arms himself with a shotgun. When Marge comes home, we see that he has already fired a shot through the door; when she enters the door, he points the gun right at her face, and upon being relieved that it's her he casually tosses the gun on the floor causing it to discharge as he runs over to embrace her.
</li><li> In another episode, Chief Wiggum gives the mayor a massage with the grip of his gun... which then discharges a round into the cameraman. Wiggum adds to his incompetence in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS10E13HomerToTheMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS10E13HomerToTheMax">Homer to the Max</a>", where he is seen attempting to block out obnoxious singing by <em>sticking a pistol in each ear, muzzles inwards</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsonsMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsonsMovie">The Simpsons Movie</a></em> has also seen him eat donuts off of the barrel of his gun, have the gun discharge on him, have him comment on how extremely lucky he is, <em>and then keeps eating the donuts off of the gun</em>.
</li><li> Played for laughs in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS5E11HomerTheVigilante" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS5E11HomerTheVigilante">Homer the Vigilante</a>" when Homer's vigilante squad is checking their guns inside Homer's house. Marge comments that she doesn't like the idea of them using guns, and Homer tries to give her a reassuring talk that they are responsible adults who know how to handle firearms &mdash; only to be interrupted by an accidental discharge from Moe. Homer tries to resume his talk, but is interrupted by more accidental discharges from the Sea Captain, Principal Skinner, Moe again, and <em>Bart</em>.
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS20E21ComingToHomerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS20E21ComingToHomerica">Coming to Homerica</a>", the Springfield police do what they do best and enlist help in patrolling the Springfield border from immigrants by arming locals and paying them in "bullets and booze". In short order, a drunken Homer ends up throwing his beer in the air and eating the barrel of his gun. All he could say afterwards was "I almost made a <em>biiig</em> mistake."
