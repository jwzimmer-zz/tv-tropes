It can also be trying out a vast number of tricks and item combinations and find that <em>each one</em> is accounted for in the game code.

<ul><li> If you skip the boomerang found in Hyrule Castle, it will later be obtainable from a chest in Kakariko Village instead of some arrows. Since Hyrule Castle becomes inaccessible upon reaching the Dark World, this was to guarantee you didn't render it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">unobtainable</a>. Also, just in case you miss the one in Kakariko, there will be a <em>magical</em> boomerang in the chest that normally contains 300 rupees in The Village of Outcasts.
</li><li> Slightly altered dialogue exists for obtaining the second and third pendants out of order.
</li><li> There is also a slightly altered dialogue for Zelda when you rescue her from Turtle Rock, in the unlikely event that you only half complete another dungeon and don't rescue all six other maidens first.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em>:
<ul><li> It is possible to leave Dodongo's Cavern after obtaining the Bomb Bag, use bombs to access Zora's River, and complete Jabu-Jabu's Belly before the remainder of Dodongo's Cavern. If you do so, the game will correctly state that the Zora's Sapphire is the second Spiritual Stone Link has recovered, rather than the third.
</li><li> In addition to that, there is a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">unused dialogue</a> of Saria hinting at the location of the Goron's Ruby; however, there is no way to hear this, as Saria will continue to say that she is happy that Darunia liked her song until the Ruby is acquired, even if Link gets the Sapphire first.
<div class="indent"><strong>Saria:</strong> Are you collecting Spiritual Stones? You have one more to find? You mean the Spiritual Stone of Fire, don&#146;t you? The Great Deku Tree once told me that Mr. Darunia of the Gorons has it...
</div></li><li> Normally, when adult Link enters the Gerudo Fortress and gets caught, he gets tossed into a prison cell that can only be escaped by using the Hookshot. If you engage in a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking">Sequence Breaking</a> and get Epona before the Longshot, and enter the Gerudo Fortress by jumping over the broken bridge<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0amzf');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0amzf" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0amzf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which many gamers do anyway at least to get Biggoron's Sword early in the game</span>, you won't get trapped in the cell if caught &mdash; the guards just throw you outside the entrance to the village. Because Link cannot enter the Gerudo Fortress from Gerudo Valley as a child (at least, not without exploiting a glitch or two), some players might try to enter the Gerudo Fortress as a child through the back door: by travelling backwards through the Haunted Wasteland from the Desert Colossus. Crafty players who manage to do so (which is impossible without glitching OR cheating as child Link cannot cross the River of Sand) will find that the gate is closed and a Gerudo guard is standing in front of it, telling the player that children are not allowed to enter.
</li><li> The Spirit Temple is divided into a child and adult portion, with the dungeon's two treasures being on each of the statue's massive hands outside. The child treasure, the Silver Gauntlets, are in a chest that's just sitting there, while you'll notice the adult treasure, the Mirror Shield, is in a chest that actually appears from nowhere once you step out onto the hand. This is just in case you found a way to get through the child portion as an adult: you can't just hookshot your way over to the Mirror Shield by using the chest as an anchor point.
</li><li> Although it's effectively impossible to get Nayru's Love before facing Dark Link, as getting it requires either the Longshot (obtained for <em>beating</em> Dark Link) or the Hover Boots (obtained in a dungeon that can't be explored until after the Water Temple is beaten), the developers considered the possibility of the player finding a way to get their hands on it prior via glitches or cheating. Dark Link reacts to Nayru's Love by becoming entirely defensive, shielding and dodging without attempting to attack, until it wears off.
</li><li> It's also possible to thaw out King Zora with a Zora Tunic already in possession, if you thaw out the Zora Shop first. King Zora has unique... interesting... dialogue if you do this. However, this is not possible with the Goron Tunic, as you can't buy it as a child and the Goron Shop is locked until you talk to Darunia's son. If you used a cheating or hacking device, he will give you a Blue Rupee instead.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>King Zora:</strong> What?! You already have one? You're ready for anything, aren't you! With my heartfelt thanks...how about a KISS?! What? You don't want it?! Oh well...
</div><ul><li> Ganondorf can only be finished off with a swing of your sword, either Master or Biggoron's Sword. It's possible to damage him with other weapons, such as Din's Fire or the Megaton Hammer, but the final blow must be with a sword. This is done <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">so your last attack will line up with the cutscene that plays after he is defeated</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask">The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</a></em>:
<ul><li> It's not supposed to be possible to enter the Deku Shrine without defeating the Woodfall Temple, but you can pull it off by standing on the lilypad, changing to a human, and quickly firing an arrow before it sinks (it requires split-second timing). If you do, the Deku Butler will correctly not be inside.
</li><li> Normally the Stone Mask renders you invisible to the Gerudo Pirate guards when infiltrating their fortress, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss">Mini Bosses</a> and Aveil herself will still see you. When they do, their dialogue is changed to say things like "Don't think that mask will fool me!" or "There's a kid with a strange mask over there". This keeps in theme with the mask's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlavorText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlavorText">Flavor Text</a> that remarks it doesn't actually make you invisible but merely "as uninteresting as a stone", implying specific people are alert or intelligent enough to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlamourFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlamourFailure">take notice anyways</a>.

However, if your lock-picking skill is high enough, you will get a message that says, "Success! Your nose is now open!".

Fortunately, while Samus is barred from returning to the previous room or progressing forward, a hole in the floor allows her to exit the nest and return to the room with the broken Chozo Statue. The Queen Metroid only appears (and the crystals automatically disappear) after all of the larvae are exterminated. Additionally, the hole in the floor is still open during the boss battle (in case the player doesn't have enough missiles or energy and needs to make an emergency exit to restock), but is covered up when the battle ends to ensure that the player can only progress forward and is no longer able to backtrack.

</li><li> The fight with Draygon can be made <em>much</em> simpler if you shoot out one of the cannons on the walls, exposing electric wiring inside, letting Draygon capture you, and then using the Grappling Beam to connect to the wires, channeling the electrical circuit through Samus and shocking Draygon to death.
</li><li> You can turn off upgrades in the menu, and there is/are a distinct beam(s) for every possible combination of activated beam weapons, which amounts to 26 different beam animations. Logically, there'd be 34 (one for the default beam plus 2 to the 5th power, on or off for each beam, plus <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">one for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower">Hyper Beam</a></span>), but the Spazer and Plasma Beam are unable to be enabled at the same time normally.
</li><li> Even if one were to make use of the Spacetime/Reset Beam (which involves enabling the Plasma Beam and Spazer together using a boot upgrade), there is no animation for said beam; it earned its name by resetting all upgrades and bosses, with no visible projectile.
</li><li> If by some chance you are able to sequence break all the way through the searing hot caves of Upper Norfair without the Varia Suit and survive, arriving at Lower Norfair will result in a very rude awakening&mdash;almost <em>every single room</em> is as hot as the worst parts of Upper Norfair. It's virtually impossible to get anywhere through it without a tool assisted run.

For instance, if the player gets the Screw Attack early, the Ripper that must be frozen so that you can stand on it during the Kiri Guru boss fight cannot be killed by the attack, unlike other Rippers.

<ul><li> Atreus has a large number of unique lines depending on what a player does, even some off-the-wall behavior. For instance, if the player has Kratos attack while there are no enemies present (for example, if you're trying out new moves), Atreus may ask "Are you... exercising?"
</li><li> Early on in the story, Kratos has to throw his axe into the Lake of Nine in a cut-scene right after a boat-ride from the Witch's cave. Normally, when entering a boat, Kratos never recalls the axe, but when he enters the boat this time, he will recall the axe if he does not have it.
</li><li> Normally, Mimir is present whenever Kratos and Atreus fight the Valkyries. However, since you can enter Muspelheim before reviving Mimir (Albiet vastly under equipped), it's possible to fight the Valkyrie Gondul before reviving Mimir, and if so, there's different dialogue between the two. Kratos also gives his own responses to Atreus' complaints as they move up the mountain.
</li><li> During your second trip to Helheim you will see <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Baldur</span> standing near a low wall. Try throwing your axe or a boulder at him and the cursor will disappear, preventing you from damaging him.

To list just a handful of examples of the game's staggeringly expansive implementation:
<ul><li> The crowd at the fair will normally cheer if you solve the word-balance puzzle by changing the apple or pear to something heavier or lighter (e.g. changing the apple to an ale), but they will gasp in disgust instead if you do so by transforming the pear into an (obviously severed) ear.
</li><li> It is fully possible to make a cock ring. Attempting to wear it prompts a snarky response from the (male) character currently sharing your (female) body. Showing it to the professor who wants you to change a naughty term to an innocent one causes him to have a <em>hilarious</em> reaction.
<div class="indent">"Waterstone sees what you've made of the cock, and clutches desperately at his hair as though he's going to tear it out in tufts. His eyes bulge and water. I've never seen the man so close to apoplexy. I think that was exactly the wrong thing, somehow."
</div></li><li> In fact, the game has various amusing responses to you doing... suggestive things with naughty-sounding items. Putting gel on the (chicken) cock/(church) member/(donkey) ass will cause Alex to awkwardly cut short his typical description of "you rub an amount of gel on the [object]", and trying to get the bartender to paddle any one of these objects into their homonyms will cause her to smirk and refuse to do so.

</li><li> If you get the crazy idea of shooting the anagramming gun at its own reflection, it turns into an anagramming <em>gnu</em>. Then the gnu sees its own reflection and changes back into a gun to prevent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByInsanity">Unwinnable by Insanity</a>, and you're even rewarded with an achievement!

</li><li> One puzzle has Hoagie slipping something into the suggestion box for the Constitution. Another puzzle (which has you tricking the founding fathers into starting a fire and later making them evacuate) takes place in the same room. How far along you are in that puzzle affects the first one:
<ul><li> If Hoagie drops the item in the suggestion box before the fire is started or after it's put out, he suggests they check the box. George Washington says he has an idea to which John Hancock asks "Does it have to do with starting a fire?"
</li><li> If Hoagie drops the item in the box after the fire is started, he again suggests they check the box. George Washington again says he has an idea. This time, John Hancock asks if they're going to torment Betsy Ross again.
</li><li> If you try to get Hoagie to drop the item in the box during the evacuation, he refuses since no one's watching.
</li></ul></li><li> Laverne starts the game with a scalpel in her inventory, but she doesn't need to use it. (Bernard does.) The first time she's taken to Dr. Tentacle, she asks if he's going to use his scalpel.

</li><li> There's a series of small signs on Plunder Island set up by the Naturalists' Society. One of these is next to a thorn bush in a patch of quicksand. It identifies the bush as a "Papapishu Bush" and explains that "papapishu" is a native word meaning "ouch". After reading the sign, Guybrush will say "papapishu" instead of "ouch" for the rest of the game. If he doesn't read the sign, he says "ouch" as usual.
</li><li> When Guybrush meets Palido Domingo on the beach, he can ask him how long he's been sunbathing. Palido will say he's been sunbathing since the month three months before the date set in the computer. If the game is played in January, he adds "By the way, Happy New Year".
</li><li> When making the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">hangover cure</span> in the endgame, you can tear up your tofu mask and sprinkle it on top. It has no effect, but it changes the item graphic.
</li><li> There's a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEggs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEggs">Easter Eggs</a> that can be found by repeatedly doing things that most people would stop doing when nothing happened initially.
<ul><li> If the player tries to walk into the lagoon on Blood Island, the game won't let them. If the player persists, Guybrush will eventually walk into the water and find his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSecretOfMonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSecretOfMonkeyIsland">The Secret of Monkey Island</a></em> self drowned and tied to the Idol of Many Hands.
</li><li> If the player reenters the crypt where Stan has set up his insurance business, all they will get is a greeting from Stan. If the player enters enough times, Maggie from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDig">The Dig</a></em> will appear on the spider's web in the corner, and a spider will appear and drag her off.
</li><li> On Skull Island, Guybrush relies on LaFoot to winch him down to King Andre's cave. LaFoot always loses his grip and drops him until Guybrush uses an umbrella to float to King Andre's cave. If the player lets LaFoot drop Guybrush enough times, Guybrush will finish his business with King Andre and take care of one last thing before returning to Blood Island: climbing back up the mountain and throwing LaFoot off.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Extremely common in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RabiRibi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RabiRibi">Rabi-Ribi</a></em>. The game has achievements for doing things like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking">fighting Lilith before gaining the help of any bosses</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">beating the game without collecting any items except the bunny amulets and consumables</a>, and in the later case, some parts of the game world change to accomodate your lack of movement options, like new springs and breakable walls.

The only way to do something that doesn't result in a custom response is finding a bug that allows you to do something that wasn&#146;t meant to be possible. The default responses aren&#146;t even voiced because they weren&#146;t meant to be triggered.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamAndMaxHitTheRoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamAndMaxHitTheRoad">Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road</a></em> has it that you can try to pick up something that can't be picked up and Sam will tell you this. If you repeatedly try to pick up the object, he will get more and more upset and eventually Max will comment. However, that's not the Foresight part. The Foresight comes into play if you try to do this during the point of the game where Sam and Max are separated (when Conroy and Lee-Harvey throw Max into the Mini-Golf course) and Sam has a new set of lines.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami">&#332;kami</a></em>: being a game based around using your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtInitiatesLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtInitiatesLife">Celestial Brush</a> to interact with and create objects, there are many extra things you can use the brush for other than the set skills the game teaches you. For example, you can use your brush on <em>any</em> NPC you wish. Summoning bombs or slashing them will send them flying, but drawing a circle around them can make them react happily and rush to pet you. Drawing circles on the residents of Kamui Village uniquely turns them into wolves.
<ul><li> One particularly funny usage of the brush that exemplifies Developer Foresight can be found after defeating <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Orochi</span> during the festival in Kamiki Village. Several villagers are sat round a barrel of Thunder Sake, and it is possible to get each of them drunk or even <em>electrocute</em> them with it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ManiacMansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ManiacMansion">Maniac Mansion</a></em> has some early examples:
<ul><li> There's a publisher in the game you can send things to and get a contract from. However, the only two things you can send him which will advance the game: the manuscript after it's been edited by Wendy and Green Tentacle's demo tape. If you send him the manuscript unedited or edited by someone other than Wendy, there's a specific cutscene for that. There's also cutscenes if you send the cassette tape with the old record, Syd or Razor playing, or the tentacle mating call on it.
</li><li> Furthermore, if Syd or Razor gets a contract for their playing, you can show it to Green Tentacle. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He kills you in response.</span>
</li><li> If you have Wendy edit the Meteor's manuscript, you can send it to the publisher to get it a contract and present the contract to the Meteor to get a different ending <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">where the Meteor ends up getting interviewed on a talk show</span>. You can also use Bernard to contact the Meteor Police and have it arrested. What happens if you do both? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The interview still happens, but gets interrupted by the Meteor Police coming to arrest him.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSwordOfEtheria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSwordOfEtheria">The Sword Of Etheria</a></em>, the tutorial asks you to perform a knockback attack, however it fails to tell you that the attack requires you to have stunned the enemy for it to work until after it is attempted. The dialogue changes if the player succeeded in their attempt, acknowledging their success and then explaining the technique in case the player stumbled on the correct answer.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarnhamFables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarnhamFables">Farnham Fables</a></em>:
<ul><li> In general, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinatorialExplosion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinatorialExplosion">almost every possible interaction</a> will yield a unique response.
</li><li> The hidden "Nudie Mode" allows you to turn clothing invisible when you mouse over it. Obviously, you can see almost any character naked, but this also works on things like background elements and inventory items.
</li><li> In Episode 1:
<ul><li> The fox will run to the south after smelling Gloria's clothes. The princes can either go to the south, or take the long way around the forest; doing the latter will result in the fox being confused as to why you'd do that.
</li><li> Once Gloria is reunited with Rachael, whichever prince is currently holding the skirt will be the one to hand it back to her. Normally, this will be Philip, since you have to give him the skirt so he can make the fox track Gloria, but if you give it to another prince first, they will give Rachael the skirt, with a unique sprite and dialogue for each one.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HearthstoneHeroesOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HearthstoneHeroesOfWarcraft">Hearthstone</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game has many examples of this, but perhaps the best example is the Noble Sacrifice card. This Paladin-only card triggers when an enemy attacks, and it summons a 2/1 minion which redirects the attack to itself. Normally, this would kill it outright, but if other triggered effects cascade off the Defender entering play, the original attacker can potentially die first or the Defender can survive or be resurrected. The best part? Each minion has a line when attacking, and the Noble Sacrifice sounds very surprised to be alive.
<ul><li> In a similar vein, Doomsayer is a 0/7 that destroys itself and all minions at the start of your next turn, and is summoned with a dramatic "THE END IS COMING!". If you manage to attack with it<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1z13s');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1z13s" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1z13s');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Either Silencing it to prevent the effect or giving it Rush/Charge, then giving it an attack boost</span>, he'll proclaim "Did I miss it?"
</li></ul></li><li> Adventure mode bosses have several minions that are unobtainable to players, but can be controlled through cards like Mind Control. These unique minions also have attack quotes, with many of them sounding quite disdainful/surprised that they are being used by the player.
</li><li> The "sorry" emote was removed from the emote list (due to people using it sarcastically) however even after that every new hero released has still had a "Sorry" line recorded. Why? Because there's one joke card that randomizes your emote selection and that can generate the old "Sorry" emotes.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shadowverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shadowverse">Shadowverse</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ghosts normally banish themselves whenever they would be destroyed. They still have a death line programmed, and it can only be heard through a single type of interaction (<a class="urllink" href="https://shadowverse-portal.com/card/103511030">Ghosthound Sexton<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>).
</li><li> Every card has a line for summoning, attacking, evolving, and dying. <a class="urllink" href="https://shadowverse-portal.com/card/103741010">Eidolon of Madness<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> has an effect that prevents it from attacking, and <a class="urllink" href="https://shadowverse-portal.com/card/104741020">Heavenly Aegis<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is indestructible. They still have attack and death lines respectively.
</li><li> Every single card has an animated version, even the limited-time reprints of cards that come in base form such as Ta-G, Katana Unsheated and generated card Tokens such as Ghosts. If you use an animated card such as Urd to summon a copy of another follower, that new copy will become animated too. With the release of Seer's Globes, players can now freely animate any card of their choice.

But if either Link or Toon Link is selected to fight, then Alfonzo will be driving the train. Similarly, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaLevel">Dream Land 64</a> stage still has the "King Dedede sometimes floats by in the background" element that it had in both the original <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> and <em>Melee</em>, but unlike those two games, Dedede is playable now, and if he's selected to fight, that background element simply won't appear.

Ultimate</a></em>, Assist Trophies and Pok&eacute; Ball Pok&eacute;mon will not spawn from their respective items if they already have a presence on the stage. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Alucard</a> will not spawn on stages with reflections or mirrors due to him being a half-vampire.
</li><li> Also in <em>Ultimate</em>, Palutena's Guidance for Cloud mentions how his Finishing Touch attack deals high knockback despite only doing 1% damage. However, if the current match is a Stamina match (where knockback matters much less), Pit will remark that he doesn't need to worry about that.
</li><li> Palutena's Guidance in general will have differences depending on if Pit's opponent is using a male or female variation, or if the alternate costume is someone different like Alph or the Koopalings. Similarly, Snake can't make a CODEC call about Ike in his <em>Radiant Dawn</em> visage; it has to be the <em>Path of Radiance</em> version which featured in <em>Brawl</em>.

However, when done on Souther, nothing will happen to him at all when the timer runs out and he even laughs about it, reflecting his dextrocardia immunity to Hokuto Shinken.
</li><li> The console versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear">Guilty Gear</a> XX Accent Core</em> up to <em>Plus R</em> include a bonus "GG Generations" option which changes the game's mechanics slightly to resemble previous games. "GG" mode changes how Instant Kills work so that they can be repeatedly used and escaped from via onscreen button prompts. If the victim misses the inputs they eat an immediate unfailing Instant Kill. Yet Order-Sol's Instant Kill "Dragon Install Sekkai" is a long and complicated button combination, and the actual IK portion only triggers if the victim's health is low enough, so how did the dev team work around this? When Order-Sol's in "GG" mode, performing a successful IK here triggers his EX form's IK, "All Guns Blazing."
<ul><li> May's Instant Kill in <em>Xrd</em> (where she blasts her opponent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinkleInTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinkleInTheSky">into the sky</a> with one of the Mayship's cannons) gives May unique dialogue when she uses it on Johnny, the owner of the Mayship. Also, Dizzy's Instant Kill (where she diverts an incredibly powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KamehameHadoken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KamehameHadoken">Kamehame Hadoken</a> before Necro can vaporize her opponent with it, and her opponent surrenders after seeing the ensuing mushroom cloud in the background) gets absolutely no reaction from Bedman (who's in a coma throughout all his fights), and Elphelt using her Instant Kill (where she fires a special bullet at her opponent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CupidsArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CupidsArrow">that makes them fall in love with her</a>) has dialogue from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch">Mirror Match</a> Elphelt lampshading how she's being seduced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYourself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYourself">herself</a>.

If Tron Bonne is one of the fighters, though, she will disappear from the background and Tiesel will cheer her on instead. One step further: If two Trons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch">fight each other</a>, Tiesel will appear confused and stare at the two of them trying to work out what's going on.

If Balrog is one of the fighters, Vega ("Claw") will appear instead. If both Balrog and Vega are fighting, M. Bison ("Dictator") will appear instead.

Well, you can call that same aircraft in later to destroy a German half-track hampering your way.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TowerOfGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TowerOfGuns">Tower of Guns</a></em>:
<ul><li> If you are smart enough to climb out of the main area of the Battlements level and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">jump off the Tower</span> while possessing the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Long Fall perk</span>, you find yourself in a small secret stage with developer Joe, who pretends to be surprised by your actions and warns you that leveling and player stats may behave oddly. After that, you have to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">start from the very first level</span>.
</li><li> If you jump (or fly) too high in the <em>Battlements</em>, you get a warning message warning about possible &#147;buggy collision detection at such heights&#148;. However, if you strive for ascension to the very top of the Tower (which is very unlikely, since it may require stacking 20 double jumps with increased jump height or obtaining an exceedingly rare gun with recoil so strong that it can serve as a jetpack), after climbing those humongous clockwork-like steampunk mechanisms, there is another message from the dev that congratulates you with &#147;breaking the game&#148;, and a reward consisting of even more perks that are, well, quite useless if you are so good to have reached the top.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament2004" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament2004">Unreal Tournament 2004</a></em> has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningGun">Lightning Gun</a> sniper weapon. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hitscan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hitscan">hitscan</a> and has no area damage, so it's theoretically impossible for players to kill themselves with it. However, just in case someone, somehow, does manage to do just that, the devs left in an appropriate suicide message: "&lt;player's name&gt; violated the laws of space-time and sniped himself".
</li><li> The training tutorial in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CounterStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CounterStrike">Counter-Strike</a>: Global Offensive</em> takes place inside an enclosed target practice room, and opens with an announcer asking you to empty your gun into the target in front of you. He will acknowledge your actions if you decide to instead empty your gun into everything <em>but</em> the target.
<ul><li> Additionally, when the training surprises you with flashbang training (by dropping one in front of you), the game reacts if you react appropriately.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeI">Quake</a></em>: in the first map of the third episode of the <em>Scourge of Armagon</em> expansion pack, at the beginning, you have to ride a trolley across an acid-filled chasm while fending off deadly explosive volleys from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Vores</a>, reach a tower, and fight your way up for a key. Or, you can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking">sequence-break</a> the whole thing by climbing the surrounding cliff, walking across an extremely thin ledge, and hop right on top of the tower. The game acknowledges this by triggering a message that reads <em>"You're not supposed to be here!"</em>
<ul><li> The <em>Quake</em> example above is a throwback to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukem3D" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukem3D">Duke Nukem 3D</a></em>, where various hard-to-access areas of the game have similar "You Aren't Supposed To Be Here" messages scrawled on the walls. Some of them you can only find by using the walk-through-walls cheat, as in the section with the helicopter at the end of Episode 3 Map 4 ('L.A. Rumble').
</li><li> For being a game created purely for multiplayer, the devs paid a hilarious amount of attention when it came to <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKWrbpehhhc">bots responding to player chat messages<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeIIIArena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeIIIArena">Quake III: Arena</a></em>.

<ul><li> Like most Source Engine games, players have the ability to type "kill" into the developer console to instantly die, in case they get stuck somehow and need to respawn as a last resort. When a team wins a round, during the brief time before the next round starts, they gain 100% critical hits while the losing team loses access to their weapons, something that fans have come to call "humiliation". Lest players <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled">decide to suicide to deny their opponents a free kill</a>, the "kill" command is disabled during this period. The Soldier's suicide-bomb taunt, however, is not; this was probably intentional.
</li><li> The Spy has an unlockable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloakingDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloakingDevice">invisibility watch</a> called the Dead Ringer, which instead of activating immediately, will cause him to feign death when he is attacked, leaving behind a fake corpse as the real spy vanishes into the shadows. Because this is a video game, a real kill would do a lot more than just ragdoll the spy's player model &#151; his weapon and an ammo box would drop to the ground, his name would be grayed out in the scoreboard, a kill notification would appear in the top right, and the killer would earn a point and, in certain circumstances, possibly also a Steam achievement. All of which have been taken into account and <em>will</em> trigger (or pretend to trigger) upon a fake kill, just in case the player is paying extra close attention.
<ul><li> But, there are still clues a savvy player can use to tell if a Spy has used the Dead Ringer. For example, when a player uses the DR, the ammo box that they drop doesn't actually provide any ammo, and has no sound effect when picked up.
</li></ul></li><li> The Sniper's "Skewer" taunt kill sees him pull an arrow from his quiver and stab his opponent with it, killing them instantly. If the Sniper has run out of ammo for his bow, however, he cannot use this taunt.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1">Half Life 1</a></em>, immediately after the resonance cascade but before you are granted any weapons, you have to talk to a scientist and have him use a retinal scanner to open a door for you. It is possible, of course, to kill this scientist, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">just like all the others</a>, but it <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf2vd80CTqU">takes some doing<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> &#151; you have to wait for a different scientist to eventually resuscitate a downed guard, then slowly push that guard back to his doom so he'll drop a pistol for you to shoot the retinal-scanner scientist. The instant that scientist dies, the door automatically opens.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em>, there's one spot where you have to activate a gate by plugging two car batteries into a contraption. One is right next to it, and the other is, predictably, inside a car. Said car is extremely heavy to prevent you from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WreakingHavok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WreakingHavok">punting it off the cliff with the gravity gun</a> like you can with the others, and if you decide to stone-cold pick up the battery and fling it into the ocean... it respawns. Additionally, in the first chapter of the game, the player must move a crate to an open window to climb out and progress. If the player inexplicably throws all ten-or-so crates out the window, the crates will respawn.
<ul><li> In Episode 1, the player does not have a weapon for a portion of the game. There is a room you fall into with a gate, with a lock you must shoot off with a gun. This is to ensure the player finds a weapon in that room before continuing. However, if the player, for some reason, wastes every round of ammunition in that room without shooting off the lock, the lock will simply fall off and the gate will open, allowing the player to progress anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLifeAlyx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLifeAlyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a></em>: There are various items you can find that you can wear as hats or masks. Most are what you'd expect, such as construction hard hats or respirators, but the game also lets you wear more unorthodox things like traffic cones. But what <em>really</em> pushes it into this trope is that, if you walk under a Barnacle while wearing something on your head, the hat will get grabbed and sucked up instead of you.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prey2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prey2017">Prey (2017)</a></em>: The game will almost always acknowledge if you skip steps in quests or do things in different orders than expected. For example, if you head to Psychotronics before inspecting the elevator, January will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">wonder how you knew the elevator was broken</a>, then give you the instructions she&#146;d normally give there.
<ul><li> If you look at Morgan&#146;s feet during the intro helicopter ride, you see they&#146;re tapping their feet to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftTheBackgroundMusicOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftTheBackgroundMusicOn">the background music</a>.
</li><li> Morgan&#146;s bathroom at the start of the game will have the toilet seat up or down depending on which gender you&#146;re playing as. <em>That&#146;s</em> attention to detail.
</li><li> You can kill just about every character anytime you meet them and the plot will change accordingly, such as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">saving December by killing January before the latter kills the former,</span> something that the game never even hints is possible.
</li><li> The epilogue takes an incredible amount of choices into account and has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Alex and his team</span> discuss them in a manner that sounds completely natural, averting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadLibsDialogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadLibsDialogue">Mad Libs Dialogue</a>. For instance, if you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kill Alex in the simulation but nobody else, the operators will warn Alex he should be wary, since &#147;Morgan&#148; seems to have something against him and Alex will defend you, saying you had every reason to do so. They&#146;ll even remark on <em>when</em> you do some things, such as wondering why you saved Igwe only to kill him later, if you did so.</span>
</li><li> Literally every single NPC on Talos-1 is a named character and accounted for. <em>Every single one</em>. You can use the terminals in each department's security booth to track who is where on the station; not only can this be used to track down specific people, but it updates in real time to account for NPCs changing locations.
</li><li> The Scavenger Hunt will change the chipset from being very useful to completely worthless depending if you put in the code before or after actually finding all of the numbers.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MysteryCaseFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MysteryCaseFiles">Mystery Case Files</a></em> developers tend to think of everything a player might do, however odd or counter-intuitive. For example, in <em>Escape From Ravenhearst</em>, you can run <em>every</em> object accessible at the time through a scanning device, and see its X-ray image; if you're playing the Collector's Edition in which tokens must be gathered and energized, the tokens' <em>scans</em> show sparkles after charging, just like the tokens do.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WhereInTimeIsCarmenSandiego1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WhereInTimeIsCarmenSandiego1997">Where in Time Is Carmen Sandiego? (1997)</a></em>:
<ul><li> It's actually possible to try and use the time cuffs on people, usually for a funny comment, such as a Roman saying "I'm cleaning up &#151; but not through thievery!" or Ann Tikwitee saying "Uh gee, I don't think there's a thief in my pocket, do you?"
</li><li> Using a battle axe on Rock Solid makes him say, "OUCH! Don't cut me down to size!" while he makes a surprised face.
</li><li> Giving a torch to Hatshepshut results in her saying, "CAREFUL! Or you'll singe my false beard!"
</li><li> You can actually try using items together or hand them to people, often getting you a response where they tell you something about that item. The only time wherein you don't get a response and it just puts it back are say, assembling pieces or where you would expect them to not need it.
</li><li> One case involves using a phonograph. Everyone you can actually speak to (sans the crook) will have a response, and you can actually play the recordings back to the people for their responses.
</li><li> In addition, some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> content suggests even <em>further</em> foresight from the writing team, as there are some deleted lines that result from actions that cannot occur in gameplay. For example, there is a line that can only result in attempting to use the time cuffs on Gutenburg &#151; this cannot ever happen, as he cannot be interacted with once the Carmen note is assembled. There is also some humour in the dummied out content, such as how you could apparently use the torch on a mummy and be told, "Nope. This is a burial, not a cremation."
</li><li> Suppose you're feeling a little cheeky during Gutenberg's case and make the notice say "Thief on the goose", "Sheep on the loose", or "Sheep on the goose". Gutenberg does indeed respond to these rather than the normal "This is gibberish!" when you mess up.
</li></ul></li><li> One remix stage in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NESRemix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NESRemix">NES Remix</a></em> has you play through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelInReverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelInReverse">mirrored version</a> of World 1-2 from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros1">Super Mario Bros</a></em> as Luigi. The instructions are "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Get to the Goal Pole!</a>". If you beat the level by taking one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarpZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarpZone">warp pipes</a> instead, it counts as a Miss.
</li><li> Levels in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MotocrossMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MotocrossMadness">Motocross Madness</a></em> were square valleys delimited by sudden and <strong>very</strong> steep mountains, apparently impassable. If, however, you got enough speed and approached them at the proper angle, it was possible to &#151; just barely &#151; climb on top, and find a flat, featureless land. The curious player who would then ride off in the sunset, expecting to find a fall into the void, an invisible wall, or just an out-of-bounds crash, would then find that the devs had foreseen this, and planned accordingly. Cue a cannon sound, followed by the player and bike being launched back inside the level boundaries at ridiculous speed.
</li><li> In the video game version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhoWantsToBeAMillionaire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhoWantsToBeAMillionaire">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</a></em>, entering in one of the names of an actual million-dollar winner (such as John Carpenter or Dan Blonsky) or either part of host Regis Philbin's name will cause Regis to mock you and enter in a more disparaging name such as "Phony Cheats", "Fakey Fakerson", "Smarty Pants", "Imposter", or "Wannabe".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JobSimulator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JobSimulator">Job Simulator</a></em>, there's a copy machine that duplicates whatever you put on it. For example, if you put a stapler on it, you get a fully functional stapler. So what happens when you physically put your face on it? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">You get a brain.</span>
<ul><li> You can also put money in the copy machine, which results in poorly-made counterfeit money with "nice try" written on the back.

(Consigliere investigating fellow mafia members, this cannot happen.) It also has achievements for actions that are <em>highly</em> improbable but can only happen under a transporter or witch screwing with the targets, such as a framer framing themselves, a janitor cleaning their own dead body, or a killing role attacking themselves.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Event0" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Event0">Event[0]</a></em> had a notable amount of work put into programming the dialogue for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialIntelligence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialIntelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a> character Kaizen. Since the player's only method of interacting with the world is through interfacing with Kaizen, the game needs to be able to recognize a large amount of possible inputs and respond in a way consistent with his current in-game mood. This results in thousands of possible lines of dialogue, as well as a system to switch up some phrases to sound less pre-programmed and more like a natural conversation. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCJw4hQkPj4">This video<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (warning: some spoilers) goes more in-depth.

In the end, when Orbulon plans to take over the ship, an Alien Bunny replies "Shucks!" and drops Orbulon back onto the Oinker. The default amount is four. But, were you to lose a life and then clear the stage for the first time, then the Alien Bunny who pulls the switch is the one closest to it.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioWare">WarioWare</a> Gold</em>, the microgame hosts have special responses for different circumstances: clearing 15 microgames in a row with no mistakes, clearing a microgame at the last second, failing a microgame three times in a row, failing a microgame by not doing anything, etc..

<ul><li> The <em>Mario Party 8</em> Challenge minigame "Fruit Picker" requires the player to memorize five fruit symbols on a wheel, which then turns, and pick out one to three of the symbols. If the player pauses or presses the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii">Wii</a>'s Home Menu button, the symbols disappear until they unpause to prevent players from cheating by writing the symbols down.
</li><li> The <em>Super Mario Party</em> minigame "Rhythm and Bruise" involves whacking plastic Monty Moles with a hammer in time to the music. If you play as Monty Mole, he'll be visibly sweating.
</li><li> Also in <em>Super Mario Party,</em> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUapH1VC3CI">if you play as Bowser and land on a Bad Luck Space,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Kamek will cower and apologize profusely.

<ul><li> Items that have an effect that can be activated will also have a cooldown time associated with this effect. Selling the item while its effect is on cooldown and then buying it again immediately will return you the item back at the start of its cooldown period again. A similar trick ensures that the Keystone rune Unsealed Spellbook can't be used to do away with summoner spell cooldowns if you use the rune twice in quick succession &#151; replacing a spell on cooldown for a new one will cause the new spell to still be on the same cooldown time as the old one was. Additionally, if you are waiting to respawn and buy Redemption, the only item that can be activated while dead, it will start on a cooldown equal to your respawn timer.
</li><li> Some champions have reaction quotes to buying certain items. Occasionally this includes items that are thematically fitting for the character but that would never actually be useful in gameplay, such as Karthus buying Athene's Unholy Grail (an item whose best perk is when you heal or shield an ally, which Karthus is incapable of doing<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5kzax');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5kzax" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5kzax');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Summoner spell Heal aside</span>).

</li><li> When Djimmi the Great is scanning you during his fourth phase, he will summon a tiny Cuphead puppet if you're shrunken during the process. This puppet does <em>not</em> get its own phase, instead attacking alongside giant Djimmi for the next and final phase.
</li><li> In Sally Stageplay's fight, there is an angel that you can jump on in Phase 1, which causes a buttress to fall in the background. If the husband in the background is in front of the priest when this happens, he will get killed, which ends Phase 1 immediately and causes some changes in the fight. For one, the nursery in Phase 2 will become a nunnery instead, and instead of babies, it spawns nuns who throw rulers at you. Also, in Phase 3, the husband will appear once again, this time as a god in Heaven.

You may remember that there's a urination mechanic in this game. It works on BTs; yes you can fight ghosts by pissing on them.
</li><li> While transporting, you can come across hot springs that you can use to bathe. If you do it while transporting <em>human</em> cargo, the person you're transporting will join you in the hot spring and later give you extra Likes.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em> is starting to work its way there. More recent missions have had numerous failure conditions and alternate methods of accomplishing goals. In the Romulan series, for example, there are several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DialogueTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DialogueTree">Dialogue Trees</a>, with new options opening up depending on the character's diplomacy level and several sections where a violent character could blast through without even talking at all. There are numerous points, even in the earlier missions, where a sufficiently sneaky character can approach enemy soldiers and eavesdrop on them to learn potentially useful information ahead of time, which they wouldn't have heard otherwise.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> Back in the days before the Cataclysm expansion pack was released, if you went through a demon-infested gorge, jumping in exactly the right places and using a since-patched glitch known as wall-walking (which was literally jumping up a normally untraversable wall or terrain in a very precise manner to trick the game into thinking you've grabbed a foothold), you could enter the then-uncompleted Mount Hyjal. When you got there, you found a zone that was actually fairly fleshed out, including the skeleton of Archimonde. The actual note that merits this entry: construction signs telling you that you weren't supposed to be here and better get out, and you would receive a debuff called "No Man's Land" that instantly teleported you out even if you somehow manage to enter it. There were even rumors that you would be <em>automatically reported</em> to a GM upon receiving the debuff, as the player would have had to deliberately and willingly break the rules of the game by using an exploit several times to get there.
</li><li> Also, when water walking didn't apply to mounted people and it was nigh impossible to get to it, an island to the south-east end of Kalimdor had a message in a bottle with, basically, "How did you get here?!"
</li><li> If you make a rude gesture at Mountaineer Pebblebitty (which you are likely to do, considering what she puts you through), she has an appropriate response ready.
</li><li> Most city guards will react to emotes, /rude them, they respond in kind, salute them, they salute back, etc. etc. Also, flex your muscles at them. They are not impressed.
</li><li> The <em>Mists of Pandaria</em> quest "Li Li's Day Off" requires you to take your NPC follower (a kid up for some sightseeing) to three predetermined places she wants to visit. However, you can take her around on a tour through the entire Valley of the Four Winds zone first, which, while not required by quest objectives, will make her comment something about every place you visit. She's very much a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleMissSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleMissSnarker">Little Miss Snarker</a>, so taking the full tour with her is worthwhile at least once.
</li><li> The Dominance Offensive storyline for the Horde in patch 5.1 makes you constantly travel to various locations, mostly by asking the indigenous Tak-Tak to give you a kite ride. However, one piece of the long quest chain asks you to travel to Silvermoon City, which is on another continent, and to boot, about the farthest from Pandaria that you can get. The quest designers expect you to take the portal; if you speak to Tak-Tak instead, he says, "I ain't flyin' a kite to Silvermoon City! <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellPlayer">You crazy?</a>" You get a similar retort Alliance-side if you ask to take a kite from the Alliance base in Krasarang to Darnassus (which is about the same distance away as Silvermoon is from the Horde base).
</li><li> Rogues who had completed a questline Wrathion gave them will be acknowledged by Wrathion when they talk to him in <em>Mists of Pandaria</em>.
</li><li> In the Well of Eternity dungeon, where you go back in time 10,000 years, players who looted the Warglaives of Azzinoth from Illidan will be noticed by his past self. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme">"You seem prepared."</a>
</li><li> Wielding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryOnlineContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryOnlineContent">now-unobtainable</a> Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian while fighting Shade of Aran in Karazhan will prompt him to yell "Where did you get that?! Did HE send you??". This is a reference to Atiesh's original wielder being Aran's son, with whom he had a... rather strained relationship.
</li><li> Archdruid Glaidalis in Darkheart Thicket has a unique voice line if there are any druids in the dungeon group. He even has different voice lines depending on the spec of the druids in the group.
</li><li> Many other NPCs act differently around various classes. If, for example, you do the Stormheim questline as a Fury Warrior, Helya will recognize you from the quest in which you get the Twinswords of the Valarjar from her.
</li><li> More for druids: their exclusive class area features dream portals that druids can use to teleport to several locations on Azeroth, many of them marked by a Great Tree that is important to green dragons. You may find that one of the portals is shut &#151; a much, <em>much</em> earlier questline in Feralas deals with sealing that zone's dream portal to prevent Nightmare corruption from pouring through it. A druid who had completed that quest will find that their seal still stands, and they may break it if they want use of the portal.
</li><li> Vanilla raid boss Nefarian had a special ability to screw over each class (switching warrior stances, messing with shaman totems, etc) and an accompanying quote. Each time a new class has been added, he's been given a new quote to address them with.
</li><li> One mandatory questline for <em>Legion</em>'s order hall campaign requires you to liberate Exodar from the Burning Legion attack. Your order champions will join you in the fight against Rakeesh... but if they are out on a mission, they won't join you. Fortunately Velen is powerful enough that you don't need their help.
</li><li> At the start of <em>Mists of Pandaria</em> content, Horde players get a letter from General Nazgrim ordering them to report for duty. If the player completed the Vashj'ir storyline, the letter addresses them by name, recalls the time Nazgrim (then a Legionnaire) fought alongside the player against the naga, and is overall more friendly and personal in tone.
</li><li> One of the starting Death Knight quests requires you to kill a member of the Argent Dawn who belongs to your own race. The character will recognize you and say something about your past. What makes this a case of Developer's Foresight is that if you start a Worgen or Goblin Death Knight, two races that joined the Alliance/Horde after the events of <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em>, you'll belong to a different faction than the regular members of that race. Worgen Death Knights are former servants of Archmage Arugal as opposed to being residents of Gilneas City, and Goblin Death Knights originally belonged to the Steamweadle Cartel and don't fall in with Bilgewater until after joining the Horde.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarhammerOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarhammerOnline">Warhammer Online</a></em>, the devs watched alpha testers get to some pretty strange places, and rather than fixing it, they either added kegs of dynamite to blow yourself up, so you can respawn where you are meant to, or by adding high-level boss characters you can fight if you can get an entire party to that spot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em>:
<ul><li> A magic shop keeper gives out free Mind Runes and Air Runes every five minutes or so. Trying to sell the freebies back to him will net you a sarcastic "Thanks for returning the samples!".
</li><li> After "The Blood Pact", Xenia remarks that she'd like to see the necromancer's ceremonial mask. Reassembling the mask, putting it on, and talking to her with it results in her telling you that you look stupid.
</li><li> The prince/princess of Miscellania that you court will respond to various emote actions; the "Blow Kiss" emote is the only one required to court them, but they will react appropriately to dancing or threats.
</li><li> Another NPC who reacts to emotes is Sir Tiffy in Falador. Saluting to him is required for one of the Falador achievements, but you can give him the "Goblin Salute" from the cave goblin quests instead, and he'll remark on it.
</li><li> There are an awful lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nods</a> to which quests you have or have not completed, in dialogue or in subsequent quests.
</li><li> At the beginning of "The Death of Chivalry", you have an encounter with Saradomin. He remembers your participation in the "Battle of Lumbridge" world event from 2013, and which side you were on. If you did not participate, he concludes you are one of the Godless and treats you with suspicion.
</li><li> If you complete "The Death of Chivalry" (a 6th Age quest) before "While Guthix Sleeps" (a 5th Age quest), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalParadox">you can use the Black Knight Captain armor from the former as a disguise to infiltrate a Black Knight base in the latter</a>. This includes the Black Knight Captain cosmetic override.
</li><li> The "Crackling" perk from Invention has a 5% chance per rank of inflicting extra damage to your enemies. It doesn't work on higher-tier vampyres, because their only weakness is blisterwood, and blisterwood weapons can't be augmented with perks.
</li><li> There was a glitch where it was possible to enter the Draynor Bank Robbery cutscene and pick up the Blue partyhat that would drop. This partyhat actually has a different Item ID than the regular Blue partyhat and is untradeable. If the player attempted to equip it, it would disappear and a message in the chatbox would say, "Please send in a bug report and tell Jagex how you got that hat."
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game has special messages for certain things that can only be obtained through exploits, such as finding plurals for unique items (Ex. The plural for Emblem of Ak'gyxoth, an item rewarded to the very first person who summoned Ak'gyxoth, is literally "Emblems of Ak'gyxoth, you dirty exploiter"), or trying to do unclickable actions via HTTP links (Ex. Attempting to use a Comfy Sofa without owning one will result in you in falling to the floor and taking damage). Hot stuffing, an item that can only be crafted by using a JavaScript command, is listed in the Discoveries section under the "Dirty Exploits" category.
</li><li> At one point during the Sauceror's Nemesis Quest, they create a potion that turns them into a slime, allowing them to infiltrate the slime convention. You can't use skills and are treated as though you don't wear any equipment. So, totally useless. Now, there is a bonus dungeon inhabited by other slimes called the Slime Tube. It is a rather high-level zone, usually reserved for Aftercore. so, if you go into this tough area in that useless form, you get an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a>.
</li><li> The Zombie Master class's playthrough focuses on attacking enemies and eating their brains. There is exactly one regular monster that will never drop a brain &mdash; a mummy (a type of zombie that had their brains taken out during preperation).
</li><li> During the Naughty Sorceress quest, you eventually come across a door that can be opened by any key, the contents of the door changing to reflect what key you used. Normally, you're supposed to use 6 keys that many would not have if they rushed through the game without exploring (e.g. many players had no idea the 8-bit realm existed and therefore never knew the existence of the digital key). That's not this trope. What is however, is if you decide to insert a balloon mon<em>key</em>... You literally get an <a class="urllink" href="http://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Easter_egg_balloon">easter egg balloon.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> A Chefstaff is a stick that does piddly squat physical damage, but grants immense bonuses to spell damage. If you attempt to club enemies with one, you'll discover they have five unique attack messages specially prepared for just such a case, three of which berate the player for not using an all powerful staff for its intended purpose. One of these five messages however, "You pretend your enemy is a pinata, sadly your beating doesn't dislodge any candy, but it does do X damage." will change into "You're holding a large stick. You're fighting a pinata. You let nature take it's course for X damage." if you actually are fighting the one pinata monster found in the game.

<ul><li> If you use the point emote to dramatically point at Crota during your battle with him, he notices and angrily points back.
</li><li> If you hide from Skolas instead of fighting during your battle with him in the Prison of Elders, he'll make various comments in Fallen language such as getting annoyed at you for hiding or thinking that you've run out of ammo.
</li><li> Headshots are massively effective on all enemies <em>except</em> Vex; since their brains/cores are in their torsos, they'll keep fighting even if you completely blow their heads off.
</li><li> Going into the legendary "Loot Cave," a cave in the Cosmodrome where, if players stood in the right spot, they could endlessly shoot Hive troops until they dropped legendary engrams, which could be decrypted by Master Rahool in the Tower. In later versions of the game, the cave leads to a pile of Hive bones that can be activated, triggering a voice that says "A million deaths is not enough for Master Rahool!"
</li><li> In the Iron Temple, you can attempt to climb Felwinter Peak by jumping up cliffs in order to find a hidden SIVA cluster. There&#146;s no incentive to do so, but you can climb all the way up to the summit of the mountain, well past the cluster; this area serves no real gameplay purpose, but it&#146;s all rendered anyways.

<ul><li> There&#146;s a remarkable amount of dialogue that changes based on whether or not you played the first game and/or transferred your Guardian to the second. If you didn&#146;t, your Guardian in the second game is explicitly shown to <em>not</em> be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyKnownByTheirNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyKnownByTheirNickname">the Young Wolf</a> from the first game, but a new Guardian who was only recently resurrected; your Ghost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityLockOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityLockOut">won&#146;t know what Warminds and Taken are</a>, there&#146;s a lot more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsYouKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsYouKnow">expository dialogue for the benefit of new players</a>, certain characters like Lord Shaxx won&#146;t know you right away, and so on.
</li><li> In one adventure you lure some Red Legion mooks into an ambush by impersonating the Fallen and mocking their commander. The taunts your Ghost uses change depending on whether you&#146;ve done the main campaign yet; either he insinuates that Dominus Ghaul is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Dirty Coward</a>, or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakIllOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakIllOfTheDead">he makes fun of Ghaul for getting killed by the Guardians</a> despite having taken the City.</span>
</li><li> Doing enough public events (or doing the same public event enough times) on a planet will result in new starting dialogue between your Ghost and the planetary vendor, lampshading your grinding/farming.
</li><li> In the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">new Tower</span>, there&#146;s a sign listing the number of days without accidents, followed by a random number.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts">Psychonauts</a></em>:
<ul><li> At one point, you have to go into the minds of a few people to assemble a disguise to trick the warden. A lazy or creative player might think that just jumping into the warden's mind would be quicker. The game will let you try it, but all you'll get is an amusing note explaining that the warden is protected against psychic interference. Similarly, if you try to jump into any of your fellow campers' heads, you'll get a notice saying that the mind-jumping device won't work on minors.
</li><li> In the normal course of gameplay, after saving the turtle Mr. Pokeylope, you carry him for about <strong>30 seconds</strong> before losing him forever. If you decide to take Mr. Pokeylope to camp after saving him, every camper reacts to him in different ways, mostly involving how adorable he is. The PC version on Steam even made showing him to <em>all</em> the campers unlock an achievement.
</li><li> In fact, just about <em>every</em> NPC has unique dialogue for every item you can possibly present to them. This is especially notable with Boyd, whose mental world revolves almost entirely around held items (none of which you're ever told to show him, by the way).
</li><li> One particularly amusing example: Using the "Rose" item from Black Velvetopia on the dog painters will make them tell you to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance">Go find someone your own species.</a>"
</li><li> The Lungfish Call item makes a "specific" sound. Using it near Dr. Loboto has him tell Sheegor to "go outside if [she's] going to do that."
</li><li> Some of the best responses to the Confusion attack show up in Fred's mind, which is cleared of its inhabitants by the time you're technically supposed to be able to get Confusion.
</li><li> Using cheats early in the game allows you to use powers that you're not supposed to have yet on characters that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">might not be around at the time you're actually supposed to have the powers</span>. Using cheats in this way often results in amusing dialog that you wouldn't hear if you played through the game normally. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Using confusion on the G-Men is particularly hilarious. "Oh my God, why am I holding a gun?!"</span>
</li><li> Clairvoyance allows you to see through someone else's eyes, specifically permitting you to see the world as they do. Each and every single character in the entire game, <em>including every single enemy type and random animal just hanging around</em>, sees you differently. Seagulls see you as a cat, Censors (basic enemies) see you as a virus, your love interest sees you as a dashing prince, etc.
</li><li> Much like with the warden, if you just try to steal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteDwarfStarlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteDwarfStarlet">Gloria's</a> award with invisibility or telekinesis instead of going into her mind, you get unique scenes where she thinks the thing is going off on its own and won't let it leave anyway.
</li><li> Each line of dialogue from every character is properly lip-synched in the character models, no matter how incidental.

</div><ul><li> Those same in-game cheat codes will give Master Jiggywiggy unique dialogue if the player attempts to observe the Altar of Knowledge near the level, which usually results in him telling you how many more Jiggies you need, giving you the option to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">teleport back to his temple</a>, or state he already opened the door for you.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jiggywiggy:</strong> Oh! That's strange... it would appear that some other force has opened this door!
</div></li><li> In Grunty Industries, there is a seemingly-useless Shock Jump Pad in the Quality Control Room. The pad is in the part of the room where you collect the Jiggy, which you're intended to access while transformed into the washing machine. The designers probably added the pad in case you Leg Springed or glided over the barrier as Kazooie alone. However, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/BikdipOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/BikdipOnABus">Bikdip on a Bus</a> points out in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsPlay">Let's Play</a> of the game, if you performed a Leg Spring to get in, you could easily do another one to get out, so the pad actually <em>is</em> completely pointless.
</li><li> The first time you rescue a Jinjo, it will ask you to look out for the remaining members of its family. However, if the very first Jinjo you rescue is the sole white one, he will have unique dialogue, basically telling you to reunite the other Jinjo families.
</li><li> There is a Grip Grab ledge that leads from Jinjo Village to the Wooded Hollow. Many gamers doubt its use, but with Bottles' House being permanently locked after beating Tower of Tragedy, if one didn't activate any of the silos from the Wooded Hollow or beyond, they would be unable to access those areas without that.
</li><li> It is also possible to use a Beak Bust-related glitch to get onto the platform to the Plateau in the Wooded Hollow; presumably because of this, there is an invisible wall near the door to the Plateau. However, it is still possible to bypass the wall by glitching onto the area near the broken staircase.
</li><li> While the Wonderwing will prevent you from taking damage when you enter terrain populated by a Dragunda, he will still spit you out.

</li><li> Similarly, all the bosses are just regular enemies grown to large size by Kamek's magic. One of them, Naval Piranha, can actually be killed before the boss battle if you <em>very carefully edge close enough</em> to see her but not close enough to trigger the cutscene. If you kill her first, Kamek flies in, panics, and retreats, and you avoid the entire battle. You can do the exact same thing in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisWoollyWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisWoollyWorld">Yoshi's Woolly World</a></em> to get similar dialogue, but in that game, Piranha Plants are not killed instantly when hit by yarn balls, so you'll still have to do the fight.

To do this, the player must have their Skylander in the boss's sights, and the boss will follow you if you walk around. Two Skylanders (Stink Bomb and Stealth Elf) have abilities that let them turn invisible. If you are in the boss's sights and turn invisible, then the boss will not follow you around.

Goomboss is an early example. In addition, Eyerok's boss arena is slightly altered: the developers added a fire for Yoshi to eat in case one goes out of their way to get Yoshi to fight Eyerok.

Because of this, you can still enter the 8-bit pipes in the northern region of the map, even though there's no need to.

It's possible to move Sonic to the left of the screen after hitting the Capsule before the end-of-level points tally shows up (and Sonic does his victory pose). If you do that, then Sonic will jump over the Capsule in the cutscene, rather than getting stuck or clipping straight through it.

If you attempt this in the final battle, you'll still take the hit, but Bowser will actually grab you and throw you back.

You can only carry 30,000 coins per level, so even with exploitative methods to gather coins, getting to ten-million-minus-one will take an extremely long time.

This means the team you decided on and the ability you kept throughout the fight will differ; you can go with the usual normal Kirby and three allies or discard all or all but one or two allies during the final phase of the fight and the cutscene will change. For example, going to the final boss with Sword Kirby and discarding all allies except for Rick &amp; Kine &amp; Coo during the final phase will cause the ending cutscene to have Kirby keep the Sword ability and Rick will be shown. They even made <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4cUZm4k0Dw&amp;t=22m46s">a version of the final cutscene<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that has no abilities or allies.

From there you can see one of the later planets in the level out in the distance. And, if you use Cloud Mario's platforms then long jump and keep holding forward on the control stick, you can jump straight to it, skipping an entire landmass of the level. To reiterate: this shortcut requires you to think leaping into <em>the void of space</em> is a good idea.

By placing a trip mine in the right place, it is possible to interrupt the cutscene and have the enemy who kills him blown up instead.

This makes a <em>massive</em> number of items function totally different for him, and the team didn't shy on making sure everything worked. A full list can be read <a class="urllink" href="https://bindingofisaacrebirth.gamepedia.com/The_Forgotten#Item_Interactions">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, but these are a few highlights:
<ul><li> Dr. Fetus replaces his boomerang bone with a thrown bomb, which can be cooked by holding it (something the actual Dr. Fetus can't do) but will explode in your face if you charge it too long.
</li><li> Epic Fetus normally replaces your tears with a missile strike. Charging the shot will do the missile strike as normal but comes with a totally unique animation: The Forgotten holds the missile while you're charging, and tosses it in the air then whacks it with his club when you fire, sending it in an arch instead of the normal straight down. It's totally cosmetic, but amazing to see.
</li><li> Ludovico Technique makes a huge tear follow The Forgotten like a familiar. Instead of controlling it directly, you can hit the tear with a melee attack to launch it. It essentially combines the functions of both the bone and the original item without losing either (albeit this Ludo is a lot harder to aim).
</li><li> Mom's Knife is attached to the end of his bone club, turning it into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterScythe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterScythe">Sinister Scythe</a> that deals bonus damage, has more range, and can hit the same enemy twice on one attack. This is functionally a completely different item, which typically replaces your tears with a piercing thrown knife.
</li><li> Lost Contact normally lets you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheBullet">Shoot the Bullet</a>. The Forgotten instead gains an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector">Attack Reflector</a> on his melee hits, not only nullifying shots in an arch, but also launching them back at his enemies.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetsOfRogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetsOfRogue">Streets of Rogue</a></em>'s tutorial covers all its bases.
<ul><li> Punch the door down instead of opening it like you're instructed to? The Resistance Leader responds in amazement.
</li><li> Kill the shopkeeper you're supposed to purchase a key from? His corpse will drop the key, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">the Resistance Leader responds appropriately.</a>
</li><li> Kill the friendly bouncer who serves as the tutorial's living punching bag instead of tranquilizing him? The leader's suitably annoyed.
</li><li> Try to tranquilize the leader instead? He's wearing protective thermal underwear, you see.
</li><li> Throw a rock at the leader after he just made you walk through an explosive tripwire? Admits he probably deserved that.
</li><li> Purposely throw all your rocks away such that you can't safely disarm the second explosive tripwire from a distance? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">He asks if you're trying to break the tutorial or something.</a>
</li><li> Smart enough to step away from the generator that's clearly about to explode? He's disappointed that you're not a total schmuck.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hades">Hades</a></em> has a ton of situational dialogue that's only seen in very specific situations, such as having the Yarn of Ariadne on-hand when encountering its previous owner Theseus, or if your first encounter with Asterius is before the dual boss at the end of Elysium.

However, it's possible to go to the dungeon, clear it and obtain the tear before talking to Red (with no in-game indication that this is an option). If you do, a cutscene will play after you leave Red's shack where Yangus admits to Trode that he played up his response. Knowing Red as well as he does, Yangus knows if she found out that the party already got the tear, she'd just send them after something else.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunTheLostAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunTheLostAge">Golden Sun: The Lost Age</a></em>, after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">lighting the Mars Lighthouse</span>, the player controls Felix only, which means that the psynergy 'Mind Read' shouldn't be usable. With the help of ROMs and cheat codes, it can be given to Felix. Using Felix's newfound ability in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Prox</span> results in new information in the mind reading dialogue boxes the developers put Mind Read text in normally non-mindreadable characters. Not just text, which would just be there to prevent the game crashing over an impossible action, but <em>plot hooks</em>.
</li><li> Atop Jupiter Lighthouse prior to its lighting, Agatio and Karst also have Mind Read text, though Sheba isn't in the party at that time, either. Both are thinking that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">Felix has outlived his usefulness</a>, foreshadowing the upcoming boss battle. Agatio's thought bubble <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">contains a typo</a>.
</li><li> It does this quite a bit. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun2001" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun2001">Golden Sun (2001)</a></em>, if you enter Altin Mines without the Force Psynergy needed to cause a path-opening rockslide, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Garet will get frustrated and kick a wall</span>, causing the rockslide. In fact, the Force Orb's absence in <em>The Lost Age</em> if a file from the first game is not imported implies that this is either the default scenario, or the developers knew that otherwise people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">would be asking how Isaac's team completed the first game in a non-import file.</a>.
</li><li> It's possible to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking">go to Imil before Kolima</a> in the first game. If Mia's in your party when you trigger the Kolima cutscenes, the game has extra dialogue so she'll get lines, and it's rumored (though not proven) that Tret's boss fight gets a difficulty boost to account for your larger party and higher level.
</li><li> If you set Flint to Ivan while he's briefly in your party at Vault, he will apologize and give Flint back when he leaves. This just <em>happens</em> to keep him from being in another class in a later cutscene when he rejoins and uses a power exclusive to his base class.
</li><li> It's been discovered that you can glitch-exploit Retreat to skip the part of the game where Mia joins the party. In doing so, you also skip the only part of the game where Mia's unique Ply power is required for puzzles. A boss later in the game provides an artifact that lets other characters use Frost, so you can solve Frost puzzles without her, keeping the game from being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake">Unwinnable by Mistake</a> without her.
<ul><li> Using the same glitch in another location lets you access the other Djinni in Mercury Lighthouse, so <em>you can still get 100% completion</em> in <em>The Lost Age</em> (finishing the first game with 27, transferring data to TLA, and using the spawn point in TLA for the Djinni Mia would have normally given you).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>The Lost Age</em>, if you give the Lash Pebble to Piers and you go to Lemuria, when Piers will leave the party you will need to Lash once to enter the house of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lunpa</span>. However, if you can't use Lash, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lunpa</span> will insult you and throw down a rope instead, preventing you from getting stuck. <em>This is the only use of the "rope throwing" animation in the game.</em>
</li><li> In <em>The Lost Age</em>, replying "No" to everything eventually results in Kraden throwing a tantrum and accusing Felix of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">thinking this is all just a game</a>.
</li><li> When in speaking roles, Djinn tend to have increasingly-amusing responses to being continually denied, and a character in the first game will complain if you change your mind repeatedly in one cutscene and cause the conversation to loop.
</li><li> In <em>Dark Dawn</em>, you can use Slap Psynergy to ring the emergency gong in Tonfon, sending the city into a panic, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">blame the nearby guard for the false alarm</a>.
</li><li> In <em>Dark Dawn</em>, you cannot name your character any name that belongs to another player character or plot-relevant NPC <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelRevolvingDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelRevolvingDoor">Alex)</a></span>. This has not been confirmed for the other two games.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlphaProtocol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlphaProtocol">Alpha Protocol</a></em>'s story progression runs on this. At first, it just seems like little things, like characters calling you out on wearing ridiculous sunglasses or if you're wearing cammies in a public place where it would be better to wear civvies and blend in. Your character sheet even comes into play. The simplest example being an instance where Mike decrypts some encoded files he's swiped on a mission, unless you haven't put any points into the tech skill. In that case Mike is computer-illiterate and his handler handles the files instead. Multiple playthroughs will reveal just how far-reaching your little decisions are; every choice has a consequence, even dialog options that seemingly do nothing but influence whether or not someone likes you, because different reputations with different NPCs always have different, tangible results. Many players assume that the game is somehow unfinished or that, at least, the writing is sloppy because they lost track of a character and never saw them again. In fact, the choices they made allowed the character in question to become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Karma Houdini</a>, but different choices would've ended in that character being more important and getting an on-screen resolution (of which there are many possibilities, ranging from friendship to backup to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a> to execution.) The drawback to this complexity is that if you want to rig the game for a certain, preferred outcome, you're probably going to have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">consult a FAQ</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InazumaEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InazumaEleven">Inazuma Eleven</a></em> series shows plenty of signs of this:
<ul><li> <em>Inazuma Eleven 3</em>, and possibly previous games in the series, have a special shoot animation which is only played if the defending team has no available players (not even the goalkeeper) anywhere near the path from the ball/kicker to the goal. Odds are you can complete the entire game without this situation ever coming up, because the goalkeepers' AI isn't stupid.
</li><li> <em>Inazuma Eleven GO</em> adds two more animations that only occur in highly improbable situations, where a player <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">with an Avatar active</a> either (a) fails to steal the ball from or (b) gets the ball stolen from them, by a player without an active avatar without using a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialAttack">hissatsu technique</a>. Both of these are nearly (but not completely) impossible to pull off.
</li><li> The Wii version also possesses animations for scoring an own goal (basically almost impossible to do by accident).
</li><li> Every player who's about to use a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialAttack">hissatsu technique</a> will use an individual grant to signal their intentions. Some even have alternate ones for very specific situations, such as Hiroto using a shoot hissatsu when Endou is the opposite team's goalkeeper. Not only does every character has their own voice lines for scoring (even those who will most likely never play offense, like the keepers), but also voice lines for shooting, goalkeeping, defending AND dribbling, even if they don't possess any hissatsu in that particular skill. Too bad the same can't be said for the announcer...
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecretOfMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecretOfMana">Secret of Mana</a></em>, there is a boss fight that is essentially a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroEffortBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroEffortBoss">Zero-Effort Boss</a>. However, if the player is wiped out in this fight (you do have to try to lose), the party is just kicked out of the area with Randi being revived.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Indivisible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Indivisible">Indivisible</a></em>: During the game's third act Ajna returns to Ashwat village. You are meant to go through the level again up until the area Dhar's soldiers captured her. You discover a Chakra gate and are supposed to use it to backtrack to the previous areas. But if you decide to go forward you discover you can actually walk to Tai Krung and enter the lower levels in reverse. The game acts as though you went to Tai Krung first. Ajna questions if she's going the right way once you run into Tai Krung's last roadblock before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Naga Rider</a> sneaks up on and joins her. You unlock the Maha Haruka dash, and can clear Tai Krung's objective from that point.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI">Kingdom Hearts</a></em>: Multiple:
<ul><li> If you complete Hollow Bastion before completing Monstro, Riku only says one thing in any of the cutscenes and does not help you during the first Parasite Cage fight. Riku only speaks one line before the second Parasite Cage fight, mocking Sora for not remembering his best friend. Sora calls him a liar, saying he's not the real Riku.
</li><li> Similarly, it is possible to actually leave a few worlds before beating the bosses there - if you return, they get stronger (presumably because they've absorbed more power from the world), and any scenes with Maleficent will not play (since she's long since left for the next world on her list).
</li><li> If one goes to Wonderland, leaves, then completes Deep Jungle first, the scene that normally shows Alice wandering into Hollow Bastion will instead show Snow White.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Kingdom Hearts II</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Cavern of Remembrance in <em>Final Mix</em> is split up into several platforming areas that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbilityRequiredToProceed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbilityRequiredToProceed">require maxed out Growth abilities to proceed</a>, with the last of these areas necessitating Glide (obtained from leveling up Final Form). If the player cheats to get Glide before beating Roxas (the trigger that allows access to Final Form) and goes to the end of the Glide room, they will find an invisible wall that prevents passage into the last part of the Cavern until Roxas is defeated.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower">Final Form, which is normally unobtainable until the last world of the game</a>, has a unique ability that changes how several spells work. Despite the fact it is normally impossible to have low level forms of various spells (such as the first level of Blizzard or Fire), these are still coded to have unique animations and altered functions if Final Form is cheated or glitched in earlier in the game.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII">Kingdom Hearts III</a></em> did this in a meta way. The game was set to be released on January 29, 2019, but a few copies were stolen from a shipment of games a month early, and spoilers were posted through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContentLeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContentLeak">Content Leak</a>. However, the leakers couldn't tell anyone what the ending was, because it wasn't on the disk; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle">Final Battle</a> and ending were added in a day-one patch, so even if the game got released early, the ending couldn't be spoiled.
<ul><li> The game over screen for most bosses will simply show Sora hovering lifelessly above the ground. However, if defeated by Ansem, his heart is also seen floating above him. Since he is the only Heartless among the Organization, this is consistent with other instances of Heartless enemies causing a game over.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastSovereign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastSovereign">The Last Sovereign</a></em>: Sierra Lee apparently knew, or guessed, that people would unencrypt the game to data-mine potential spoilers; as such, in place of Ivala's portrait, she put the Dramatic Chipmunk clip.

However, he doesn't drop the key when killed. Instead, it's found in a trunk in his bedroom, meaning that it's possible to get it without killing him. If you do so, then the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s dialogue will change to acknowledge this.

Said tutorial does not feature any monsters, and the only NPCs are shopkeepers with whom the player cannot make physical contact outside cheating. There is virtually no way to actually die from losing health in the Tutorial, unless you a.) repeatedly run into a wall until it grinds at your health, or b.) get especially lucky with a <em>hidden</em> spell that <em>might</em> summon a monster. And even then, you will <em>not</em> die in the Tutorial should your health hit 0 &#151; the game will just say that you would have died under normal circumstances, and reset your health bar to full.
<ul><li> There's a hidden spell that can be used to summon a ship any time the player is facing water. However, said spell will not work in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstTown">Castle Hall</a>, because doing so in the right place would allow access to a very powerful weapon early on in the game.

In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue">Playable Epilogue</a>, if you get the bike out of storage (because, guaranteed, that's where you put it), and go riding around in the swamp, a unique sound will play when you pedal through the marshes that can't be heard anywhere else in the game.
</li><li> The Deep Darkness swamp lacks any light source, making the whole area pitch black. You need the Hawk's Eye in order to see, but a persistent player or those who have a map guide can feel their way around in the dark. The way to the Tenda Village is blocked by an invisible wall that you can't get around, but it disappears once you use the Hawk's Eye.
</li><li> The game also has several NPCs that say things based on who is in your party. For example, Paula's friends and father react with relief and joy once they see that you have rescued her. If Paula is unconscious, the NPCs will instead wonder where she is and Paula's father will react with disappointment when he thinks he sensed Paula's presence and sees that she's not there.

His disguise depends on where you fight him, and the demon(s) he summons depends on how many times you've encountered him so far. His dialogue will always match his current disguise-demon combination, even unlikely combinations, such as encountering him for the first time in his "Intuitive Man" disguise (which he wears in the final dungeons). What's more, every single one of his lines is <em>fully-voiced.</em> A comprehensive dump of his dialogue can be found <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/672441-shin-megami-tensei-iv/69379037">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> The skill Estoma Sword normally stops all encounters on the World Map and also banishes enemies that you strike with your weapon in a dungeon if their level is lower than the player character's level.

One section has her explain how to grab items from across crevices; it's possible to snag the key without approaching close enough to trigger the tutorial scene, which leads to Tia commenting on how Maxim already knew how her Hook Shot works. A later scene requires Tia to grab a box you passed by earlier in order to reach a higher ledge. If you threw the box away from its initial position, Tia will tell Maxim to look, the camera will zoom in on its original place... and Maxim will comment that nothing is there. The game even acknowledges whether it was Maxim or Tia who moved the box.
</li><li> When you obtain the Legendary Sword from Soma Temple as a request from Parcelyte's president, you can choose to <em>sell the sword</em>. The obvious choice is Rochy since he pays the most, but there is unique dialogue for selling the sword in the Parcelyte guild shop or even in Tia's shop in Elcid.

If you beat him, you get his sword that has an 8-hit special move and the cutscene after the battle starts with Gades defeating your party with a lightning bolt.

If you begin grinding for experience the second Mallow joins you it is possible to get Psychopath far earlier than usual. Anticipating this, all the early bosses are programmed with Psychopath quotes. Even the enemies who appear before Mallow joins have Psychopath quotes, in case you find a way to hack him into the earlier levels.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario">Paper Mario</a></em>, it would theoretically be possible to skip two fights with Jr. Troopa, if you head back to Toad Town immediately after getting either the Super Boots or Sushi, then open up the shortcuts in the sewers to Boo's Mansion and Lavalava Island respectively, then just taking those back after completing the area. This works because Jr. Troopa ambushes you on the way back from those areas...or it would anyway, if the developers hadn't thought of this and instead had him ambush you if you go back at any point after getting either the boots or Sushi. Sorry, no skipping boss fights for you.

The creators realized this and, in the case of two bosses where plot important events occur in the middle of the fight (specifically, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the first fight with Doopliss and the first form of the Shadow Queen</span>), made it so that the bosses would heal a specific amount of HP if you manage to get their health to 0 before the event happens.

If the PC is female, then you have to do it, but if the PC is male, the Handmaiden will do it. If you are visibly Dark Sided and female, the PC will brainwash the Hutt to let her do it anyway. It's also possible to have recruited Visas Marr by this point, so naturally, a curious player may think to try bringing her (since the game will dismiss Kreia). Visas will outright refuse. Additionally, if you've recruited Mira by doing the planet's main quest first, you can dare her into doing it.

<ul><li> During the late-game "Rescue the Queen" quest, you set out to rescue Loghain's daughter, Anora, from a fortified estate. As you escape, you're besieged by Loghain's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">lieutenant</a>, Ser Cauthrien, and a large posse of knights at the front door to the estate. The situation is presented as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">Hopeless Boss Fight</a>, as your only apparent options are to either surrender (which sends you and your party to Fort Drakon, and requires another companion to help bust you out) or attempt to take on the massive number of enemies (which usually results in you being overwhelmed and knocked out). However, it is possible (though very, very difficult) to win this fight. Doing so nets you a powerful greatsword (the Summer Sword) early and skips the later confrontation with Cauthrien at the Landsmeet. Anora even gets a unique line later on where she mourns Ser Cauthrien, who she knew.
</li><li> When you return to Ostagar, a site of a great (and lost) battle against the Darkspawn, you pursue the enemy warlock to a place where, in an early cutscene, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook">Ogre</a> was slain by one of the heroes. Its corpse is still lying there, and the warlock animates it for you to fight as a <em>very</em> tough boss. Except that if you have a mage in your party, who specialises in Necromancy, you'll know that animated corpses are put to rest when the mage controlling them is killed. Hint: it works here. Kill the warlock, and the Ogre will crumble to dust.
</li><li> If you're creating a character with the Dwarven Commoner origin story and try to remove the facial brand that signifies that your character is casteless, the game will ask you to reconsider having one for roleplaying purposes. You don't have to have one, but in the game's universe, you do. Same goes for the Dalish Elf origin story, as their facial tattoos are given to them as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiteOfPassage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiteOfPassage">Rite of Passage</a> into adulthood.
</li><li> Every single NPC that refer to you as a group, such as saying "what can I help you people with" or "I heard there were travelers on the road", have alternate lines if you have no party members with you. In these instances they instead refer to you as alone and sometimes even comment on your race. For example, after being warmly greeted by the dalish, a dalish player will then be asked why they are traveling without their clan.
</li><li> The Redcliffe questline has a few different options for how you deal with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">possessed</a> Connor, some of which can become closed off depending on how you play. If you sided with the templars earlier the option to bring circle mages becomes closed off. If you killed Jowan he can't bring up the plan to confront the demon in the fade, but you can still get the idea from another mage in your party or bring it up yourself if you are a mage. If you somehow closed off <em>all</em> of the above options (sided with templars, drove off Morrigan, killed Wynne and Jowan, are not a mage yourself) confronting the demon will never be brought up and Teagan will point out that there simply are no other options but to kill Connor.
</li><li> The questline "The Trial of Crows" has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderInc">the Antivan Crows</a> giving you a list of targets to assassinate. It is entirely possible for you to have killed the first one before beginning the quest. If that is the case, you have dialogue along the lines of angrily calling them out on asking you to kill a dead person. Your "handler" is visibly surprised, but recovers and then moves on.
</li><li> After the Redcliffe arc, Teagan will send you on a quest to find the Urn of Sacred Ashes, a legendary artifact that can cure Arl Eamon. However, it's also possible to complete this quest by yourself by following leads/stumbling onto the right NPCs despite having no motivation to do so. If so, then the moment you're sent on the quest you can tell Teagan that you've already found the urn. He'll understandably be baffled that you've somehow already located the fantasy equivalent of The Ark of the Covenant in your spare time. Some of the dialogue in the questline will also be slightly different, as you and your party members will not bring up <em>why</em> they need the urn since they don't know that Arl Eamon is sick.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>, one of Aveline's gifts is the Shield of the Knight Herself. You get different dialogue when you give it to her depending on what you did with her starting shield, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicKeepsake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicKeepsake">belonged to her husband right up until he died ten minutes in</a>. If you put it in storage she'll complain about you passing it around, and if you sold it she'll mournfully comment about "utility over sentiment". If she for some reason still has the shield equipped - which by now should be outclassed by every other piece of equipment in the game - she'll note that she already has a shield and doesn't need a new one.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrialsOfMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrialsOfMana">Trials of Mana</a></em>: Multiple:
<ul><li> Very early in the game, every playable character except Charlotte is stuck in a town. While there, Angela can be seen asleep in the inn if she is not the main character. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPervert">Since Angela is implied to be naked in bed, she will get angry at you and call your character a pervert if you wake her up.</a> However, if the main character is Riesz &mdash; the only other female main character that could speak to Angela at that time &mdash; Angela will only express annoyance at being woken up. This extends to the remake where a cutscene plays out if a male character approaches Angela, but she sleeps through any attempt by Riesz to converse with her.
</li><li> The third party member is usually recruited via jailbreak. However, if the player selected Charlotte as the third party member, she joins in a predetermined location much earlier. Should this happen, one of the three possible party members not chosen by the player will be in the jail cell instead of Charlotte. The foresight comes from an extra scene where this character gets left behind when the heroes flee the town; if Duran is the character left behind in this manner, he'll berate the heroes for abandoning him when they meet Duran in the Molebear Moors much later.
</li><li> There is a hierarchy for certain cutscene reactions. For instance, when facing the Altenish mages in the Stoneslip Gap, they prioritize Angela first (the runaway princess who has a price on her head), then Duran (the Valsenan loyalist the Crimson Wizard encountered); if neither are present, they declare the party to be Valsenan spies and try to kill them anyway.
</li><li> When the party stays at an inn, they all shift into their respective "sleeping" animations. In normal gameplay, the only thing the player sees of these are the characters' heads peeking out from under the sheets of the beds. However, not only are the rest of the characters' bodies there, they're wearing underwear that changes color depending on the character's class. However, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averted</a> in the 2020 remake, as everyone sleeps with his/her clothes on in the cutscene.
</li><li> Should you have enough money, you can simply agree to the outrageous price quoted by Watts and buy the Nitromyte. If you do, the king will tell you about a shortcut to the boss room via a strange statue, which does nothing if you went through the dungeon in the normal way. You still get the Mana Spirit, but you'll <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBypass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBypass">skip the rest of the dungeon</a>. (In the 2020 remake, you get an achievement called "Throw Money at It" if you just buy the nitromyte, but you still have to chase after Watts.)
</li><li> In the original SNES release, the battle with Karl in Kevin's opening is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">Hopeless Boss Fight</a> that Kevin has to lose before transforming into a werewolf. In the 2020 remake, this could have potentially taken hours to clear, since Kevin's level carries over from previous playthroughs on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>. So the battle is just changed to Kevin's tutorial fight, and he now has to win.

<ul><li> Unlike many RPGs, your character&#146;s race and backstory actually has an impact on the plot and how other characters interact with you. For example, a Watcher from Old Valia can get angry with people badmouthing the region or display knowledge about it when it&#146;s brought up in conversation.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModularEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModularEpilogue">Modular Epilogue</a> takes a staggeringly large amount of details into account; what people you helped, what quests you did, whether you kept promises to the gods, what you said in random conversations, and so on. Most notably, if you leave the main quest in the &#147;White March&#148; expansion unfinished, than <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Eyeless swarm your keep and kill you.</span>
</li><li> During the climax, Thaos will try to give a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingSpeech">Breaking Speech</a> to your party. The game takes into account how you&#146;ve handled them and their character arcs, and their responses to his speech change accordingly. For instance, Hiravias can either give a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal">snappy comeback</a> or be left a shaken mess depending on whether you&#146;ve completed his quest or not.
</li><li> Your stats, class, and reputation frequently have a big impact on the plot; a Cipher Watcher can bypass some battles and puzzles by simply reading minds, people will be actively afraid of you if you&#146;ve picked up an evil reputation, having high Lore lets you figure out some plot twists early, and so on.
</li><li> In the climax of the White March expansion, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a member of the party has to stay behind and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">sacrifice themselves</a> in order to stop the Eyeless</span>... unless you cheat by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">wearing a diving helmet you probably got earlier</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">releasing the Pargrunen souls</span>, or picking the Devil of Caroc as (she&#146;s a construct, which means that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she can't drown</span>).

</li><li> In the climax of Deadfire, the final encounter is a battle against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the leader of the strongest remaining faction not allied with the Watcher.</span> The identity of the final enemy will vary depending on the choices made during the game, but one of those choices could involve the player prematurely killing whoever was supposed to face them. To compensate for this, several candidates have second-in-commands who will take their place at the end. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Vailian Trading Company are an exception, because their leader, the Canta Nicese, is only ever encountered in cutscenes before the end, so the Watcher can't kill them. The Huana would normally be led by Queen Onekaza, but if she dies, her brother Prince Aruihi disappears from the map and will take her place at Ukaizo. The Royal Deadfire Company's Hazanui Karu will be replaced by her second, Grand Secretary Atsura. The Principi pirates really take the cake, though. Their default leader is Captain Furrante, but if he's dead, possibly because the Watcher sided with his second Captain Aeldys in their power struggle, then she will go to Ukaizo instead. But if she's also been killed, then Captain Two-Eyed Pim will take her place (and Pim disappears in a cutscene shortly before Furrante and Aeldys come to blows, reducing the likelihood of his death). If the Watcher <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">has killed Two-Eyed Pim as well,</a> he'll be replaced...by One-Eyed Pim.</span>

This causes them to disappear off the map until the start of their next turn, when they are returned with a change to their stats. If this happens to sync up with an end-of-week hairstyle contest (itself a very rare event), the game will comment that your character 'was not around'. This can lead to one person winning by default.

However, characters with low Intelligence can't get some quests, and some potential party members won't join them. In at least one case, they won't <em>ever</em> join you if you talk to them with low Intelligence, so you would have to know in advance or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scum</a> to bump the character's Intelligence <em>before</em> talking to them.

But what happens if a player stands at the edge of a cliff and tries to deploy it in midair? The models for both the cooking fire and the stool the hunter sits on contain wooden scaffolding underneath. Normally this scaffolding clips into and is obscured by the ground if the BBQ Spit is deployed on a level surface, but it becomes visible if the item is used on rough terrain.

<ul><li> Items which exist over multiple time periods obey causality, relative to themselves. If you take an item from the past, it will be absent from all subsequent time periods, but you can also acquire two versions of that item by taking it from the future first, effectively creating a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalParadox">Temporal Paradox</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">The Black Omen</a> functions identically; it disappears after you complete it, but only in periods further ahead, making it possible to explore the Omen three separate times and score three times the Charmed loot off <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Queen Zeal</span>.
</li><li> Speaking of the Black Omen, the only time period where you can&#146;t take it on is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a>; if you try, you get a special cutscene where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Queen Zeal</span> comes out to make fun of you, pointing out that the apocalypse has already happened by then and attacking the Omen in that period is pointless.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking">It&#146;s entirely possible to skip huge portions of the plot</a> and go straight to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Lavos</a> with the bare minimum of party members or equipment, long before you&#146;re ready and before the characters even know said Boss exists (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> even lets you do it right at the Millennial Fair, <em>when you don&#146;t have anyone in the party at all except Crono</em>). Not only do you get a lot of unique dialogue from doing this, but if you actually manage to defeat Lavos that way, you&#146;ll get a secret ending explicitly lampshading what you&#146;ve done. It&#146;s nearly impossible to do if you&#146;re playing normally, but they still acknowledged the possibility of people pulling it off through cheating, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing">Min-Maxing</a>, or sheer dumb luck.
</li><li> On a similar note, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LordBritishPostulate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LordBritishPostulate">winning against</a> the various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">Hopeless Boss Fights</a> will cause slight changes to the plot and earn you unique dialogue you won&#146;t see otherwise. One of the secret endings is earned by beating Lavos in the first battle with him (and only in that specific battle; you get a separate for beating him at other times, as noted above), where he&#146;s at his most powerful and expressly designed to wipe out your party with ease.
</li><li> Famously, the quest to revive <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Crono</span> is <em>optional</em>; there&#146;s absolutely no sane reason to not do it, but you&#146;re still free to play the rest of the game with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a></span> dead, and the plot and cutscenes all change to account for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath">Final Death</a>. Yet again, you get a unique ending for completing the game this way.
</li><li> Frog has a tech called Slurp Slash where he grabs enemies with his tongue, pulls them to himself, and slashes them. If you use it on stationary targets, Frog will instead pull <em>himself</em> towards them, with the ensuing damage being from him crashing into his enemy.
</li><li> In the Blackbird, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGearLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGearLevel">your party is stripped of their gear after being taken prisoner</a>. Until you get it back, you have to rely on magic and stealth to get through... unless you have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser">Ayla</a> in the party; she&#146;s been ripping stuff apart with her bare hands the whole game, so naturally all her &#147;weapons&#148; still work perfectly.

<ul><li> Depending on certain choices you make in game (along with relationship values with your party) a large number of your companions can betray you during the final confrontation with Black Garius. At least one will always do so, no matter what. Sneaky players would save scum the boss, learn who was going to betray them, reload and preemptively remove their gear, rendering them a lot less dangerous. If you do, then Black Garius will conjure them high powered gear as replacements and taunts the player for seeming to "expect" their betrayal.
</li><li> If your character is a Priest, your patron god can be Kelemvor, the god of death in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em>. Kelemvor himself plays a major role in the <em>Mask Of The Betrayer</em> DLC. If you're playing as a Kelemvor Priest during said DLC, you get tons of unique dialogue, and we mean <em>tons</em>. It almost completely changes your role in the story.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsInTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsInTheSky">The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky</a></em> can change dialogue in the main story depending on whether or not you've done certain sidequests. For example, in Second Chapter, there is a sidequest where your characters spar with some members of the military at a fortress for training. When you go to the same fortress for story-related reasons, if you did that sidequest first, the characters acknowledge that you assisted with training the soldiers at the fortress. This is even done between games, because the later games can read your saves and carry over progress accordingly, so for example, if you did a sidequest for a lighthouse keeper in First Chapter, you can go back to the same lighthouse in Second Chapter and get another sidequest there, and he'll acknowledge that you helped him out before too.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableI">Fable I</a></em>: The Lost Chapters has a Demon Door which will only open if you trade it all of your Silver Keys, but if you somehow reach it without any Silver Keys (something so unlikely it pretty much has to be done deliberately), the Demon Door will open anyway, though it will ask how you managed to get so far without finding any.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenI">Suikoden</a></em>, you first meet Vincent when he's in an inn in one town.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheOuterWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheOuterWorlds">The Outer Worlds</a></em>:
<ul><li> There's an early side quest in Emerald Vale where you either destroy or repair a malfunctioning robot. One possible ending is to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench">Parvati</a> repair, after which she'll joke about renaming the robot Jeremy as she fixed it. Do this, and way later into the game you'll encounter that robot again... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">and it has indeed been renamed Jeremy</a>. This <em>only</em> happens if you let Parvati fix him.
</li><li> Doing certain things or taking damage from specific sources repeatedly can cause the game to offer you a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel">Flaw</a> (a sort of anti-Perk) based on that in exchange for a Perk point. For example, if you catch on fire a lot the game will offer to make you <em>even more</em> vulnerable to fire, or if you encounter a certain creature multiple times it offers to weaken you against that creature to reflect your character being afraid of it.
<ul><li> Linked to this, one Flaw you can take is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technophobia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technophobia">Robophobia</a>, which makes you fear robots. One of your potential companions is a robot. The Flaw applies to him as much as it does to other robot NPCs; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">you take a stat penalty when he's in your party</a>, and have special dialogue options that make clear that you're <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethClenchedTeamwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethClenchedTeamwork">terrified</a></em> by him.
</li></ul></li><li> Characters sometimes remark on the clothing and armor you're wearing. For example, wearing the Spacer's Choice mascot costume around Martin Callahan (who also wears that costume), gives you a unique dialogue tree discussing how you two are wearing the same outfit.
</li><li> Similar to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> (which was created by the same people), your Perks and stats can heavily affect your character's dialogue and the overall plot. An extremely low intelligence character talks in borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HulkSpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HulkSpeak">Hulk Speak</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice">Sadistic Choice</a> at the end of the game can be entirely avoided with a sufficiently high Science/Engineering skill, your selected Perks or background give you unique dialogue options, and so on.
</li><li> The game has a downright insane number of redundancies. Breaking the main quest by, for example, rendering yourself unable to get the Stellar Bay navkey from Gladys (nearly impossible to do on accident), just makes the game let you land on Monarch anyway through a back-path. You can kill practically every named NPC in the game, and there are dozens of back-up characters designed to fill in for them to keep quests intact, to the point that doing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacifistRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacifistRun">Pacifist Run</a> will actually make you can miss a good chunk of the cast. No character build is unviable, and nearly every quest has multiple solutions in case you botch the most obvious ones.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreeSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreeSpace">FreeSpace</a></em>: Multiple:
<ul><li> The first game came bundled with FRED (FReespace EDitor), the same development tool the designers used to create the main game's missions. They included a rather amusing response to one attempt at crashing the program. FRED has an autonaming feature: before the user gives a ship a unique name, it is given a generic name based on its class and how many ships have been placed already. It was discovered that attempting to trick FRED's autonamer by renaming a ship to the next ship name in line (for instance, naming a ship "Ulysses 2" and then placing a second Ulysses) would result in the new ship being autonamed "URA Moron 1". For those interested, renaming a ship the next ship in line <em>and</em> renaming a ship "URA Moron 1" results in the next ship being "URA Moron 2", and so on.
</li><li> In the first mission of <em>Freespace 2</em>, if you don't jump out when the mission is complete, the ships you've been escorting will actually go through the docking procedure with the ship that you're told is coming in for them to dock with. You can watch several minutes of scripted sequence and dialog that pertains to absolutely nothing important.
</li><li> When the second Sathanas juggernaut destroys the <em>GVD Psamtik</em> in the mission "Straight, No Chaser", the Sathanas will normally blow the <em>Psamtik</em> away in seconds. However, its beams aren't scripted, just flagged as allowed to fire at will. On the off-chance that they miss enough so that the <em>Psamtik</em> is not immediately obliterated (essentially requiring all but one beam in the first two volleys to miss), the ship's commander and allied command exchange increasingly panicked dialog as the damage starts to pile up. The commander even reports that their jump drive has been destroyed, so you won't wonder why the <em>Psamtik</em> doesn't just take advantage of its luck and retreat while still in one piece.
</li><li> Similarly, at one point the first Sathanas attacks the <em>GTD Phoenicia</em>. Usually it just gets blown up in the first volley, but if it does survive, the captain basically says "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">Screw This, I'm Outta Here!</a>" and jumps out. Mention of this is made in the debriefing.
</li><li> The first time you encounter the Shivans, the weapons you're equipped with are not nearly powerful enough to do more than annoy the Shivan ships. The debriefing makes note that no Shivan ships have been destroyed at all, anywhere. If you <em>do</em> manage to administer a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">Death of a Thousand Cuts</a> to the enemy and blow up one of their ships, the debriefing is altered so that Command congratulates you on proving the new enemy is not invincible.
</li><li> Occurs very frequently throughout the series. There are numerous ships that can appear in multiple missions, but stop appearing if they are destroyed. Easy to miss since most of these are freighters and transports of no real importance. The most obvious example is the Actium and Lysander.
</li><li> Fan-made expansions often do this too: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BluePlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BluePlanet">Blue Planet</a></em> has one mission where you lure a destroyer into a trap by disabling some lesser capital ships. The crews of these ships figure out what you're up to and try to warn the destroyer that it's a trap. Even if you destroy their Comm subsystem to prevent this, the ship's crew will manage to jury-rig an emergency transmitter to get the warning off anyway.
<ul><li> Also from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BluePlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BluePlanet">Blue Planet</a></em>, let's say you used cheats to win the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign">Unwinnable by Design</a> mission "Delenda Est". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">A Sathanas juggernaut called "Mr. Cuddles" will show up to kill you.</span> If you manage to survive <em>that</em>, you get a special debriefing.

<ul><li> Many of the items from the House Party expansion are things that can be found in public places and would lend themselves well to clubs and other hangouts, so when the Hot Date expansion introduced the ability to travel downtown, an alternate version of downtown was created for House Party users which extensively uses House Party's items and decor.
<ul><li> One item that deserves special mention is the DJ booth. Hot Date actually went so far as to include an NPC to operate it on community lots, complete with the ability to request songs.
</li></ul></li><li> The Hot Date expansion adds the ability to go on dates. If Vacation or Unleashed is also installed, dates can be taken to Vacation Island, and Unleashed's in-neighborhood community lots as well.
</li><li> The Unleashed expansion adds the ability to own dogs and cats as fully-fledged family members. If Vacation is installed, they can actually be taken on vacation with the rest of the family, and the pre-made resorts and campgrounds from Vacation were upgraded with pet-related objects to support them (and some other aesthetic objects from Unleashed), though there are some signs that suggest this was an afterthought.
<ul><li> The new community lots in Unleashed can only be traveled to by the whole family, which can be annoying when you just want to shop for pet supplies. Well, if Hot Date is installed, Unleashed will actually update one of the pre-made downtown lots with a pet store so you can buy pet supplies without making it a family outing.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims2">The Sims 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> Don't think you can get away with screwing around with the social worker if she shows up to take your kids. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">Most sadistic players</a> who played the first <em>Sims</em> usually boxed the kid or the worker in a room with no doors or the like in order to prevent the kid from being taken away. Trying to pull the same trick off in the sequel, and if the worker can't reach the kid after a certain amount of time, she will teleport both herself and the kid to her car.
</li><li> Each expansion in <em>The Sims 2</em> included big gameplay elements that would have to be accounted for in future expansions, leading to extra features that you would never see if you only had one or two installed.
<ul><li> In <em>University</em>, the college neighborhood has certain restrictions due to time passing differently and students being in their own separate age group with its own game mechanics, which all later expansions had to take into consideration. Students also have teenage voices, meaning the voice actors would have to record lines for all the things adults can do but teenagers cannot.
</li><li> <em>Nightlife</em> introduced a new aspiration, (Pleasure), which would need to have wants and fears assigned to it in all later expansions.
</li><li> <em>Open For Business</em> allows players to run their own business, meaning all community lot items in future expansions (such as food stands and pet shops) would need to work when controlled by the player.
</li><li> <em>Pets</em> cheated a bit; cats and dogs aren't permitted at university, and they can't be taken on vacation. Still, though, they can interact with objects only included in previous and future expansions.
</li><li> <em>Free Time</em>'s hobby system assigns an appropriate hobby to almost EVERY SINGLE OBJECT IN ALL EXPANSIONS.
</li></ul></li><li> Don't think you can cheat in the DS version without consequence. Setting back your DS's clock will cause the concierge to accuse you of being a time-traveling witch and aliens will swarm the town. There is no consequence for setting your DS clock forward, other than causing bugs to occur more frequently.
</li><li> Sims with an Outgoing personality sometimes pull out a hand mirror and primp as an Idle Action. If the player has <em>Nightlife</em> installed and the Outgoing Sim becomes a vampire, the Sim will look into the mirror, sneer at it, and hiss. (You know, because vampires don't show up in mirrors.)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon">Harvest Moon</a></em>
<ul><li> Many games within the series have events based on your friendship with certain people. Some of the events involve characters who are in the pool of potential <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interests</a>; some of the events must be seen if you want to marry them, but some of them are optional. If you see these optional events after you've married them, the dialogue will often be slightly different &mdash; in addition to calling you by your nickname, they'll say somewhat more romantic things.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonDS">Harvest Moon DS</a></em>, if your Ball item gets lost, Mayor Thomas will return it to you. Your ball can get lost if you so much as sneeze (though you can purposefully ship it or give it to people), but if you specifically throw your ball in the water? Thomas will appear angry and dripping wet, and chide you for being so irresponsible! If he wasn't a champion swimmer, your ball would be lost for good.
</li><li> When you want to propose to someone, you need to use the Blue Feather. If you show it to an eligible partner, then they'll either agree to marry you or refuse. If you show it to the other townspeople, you get responses ranging from congratulations on your upcoming engagement, to mistakenly thinking that you're trying to propose to them. This is taken even further in <em>Island of Happiness</em>. There are around 70 extra side villagers that can move to your island. Even though they don't have face graphics, and are all simple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">Palette Swaps</a> of each other, they'll each have their own special response to the Blue Feather.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory3">Rune Factory 3</a></em>, because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> Micah can't initially enter the Univir settlement when in human form, and if he has a companion with him (even one who knows about his Woolly form) they will insist on not entering since humans are not welcome. If Raven's quests have been completed (and thus she's comfortable transforming in her monster form around Micah), she and Micah are then able to enter the settlement freely.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EvilGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EvilGenius">Evil Genius</a></em>, secret service agents usually infiltrate the rooms of your underground base via doors, and given enough time, they will hack <em>any</em> door. If they find something incriminating or vital, they'll try to blow it up or take pictures for evidence. If you try and block off incriminating evidence, agents that get close enough will start shooting whatever is in the way, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium">leading to explosions and fires</a>. If you're foolish enough to build a room then brick up the entrance, agents will find (read: make on the spot) secret entrances into the sealed-off portion of your base and carry on with their despicable do-gooding while you are helpless to stop them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">because the entrance is bricked up.</a> This also works in <em>reverse</em> &mdash; locking up an agent into a bricked-up cell only leads to him using another secret passage to get out, and he could end up smack dab in the middle of your power plant. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">FFFFFFF----</a>
<ul><li> Clever players have found a way around that by building what they call an &Uuml;ber-trap, coupled with a Freak Trigger. The former is a sophisticated room, full of wind blower traps, separate from the rest of your base that keeps agents from escaping. The whole thing can be made out of a freezer, in case they die (so their dead bodies don't increase your heat level). The Freak Trigger is a series of small rooms, where you put your Freaks, who lumber around. They're dumb enough to trigger every sensor they step on, and you can tie those sensors to traps in the &Uuml;ber-trap room. Thus, not only are agents unable to escape (the door is there, it's just locked and set to allow only your evil self in), but them being constantly thrown from one wind trap to another generates a <em>ton</em> of cash for you thanks to trap combos (you don't even need to steal on the map anymore). The reason to put sensors in a separate room is because agents tend to shoot at any sensor they find, but they usually ignore traps. As a bonus, the game has a cap on how many agents are allowed on the island at once. If you trap the max number in the &Uuml;ber-trap, you won't get any more agents arriving and messing up your plans.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MechWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MechWarrior">MechWarrior</a> 2</em>, several missions required you to navigate a sprawling city full of civilian buildings. The missions didn't require you to deviate much from the predisposed path, but many curious players did it anyway because <em>all</em> the buildings could be inspected to reveal what was inside (and destroyed with no consequences, if the urge struck you). That they were all believably labeled (offices, hospitals etc.) showed a fair amount of Thinking of Everything all by itself, but at some point &mdash; way away from the mission's objective &mdash; you'd find a building labeled "Oh, just a building" that, when inspected, showed "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait">Don't shoot me!</a>". If you blew that up, a nuclear explosion would happen that'd <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCrueltyPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCrueltyPunishment">destroy the entire level and everything in it</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StardewValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StardewValley">Stardew Valley</a></em>
<ul><li> Some NPCs are placed in unreachable locations for some of the town festivals (such as the Wizard and Linus at the Spirit's Eve maze), but nevertheless have unique dialogue about the situation if the player manages to somehow reach them anyway.
</li><li> Similarly, the caged skeletons and penned animals that show up during certain festivals can be talked to if a player no-clips past the fences. (Although all of them just say "Hi.")
</li><li> The mine carts are repaired as the reward for completing the boiler room bundles (or paying 15,000 gold). These can access the quarry if the player has completed the crafts room bundles. If the player hasn't, the mine carts can go to the mines, the town, and the bus stop, but the quarry will remain locked until the player has completed all of the craft room bundles and repaired the bridge.
</li><li> You can display any item on the Grange at the Stardew Valley Fair, including objective-based ones. <a class="urllink" href="https://i.redd.it/r3ycq7vhcypx.png">Such as the Mayor's shorts<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>. Starting in Version 1.1, the Mayor gets offended, bans you from competing, and offers you 750 stars as hush money to take it down, and Marnie gets flustered when she realizes what that "strange purple cabbage" is.
</li><li> An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">Anti-Frustration Feature</a> allows the player to push past characters that may be in the way. Attempting to push the desert casino bouncer out of the way will result in him not budging and saying "Nice try."
</li><li> Trying to use the out-of-bounds bug to reach the casino staircase results in the bouncer catching you, throwing you out, yelling "you little punk!" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFairCheating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFairCheating">and hitting you with a Mega Bomb</a>. He does the same thing if you try using a mod to warp into the Casino before you've unlocked it.
</li><li> Using a pile of staircases to complete the 100-level quest in Skull Cavern gets you a reprimand that you were supposed to do it the hard way... but he'll give you the reward anyway, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">for having the chutzpah to cheat</a>. If you do the quest fairly, your benefactor is sincerely impressed and remarks that he expected you to cheat.
</li><li> Typing "/cheat" into chat gets you a message saying "Nice try."
</li><li> If the player was married to Emily prior to 1.4, she has different dialogue in the scene where she allows you access to her sewing machine. This is otherwise impossible to see since she normally gives you permission to use it long before you can marry her.
</li><li> Since Linus never goes to town outside of cutscenes and events, it's nearly impossible to get caught going into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpsterDive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpsterDive">Dumpster Dive</a> by him. 1.3 added the Night Market, which he does have to cross town to go to.

Because of this, choosing to instead pay full price for a game without using any items brings up a special series of cutscenes in which Rusty receives the relevant items anyways from Pappy van Poodle, a mentor character who is otherwise unmentioned until the epilogue and who happens upon the items himself, giving them to Rusty either as gifts or because he has no need for them. This ensures that the main story is still able to progress as intended even if the player refuses to cooperate with it.

So naturally, there's a bonus cutscene where you can tie the knot for your target.
</li><li> This mission takes place in a rural swamp estate in Mississippi. At the start of the mission you see a group of poachers shooting gators in the swamp for sport. If you join in at shooting at them, they will comment. If you later toss bodies into the same swamp, you'll see a unique animation of the bodies being devoured by gators. This is the only mission in the game where NPC's will not be alarmed by the sounds of gunshots, as long as they don't see anyone actually get hit.
</li><li> If you shoot the target during his wedding ceremony, in front of the large audience, everyone will begin looking for the shooter and you'll likely be found quickly no matter how far away you were. But if you wait until after the ceremony when all of the men draw guns and fire them into the air to celebrate and time your shot with theirs, they will react with confusion and the death will be counted as an accident.

Of course, by the time it figures it out (which varies from character to character), you could already have your characters' levels in the 4000s (usually, it figures it out by around 2300 or so).

For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO">The Big O</a> is a ground unit which has melee attacks which do not work against aerial opponents, but if you attach a "Minovsky Drive" which allows it to fly and use these attacks, you see that they have specialized, completely unique animations for mid-air use. Another one is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a> special dialog that can be found if you reduce the penultimate boss' HP to exactly 1 point, where it goes on a rather lengthy rambling session. Lampshades the whole idea with the ground-only Iron Gear (WM)'s punch attack &mdash; if it's given some way to attack aerial foes, it won't use its boosters to jump up. Rather, it just kinda <em>floats</em> up, perfectly in key with its source.

While it's largely cosmetic as the melee attack has exactly the same properties as the normal attack, it also ignores Point-Defense Drones, which only work against ranged attacks.
<ul><li> In the <em>Wings of Liberty</em> campaign, two missions have specific objectives that are <em>not</em> "destroy the enemy base".

Fight a battle in Sicily, and you'll see Mt. Etna spewing smoke on the horizon. <em>Rome</em> is the first game in the series that introduces the concept of buildings catching fire and collapsing into piles of rubble if they're heavily damaged by siege weapons.
</li><li> One shared with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedievalIITotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedievalIITotalWar">Medieval II: Total War</a></em> as well - Nearly anything your Generals do can earn them a new trait or ancillary. Have a general visit or become governor to a town an Arena? He may become a fan of the games. Leave a General between cities at the end of a turn? He might gain a trait regarding logistics. Have a General regularly fight armies of a particular faction? He may earn a trait that has him <em>hate</em> that particular faction and get a bonus commanding against them. Hire mercenaries often? He may get a mercenary captain in the retinue. Govern a city with a temple? He may get a priest of that temple in his retinue. This even applies to agents and naval captains.
</li><li> Before most battles, the commander of the army will give a speech. If the army is commanded by a captain (no general is present in the army) the speech will be very short, along the lines of "let's kill them, men", while an actual general will treat the player to a longer speech. The content of the speech will depend on a large variety of things, including: the faction you're playing, the faction you're facing, which side has the numerical advantage, if the general has fought, won or lost against the faction before and how large a portion of the total military strength of both factions is present. Even some traits the generals may have will affect the speech, in addition to the effects they have on the general's stats, so a Boring Speaker will stutter a lot and be uninspiring in general, while a Great Speaker's speech makes even the player excited. The most experienced generals will even analyze the composition of the forces present, such as which side has more missiles, cavalry, etc., and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">give the player advice on how he should approach the battle</a>.

Someone will make note of common ways the limit is kept if they occur, such as grown Pikmin being stored away when there are already 100 on the field. However, there are also times when a Pikmin is automatically placed into the field, usually when an Onion releases the first seed of a type of Pikmin after discovering or extincting it, and the game will forcefully put the farthest Pikmin from that location back in its Onion if needed. Additionally, when entering a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonCrawling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonCrawling">cave</a> in the second game, Pikmin that aren't buried or with the leaders are put back in their Onions. In a few caves, it is possible to obtain more Pikmin, and those extra Pikmin will be automatically put away if they exceed the limit due to buried Pikmin on the surface.
<ul><li> In <em>Pikmin 2</em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">Submerged Castle</a> can only be reached by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperNotDrowningSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperNotDrowningSkills">Blue Pikmin</a>, as the entrance to that dungeon is underwater. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">main boss</a> in that dungeon needs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoutStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoutStrength">Purple Pikmin</a> to be defeated. But if you try to hack the game and allow Purple Pikmin to access water, the game will flat-out tell you that only Blue Pikmin can enter the dungeon.
</li><li> In <em>Pikmin 3</em>, due to the more story-driven areas, there are invisible walls set up to prevent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking">Sequence Breaking</a> in a lot of places, though some can be avoided.

If you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">use a high-calibre rifle on small game</a> then the corpse will be near-worthless to a butcher or trapper because frankly, the shot obliterated the body.
</li><li> Morgan needs to regularly eat and sleep or he will eventually become fatigued, leading to adverse stamina gain, changed posture and dizziness. He also needs to regularly bathe, as mud and blood that splashes on him will dry and cause people to avoid him (and lawmen may also react badly if he is heavily coated in the latter). Injuries are realistically depicted: if a wolf mauls him then his forearms will be covered in gashes and bit marks, and if he is shot then bloody bullet holes will appear on his clothes. Morgan can gain or lose weight according to how much he eats, with corresponding effects on performance (for example if he is overweight then he will gain stamina more slowly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kevlard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kevlard">but gain a little more resistance to gunshot wounds</a>). His hair and beard grow continually and have to be cut and shaved. Finally, Morgan's stamina changes depending on what he is wearing and the weather; wearing a heavy sheepskin jacket in the hot, swampy Louisiana-esque Lemoyne territory or only light clothing on a cold mountaintop will adversely affect stamina gain.
</li><li> NPCs are highly dynamic. You can greet, antagonise and apologise to the same person in a single conversation. As mentioned above, Morgan's appearance will affect how people react to him; being covered in dried gore will cause most people to avoid him altogether. NPCs will also react differently if Morgan tries to have a conversation with them with a gun drawn. NPCs have loved ones and friends and killing someone might cause them to come after you later. Lawmen will not try to kill Morgan for petty crimes, in some cases merely giving him a stern telling off and an order to leave town for a while.
</li><li> <em>Max Payne 3</em>, above, was also developed by Rockstar, and uses a similar gun system; Morgan will sometimes carry a handgun in his right hand and a long gun in his left.
</li><li> Several missions have dialogue change according to your honor rank, or things you have done. As an example, in a mission from the epilogue Sadie will describe several things about New Austin, and your character's response to each will differ depending on whether you've already visited the places or people she mentions. She'll even be impressed if you've seen all of them. Other missions will have characters have special reactions to things you wouldn't expect, such as in one (pretty hectic and fast paced) mission where Charles will remark "Thanks, you saved me the trouble" if you happen to kill the one guy he's scripted to kill before he gets the chance to - you need to be pretty fast to do so, and he likely won't be the one you're targeting.

Order a flashbang on a bunch of enemies hiding in a bus, and Walker will say "Empty that bus!" In a shootout in a museum with a T-Rex skeleton, he'll say "Take out that guy by the T-Rex!". Adams and Lugo will also shout out enemy locations in the same way.
</li><li> Chapter 3 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarusUprising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarusUprising">Kid Icarus: Uprising</a></em> revolves around Pit fighting a three-headed dragon and chasing its disembodied heads. The order you take out its heads determines which "role" each of the heads will play in the land portion of the chapter, and each head has unique dialogue for each "role".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TransformersFallOfCybertron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TransformersFallOfCybertron">Transformers: Fall of Cybertron</a></em>:
<ul><li> While playing as Starscream, the player can find a crown and have him wear it for the rest of the level as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a>. During a cutscene towards the end of the level, Starscream gets thrown into a wall and knocked out by Grimlock before player control switches to Grimlock; if Starscream is still wearing the crown at this point, it gets knocked off by Grimlock's throw and accidentally crushed when Grimlock walks past.
</li><li> Shortly after Grimlock gets loose, the various Decepticon guards will attack you... but the unarmed scientists and workers actually working at the facility will run away, duck for cover, or simply freeze up out of fear. Some of the guards will also choose to flee instead of fighting, as they know how much more dangerous you are.
</li><li> Early in the game Optimus passes by Grimlock's quarters, where Warpath was just searching for him. If you go inside (which you have no reason to do and wouldn't probably think of, given there's an attack going on) and look at the morbid stuff he has in there (weapon racks, a locker filled with heads, etc.), than Optimus will make some weary comments about Grimlock's violent nature. You can also turn on the TV in the room and sit down to watch it; doing so gets you a nasty comment from Ironhide over your radio chewing you out for not getting to the battlefield when you're needed.
</li><li> When Megatron confronts Starscream, a button prompt tells the player to press the fire button to "shut Starscream up". If you hold off on firing instead, a surprised Starscream proceeds to go into a lengthy rant about how he's the better leader of the Decepticons while waiting for you to shoot him. Similarly, if you linger a bit instead of walking away immediately after beating Kickback, he'll make fun of you for sticking around.
</li><li> When you confront Shockwave as Grimlock, if you listen in on Shockwave and Megatron's conversation instead of attacking right away like the game expects, the two continue their fully scripted conversation and exchange some private information the player won't otherwise hear because the two think they're alone.

All your passwords you find are stored in the file screen, and after you've completed an escape section, you can replay it by selecting it on the flow chart. If you replay one of them, you'll be able to automatically open the safe by entering the password, thus bypassing the puzzles. If you do so, then there'll be unique conversations when you go to leave the room, particularly if there is something within the room and it's puzzles relating to the plot. The same thing obviously happens if you happen to guess the password and input it without having found it. One particular example is in the lounge, where doing this will result in Phi stopping you from going through the door, and shouting a quick lecture on lunar eclipses at you, much to the confusion of protagonist Sigma.
</li><li> The sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ZeroTimeDilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ZeroTimeDilemma">Zero Time Dilemma</a></em>:
<ul><li> The player can type a number of answers for different choices, including the nonsensical. For example, after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">finding Mira dead</span> in one timeline Eric asks Q <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who killed her</span>. Among the options are Q, Eric and... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanineCompanion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanineCompanion">Gab</a>.
</li><li> If the player knows Zero's identity, there are a few places where extra dialogue can be found. When typing in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who killed Junpei</span>, putting in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Delta</span> causes the game to say <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"HE IS NOT HERE"</span>. Typing it in during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MexicanStandoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MexicanStandoff">Mexican Standoff</a> leads to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a> ending where Q turns around and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApologeticAttacker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApologeticAttacker">apologizes</a> before shooting him, leading to surprised reactions from Eric and Mira</span>.
</li><li> Throughout the game you can see who's dead in the pause menu. If you check during <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the ending D-END 2</span> you'll see that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Phi and Q</span> are marked as DEAD throughout... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until Diana and Sigma's children are born and their status is changed to ALIVE. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">Time travel is involved</a>.</span>
</li><li> There are often multiple ways that answers can be typed in when prompted. For example, to progress <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when Eric is demanding to know who killed Mira</span> you can type in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"NO IDEA", "I DONT KNOW" or simply not answer,</span> all of which are valid. Not only that, but during the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Force Quit: D scenes</span> the player can type in either <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"BLUE BIRD" or "MUSIC BOX"</span> for the second item.
</li><li> If the player solves a puzzle through guess work, because they're replaying an already completed room, or solves it before acquiring all information the game expects you need to know, the the characters will say something about how they accidentally stumbled onto the answer, or how the answer just popped into their head. They also often say something akin to "I feel like we skipped a few steps...", or muse over how it feels like the answer was something they just somehow knew, particularly tying it into most of the characters having a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">connection to the morphogenetic field.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostTrick">Ghost Trick</a></em> offers several branching areas where you're allowed to travel over the phone lines to check out areas that aren't even crucial to your immediate task, but if you choose to, you're often given information that will come into play soon thereafter. An early example involves Emma and her daughter Amelie, Lynne's neighbors who seem only tangentially related to the story. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Later on, Amelie is kidnapped by the foreigners and held hostage as ransom against the justice minister... or so they claim. If you've been checking in on them during the night, and if you travel to see them during the ransom phone call in question, you see that it's all a bluff using a recorded message spliced together from the arguments Amelie has been having with Emma during the evening.</span>
</li><li> For a series that often gets accused of the opposite, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> actually offers quite a bit of this, particularly in the latter games.
<ul><li> The first case of the first game requires no pressing to finish, and the aspect of pressing is only brought up during the second case. However the "Press" option is still present in the controls and pressing it will have Phoenix questioning the witnesses as per normal.
</li><li> Some of the later games include special <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver">Non Standard Game Over</a> sequences for when you fail a trial at a point where the defendant being found Guilty wouldn't make sense. For example, the client getting off the hook but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">the real killer getting away.</a>
</li><li> For example, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneySpiritOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneySpiritOfJustice">Spirit of Justice</a></em>, during the divination seance of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Inga's</span> final memories. You have a testimony from a witness, that was previously used to prove that the person the victim was talking to on the phone was in the bazaar, from the sounds that can be heard over the phone corresponding to events the witness claimed occurred in the bazaar. You then have to use that same testimony to point out that the assumed time the memories are occurring is wrong, as the witness claims the events occurred at around 2PM, while the TOD is put as 3PM. To do this the player must pinpoint a specific spot in the memories that correspond to the events from the testimony, the two main ones being the supposed "gunshot" and the laughter heard over the phone. If the player attempts to use the laughter they will get unique dialogue where it's pointed out that laughter is a common occurrence in a place like a bazaar. They also will not occur the usual penalty, due to being on the right track with their logic, before being returned to the seance.
</li><li> And a minor example from the third game: In the section where you play as Edgeworth and talk to Iris for the first time, you'd typically ask the questions in order as laid out for you. Doing so triggers a Psyche-Lock, cluing Edgeworth in that Iris is hiding something. The next dialogue option has him directly ask Iris if she's the murderer, and Edgeworth figures out she's telling the truth because the psyche-locks are absent. However, if you ask her about being the murderer FIRST (without finding out about the psyche-locks) Edgeworth's internal monologue reveals he, rightfully at the time, has no way to actually know if she's lying or not.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/XBlaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/XBlaze">XBlaze</a></em> is set as a prequel to the rest of <em>BlazBlue</em> franchise, with <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XBlaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XBlaze">X Blaze</a> Lost: Memories</em> showing two major characters at a very young age. The central one of the two contracts amnesia at the start of the story, allowing you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloInsertNameHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloInsertNameHere">to input a name for her</a>. Try to input <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the name she is better known as, 'Nine'</span>, and the game will tell you 'The time has not come for that yet...'. It also vetoes names like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Konoe, Phantom and various members of Nine's family</span>.

<ul><li> In the first game, there's one final temptation for a heroic Cole to cross the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">detonating the ray sphere again</span>. If you do this and you've garnered a good reputation, the civilians that attack you on the street will scream about how Cole betrayed them instead of the generic comments about his monstrosity, and the heroic posters you would have chosen to be plastered up will have all been crossed out, marked up, or had stickers with broken hearts put on them. It also works the other way around. If you chose not to despite having Evil Karma the people will start to question you and your Evil Posters will have a question mark over them.
</li><li> Cole suffers from justified <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills">Super Drowning Skills</a> because water causes him to short out. Even tiny puddles cause enough of a surge to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> most enemies up to and including minibosses, which can be used in certain situations to completely bypass tricky fights.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AIDungeon2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AIDungeon2">AI Dungeon 2</a></em> averts this trope.

They mainly do this with food, eventually eating it to regain health, but can also carry other things. If they get their teeth on a piece of gear, any offensive enchantments on it will increase their attack power. And if they somehow snag a Totem of Undying&mdash;which you'd have to drop intentionally in front of the fox, since you can't die while holding it&mdash;they can use it to come back to life if they die, even though the totem normally only works on human players.

</li></ul></li><li> Bezier Games has an app for use with their <em>One Night</em> series. As of this writing, this series consists of five different games (<em>Werewolf</em>, <em>Daybreak</em>, <em>Vampire</em>, <em>Alien</em>, and <em>Super Villains</em>) and a few bonus packs which are all designed to be used together. However, this is zigzagged at best:
<ul><li> One of the roles featured in <em>Werewolf</em> is the Doppelganger who assumes the role of whoever's card her player looks at. They had to account for the night actions of roles from the subsequent installments, so up until <em>Vampire</em>, the announcer added the various roles with night actions to the original list. But starting with <em>Alien</em>, the announcer simply says to perform the other role's night action at that point.
</li><li> If non-villagers are added from multiple games, the announcer says to prepare for an epic battle even if there's only one of each non-villager. At first, the announcer said to prepare for an epic battle between villagers, werewolves, and vampires, but didn't include aliens when that game was introduced. As of <em>Super Villains</em>, the announcer simply says to prepare for an epic battle.
</li><li> One aversion is that if only one werewolf, vampire, or alien is selected, the app still asks those roles to look for others. On the other hand, <em>Super Villains</em> has an enemy (Henchman number 7) who doesn't have any abilities. If he is the only non-villager from that game, the app tells him to wake up and go back to sleep.
</li><li> The total number of roles across the five games and bonus packs is eighty-six as of 2019. While it's highly unlikely that someone would have that many friends to play such a big session, it is possible to select them all. If so...
<div class="indent"><strong>Narrator:</strong> Really? You've selected <em>all</em> the roles? I have better things to do and I'm sure you do too.

More than once, he has tried to cheat the system by deliberately failing certain questions, but on that most intelligent day, he included mechanisms to catch when he was doing so and shut his attempts down.

</li><li> The AI can recognize when the players are working together instead of competing with each other. The latter is how the game is supposed to be played.

</div></li><li> The developers apparently prepared for the chance that a player would accidentally kill a shopkeeper...and decide to kill the rest of his family, loot his shop, and burn it down to cover all that up.
</li><li> Since the point of the game is to get to the ending as quickly as possible, it's interesting that the developers allowed for the possibility of romancing an NPC <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to the point of starting a family and getting their kids to mine materials for the game's crafting system.

However, Faysal (a muslim) chose that punishment, so in place of ham, he was given a vegetarian substitute.

In order to avoid this, the vote was given to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceParticipation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceParticipation">viewers</a> - and when the viewers went to cast their vote (Which was done online), the player was given three choices - one for every potential final two out of the three players remaining in the game.

Sure enough, if this happens (Which it did once), the second runner up would cast the tiebreaking vote.
</li><li> <em>Monster House</em> had an episode where two teams of past contestants competed to fix up a frat house. To mark which one was winning, host Steve Watson posted a flag bearing that team's color, red or blue. At one point, the two teams decided to join forces and try to complete the build together. Even though this wasn't offered as an option, Steve brought a purple flag for the occasion.

Not only does he have to keep them all alive within the story, if the story ends they will all die.

However, it's possible to make it to this part of the game without having two full pendants of life. If the team made it this far, the last half would be placed in the temple, usually in a place they were required to go rather early so they have a fighting chance.

<ul><li> On the vast majority of pinball machines, if nothing seems to have happened on the playfield for a while and no flipper has been touched, the game reasons that the ball is stuck and starts randomly firing off all of the kickers and features on the table to attempt to unstick it. Some games also have quotes or special displays at this point (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/FunHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/FunHouse">Fun House</a></em>, for example, would say "Where did you go now?")
</li><li> The pinball game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/IndianaJonesThePinballAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/IndianaJonesThePinballAdventure">Indiana Jones: The Pinball Adventure</a></em> features a sinkhole chute that is guarded by three targets. Normally the sinkhole is accessable only when the targets are struck and dropped out of play, revealing access. Because pinball games are physical, it is possible to slip by without striking the targets. The character Short Round will cry out, "you cheat, Dr. Jones!" and awards bonus points. There is also a bonus section where you are supposed to hit various targets to fight against a swordsman displayed on the screen. However, if you remember that the ball launcher is designed like a gun trigger, you can indeed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">follow in Dr. Jones' footsteps and just shoot him</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15zl74');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note15zl74" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15zl74');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though you get far less points for doing this.</span>
</li><li> The same could be done on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/TheShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/TheShadow">The Shadow</a></em> pinball machine, where you could make a pinball shot to defeat attacking Mongols, or just shoot them. This added a tactical dimension, as shooting the Mongol awarded far fewer points, but certain features were not accessible during the Mongol Attack, meaning that skipping it could avoid you being frozen out of the feature you actually wanted.
</li><li> Williams Pinball machines were famous for their ability to detect when a physical part of the machine had failed and <em>compensate for it</em> by modifying the rules of the game. So if a sensor hadn't triggered for a while, the game would substitute another sensor along the same rail or shot. This was an incredibly useful feature for arcade owners, and the source of some annoyance that machines from other manufacturers didn't do this (this wasn't their fault, though - Williams patented it.)

<ul><li> Rudy's mouth is normally only a valid shot when it is either shut or locked open as he sleeps, but incidentally shooting the ball into his mouth while he's speaking causes him to swallow it and spit it out, scoring a "Rudy Gulp" bonus. In the similar table <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/RedAndTedsRoadShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/RedAndTedsRoadShow">Red &amp; Ted's Road Show</a></em>, which featured two talking heads named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEponymousShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEponymousShow">Red and Ted</a>, shooting the ball into Red's mouth while she's speaking will make her spit it out, asking Ted why he likes the taste of pinballs.
</li><li> Additionally, the table's standard multiball mode requires locking two balls, then shooting a ball into Rudy's mouth while he's asleep. However, there's also a "Quick Multiball" award that, when activated with both balls locked, will start the standard multiball mode without having to shoot the ball into Rudy's mouth. If the multiball round starts via Quick Multiball, each hit to Rudy's mouth awards a million points&mdash;this in addition to the normal multi-million-point trap door shot. (This table averts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a>, however.

<ul><li> If the ball falls into the Highwire lock from a weak ramp shot without being lit, you are awarded a "Sneaky Lock" bonus (with an animation of a pinball tip-toeing across the display), and that ball is locked.
</li><li> When the ball is stuck to the magnet on the Ringmaster's hat, he will then swing his head around and drop the ball. This means the ball will take a random path back down. Since some of these paths will drain your ball, the ball saver will briefly activate after the Ringmaster lets go of the ball in case it happens.

Normally, diverters to the holes are down until lock is lit, but it's still possible to shoot the loop lightly so that the ball stops mid-loop and falls in the hole. Doing this will trigger a special animation where a magician falls down the stairs into the Haunted Basement: "Oooohhh Noooooo! Ow oof aak oof ack! This ball is full of wonders!" and allow you to lock balls without spelling "Magic". In a double case of developers' foresight, doing this a second time in the same game will only award some points.
</li><li> A Death Save is a pinball maneuver where, after the ball falls down an outlane, the player whacks the machine in order to bounce the ball back into play from below the flippers. Some games, including most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DataEast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DataEast">Data East</a> tables and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em>, detect this move and give points for it.
</li><li> A highly frowned-upon technique in pinball is called a "Bang Back", where a player strikes the machine's front or underside to force a ball back into play as it's going down the drain. Allegedly, some early pinball companies would discourage this by placing downward-facing nails or spikes on the underside of the cabinet under the drain to injure anyone trying to cheat this way.

<ul><li> In Chessboxing there are rules for how to handle a match runs out of times before either fighter wins. As in boxing, the fighter ahead on points in the boxing match wins. This trope comes in, however, in a situation that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> says has <em>never happened</em>: if the points in the boxing match are tied and the chess match ends in a draw, the person playing black wins.
</li><li> In many sports there are (sometimes extremely detailed) rules for what happens when a player is injured, feigns injury, bleeds or is otherwise incapacitated. The fact that these rules exist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">might get you thinking about the game</a>. Particularly detailed rules exist in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RugbyIsSlaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RugbyIsSlaughter">Rugby</a> and American Football, but the rules on bleeding soccer players are also a bit <em>too</em> detailed for comfort.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IceHockey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IceHockey">Hockey</a> has some extremely detailed rules about extraordinarily unlikely scenarios, most of which have never come to pass, (and an unusual number of them surround goalies). Most hockey fans - even dedicated ones - are unaware these rules even exist. For instance:
<ul><li> Goalies are not allowed to play the puck anywhere past centre ice (to prevent goalies from joining the rush as an extra attacker).
</li><li> If a goalie is pulled for an extra attacker during overtime and the goalie's team loses, that team forfeits the "loser point" in the standings they would otherwise have earned for making it to overtime (the only exception to this is if the goalie was pulled due to a delayed penalty call against the other team). This was apparently put into play to discourage teams from going offence-heavy in overtime to take advantage of the smaller number of players on the ice. What truly pushes this into "bizarre" territory is that any team that pulls its goalie in overtime also triggers a second obscure rule that states that the goalie cannot then return to the ice, even if one of the active players swaps out, until the next stoppage in play (a goalie returning to the ice from the bench on the fly is an extremely rare play on its own, nevermind doing so in the further unlikely event that a team in overtime has pulled said goalie).
</li><li> In the event that a goalie gets injured, each team keeps a backup goalie dressed so that they can swap in. But what happens if that goalie <em>also</em> gets injured? The league has detailed rules on who gets to sub in, including exactly how long an emergency "third goalie" has to warm up (two minutes if they aren't already dressed, no time if they are dressed or if they are being asked to defend a penalty shot).
</li><li> While players get injured or tossed out of the game all the time, what happens if the refs are incapacitated or otherwise unable to do their jobs? Given that refs aren't typically involved in the rough parts of the game, this is a pretty unlikely event, but the league has a list of steps to take if the refs are unavailable. First the league tries to find replacements, and if that fails the teams are asked to agree on a neutral third party to ref. If <em>that</em> doesn't work either, then each team must put forward one player to act as referee (meaning, yes, the players may actually be asked to ref their own team). Surprisingly, this particular rule actually DID come into effect once in the NHL (during a game in 1983 between the New Jersey Devils and the Hartford Whalers, the refs and linesmen were delayed by weather and didn't make it in time for the first period).
</li></ul></li><li> Current <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague">National Football League</a> rules allow points to be scored by <em>either</em> team during an extra point or two point conversion attempt. In addition to the defending team being awarded two points for the equivalent of a defensive touchdown, this includes provisions for a team to be awarded a single point for a play resulting in a safety. However, while it is rare but not unheard of for an offensive team to be awarded a one point safety, the sequence of events required for the defense to do so - either a tackle for a loss of at least 85 yards<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1781pe');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1781pe" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1781pe');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">98 yards on a two point conversion atttempt</span> or a double turnover, with the second turnover being recovered by the offense in their own end zone<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note18dftj');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note18dftj" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note18dftj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">again, up to 98 yards away from the start of the play</span> - are so unusual that they have never happened in an NFL game.
<ul><li> While this has also never happened, in the event that a team were to forfeit a game, the team that did not forfeit will be considered to have won with a score of 2-0. This is because the two-point safety is the only type of point in the entire NFL that is not attributed to a single player.

Although "<a class="urllink" href="https://aprimenumber.com/index.php?prime=0">https://aprimenumber.com/index.php?prime=0<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>" just leads to the main site, it does have a unique message for zero, which can be found at "<a class="urllink" href="https://aprimenumber.com/index.php?prime=00">https://aprimenumber.com/index.php?prime=00<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>". Negative numbers would formerly redirect you to the creator's main website, as will any string with an underscore in it. Finally, entering letters produces the message "I need a real number, yo." It also has snarky comments for prime numbers under 10, as well as the numbers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirteenIsUnlucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirteenIsUnlucky">13</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy">42</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LOL69" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LOL69">69</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberOfTheBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberOfTheBeast">666</a>.
</li><li> Pok&eacute;check is a website that, among other uses, can check the legitimacy of any Pok&eacute;mon uploaded to it. It takes <em>everything</em> into account when checking to see whether or not a Pok&eacute;mon was likely edited or created using an external device, across three whole generations of games and events. (as Gen VI hasn't been implemented yet as of 5/5/14) Obscure spin-offs and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">limited-distribution events</a>? Taken into account. Differences between Gen III to V <em>data-structures</em> like garbage bits in nicknames that are preserved in the transition between generations? Well documented. The fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXDGaleOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXDGaleOfDarkness">XD</a>'s Shadow Pok&eacute;mon and certain Gen 5 legendaries cannot be shiny? Factored in perfectly. Unusual stat totals? It's got that covered. An obscure glitch that only affects five species? Of course. And if a Pok&eacute;mon has a Trainer/Secret ID of 00666 or some equally unlikely number, it displays the message "Suspicious trainer IDs." The only way past it is to hack a Pok&eacute;mon that is identical to one that could have been generated by a core series/Gamecube Pok&eacute;mon title. Which is the intention.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/TheGastonTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/TheGastonTrilogy">The Gaston Trilogy</a></em> has an in-universe example. Lefou's Quest IV has no fewer than five unique ways to die on the first level alone, one of which is both ridiculously elaborate and relatively obscure, and the game over screen also references which way you died last. It&#146;s also possible to do a ton of actions that seem counterintuitive such as using someone else's belt as a weapon on the boss or stab him with nothing, which all have unique responses, and damaging the boss in his eye results in him getting an eyepatch.

<ul><li> The Amazon Echo, a speaker/microphone array that acts as the interface for Amazon's cloud-based personal assistant, has a long, <em>long</em> list of "Easter Egg" phrases to which it will respond with a joke answer, and as a cloud-based platform, more are being added every day.
</li><li> Cortana (the assistant for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MicrosoftWindows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MicrosoftWindows">Windows 10 and Windows Phone</a>, not the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> character) has a long list of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a> phrases she'll respond to. For instance, try "How is Master Chief?", "Tell me a joke", "Who's your daddy?", "What's your favourite colour?", etc.
<ul><li> Despite these joke/Easter-Egg responses, its obvious that the goal for such personal assistants is to handle, if not <em>everything</em>, a bewildering array of requests. Ask Cortana about a restaurant, for instance and rather than just doing a web-search, it will display its menu and hours in a "restaurant" template created just for such questions.
</li><li> Try asking Cortana about Siri, and she'll say <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">"I think it's cool that she's out there trying to make people's lives a little easier."</a>
</li></ul></li><li> IBM RnD, according to Prof Moriarty speaking on the Sixty Symbols <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> channel. "You read [one of their research papers] and questions arise. Then you go back and see 'oh, right, they've done that as well'. And then you think 'well maybe this', but every single question is covered."
</li><li> Detroit's Comerica Park, home of the Tigers, has a statue garden of their legendary players in the deep center field stands. One of them is memorialized with his glove up and open. The artist took the time to fill the interior of the glove with small nails, so that on the one-in-a-million chance that a home run is hit into the glove, the statue will "catch" it.
</li><li> When using some email processors, if you write the words "Attached is/are..." without giving an attachment, and then hit "Send," the program will point this out, then ask you if you want to attach anything. Same thing goes if you try to send an email with a blank subject line, since most email processors filter blank-line messages as spam.
</li><li> The free music program Spotify plays commercials between songs. If you mute your speakers during these, the commercial pauses until you unmute the sound.
</li><li> Several websites are now able to detect if the user has adblocking software installed. Some merely add a message intended to guilt-trip you into turning it off, while others are more intrusive. Some take it to absolutely ridiculous levels; Blip.tv, for example, rapidly gained infamy for making you stare at a static message for <em>90 seconds</em> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">helpfully</a> informed you that their ads were much shorter.
<ul><li> Similarly, certain websites limit how many articles you can read in a month before you have to pay and login to read them. Many of these are smart enough to detect if the user is in Private mode on their browser (which doesn't save cookies, which these sites use to track the number of times you access them), and immediately bar access even if you otherwise have free articles remaining.
</li></ul></li><li> Google Maps:
<ul><li> Driving directions are given for journeys on different continents, including at necessary places "Sail across [insert body of water]".
</li><li> Often times the navigate feature will choose the fastest route, not necessarily the shortest route, as the shorter route may take longer due to factors such as lower speed limits, more stoplights, etc. However, it also takes traffic into account as well. It's also scarily accurate with the estimated time to arrival, adjusting the ETA accordingly with your average speed.
</li><li> An update tells you which lane you need to be in if encountering a fork or intersection and the secondary routes along the way with a change in ETA if you decide to take that route.
</li><li> It was once <a class="urllink" href="https://www.seroundtable.com/google-maps-easter-egg-walking-to-mordor-17968.html">reported<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that asking an older version of it for walking directions from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Shire to Mordor</a> would result in it replying "Use caution &mdash; One does not simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkIntoMordor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkIntoMordor">Walk into Mordor</a>."
</li></ul></li><li> As it turns out, someone had the foresight to add tamper-proof measures to photobooths - they'll take your picture if they detect someone trying to, for example, steal money from the machine <a class="urllink" href="http://ewn.co.za/2016/02/05/Photo-booth-snaps-mugshot-of-thief-in-the-act">as this thief found out<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> Laws are often awfully specific, especially if they forbid something. That has a very simple reason: Almost all legal systems work under the assumption that anything which is not <em>explicitly</em> forbidden by law is allowed and no law may ever apply retroactively. So whoever writes the laws has to anticipate a <em>lot</em>. Some laws are therefore rather general, but some are awfully specific, like the German law on <a class="urllink" href="https://dejure.org/gesetze/StGB/307.html">nuclear explosions<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> In <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyThemeParks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyThemeParks">Disney Theme Parks</a>, there are attractions that use animatronics in their pre-shows or during keystone moments of their attractions. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious">Animatronics break.</a> Because of this, many of these rides have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeForPlanB" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeForPlanB">B-Modes</a> in place so that immersion/story flow can continue without issue.
