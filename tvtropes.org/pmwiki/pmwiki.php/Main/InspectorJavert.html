However, the trope is not confined to heroes, and the Javert frequently finds himself pursuing criminals of all stripes, often the powerful or influential Mafia Boss or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">Villain with Good Publicity</a>. In that case, he will be treated in-story as a noble hero who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness">completely immune to temptation</a> and utterly dedicated to his duty. This can even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">apply</a> to petty criminals, resulting in, say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables">ten years spent chasing down a thief who stole a loaf of bread.</a>
</p><p>The Javert does not realize that the hero either is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClearMyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClearMyName">wrongly accused</a>, has already redeemed himself for crimes done long ago, or is working towards a much greater good and can't stop to pay for whatever petty or unjust law he may have violated. Perhaps the Javert simply doesn't care, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">the law is the law</a> with the rationale that the fugitive can always dispute the accusation in the courts, and one is either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality">on the side of the law, or on the side of crime</a>. Thus, the Javert is the type of person who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral">obeys the letter of the law, but not the spirit of the law</a>. Inspector Javert may be the reason the hero has to keep moving among <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureTowns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureTowns">Adventure Towns</a>. Often, the only way to slow him down is to defeat other violent criminals, then leave them for the Inspector to arrest and process before he can resume the chase.

However, once <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Light's memory is restored</span>, Light is guilty again and L's actions become justified, bringing him back to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticInspectorAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticInspectorAntagonist">Sympathetic Inspector Antagonist</a> status.

The first one shows up in England (pursues Sayid for having been a petty thief <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> but is foiled when he and Lunlun set out for Morocco</span>), the second is seen in Egypt (pursues Lunlun <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> as a side effect of her unknowingly becoming the accomplice of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanThief">Gentleman Thief</a> - he catches the thief but lets Lunlun go</span>), and the third one appears in Sicily (is on the case of Dario the bank robbing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who's about to slip away because of the state of regulations; but when Dario shows up to save a trapped Lunlun from an airtight bank vault, he allows Dario to leave as a free man since not only he chose Lunlun over his freedom, he actually turned himself in five minutes <em>after</em> the state kicked in.</span>)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> has Mustang and his crew do this to the Elric brothers. However, instead of wanting to arrest or kill them, he demanded to know why they ran off and didn't ask for his help.
</li><li> Junko Hattori of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DemonKingDaimao" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DemonKingDaimao">Demon King Daimao</a></em> has a rather nasty habit of this. When we're first introduced to her, she attacks Akuto because she automatically assumes that he was trying to mug her grandmother when he was just helping her out. After the reveal that Akuto is destined to become the next Demon King, Junko repeatedly hassles and tries to kill him, repeatedly mistaking his attempts to actually be good as evil.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIII">Lupin III</a></em> subverts this with Inspector Zenigata. Although driven to capture Lupin and his gang to the point of obsession, Zenigata isn't so blind as to not realize that unlike other career criminals, Lupin has a code of honor which leads to a mutual sense of respect between them despite being on opposite sides of the law. He also realizes that there are far worse individuals than Lupin and will begrudgingly join forces with him if doing so will serve the greater good. But that won't stop him from going back to chasing after Lupin once he's finished processing the villain of the week that they'd joined forces to take down.
</li><li> Game Master of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildDivers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildDivers">Gundam Build Divers</a></em> plays this frustratingly straight. During the initial Break Decal storyline, despite people approaching him and admitting their usage of the titular illegal items and video footage of people using them, he refuses to apprehend anyone because the Gunpla Battle Nexus Online game does not register the items and, thus, they haven't done anything illegal. On the other hand, when he realizes that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sarah is actually an electronic lifeform and threatening the game by her existence, he goes after her guns blazing, refusing to acknowledge the fact that she's a one-of-a-kind AI, but just "a bug"</span>

He actually began to accuse Bunnie Rabbot of being the traitor based on the knowledge that she left without telling anyone, but Sonic, who was already on the verge of strangling him for accusing Antoine, snapped and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">effectively dissuaded him from that one</a>, telling him to pack up and go home, because he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMillstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMillstone">really not helping</a>.
</li><li> In the Endgame arc, Sonic is accused of Sally's apparent murder. Geoffrey St. John is the arresting officer and the one who hunts him when he escapes. Despite personally knowing about such things as Robotnik's Auto Automatons, robots that can perfectly imitate people, he's fully prepared to believe the worst in Sonic and doesn't hesitate to chase him all the way to Angel Island, and it takes Dulcy, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLieDetector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLieDetector">Living Lie Detector</a>, telling him that Sonic was framed by Robotnik to get him to back off.

Justified because Batman is a vigilante, but Batman is oftentimes shown to be the only one that can take down the Villain-Of-The-Issue/Arc. <em>Batman</em> himself can sometimes fall into this, willing to chase down whichever criminal he's after (no matter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedCriminal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedCriminal">how justified</a> or how small-fry) to the literal ends of the Earth (and only getting more dogged if the criminal manages to avoid him <em>even once</em>, even to the point <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsYouAndHimFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsYouAndHimFight">that he's willing to go to war with other heroes, if they get in the way... heck, even other heroes are not exempt from him applying this Trope to them</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>).

Oh how he can go here. Dredd is extremely rigid in his application of the law, so he'll chase after people no matter how small the crime (even across <em>parallel universes</em>, as his crossovers with Batman can demonstrate). Played with in that he's not completely unreasonable though, as he has (occasionally, and on a good day) been shown to use his judgment to go easy on people because of special circumstances.
</li><li> A recurring antagonist in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KidColt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KidColt">Kid Colt</a></em> is Marshal Sam Hawk, a.k.a. 'the Manhunter', an honest lawman who was dogging Colt's trail because he honestly believed him to be an outlaw.
<ul><li> Sam is succeeded in this by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinkertonDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinkertonDetective">Pinkerton Detective</a> Caleb Hammer in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlazeOfGlory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlazeOfGlory">Blaze Of Glory</a></em> miniseries, seemingly so everyone who was anyone important in a Marvel western comic could show up for this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MsTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MsTree">Ms. Tree</a></em> has Captain Miller, who is constantly trying to put the eponymous heroine behind bars for her vigilante activities.
</li><li> A non-cop example, and arguably the most prominent comic-book example; J. Jonah Jameson, former editor of the Daily Bugle and current mayor of New York, and perpetual thorn in the side of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em>. Depending on who's writing him, he's depicted as total <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>, or as a semi-honorable businessman. When Peter was framed for murder during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga">The Clone Saga</a>, Jameson paid for Peter's legal defense. When Bastion threatened his life if he refused to print an editorial condemning mutants, Jameson (a civil-rights advocate) refused to give in to threats. Jameson is a skinflint, a tight-wad and on occasion a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">Bad Boss</a>, but is also often portrayed as a man with a strong sense of honor and fair play. And no matter how much good Spider-Man does for the city of New York, Jameson will still make it his mission to bring Spider-Man down. In the Ultimate Universe Jameson's positive qualities are played up a lot more, to the point where he eventually recognises Spider-Man as a hero (and he just restarts his crusade because he, at first, believes Miles Morales is desecrating Peter's memory. He lets go once Miles builds a better rep).
</li><li> General Sam Lane (Lois' father) has been portrayed as this to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Superman">Superman</a></em>, of all people. Pre the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a>, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewKrypton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewKrypton">New Krypton</a> storyline, he was straight up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">General Ripper</a> who was determined to destroy Superman's reputation and kill him, regardless of who got hurt in the process. In the New 52 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ActionComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ActionComics">Action Comics</a>, General Lane is portrayed as this in Superman's early years, where Superman is still a mysterious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">Good Is Not Nice</a> vigilante. He's still gunning for Superman, believing him to be a potential threat to America, but he's not the psychotic genocidal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">General Ripper</a> he was before the reboot.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> is this in <em>Target X</em>. He feels personally responsible for all the killings <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/X23" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/X23">X-23</a> has carried out because she slipped his grasp after her field test by masquerading as a wounded survivor. He reveals he's been tracking her down ever since (approximately <em>six years</em>) and is obsessed with bringing her to justice. He's driven to the point where he completely ignores <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil">Matt Murdock's</a> attempts to warn him that S.H.I.E.L.D. won't care really about justice but instead will use her as a weapon the same way she was used by the Facility. Before he can actually turn her over, however, he recognizes the truth of this and that Laura was as much a victim as the people she killed, and lets her go.
<ul><li> He goes back to this during the road to <em>Secret Wars 2016</em>, hunting down the Illuminati and goading every superhero he converses with into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithUsOrAgainstUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithUsOrAgainstUs">With Us or Against Us</a> situation&mdash;either they help him or they are abetting the Illuminati (even by inaction).

It turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the unit commander Colonel George Howe genuinely believes that the Punisher is a criminal who must be brought in... but, since he was rescued from captivity during the Vietnam War by Frank Castle's special operations team, he felt obligated to preserve Frank Castle's life &mdash; wanting to put him on trial, not put him down. (Eventually the generals' liaison with the Colonel believes that that's why he was so receptive to the orders.) After Frank Castle tells him about the tape and one of the generals inadvertently exposes his motivation, Howe views the tape and decides to release Castle so that he can kill the generals... but since the tape would so damage the credibility of the military, he flat-out tells Castle that he won't reveal the generals' crimes</span>.

But to this day, they pursue her and other relatives of hers, fearing the return of Dark Phoenix. Worse, most of their actions are the sort of thing that would make Jean <em>decide</em> to go kick their asses if she <em>did</em> ever return to that power level.

This plot thread was laid to rest when the traitor was revealed to be Onslaught. During the <em>Messiah Complex</em> arc, he became this to Hope (because on <em>his</em> timeline she grew up to be a villain) and in doing so (by means of <em>trying to kill her when she was only minutes born</em> and refusing any other alternatives) he jumped the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a>. He was so extreme that when Cable and Hope kept escaping with a time machine that only went forward, he decided the best way to corner them was to wipe out humanity and render the Earth uninhabitable (reasoning that he could just undo it later with his time machine). It took some serious handwaving to rehabilitate him after that.

</li><li> Commissioner Alcmeone Pinko, the other Pinko's father, who hunted Fantomius, the one whose legacy Paperinik inherited.

Not helping matters is that, prior to the start of the story, Naruto was involved in a gang-fight at Whirl City's Uzushio High School that resulted in several thugs being battered and the compound being damaged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">while not sustaining any injuries himself</a>, and basically got to relocate from the city instead of being arrested, for which Kaiza views him as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Karma Houdini</a>. However, there are a few things wrong with Kaiza's thinking: first, the Terrors themselves weren't even involved in Mrs. Kaiza's rape/murder and the men who did it were quickly caught and imprisoned not long afterward; second, Naruto was defending himself during the aforementioned gang fight when the gang's leader set the other thugs on him; and third, during the story's Gaiden chapters, it's indicated that Kaiza's motivation is more due to anger at Naruto being treated as a hero by the government instead of as the criminal (Kaiza believes) he should be treated as, whereas by comparison, despite his years of service on the force, Kaiza's been thrown under the bus by some gang members who blackmailed him into trying to kill Naruto in exchange for his daughter Hokuto's safety, just so the gangsters can try to get easier deals with the prosecution for themselves (it doesn't help that Kaiza had to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">team up with Naruto</a> to beat the thugs in order to rescue Hokuto).

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables">Les Mis&eacute;rables</a></em>
<ul><li> The book named the trope with the original Inspector Javert. In his face, the narrator describes seeing "what could be called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PureIsNotGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PureIsNotGood">all the evil</a> of good." Javert subverted the trope of maniacal lawfulness once in the book: during the street brawl of Fantine and Monsieur Bamatabois, he thought her guilty of everything and refused to hear how she had been attacked, because she was a prostitute. A character true to the spirit of the trope would have accused both of them. This is a display of idealism rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid">stupidity</a>&mdash;Fantine, being a prostitute, was already a law-breaker, whereas Monsieur Bamatabois was 'innocent.' Similarly, he refuses to accept that Jean Valjean was not necessarily in the wrong when he stole a loaf of bread, and he follows Valjean mercilessly for decades for what amounted to a parole violation. Worst of all <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">even after Valjean saves his life, Javert still can't make himself admit that he's wrong, and is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a> for his failure, in effect killing himself over his failure to accomplish a goal that never had any real importance.</span> <br><br>Alternatively, he could instead <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">have realized just</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteInsanity">how wrong he was about the world</a>, and critically failed to cope</span>. The lead-up to his suicide goes on for several pages, as we watch him struggle with a dilemma he can barely process. He seems to finally get the idea that the law is maybe too harsh on convicts: one of his last acts is to write down a list of pragmatic reforms for the local prison, such as suggesting that they should stop making prisoners stand around barefoot in the freezing cold <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy">because when they get sick it's expensive to treat them</a>. But this is, perhaps, the essence of his dilemma: he has operated under the belief that "law" and "good" are the same entity, but in this instance, they're clearly not. Letting Valjean go is moral, but unlawful; imprisoning him again is lawful, but immoral. No matter what he does, he betrays his purpose; since he can't serve his purpose, he finds no reason to live. <br><br>Also of note is that when Javert isn't chasing Valjean, he's otherwise very good at his job. He leads a group of Paris police officers in catching the Patron-Minette street gang, and correctly pegged "Monsieur Madeleine" as Valjean. However, when a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenIdentity">Mistaken Identity</a> leads him to think that he had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WronglyAccused" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WronglyAccused">Wrongly Accused</a> Madeleine, he begs Valjean to dismiss him for his screwup-showing that Javert is no more tolerant of his own sins than he is of anyone else's. Javert lives the most rigid and unyielding code of conduct of anyone in the novel, and shows mercy to no one - not even himself. By releasing Valjean, he's committed a capital crime. As a man of the law, his code of conduct requires that he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> give his life</span> as punishment for that crime.
</li><li> When Javert, in a particular scene, asks to be resigned from his duty because he thought Madeleine was Valjean, something he adamantly <em>resists</em> believing because "Madeleine" is an authority person (from his perspective), Valjean/Madeleine promptly asks him to go back to work, <em>because he understands what an excellent policeman Javert initially is</em>.

This led to the character of FBI Agent Mahone, who spent the first seven episodes portrayed as an intense, intelligent but well-intentioned FBI manhunter.

One episode dealt with him having a vital component stolen which, if not recovered, would lead to mental instability and eventually death. The component couldn't be easily replaced to laws against androids and manufacturing these components. He insisted on providing a method so he could be killed if he became a danger to public safety and refused to accept a replacement if doing so meant violating the law.

<ul><li> As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain">The Captain</a> of Alexandria's 'Knights of Pluto', Steiner is naturally distrustful of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanThief">Gentleman Thief</a> Zidane's intentions with Princess Garnet.

Once that happens, Steiner begins to realize that he had some part in what's happened, and vows to make amends.

Though the man is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">hilariously incompetent</a> at this, despite being very competent at everything else regarding his job, and very, very persistent.

<ul><li> Franziska doesn't care if the defendant is guilty or innocent, as long as she wins the trial. She doesn't really get over it until she starts working for Interpol in the spin-offs, and even then she has to butt heads with Edgeworth multiple times about what they think happened at a crime scene and who's responsible.
</li><li> Edgeworth in particular is like this toward the end of the first game's second case (when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Phoenix</span> is the defendant).

</li><li> Shi-Long Lang practices the "philosophy of detainment" laid down by his ancestor Lang-Zi. It can be boiled down to "arrest every suspicious person in the vicinity, then let the prosecutors figure out which ones are actually guilty." Except that he also despises prosecutors because one disgraced the Lang family, so he's pretty much a thorn in Edgeworth's side for most of the game. Amusingly, his wolf-like design inverts Javert's description as 'a Dog among Wolves.'

<ul><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine">Thomas the Tank Engine</a></em> had Thomas run afoul of a particularly over zealous constable who makes a big deal out of Thomas travelling down a tramway without cowcatchers and side plates, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">to which Thomas remarks that he doesn't catch cows</a>. The constable marks Thomas as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Delinquents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Delinquents">regular law breaker</a>, despite the fact that his predecessor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOnTheForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOnTheForce">whom Thomas was good friends with</a> had no problem with Thomas using that road. Supplementary materials written by the Reverend Awdry explain that the offending officer enforced small laws that none of his peers really cared about. In the time that the episode takes place in (1951), the law in question, a Ministry of Transportation regulation, had actually been repealed for several years, meaning that the constable was <em>enforcing an outdated law</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Batman Beyond</a>:</em> Barbara tends to come off as such towards Terry. It's shown to its greatest extent in "Eyewitness," in which Spellbinder uses his illusion technology to make Barbara believe that Batman had murdered Mad Stan in cold blood. When he is exposed and promptly arrested, Spellbinder takes the time to taunt Barbara:
<div class="indent"><strong>Spellbinder</strong>: You were <em>so</em> ready to believe the worst [in Batman], <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfIllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfIllusion">it</a> was <em>easy</em>.
</div><ul><li> Barbara <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">even acknowledges herself</a> that she screwed up big-time and gives Terry a public service award as an apology.
</li></ul></li><li> In the first two seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBatman">The Batman</a></em>, the grouchy and hot tempered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief">Chief Rojas</a> was this to Batman, thinking him just as much a "freak" as the guys in Arkham. In the first season, Detective Ellen Yin was the same, but she changed her mind by season two, becoming Batman's ally.
</li><li> Agent James Bennet in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheZetaProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheZetaProject">The Zeta Project</a></em> genuinely believes that Zeta has been turned against them and is a threat. Despite the number of times he has saved people, the comments of his own team, and the time Zeta saved his own son. But this may have changed when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he overheard that the chip in Zeta's head was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalityChip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalityChip">conscience chip</a>, and is indeed <em>not</em> working for terrorists</span>. However the show was canceled before anything could be shown.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SwatKats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SwatKats">SWAT Kats</a></em>: Commander Feral, continually running them down to the media for the property damaged caused by actually stopping the threats to the public. At least partially because he and the Enforcers are unable to.
</li><li> Truant Officer Langley Turk from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fillmore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fillmore">Fillmore!</a></em> episode "Field Trip of the Just". Turk is determined to bust Fillmore for truancy because of Fillmore's delinquent past. Fillmore actually has a pass allowing him to be out of school, but Turk assumes it is a forgery.
<ul><li> To be fair when Turk had reason to to believe Filmore was playing truant since he ran away when asked to produce the pass again. Though by that point the pass had been destroyed so he 'couldn't' have given it to him. Not that Turk would have believed him anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> Flint in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GIJoeRenegades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GIJoeRenegades">G.I. Joe: Renegades</a></em>. He pursues the titular Renegades for their actions against COBRA, not knowing that COBRA is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">Villain with Good Publicity</a>.

So does their regular arch-nemesis, who wants to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRuleTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRuleTogether">team up with him</a>. Coop's attempts to prove that he is a good guy don't work out very well.
</li><li> Leela is like this towards Fry when they first meet on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>, relentlessly pursuing him in attempt to assign him a career. It's later subverted, as she's chasing after Fry on orders only, and hates her job. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This is what makes her quit and join Fry and Bender.</span>
</li><li> The Van Helsing parody Ludwig Von Goosewing in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CountDuckula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CountDuckula">Count Duckula</a></em>, who is fundamentally incapable of grasping that his quarry is a harmless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VegetarianVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VegetarianVampire">Vegetarian Vampire</a>.
</li><li> Razoul from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin">Aladdin</a></em> is also this, though particularly in the animated series he has his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticInspectorAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticInspectorAntagonist">Sympathetic Inspector Antagonist</a> moments. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">He does get better</a> at the end of the threequel, though</span>.
</li><li> Jim from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko">Code Lyoko</a></em> is this for Season 1. He suspects that Jeremie and his friends are up to no good since they've been sneaking around a lot within the last few months. Near the end of the season, his determination to find out the truth leads to him chasing Jeremie through the dorms, which leads to the latter getting a twisted ankle and Jim being fired. But that leads to him learning the truth and becoming an ally, meaning that after the gang presses the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a>, he becomes a much better character.
</li><li> Solomon, the leader of G3 (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal">Galactic Guardian Group</a>) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan">Sym-Bionic Titan</a></em>. He's not a villain, but still is suspicious of whoever's controlling the Titan.

He is right, but Zuko has changed from an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a> to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByronicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByronicHero">Byronic Hero</a>, and the audience is set up to expect that he'll make a full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a> any time now - leading most of said audience to root for Zuko and consider Jet an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspectorJavert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspectorJavert">Inspector Javert</a>. Then Zuko <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">helps Azula take over Ba Sing Se, revealing Jet to really have been a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticInspectorAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticInspectorAntagonist">Sympathetic Inspector Antagonist</a></span>.
<ul><li> On its continuation series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>, Chief Bei Fong's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment">Establishing Character Moment</a> is getting in Korra's face after she faces off against some members of the local Triad and demolishes half of the street taking them down and gives her the riot act, declaring that the fact she's the Avatar (and the reincarnation of her mother's best friend) will not earn her any special treatment from her (and almost has her tossed in jail until Tenzin arrives and negotiates). Many episodes afterwards have her treating Korra like a punk even after it's been made clear that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopsNeedTheVigilante" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopsNeedTheVigilante">The Cops Need The Avatar.</a>

He also totally ignores anything Commissioner Gordon says in their defense and suspends them from the force. Gordon finally gets fed up with him when Montoya helps Batman takes down the gang the sting operation was supposed to catch and Hackle begins berating her for doing so since she was suspended, and severely reprimands Hackle for his unprofessionall behavior.
