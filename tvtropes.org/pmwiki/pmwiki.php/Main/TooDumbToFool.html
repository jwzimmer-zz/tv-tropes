</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Something like this occurs during the Chunin Exam <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">arc</a>, when Sasuke comes up with a plan to figure out if somebody is infiltrating the group using a transformation jutsu. His plan was to come up with a very, very, long password. Later, when someone does come disguised as Naruto and gets the password right, Sasuke realizes that it's an impostor because he knew Naruto would never be able to remember the whole thing.
<div class="indent"><strong>Sasuke:</strong> You'd have better luck teaching it to a hamster.
</div></li><li> Also comes to Naruto's aid during the first part of the Chunin Exams. The ninja candidates are given an insanely difficult written test, with the implicit understanding that what's <em>really</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">being tested</a> are their covert information gathering skills (i.e. being able to cheat on the test without getting caught). However, the way the test is set up (You get ten questions, the tenth of which is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveYourQuestTest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveYourQuestTest">"Leave Your Quest" Test</a>. For the first nine questions, the proctors are watching like hawks and will fail you if you get caught cheating enough. Students are told that wrong answers will also lose them points, but this doesn't actually happen because if you answer the tenth question correctly, you automatically pass.) means that the only thing that will actually get you failed is getting caught cheating. Naruto manages to pass the test <em>without doing anything at all</em>, as he didn't know the answers to the questions, was dumb enough to miss the implication that the test was really on his cheating skills, and brave enough to pass the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">Secret Test of Character</a> at the end. Sakura also never realized that she was supposed to cheat, because she didn't need to - she was smart enough to just work out the answers legitimately.

To quote how they're depicted in this series, Seiren only know how to sleep, eat, have sex, and play. The majority of them don't even realize or understand they're on the verge of extinction. Their temporary representative, Amira, is formidable simply because she <em>knows</em> and <em>acknowledges</em> she is dumb, unlike the rest of her race. Thus she manages to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">outplay a Dhampir with more brains than her</span> simply because the opponent didn't think her capable of it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ToraDora" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ToraDora">Tora Dora</a></em>, Yasuko tends to talk and act like a child, but often says or does exactly the right thing to make people feel better or understand each other without even realizing it. Could also be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotSavant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotSavant">Idiot Savant</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">manipulative sociopath</a> Izaya names this as the reason why he hates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">Heiwajima</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper">Shizuo</a> &mdash; the guy is just too thick (and too angry) to fall prey to Izaya's mind games. The fact that Shizuo returns the sentiment (so every time he believes he is stuck in a mind game, his first strategy always is "find Izaya and bludgeon him to a bloody pulp", which turns out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">a pretty effective counter</a>) is only icing on the cake.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheLawOfUeki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheLawOfUeki">The Law of Ueki</a></em>, BJ starts off trying to win fights by claiming to be Robert Haydn, which causes people to run in fear. While Mori falls for this, Ueki just remembers that BJ introduced himself as BJ earlier that day, and just can't seem to understand BJ's claims that his name is really Robert Haydn... and keeps insisting that he's really BJ. The fact that he doesn't even know who Robert Haydn is probably helps.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21">Eyeshield 21</a></em>, Riku of the Seibu Wild Gunmen realizes, to his horror, that Rikiya Gaoh of the Hakushu Dinosaurs is too single-minded to fall for his feint, on top of being too big and strong to have to worry about it. Although Gaoh isn't dumb at all &mdash; he's just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack">too unsubtle, blunt and single-minded to be tricked</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Katanagatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Katanagatari">Katanagatari</a></em>:
<ul><li> Yasuri Shichika isn't exactly dumb &mdash; but he has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSocialSkills">No Social Skills</a>, with his only human interaction being his father and his sister until Togame came along and the series started. As such, he is barely able to distinguish between people, and when a ninja used an impressive technique to impersonate Togame, Shichika immediately punched him even when he didn't know who it was yet.
</li><li> Shichika has been on the receiving end of this as well. His first major defeat was against a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">super-strong</a> little girl named Konayuki who had no understanding of combat and who just swung her sword around wildly. Shichika practices a martial art that focuses heavily on feinting and predicting your opponent&#146;s moves, neither of which worked on her.
</li></ul></li><li> Gon Freecss from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter &times; Hunter</a></em> is too childish and naive to fool. In a game where he and his opponent had to light candles and keep them burning, he was presented with two choices. Pick the long one or pick the short one. His friends speculate that the long one could be a trap but the short one could <em>also</em> be a trap. He picks the long one because it would <em>obviously</em> burn longer. However, it turns out that it doesn't burn longer because the candle he picked was special and burned three times as quickly as the shorter one. His opponent eventually reveals to us that he hid several booby-trapped candles under his shirt and would've given Gon a booby-trapped candle no matter which candle he picked. And despite all the deceptions and trap-laying, Gon realizes that his booby-trapped candle is burning so fiercely that there's no way it could be extinguished short of running out of wick. He then puts it down and uses his superior speed to move in and blow out the enemy's candle himself.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a>,</em> a player keeping two Islands untapped implies that they have a Counterspell in their hand. Similarly, a player tapping all of their Forests except one implies that they are holding a Giant Growth. Sometimes, players will attempt to <em>bluff</em> their opponents by keeping those lands untapped even when they don't have the necessary cards in hand. This tactic works best against intermediate players, because beginners don't yet know enough about the game to know what two untapped Islands or one untapped Forest signifies, and expert players are usually able to see through their opponents' bluffs. Many a <em>Magic : The Gathering</em> player has seen a bluff fail completely because they didn't realize that their opponents were, ironically, <em>too inexperienced</em> to fall for it.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a> likes to describe characters this way in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>. Detritus the troll, Fred Colon, and the Palace Guards in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GuardsGuards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GuardsGuards">Guards! Guards!</a>!</em> have all been characterized this way at some point.
<ul><li> Commander Vimes takes advantage of Detritus' nature to prevent people getting where he doesn't want them.
</li><li> The Palace Guards have been stated to be hired for precisely this trait.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThiefOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThiefOfTime">Thief of Time</a></em>, where the story of the Emperor's New Clothes is mentioned, and the book then points out that the story ended before it got to the bit where the kid was beaten for being rude to royalty.
</li><li> Also seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MakingMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MakingMoney">Making Money</a></em>, where Moist tests his paper currency on particularly "slow" shopkeepers (although he does distinguish between "slow" and "stupid", with the implication he can persuade a stupid man of anything). If he can convince them, he can convince anyone. "Slow" here refers to mental inertia. These are men to whom new ideas are very dodgy. Not stupid (they can make wrong change as quick as you can blink), but set in their ways.
</li><li> A related concept is that children on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a> don't have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor">Weirdness Censor</a>, because they don't know they're not <em>supposed</em> to be able to see the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimReaper">Grim Reaper</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFifthElephant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFifthElephant">The Fifth Elephant</a></em>, it is suggested that one reason the Clacks is so efficient that it can function as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BambooTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BambooTechnology">Bamboo Internet</a> is that it employs Discworld's gargoyles, who are good at watching and too uncreative to make mistakes.
</li><li> The picture taking imps are the same way; they're only intelligent enough to paint what they see, very fast. They can't paint what isn't there.
</li><li> Banjo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hogfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hogfather">Hogfather</a></em> is far too clueless to follow the criminal gang's plotting, yet he notices that the bar suddenly has a waiter (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">actually, Mr. Teatime</span>).

</li><li> Throughout <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InterestingTimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InterestingTimes">Interesting Times</a></em>, whenever someone says they would rather die than betray the Emperor, Cohen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded">kills them</a>. When the Silver Horde encounters a guard by the name of One Big River and ask him whether he'd rather die than betray the Emperor, One Big River (who isn't bright enough to see in terms of metaphor) answers, "I tink I rather live." The Horde, seeing value in a man too dumb to think in the empire's strict mental paths, bring him along.
</li><li> Apparently, it takes at least five minutes to explain anything to Mustrum Ridcully. His subordinates consider this an advantage, because it means that people will only ever bother him with <em>really</em> important matters. Of course, there are many hints in the books that this may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a>, so it might be deliberate on his part for the very same reason... It's been stated that Ridcully doesn't start paying attention for a few minutes, because if someone's still trying to explain something to him after that long, it must be worth listening to.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReaperMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReaperMan">Reaper Man</a></em> provides a possible explanation: it's not so much that Ridcully is stupid, but that his mind is like an old locomotive; it takes a while for it to get up to speed...but once it's <em>at</em> speed, it's going at a pretty good clip. It just can't be steered.
</li><li> Note that it is for this precise reason he gets on with Ponder Stibbons: the young lad is always trying to explain stuff to him. So Ridcully will often listen to Stibbons more often than not.
</li><li> Stibbons is also smart enough to know when to stop trying to explain and just say, basically, "it's magic". They're <em>wizards</em>, and magic is <em>what they're highly trained to avoid doing</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1989r');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1989r" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1989r');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Discworld's magic has such a history of being destructive and irreversible that Ankh-Morpork's resident wizards tend to avoid doing it when possible.

</li><li> Heinrich von Kleist's essay <em>On the Marionette Theater</em>: A top class fencer finds his master in a bear. The bear parries all the fencers thrusts because it cannot be fooled by feints and tricks due to its lack of consciousness and understanding. In a number of similar examples, the essay laments human consciousness (a consequence of the Fall of Man) as imperfect - as opposed to the perfect consciousness of God and the nonexistent consciousness of animals. The imperfect consciousness stands in Mankind's way to beauty, grace and happiness, which both God and the Animal can achieve (for different reasons).

He explains that the Battle was just a display of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTactics">Hollywood Tactics</a> that <em>would</em> have scared off a more conventional enemy through "shock and awe", but the zombies (being literally brain-dead) only saw a huge amount of humans to eat and kept on coming regardless of losses and ignoring the massive explosions and gunfire that was going on around them. As a result, because the higher-ups decided to use weapons that were highly intimidating but lacked anti-personnel power and hadn't arrayed the defenses better to suit the enemy (among other stupid decisions); the Battle instead became a massacre.

Marcus, feeling bad that he bet against his brother does his best to help him practice despite only knowing how the pieces move.

They all turn to Todd expectantly, waiting for him to suggest that he accept payment later, but he just stares blankly back at them, too socially inept to read the unspoken request. After an awkward pause, they give up and try a second tack, which Todd <em>is</em> dumb enough to fall for.

Norm then tries the same trick on Coach, who merely accepts the claim without comment.

Unfortunately, Nacho's gambit falls apart because Daniel is too much of an idiot to realize he shouldn't go to the cops and reports the theft instead, which necessitates Mike and Jimmy to step in before everyone involved goes to prison or worse.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Some compulsion spells have as a condition that the target must have a minimum amount of Intelligence (usually 3) to understand what you're trying to compel them to do. However, that isn't quite this trope because less than that is animal intelligence. It'd be like trying to hypnotize a cat.
</li><li> Though some other powers will affect only a stricter range of intelligence, sparing those who are either too smart or too stupid. For example, the 2nd Edition psionic devotion "post-hypnotic suggestion" only works on a subject with a score between 7 and 17.
</li><li> All compulsion and most illusion spells have an intelligence requirement of "some". Many creatures, such as undead and constructs (fantasy robots) can solve logical problems but lack a conscious intellect and are thus immune to mental manipulation, including bluffs and feints in combat.
</li><li> And, obviously, anything that involves manipulating a creature in a specific way (giving orders, etc.) usually requires that it be smart enough to know your language... which can be an issue for perfectly intelligent, say, goblins or giants who simply aren't multilingual and don't get the common language by default. This applies to both mundane social skills and spells; a caster with powerful mind-affecting magic or insanely good social stats can be paralyzed by sharing no languages with a weak-willed creature that should be their plaything.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape">Planescape</a> also has the Clueless &mdash; basically the assumption that anyone from the Prime Material Plane is an idiot who doesn't understand how the planes work. There is a running theme in most supplementary materials, however, that point out that this can make primes the most unpredictably dangerous beings to deal with, especially from some worlds (like Krynn) where the lack of planar contact may mean they assume any planar is automatically a demon. There's also the fact that while planar factions engage in ideological struggles, it is the Prime where most of the belief that shaped the plane come from. The player guide in the campaign setting also notes that Clueless make popular mercenaries, since they don't have any factional loyalties.
</li></ul></li><li> The Orks of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> fit this trope. They cannot be fooled with a cunning tactical ruse, they won't attack an enemy's command structure or supply chains, they'll simply charge at whatever is right in front of them. This causes no shortage of headaches for many of the setting's centuries-old commanders, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplexityAddiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplexityAddiction">can't break out of the deceptive warfare habit</a>. It doesn't help that they sometimes mix it up with completely random tactics on a whim, which frequently results in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance">Achievements in Ignorance</a> or a case of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWouldBeStupidEnough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWouldBeStupidEnough">Who Would Be Stupid Enough?</a>". It makes sense considering the Orks' two deities, Gork and Mork, embody brutal cunning (hits you even harder when you're looking) and cunning brutality (hits you when you're not looking) respectively. It's a tossup which Ork deity's philosophy an Ork considers the best. The most dangerous Orks are the ones who are brutally cunning <em>and</em> cunningly brutal.

<ul><li> In "The Joy of Sect", Homer resists the most powerful persuasion techniques of the Movementarian cult thanks to his negligible IQ and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitOohShiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitOohShiny">attention span</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">They eventually succeed</a> when they use a technique <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatThemAtTheirOwnGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatThemAtTheirOwnGame">that's as stupid as he is</a>: change the lyrics to the 1960's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966">Batman (1966)</a></em> score from "Batman" to "Leader".
</li><li> In "Last Exit to Springfield", there was also Mr. Burns' numerous attempts to negotiate with Homer when he became head of the union for the Power Plant. Homer being Homer, he mistakes the innuendo Mr. Burns is using to offer Homer a bribe for <em>sexual</em> innuendo, and leaves thinking Mr. Burns is coming on to him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> at the end of the episode when Homer celebrates his victory for the union with an extended <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges">Three Stooges</a> esque "woop woop woop woop" leading Mr. Burns to comment that Homer might not be the master negotiator that he'd taken him to be.
</li><li> In "Homer's Enemy", Frank Grimes, who is frustrated by Homer's dumb luck, attempts to show the power plant the follies of putting a complete idiot in charge of plant safety by holding a "Design Your Own Power Plant" contest meant for elementary school age students. Homer enters a power plant with aerodynamic wings to lower wind resistance and a racing stripe, and even after Grimes tells Homer that the contest was meant for school-age children, Mr. Burns and the plant employees still give him a standing ovation, much to Frank Grimes' chagrin.
</li><li> In "Homer the Moe", Homer took over Moe's duties as bar tender. When Bart tried his usual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrankCall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrankCall">Prank Call</a>, Homer <em>immediately</em> recognizes that it is Bart pranking him but is eager to go along. He doesn't get the joke however, even after Bart explains it to him, so Bart just hangs up in disgust.
</li><li> In "Dead Putting Society", Lisa tries to deliver the classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Koan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Koan">Koan</a> of "What is the sound of one hand clapping?" to Bart. He simply slaps the fingers and palm of one hand together.
</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Squidbillies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Squidbillies">Squidbillies</a></em>, when Early walks in on his wife naked with the band .38 Special, and they try to convince him nothing is going on:
<div class="indent"><strong>Early:</strong> .38 Special? How the hell you boys doin'! <br><strong>Larry:</strong> Uh, we're just hanging out... <br><strong>Early:</strong> Well, it says here on this shirt you're supposed to be playing up in Pittsburgh tonight. <br><strong>Don:</strong> That shirt's from 1984. <br><em>[long pause]</em> <br><strong>Early:</strong> Hell, that ain't this year! What's goin' on here?!
</div></li><li> Luanne from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em> tops this trope by being too dumb to brainwash when she accidentally joins a cult. Meanwhile, her aunt, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll">Know-Nothing Know-It-All</a> Peggy, not only encourages her to go back to the cult after she escapes, but falls under their sway almost effortlessly.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWeekenders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWeekenders">The Weekenders</a></em>, dimwitted Bluke figures out the answers to the clues for the scavenger hunt because he doesn't bother to think they're cryptic and complicated, as the main cast assumes... and nets them second place and a pizza &mdash; which he similarly correctly realizes is a better prize than the first-place pool table, since the game was played by five-person teams, and you can't "split" a pool table.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em>: In "The Secret Origin of Denzel Crocker", it's revealed that March the 15th is the day Crocker is more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher">Sadist Teacher</a> than the rest of the year and tortures all students in specific ways. While wondering what to do with Timmy Turner, he decides against using rhetorical questions (like he did with A.J.) because Turner isn't intelligent enough to get frustrated by them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em>: Though the above quote from "Jack-Wabbit and the Beanstalk" isn't an example, the short does have an instance where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny">Bugs Bunny</a> tricks the Giant into a duel at twenty paces, counting on the latter's giant steps to take him far away. Instead, the Giant's steps take him <em>all the way around the cloud they're on</em>, putting Bugs right back where he started.
</li><li> During the "Brainwashed" multi-parter near the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinkyAndTheBrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinkyAndTheBrain">Pinky and the Brain</a></em>, the mice are captured and, appropriately enough, brainwashed. Or, at least, Brain is. Pinky is entirely unaffected due to his low intelligence. Later, as Brain starts to return to normal, he manages to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb">Logic Bomb</a> the brainwashing computer by introducing it to the concept of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic">Narf</a>", which Pinky cannot help but "define" when the computer derides it as a non-word.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButtHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButtHead">Beavis and Butt-Head</a></em>, when the duo harasses a man named Harry Sachs with prank calls one too many times, he gets Caller ID to trace the call back, and calls them pretending to be a pizza delivery man. Only problem is, the two are too stupid to even know their own address, so instead they give him the address from some mail they took from their neighbor, Stuart.
</li><li> Baloo and Kit run into a gangster pair of these in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Talespin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Talespin">Talespin</a></em> episode "Time Waits for No Bear". Their solution is to pick a dumber plan.

<ul><li> Many magicians don't like having children in the audience, because they often don't pay attention to the nonverbal cues magicians use to distract the audience and notice what they're actually doing.
</li><li> There's a saying that goes "The best swordsman in the world does not fear the second-best swordsman; he fears the worst swordsman, because he has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu">no idea</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrategySchmategy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrategySchmategy">what that idiot will do</a>." This can, of course, translate to a wide array of undertakings.
</li><li> "Professionals are predictable, but the world is full of dangerous amateurs."
</li><li> This trope is actively applied in the military, where scenarios and exercises are thrown at very young and inexperienced officers, or officers being called upon to act outside of their area of expertise, precisely to see what nuggets can be gleaned from their approaching the problem with a complete lack of experience. They've been thrown outside of their comfort zone, so they often come up with ideas that would not even occur to more experienced leaders.
</li><li> An excellent example would be the Doolittle Raid. A Naval <em>anti-submarine warfare officer</em>, with no experience flying planes, was at a Navy base early in the war, watching Army B-25's take off and land. What he also noticed was that for training purposes for Navy pilots, the runway was painted with the outline of an aircraft carrier. That got him to wondering if a B-25 could take off from an aircraft carrier. Since he had no flying experience, he didn't know that such a thing had never even been considered...
</li><li> In software testing, this is why some of the biggest bugs slip past QA (who know how the software is supposed to react and are trained programmers), and are found by end users who attempt something <em>no-one</em> in QA would bother to try (like running a sprite through a wall) or completely ignoring all the directions given in the tutorial. This is where open betas come into play: ordinary users without a lick of programming or in-house testing experience are invited to try them and report bugs as they come across them, though this has been known to invite complaints from impatient users who expect open betas to be as polished as release builds.
<ul><li> An example of this was from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CreeperWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CreeperWorld">Creeper World</a></em>, where in the last level (where you're supposed to build a ship to destroy the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyGoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyGoo">Creeper</a>) players stuck to the tried-and-true tactics of forcing the creeper back, capping the emitters, and activating the totems. It just took more time and units. This uncovered a bug in which the game <em>couldn't end</em> because the ship hadn't been built. This bug was fixed, and a congratulatory message for doing it the hard way was added.
</li><li> There is an essay-length piece in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">instruction manual</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioMaker">Super Mario Maker</a></em> specifically about this issue. They warn people who intend to make courses that they may think their courses are simple and straightforward, but as the wider audience plays them, they <em>will</em> find things in your course you didn't intend. They also state not to get annoyed when this happens and that it's a common part of the game-making process.
</li></ul></li><li> This is also a concern in matters military. Several of the greatest innovations in warfare were the result of amateurs making war without the baggage that professionals had acquired over centuries.
</li><li> According to <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beginner%27s_luck">The Other Wiki<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> one possible explanation for what is commonly called "beginner's luck" is that beginners are not limited in their thinking to what is the "right" way to win, and explore wider possibilities. Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw">90% of these possibilities are terrible ones</a>, and the majority of the remainder are already codified as "the right way", but every now and again... Although before you decide to go gamble your life's savings in a Poker tournament with an "unconventional strategy", bear in mind that stories of beginner's luck suffer heavily from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorshipBias" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorshipBias">Survivorship Bias</a>.
</li><li> Historians have often attributed Joan of Arc's military success, not to divine intervention, but due to her lack of knowledge of military tactics. While the English expected the French to continue with their regular pattern, an unprecedented full frontal assault completely caught them off guard. Later in the campaign they had adapted, and she suffered as many major defeats as victories. However if one believes her peers like the Bastard of Orleans or looks at both common tactics and case of supplies, out of her 3 defeats (not counting a retreat order of the King himself), only one can count for the dumb part of this trope due to her ordering an attack while low on supplies and refusing to wait for reinforcements that were already mobilized and on the way. The other 2 defeats were due to the King ordering her, who mainly had experience in using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">cannon</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack">cavalry</a> and main strategies involved breaking inflexible defenses of sieges through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">fear or firepower</a>, to try and take care of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualGrinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualGrinder">defensive</a>.
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, the Germans tried to lure a French force into attacking, whereupon they would be isolated and massacred. To accomplish this, they faked a hole in their security. This might have worked, had the French commander in charge of the area not been too dim to notice the weak point.
</li><li> During the second world war, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MI5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MI5">MI-5</a> did a deliberately botched operation on a German spy so that he would report back to his masters with false information about British interrogation techniques. The idea behind it was to make him look so obviously and incompetently subverted that they'd think that he must be the only one who had been compromised &mdash; they had actually captured or bribed most or all of the German spies, but they figured if the Germans assumed MI-5 was that incompetent, they'd think the others weren't compromised, as they weren't giving such blatantly false information. It wasn't a total loss, as they did indeed fail to realize that the others had been compromised... but since they didn't even realize the decoy had been, the operation was simply a waste of time and money.
</li><li> People who consider themselves to be highly intelligent and perceptive can be suckered into scams and such things far more easily than one would suspect, precisely because they think that they're too smart to fool, and as a result, they simply can't imagine themselves falling for a scam, because getting fleeced is only for morons who couldn't spot an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousTrap">Obvious Trap</a> if it danced naked in front of them, waved a flag with those words written on it, and performed a dramatic jazzy Las Vegas showtune song and dance routine spelling everything out in lurid detail. Well, scams are called confidence tricks for a reason.
</li><li> People with lower IQ scores are also generally more resistant to hypnosis or hypnotic suggestion. This is usually attributed to that hypnosis requires the subject to be able to focus their attention at a single point for an extended time, and low IQ tends to correspond with a short attention span.
</li><li> This trope is why children under 7 have a higher survival rate if lost than children 7-9. They don't know how much trouble they're in, so they don't make as many dumb mistakes and will usually just settle down somewhere and save their energy until they're found. Older children will know they're in danger and panic, using up valuable energy as they try to find their way out and keep moving so rescuers can't find them.
</li><li> Similarly, a very small child is more likely to survive a serious auto accident with fewer injuries in part because unlike adults, who will reflexively tense up right before an impact if they see it coming and hurt themselves more, kids will remain limp and be able to weather it better. This is also why drivers who fall asleep (either because of exhaustion, alcohol and/or drug consumption) and crash are less likely to be seriously injured since they're also limp at the time of impact. The same goes for drunks and other impaired persons that are conscious but unaware of the impending crash.
