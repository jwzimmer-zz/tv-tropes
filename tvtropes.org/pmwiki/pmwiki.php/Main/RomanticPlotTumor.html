</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTropes">Love</a> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">powerful</a> emotion. It can completely change the way a character acts and thinks. It can be used to create <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveHurts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveHurts">drama</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouStupid">stupidity</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouCrazy">comedic relief</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">suspense</a>. Maybe the writer just wants to tug at the audience's heart in a way they couldn't with the rest of the story. Whatever the reason for introducing it, love is a powerful tool in storytelling that can also make the audience feel okay with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoitusEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoitusEnsues">abrupt, arbitrary sex scenes</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>However, like most tools, a love story can be deadly in the wrong hands. Sometimes, a writer gets so caught up in wringing every last drop of blood out of their romantic stone that they forget they have a compelling A-story to tell. This results in a Romantic Plot Tumor: a comparatively weak romantic sub-plot overtakes the potentially more interesting main plot.
</p><p>At best, it results in a compelling little side-romance between two minor characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriangRelations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriangRelations">(or sometimes more than two characters)</a> that avoids becoming too important in the grand scheme of things. At worst, it becomes a monster unto itself and brings the whole story down with it.
</p><p>A telltale sign of a Romantic Plot Tumor is that you could edit out the romance thread completely and have the story still make sense (and be a more bearable length). Very common in superhero movies. The sad thing is that the creators usually put some thought and effort into crafting the romance; it isn't a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenRomance">Token Romance</a>, but it turns out to be more of a glaring intrusion than a typical Token Romance.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedLoveInterest">Designated Love Interest</a>, where a romantic subplot is given so <em>little</em> focus that it feels fake; why are these characters who barely know each other convinced that they're soulmates?
</p><p>Obviously, considering the emotional nature of romance and the contentious issue of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping">Shipping</a> that arises out of it, most of these examples will fall into subjective territory.
</p><p>A specific form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift">Genre Shift</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTumor">Plot Tumor</a>.
</p><p>Strongly overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot">They Wasted a Perfectly Good Plot</a>, as many audience members who liked the plot that got overshadowed by the romance will likely end up coming to this conclusion.
</p><p>Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHuggingNoKissing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHuggingNoKissing">No Hugging, No Kissing</a>, which may stem from the writers having a strong desire to avoid this.
</p><p>Compare and contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString">Strangled by the Red String</a>, which can overlap with this, but often happens as a result of the writers <em>not</em> letting the romantic subplot take much screentime away from the main plot, resulting in its resolution happening abruptly out of nowhere with little build-up beforehand.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds">7 Seeds</a></em> with its repeated moments of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers">Hana and Arashi</a>. The two are put into different teams and are unaware if the other is even <em>alive</em>, which causes fear and loss for each. While they do, eventually, find out that both are in the post-apocalyptic world, they are still kept apart. The reader is never actually told <em>why</em> they became a couple before the got put into cryostasis, the unnecessary drama of worrying about the other can feel out of place during intense moments in the series and Hana's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsenceMakesTheHeartGoYonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsenceMakesTheHeartGoYonder">slight attraction</a> to Aramaki not only feels like it is forced to begin with but made worse <em>because</em> of her insistence on staying true to Arashi. As noble as that may appear, it makes one wonder why Hana is having this attraction subplot when it easily could be used for one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleCast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleCast">other characters</a> and expand upon them. The emphasis on Hana and Arashi's love can also feel like it's taking up potential time to show the <em>other</em> romances that are beginning to blossom among the cast. All in all, it comes across as if Hana and Arashi's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers">Star-Crossed Lovers</a> aspect is played up more and more simply for rule of cheap, emotional drama.
</li><li> This is actually kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inverted</a> in a story such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>. Set in a world of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkFantasy">dark</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy">fantastic fantasy</a>, Guts is always fighting monsters and traveling to new and strange places with his new team of companions. But despite the constant action and blood and gore that is present, some tend to forget that his main motivation in the story right now <em>is</em> centered around his love for Casca, since he is traveling to the distant island of Elfhelm in hopes that he can find a cure for her insanity so that they can be together again. The greater <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> does involve a lot more than just their relationship (the story revolves around the relationship between Guts and his former friend turned foe Griffith), but Guts willingly put revenge aside for Casca, which adds to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>. Due to how rarely new chapters come out, this has led to complaints that the series is spending <em>too much</em> time on fighting monsters, and not enough time on getting Casca cured so she and Guts can move forward. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Casca is finally cured, Guts approaches her, they are about to talk... cut to more monster fighting.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars">Food Wars!</a></em> began an arc about the appearance of underground chefs who threaten to smear Tootsuki's reputation by abusing the Shokugeki system. This set-up was apparently nothing but a vehicle to introduce a <em>romantic</em> rival who wants to win Erina's hand. This ended up invalidating Erina's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>. She went from a strong girl to a fragile person who is willing to turn her back on her friends and spend the rest of her life with some obnoxious creepy stranger just to satisfy her absentee mother who prioritizes gourmet over her daughter's wellbeing. Worse, Soma and Asahi make it clear that they are only interested in Erina's God Tongue to further their culinary skills, although Soma is slightly concerned for her wellbeing. Soma finally quashes Asahi, only for Erina to conveniently regain her confidence and curb stomp Soma at the BLUE finals. Soma heads overseas and cuts off contact with Erina. In the epilogue, in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">inane twist</a>, Asahi is revealed to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Erina's half-brother and Azami's illegitimate son, retrospectively making the whole BLUE Arc to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseIncest">Surprise Incest</a>.</span> The conclusion of the epilogue exacerbated it further: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> between Soma and Erina ultimately results in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeEverAfter">Maybe Ever After</a>, meaning that there was never a reason to introduce a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> in the first place.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HappinessChargePrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HappinessChargePrettyCure">Happiness Charge Pretty Cure</a></em> suffered terribly from this due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> between Megumi, her best friend Seiji and the Cures' mentor Blue. Seiji has a crush on Megumi, but Megumi was starting to have feelings for Blue (something that hadn't been seen since the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YesPrettyCure5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YesPrettyCure5">Yes! Pretty Cure 5</a></em> saga), but Blue had been sending mixed signals all the way, running with the "Precure cannot fall in love" spiel while having <em>something</em> towards Megumi. There's this entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a> until the <em>entire subplot is dropped</em> when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Cures rescue Queen Mirage, return her to her true form &mdash; a Cure in the past that <em>Blue fell in love with and broke her heart because of his duties</em> &mdash; and they fell in love again</span>! And anything between Megumi and Seiji is flat-out ignored! According to a PreCure fan, this is due to the writers didn't want the morals of the story to be distracted by the results. The morals is that romance can be happiness but at same time causes misfortune and everyone should be mindful of other people's feelings even if they don't feel the same way.
</li><li> The love affair between Yuki and Hitomi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ICE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ICE">ICE</a></em> comes out of left field and goes nowhere for the rest of the OVA.
</li><li> There are two notable examples in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>.
<ul><li> First is the love triangle between Nodoka, Yue, and Negi. It began with Nodoka developing an early crush on Negi and Yue trying to play matchmaker but succumbing to her own feelings. Not wanting to get in the way, she tried to withdraw before Nodoka made her realize it was okay. In the end, this love triangle became one of Yue's most defining characteristics with everyone telling her to hurry up and confess and Yue never getting around to it. It does take a back seat to plot when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she enters a magical academy due to her memory being erased</span> though. This subplot strings along for several hundred chapters before getting a partial resolution a few months before the series ended <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and in the end it went nowhere at all. Both Nodoka and Yue were rejected</span>.
</li><li> Secondly is the relationship between Setsuna and Konoka. It became as a princess/bodyguard type relationship before yuri subtext began to grow. Setsuna's angst over the matter became <em>the</em> defining part of her character arc and lasted several hundred chapters without progress <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">even after a pactio</span>. During the ordeal, Konoka's actual character diminished to insignificance.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MayoChiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MayoChiki">Mayo Chiki!</a></em> is so much about Kinjirou and Subaru's relationship, it doesn't make the cut for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingHarem">Supporting Harem</a> since the other haremettes are clearly just there for variety... but since they're so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> they don't really do that well.
</li><li> The first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em> depicted the relationship between Saji Crossroad and Louise Halevy, as they were depicted as two civilians who see how the world is affected with Celestial Being's mission to "unite" the world by conflict and both ultimately suffer as a result of it. In season two, however, you can argue that this gets bloated, as Louise becomes the warrant officer for the A-LAWS and Saji Crossroad joins Celestial Being to co-pilot the 00 Raiser. To turn it into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> is Andrei Smirnov, who is infatuated with Louise and will also do anything to protect her. This doesn't affect the story as much as others, but it did eat away screentime that could've been devoted for, say, Allelujah battling (and accepting) his alter ego or showing the development of Nena Trinity.
</li><li> The latter third of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0083StardustMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0083StardustMemory">Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory</a></em> has a particularly irritating one in the form of the sudden revelation that Nina Purpleton and enemy ace Anavel Gato were once lovers, which results in a horrendously mishandled love triangle involving the two of them and main protagonist Kou Uraki. This is particularly blatant because it came completely out of nowhere, and conflicts with the fact that when Gato appears in the very beginning of the series, she sees him and utterly fails to recognize him.
</li><li> A lot of the fan complaints lobbed at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack">Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack</a></em> center around a romantic quadrangle that develops midway through the story between the eponymous Char Aznable, Quess Paraya, Hathaway Noa, and Gyunei Guss. Quess is the direct instigator of this quadrangle, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">self-centered</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink">Hate Sink</a> with psychic powers that affect a disturbing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreThanMindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreThanMindControl">More Than Mind Control</a> effect on weaker Newtypes. Hathaway and Gyunei, both being weaker Newtypes, develop identical instant insane infatuations with Quess the moment they meet her and devolve from relatively likable kids (and in Gyunei's case, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> in Neo-Zeon) into murderous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyJealousGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyJealousGuy">Crazy Jealous Guy</a> types willing to shoot down allies or kill hostages if that's what it takes to impress Quess. As for Char himself, all his dignity is lost as he cold-bloodedly grooms the 13-year old Quess to be his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tykebomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tykebomb">Tyke-Bomb</a> (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish">Replacement Goldfish</a> for Lalah Sune according to Gyunei, though Char asserts in the climax that he never sees Quess as anything but a weapon... not that that makes his actions any better or at all excusable). Worst of all is that this romantic quadrangle dominates the story, motivating the actions of a good chunk of the cast and forcing the rest of it to react. The end result is that a story supposedly about Amuro and Char's final battle in large part focuses on an obnoxious child and the men (and boys) who want to bone her instead.

After a few yearly arcs had passed, it's to the point that <em>more</em> time is spent on telling you how this unimportant romantic subplot side-character <em>feels</em> about the events than on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell">actually showing these events</a>.

Tails and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">Cosmo</a>. Much screen time was spent on their relationship instead of the interplanetary war between Sonic's friends and an evil race of warrior robots. The worst part is that you could pair Cosmo up with any of the boys on the ship (especially Knuckles) and she would've been just as compatible, perhaps even more so, considering that Tails is sometimes characterized as thinking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlsHaveCooties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlsHaveCooties">Girls Have Cooties</a>.
</li><li> Many fans find the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbians">affair between Yasuko and Fumi</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SweetBlueFlowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SweetBlueFlowers">Sweet Blue Flowers</a></em> rather puzzling, especially in light of Fumi's obvious feelings for her childhood friend Akira. The whole thing feels rushed and tacked on and looks more like an elaborate scheme to establish that Fumi is <em>truly</em> lesbian. It seems like the author realizes the inanity of it all when she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">decides to have Yasuko <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a></span>, but not before spending up to <em>two manga volumes</em> on the relationship.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em> has Kirito and Asuna. Their relationship practically overtakes the whole <em>escaping the MMORPG</em> storyline, even though it barely has any development. Still, they end up kissing (not before some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension">Belligerent Sexual Tension</a>), get married (only in-game, though), have sex (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidTheyOrDidntThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidTheyOrDidntThey">supposedly</a>), and kind of adopt a child <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(which is actually an artificial intelligence)</span>. One wonders why the makers even bothered with Kirito's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingHarem">Supporting Harem</a> when we are supposed to believe that Kirito and Asuna were meant for each other from the beginning. Compounded in that the writer himself admits regularly that he has no idea how to write supporting female characters, so he just makes them love interests.
</li><li> Three big examples in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UQHolder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UQHolder">UQ Holder!</a></em>:
<ul><li> The shoehorned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravelRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravelRomance">Time-Travel Romance</a> between Touta and his mother figure Yukihime/Evangeline. Before it happened, the story was setting up the start of a plot-relevant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc">Tournament Arc</a> where Touta would go to the top of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElevator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElevator">Space Elevator</a> in the finals and face his most powerful enemy Fate and possibly Negi along the way. Then, literally out of nowhere, Yukihime's former teacher Dana kidnaps Touta and takes him to her castle located at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoidBetweenTheWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoidBetweenTheWorlds">Void Between the Worlds</a> to train him and some of his friends. In the middle of his training, Touta continues bumping into a Yukihime from the Middle Ages and the two quickly develop romantic feelings for each other while all of the plot and other characters are completely pushed aside. Even though the current Yukihime rejects Touta's marriage proposal, his feelings for the past Yukihime became his most defining motive for anything he does. This subplot was dragged along for dozens of chapters until it got some kind of resolution in the last parts of the manga with Touta and Yukihime clarifying their feelings for each other are more on the familial side now and both are already in love with someone else.
</li><li> When it looked like the manga was going back to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc">Tournament Arc</a>, it was once again discarded in favor of putting all focus on the potential romance between Touta and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Kirie</a>. All the main characters suddenly wanted to drop everything so they could play matchmaker for Touta and Kirie. Several chapters were totally wasted on excessive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">Fanservice</a> antics from a naked Kirie with Touta. It got to the point that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingHarem">Supporting Harem</a> became utterly irrelevant because the other girls are always so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> they don't try to get Touta hard enough or are rooting for Kirie. Adding insult to injury, this whole romantic subplot ended up going nowhere at all. Even though Touta and Kirie admitted having feelings for each other, Kirie settles for being Touta's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister">"big sis"</a> while Touta suddenly gets a crush on Kuroumaru instead.
</li><li> Kuroumaru, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of Setsuna mentioned above, was plagued with a very similar problem to their Shinmei-ryuu predecessor. Kuroumaru was presented as this person with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBiologicalSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBiologicalSex">No Biological Sex</a> who was struggling to define their gender identity before they had to choose their physical sex at their sixteenth birthday, but Kuroumaru's character arc was soon completely overtaken by Kuroumaru's angst over their feelings for Touta. The issue went over a hundred chapters with no progress <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">even after Kuroumaru confesses the truth of their body to Touta right before they make a pactio</span>. To aggravate the matter, near the end of the manga, Touta and Kuroumaru's relationship seizes the center stage when Kuroumaru gets captured <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and transformed into a sword</span> by the faction of immortal hunters, which forces the manga to put the preparations for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle">Final Battle</a> on hold so it can have a boring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueArc">Rescue Arc</a> focused on Touta wanting to save Kuroumaru.
</li></ul></li><li> The anime adaption of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ValkyriaChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ValkyriaChronicles">Valkyria Chronicles</a></em> has this shoe-horned in about midway through, which changes Faldio's, Alicia's and Welkin's characters whilst adding angst for the sake of it. This is made particularly grating by virtue of the fact that if the writers wanted to add romantic tension all they had to do was include either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyChildhoodFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyChildhoodFriend">Noce or Juno</a> from the game. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> wouldn't have been that bad, though, if it didn't keep popping up during inopportune moments in ways that makes the viewer question the characters' professional competence.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WanderingSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WanderingSon">Wandering Son</a></em> anime, the protagonist has a crush on Takatsuki which gets mentioned all the time. In the manga the crush is brief; Nitori doesn't like when people refer to it and it's not mentioned much afterwards. In the anime, their characterization and scenes are warped to make the crush appear to continue long after it ended in the manga.
</li><li> Quite a few fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Working" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Working">WORKING!!</a></em> resent that the developing relationship between Inami and Takanashi has more and more taken center stage, considering how the series is filled to the brim with other interesting characters.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> in spades, especially during the period between the 90s and 160s. To wit, Sonic and Sally had been part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a> plot for ages when they decided to toss in Mina Mongoose as a third wheel. This lasted all of 30-40 issues before Sonic and Sally became the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a>. For all of ten issues before they broke up again. Then there was the time Sonic was with Fiona, which didn't pan out and she ended up with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">Evil Twin</a> Scourge. Then Sally spends time with Monkey Khan before rehooking up with Sonic <em>again</em>... only to get turned into a robot. When the universe had to be rebooted, Archie quietly dropped Sonic and Sally's relationship entirely, which actually proved greatly beneficial for both characters.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy">Star-Lord</a>'s first solo series ended up suffering from this for most of its run. It had a good start, introducing some characters like a lost sister of Peter and some interesting plots like the mystery of a new villain who put a bounty on Peter's head. However, it also introduced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KittyPryde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KittyPryde">Kitty Pryde</a>, who became Peter's new girlfriend in another book. At first, it looked like the relationship would be developed as a side plot in between Peter's many adventures, however, the couple was well received between fans and soon the book turned into the Star-Lord &amp; Kitty Pryde romantic adventures. Every other subplot was forgotten with the exception of the one with the new villain, in favor of showcasing Peter and Kitty's developing relationship to the point that a whole crossover event was planned just to keep developing the relationship.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicIDW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicIDW">My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</a></em> comic ran into this in the four-issue "Reflections" arc. While the main premise of the cast going to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse">Mirror Universe</a> was positively received, the actual story is centered on Celestia's relationship with that world's version of Sombra, leaving lots of readers to claim that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot">They Wasted a Perfectly Good Plot</a>.
</li><li> Most of the relationships in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> since "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BrandNewDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BrandNewDay">Brand New Day</a>" can be seen as such. Most of them have no bearing on any of the ongoing plots at all. Even Peter's relationship with Carlie Cooper &mdash; which was set up since the very beginning of BND, with plenty of time spent emphasizing just how "perfect" the two are for each other - ultimately ends up being largely irrelevant and has hardly any impact on any of the major events in Peter's life. Even in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderIsland">Spider-Island</a>,</em> Peter's relationship with MJ &mdash; his ex-wife/ girlfriend &mdash; is more important to the plot than his relationship with Carlie, who was his girlfriend at the time. This is especially egregious since the creators emphasized how important Peter being single was to the story, essentially arguing that the stories "couldn't work" if Peter wasn't single. The Carlie relationship has actually become fairly critical to the main plot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SuperiorSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SuperiorSpiderMan">Superior Spider-Man</a></em>, well after the actual relationship ended. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Carlie is one of the few people who knows that Doc Ock has taken over Peter Parker's body.</span> However, this is only made worse by the fact that Carlie just isn't that interesting or sympathetic as a character on her own and her "relationship" with Peter is by far one of the least convincing romantic subplots the web-slinger's ever had.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/XMen">X-Men</a></em> series loves to drum up romantic tension between two seemingly randomly selected characters. Usually it only leads to one or two scenes of flirtation &mdash; a "Romantic Plot Freckle" if you will; sometimes it leads to an actual ongoing relationship - a "Romantic Plot Appendage," say; but sometimes it ends up as a full-fledged Romantic Plot Tumor, with an inordinate page count being devoted to a relationship that ends up being dropped as soon as the writer loses interest (or left the book) to be rarely, if ever, mentioned again. The one example of this which hasn't gone into remission, despite <em>both</em> sides of it being <em>dead</em>, would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">Wolverine</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JeanGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JeanGrey">Jean</a> (Old Man Logan and Teen Jean are around, but have more of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntergenerationalFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntergenerationalFriendship">Intergenerational Friendship</a> than anything else - which is good because as observed in comic, anything else would be creepy). Canon-wise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Cyclops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Cyclops">Scott</a> and Jean were the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTruePairing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTruePairing">One True Pairing</a>, with Wolverine housing a crush on Jean and Scott being jealous. But eventually, they included Jean being attracted to Wolverine despite Scott's existence, though any time Scott got overly jealous he'd be called out on this, despite, you know, actually having good reason to be annoyed. Wolverine basically ends up with the only thing going for him is his love for Jean, and he'll angst about his inability to have her because of Cyclops despite the fact he has a lot more things to complain about, and Jean will all-but cheat on Cyclops without actually consummating anything with Wolverine until it ends up with her almost stringing them both. Basically, whenever this gets played up, usually at least one of these three end up being driven entirely by this in characterization. To make matters worse, it seeped into the films, being the biggest defining romance in the series - though they did at least have the sense to have Jean be fond of Logan, but not be inclined to do anything more than flirt a little and, as Logan puts it, she ultimately chose Scott.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a> was rebooted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987">Post-Crisis</a> her traditional love interest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SteveTrevor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SteveTrevor">Steve Trevor</a> was paired up with Etta Candy instead and every attempt to put Diana in a relationship with a new guy was met with derision and lack of interest by the fans and rarely did anything for the story other than distract from it.

<ul><li> Draco and Ebony's relationship in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/MyImmortal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/MyImmortal">My Immortal</a></em> is a particularly resilient tumor: even when it's quelled into submission by actual plot, it promptly becomes malignant again and overtakes anything else that's happening. This leads to the pair engaging in sex or just making out in the middle of random other events.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/MyInnerLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/MyInnerLife">My Inner Life</a></em>. The relationship between Link and Jenna is the central topic even if there's nothing going on in it besides them just being super happy with each other. Every <em>other</em> plot point awkwardly bursts in instead. Though, it could be argued that the trope is played straight since the romance plot wildly overshadows events it really shouldn't. For example, Link goes off to war and the only concern given by the narrator is that Link might not be home for the birth of her first child with him. The entire war is ignored and resolved within a chapter so Link can get home, Jenna can have her moment being happy to have him back and the romance can continue drama-free.

Said sub-plot isn't mentioned in the summary whatsoever and only comes into play around the middle of the story, yet the main plot of Light vs. Shadows eventually comes off as just an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot">Excuse Plot</a> for shoving Majorin x the Queen down the reader's throats.

Shortly into the second arc when the other main protagonists were introduced, though, their social lives and the introduction of girls to fill out the characters' harems pretty much swallowed up the plot. Villains showing up on campus to fight the main characters seemed to happen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot">just so there'd be some kind of reason</a> to justify them being such powerful fighters.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCaineMutiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCaineMutiny">The Caine Mutiny</a></em> was notorious for having a romance that was completely irrelevant to the plot, to the point that Humphrey Bogart stated the film was "crapped up by a pointless love story."
</li><li> The film adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AChorusLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AChorusLine">A Chorus Line</a></em> is one of the worst cases of stretching out to tedious extent an affair (between Cassie and Zach) which should have been a minor romantic subplot - and, indeed, <em>was</em> originally a minor romantic subplot. This may have been done to beef up the part of Zach, who doesn't sing, enough to get a name actor to play him (Michael Douglas) since the other roles weren't and likely could not have been filled by name performers. <em>People</em> magazine's critic suspected it may have also been out of fear movie audiences wouldn't relate to the plights of the dancers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDeparted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDeparted">The Departed</a></em> won numerous awards and is very well-regarded, but the fact that both male leads have a relationship with the female psychiatrist is basically completely pointless, serving no point other than to have some romance in the film.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BramStokersDracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BramStokersDracula">Bram Stoker's Dracula</a></em> (but not in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula">Dracula</a></em> by Bram Stoker), Dracula isn't after Mina Harker because he's an undead embodiment of evil, a monster seeking to feed on the blood of the innocent. It's because he's in love with her. Awww. And she loves him because it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReincarnationRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReincarnationRomance">Reincarnation Romance</a>. And Dracula wasn't cursed by God to be a vampire because he was an evil bastard who deserved eternal torment. No, Dracula willingly became one as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheHeavens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheHeavens">Rage Against the Heavens</a> because his wife <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideIsShameful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideIsShameful">committed suicide and her soul couldn't be redeemed</a>. Never mind that none of this was in the book, or that the forced romance between Drac and Mina leaves her acting like a complete and unsympathetic bitch to everyone around her, especially her loving husband. Unsurprisingly, the Dracula and Mina subplot only exists because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, as they didn't think a straight horror film would sell tickets.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EnemyAtTheGates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EnemyAtTheGates">Enemy at the Gates</a></em> keeps taking time away from a fascinating and incredibly taut plot centered around a sniper duel in besieged Stalingrad to focus on a love triangle. This one is more ironic than others: the love triangle did happen in real life, but the sniper duel didn't. That still doesn't change the fact that the sniper duel was what most people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustHereForGodzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustHereForGodzilla">came to see</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">Reality Is Unrealistic</a> sometimes.
</li><li> The first film in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExpendables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExpendables">The Expendables</a></em> was criticized for often screeching things to a halt to focus on Lee and his relationship with Lacy. Despite the fact that she otherwise has no connection with the main story, an unnecessarily decent chunk of it was devoted to their relationship troubles due to Lee's job as a member of the titular Expendables as well as him protecting her from her new abusive boyfriend.
</li><li> An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFall">The Fall</a></em>: Roy is telling a story to a little girl named Alexandria. To spice it up a little &mdash; and possibly showing how he's still upset over <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his girlfriend leaving him for a man with a better job</span> &mdash; a romance plot is suddenly introduced into his story. But <em>because</em> he's so depressed, the romance starts to become very, very bad, and in the end, part of the point of his story (with Alexandria taking over the reins) is the hero giving up on the love interest.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Flyboys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Flyboys">Flyboys</a></em> might have been more endurable if it had dropped the love story (between two people who couldn't speak to each other, for goodness sake) and concentrated on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSquad">The Squad</a>...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GangsOfNewYork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GangsOfNewYork">Gangs of New York</a></em>: A powerful tale of revenge, gang violence, and political corruption, which takes a good half-hour out of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielDayLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielDayLewis">Day-Lewis</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardoDiCaprio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardoDiCaprio">DiCaprio</a> relationship for an almost completely irrelevant romance with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CameronDiaz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CameronDiaz">Cameron Diaz</a>. You could excise her character entirely, and the only other change that would necessitate would be giving Johnny a different reason for jealousy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gigli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gigli">Gigli</a></em>, is a mob movie about the kidnapping of a prosecutor's brother, but that was forced to the side when the movie was (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">re-</a>)written to capitalize on the at-the-time romance between actors <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenAffleck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenAffleck">Ben Affleck</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JenniferLopez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JenniferLopez">Jennifer Lopez</a>.
</li><li> The relationship between the Baroness and Duke is pretty central to the storyline of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GIJoeTheRiseOfCobra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GIJoeTheRiseOfCobra">GI Joe The Rise Of Cobra</a></em>, even if it feels unnecessary to the mythos. G.I. Joe, after all, has no small shortage of improbable relationships across every canon. Ripcord and Scarlet's relationship, however, seems to have drawn almost universal scorn.
</li><li> The biggest complaint of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGiver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGiver">The Giver</a></em> is the romantic story between Jonas and Fiona that was not in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGiver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGiver">the book</a>. In the book, Jonas merely had a crush on Fiona and the tragedy was that romance was <em>impossible</em> for them because Fiona was irretrievably brainwashed by the community and even committed "Release" on senior citizens. Also, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeLift">Age Lift</a> changed the thread from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppyLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppyLove">Puppy Love</a> to something more serious (on Jonas' side, at least).
</li><li> This happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a></em>. While the romantic subplots were in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince">the book</a>, they're forced to the forefront in the movie, making it seem like they are the most important part of the movie. What's even worse is the fact that by the time they revealed who the Half-Blood Prince was, the audience (at least, those who hadn't read the book) had no clue why it was important. In other words, the romantic plot made people forget what the main plot was. Granted, for some at least, the romantic subplots weren't much better in the book, either.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></em> features a fairly obvious example of this trope, between Arthur and Trillian. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy">The "original" source materials</a> all handled their past differently, but agreed that Arthur had been briefly interested in Trillian during a single superficial encounter in the past; when he re-encounters her during the story, he displays jealousy at a few points, but not much more than that. By comparison, the movie version features an Arthur who is desperately pining over Trillian, who could have been his one true love <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut">had he not been afraid to pursue her</a>, and he spends most of the movie time thinking about, worrying about or focusing on her. This was deliberately inserted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DouglasAdams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DouglasAdams">Douglas Adams</a> when drafting the movie, before his death, to increase studio interest and audience acceptance of the movie. (Which doesn't necessarily rule out that the new love plot was half-baked or several draft rewrites away from being good.)
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em> movies, between Kili, Tauriel, and Legolas, has been largely despised by critics, fans, <em>and</em> Peter Jackson and Evangeline Lilly. (It was the result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, and actually went against Evangeline Lilly's single stipulation for being in the movie: that there be <em>no</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a>.) It didn't need to be in the movie, especially since two-thirds of the relevant love triangle aren't even in the original book (and one is a straight-up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner">Canon Foreigner</a>), and the film was already severely overlong (which was a result of both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a>). Even with that aside, the trio takes up far, far more screentime than ought to be necessary, overshadowing most of the non-Kili dwarves and Bilbo, all for the sake of a romance that the audience knows to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedByCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedByCanon">Doomed by Canon</a>. It's particularly irritating because Kili and Tauriel do have some chemistry (the scene involving the runestone in the Mirkwood dungeons is cited as their best), but the terrible writing, excessive screentime, and tossing Legolas in there for no good reason other than his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice">Mr. Fanservice</a> status puts it firmly in here, especially considering that it was meant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">to be more subtle</a> and Legolas and Tauriel's relationship was strictly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister">Like Brother and Sister</a> during the original two-movie shooting period in 2010-2011.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IAmNumberFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IAmNumberFour">I Am Number Four</a></em> spends most of its time developing a typical teen love story. By the time it starts getting into the action the trailer led us to believe made up most of the movie, it ends. Just like that.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a> movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWorldIsNotEnough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWorldIsNotEnough">The World Is Not Enough</a></em> features Dr. Christmas Jones, who is quite possibly the most hated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BondGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BondGirl">Bond Girl</a> in the entire film franchise. Plenty of other Bond films have had unspectacular female leads, but usually the movie was poorly-received as a whole, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManWithTheGoldenGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManWithTheGoldenGun">The Man with the Golden Gun</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AViewToAKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AViewToAKill">A View to a Kill</a>.</em> However, <em>TWINE</em> was held in high regard <strong>except</strong> for Christmas, who was seen as inexplicably young for her job as a nuclear physicist (Richards was 28 during filming), and her shallow fling with Bond was seen as a distraction from his much more complicated relationship with Elektra King, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> especially when she's revealed to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a></span>. By the end of the movie, it's clear that the only reason Christmas exists is for Bond to have a good girl to make out with as the credits roll, in keeping with the series formula.
</li><li> In-universe example: In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKong1933" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKong1933">King Kong (1933)</a></em>, the reason Ann Darrow is hired by Denham in the first place is that the studio and the public want romance in his adventure movies. Based on his reluctance to do so, one can assume that a romance in one of his movies would be a case of this.
</li><li> <em>The Mountain Between Us</em> has an exciting main plot about two strangers forced to help each other to survive after a plane crash in the frozen mountains of Montana. But it increasingly concentrates on a developing romance between them to the extent that the film continues for half an hour after they reach safety, and concentrates solely on the romance. It just makes the film feel like it has a needlessly stretched-out denouement.
</li><li> The romance with Sarah (and indeed, Sarah as a character) were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">last-minute additions</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Newsies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Newsies">Newsies</a></em>, supposedly because without her, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">implications of close friendships between boys from different social strata and the introduction of a group of said boys who get a collective morning wash-up/shower scene in the first ten minutes</a> would be just too obvious. They were right, but adding her didn't help.
</li><li> Purposely avoided in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PacificRim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PacificRim">Pacific Rim</a></em>. Guillermo del Toro stated in numerous interviews that he dislikes how movies &mdash; particularly big-budget action movies &mdash; tend to shoehorn a romance in simply because one lead is male and the other is female. Despite a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> moments, Raleigh and Mako end up close friends and partners, but not romantically involved.
<div class="indent"><strong>Guillermo del Toro:</strong> I wanted to show that men and women can be friends without having a relationship.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PearlHarbor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PearlHarbor">Pearl Harbor</a></em> is a serious offender. As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert">Roger Ebert</a> said, it's about how, on December 7, 1941, the Japanese staged a surprise attack on an American love triangle.
<ul><li> Firstly, the fact that it's a movie about <em>the attack on Pearl Harbor</em> and really has no need for a love story. The presented triangle with a woman choosing between two lovers is, for many, a hollow attempt to replicate the "romance amidst an iconic moment in history" success of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997">Titanic</a></em>.
</li><li> Secondly, the love triangle itself drew plenty of scorn: A nurse in Hawaii falls in love with two fighter pilots. The first one apparently dies, so she goes to the other one. Then the first guy shows up alive, angst ensues, then the <em>second</em> guy appears to die. Eventually, one of them really does die, but only after knocking her up, leaving the runner-up to be the baby's father. By the halfway point of the movie, there was no way one could pretend to sympathize with the girl anymore; no matter which of her boyfriends died, she'd still have a spare. One newspaper review at the time summarized the film as:
</li></ul><div class="indent">"A girl has to choose between her love for two pilots when it's not clear how she tells the difference between them."
</div></li><li> The film adaption of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians">The Lightning Thief</a></em> unfortunately gravitates towards this level, which was one of the many complaints fans had towards the film. This is partially brought on by the age upgrade in the film. While the book series grows the romance to fit with the age of the characters (from twelve to sixteen), the film has the characters at age sixteen, making the character development moot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PiratesOfTheCaribbean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PiratesOfTheCaribbean">Pirates of the Caribbean</a></em> has been accused of this on several occasions.
<ul><li> Elizabeth and Will's relationship troubles drag on into the sequels. Their characters' necessity to the story largely ended with their romance's resolution in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanTheCurseOfTheBlackPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanTheCurseOfTheBlackPearl">Black Pearl</a>.</em> It's also rumored that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrlandoBloom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrlandoBloom">Orlando Bloom</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeiraKnightley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeiraKnightley">Keira Knightley</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">Creator Backlash</a> dispositions <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note008mh');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note008mh" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note008mh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">though <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fandango.com/movieblog/orlando-bloom-open-to-pirates-of-caribbean-5-return-684391.html">this interview<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> suggests Bloom has since had a change of heart</span> toward the characters stem from the romance story that took over the trilogy.
</li><li> Though even they pale into insignificance next to the criticism of the new romantic sub-plot introduced in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanOnStrangerTides" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanOnStrangerTides">the fourth film</a>, between a young missionary and a mermaid, which was so uninteresting as to have some Elizabeth/Will critics wish they'd been dragged back after all.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePostman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePostman">The Postman</a></em>: Around the midpoint of the film, Abby and Shakespeare's romance begins to take over.
</li><li> The 2008 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRedBaron">The Red Baron</a></em> was heavily criticized for shoe-horning the fictional character of Nurse Kate and making her love story with Manfred von Richthofen the central plot in the film. Yep, <em>that</em> Red Baron. <strong>The</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">Red Baron</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot">They had the freaking Red Baron and they overlooked him</a>. You could even say <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">They Wasted A Perfectly Good Pilot</a>.
</li><li> <em>The Shoes of the Fisherman</em> (1968) has a particularly egregious case. Most of the movie focuses on Anthony Quinn as Kiril, a Ukranian bishop who becomes Pope and tries to avert a war between China and the USSR. Yet <em>Shoes</em> spends at least half-an-hour on a superfluous love triangle between David Janssen's American journalist, his wife Barbara Jefford and mistress Rosemary Dexter. This subplot doesn't even relate to the main story (Janssen and Jefford briefly meet the Pope, without any impact on their relationship) and was widely attacked by critics.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Splash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Splash">Splash</a></em>. The film is billed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticComedy">Romantic Comedy</a> and is one but eventually, the plot turns to rescuing Madison and protecting them from the government that wishes to "research" and dissect her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekVTheFinalFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekVTheFinalFrontier">Star Trek V: The Final Frontier</a></em> has scenes where the action grinds to a halt to show awkward flirting between Uhura and Scotty, a romance which is nowhere to be found in any of the other films. This is a weird example because the romance plot doesn't actually take up much screen time, but <em>so little else</em> happens in the movie that it feels far more time-consuming than it really is.
</li><li> The most famous example (to the point that this trope was originally named "George Lucas Love Story") would probably be Anakin Skywalker's relationship with Padm&eacute; in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones">Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones</a></em>. Whether this was the fault of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas">George Lucas</a>' writing or the actors is up for debate; either way, you're left with an almost unwatchable love story that not only takes up a majority of the movie but also takes attention away from the perfectly serviceable assassination plot (although getting in the love story was inevitably necessary at some point). Aside from the badly done scenes themselves, the storyline went like this: Obi-Wan finds a planet of cloners&#151;Anakin and Padme fall in love next to a river&#151;Obi-Wan learns of a massive clone army&#151;Anakin and Padm&eacute; fall in love in a field&#151;Obi-Wan confronts Jango Fett&#151;Anakin and Padm&eacute; fall in love while eating dinner. There was no flow to the romance; as a result, it felt as if they fell in love <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo">Because Destiny Says So</a>. This improves somewhat for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em>: while the love story is still uncompelling, it results in the conception of two major characters from the original trilogy and is pivotal to Anakin's turn to the Dark Side. Then again, putting the weight of the two most pivotal plot points of the trilogy on said unconvincing romance may not have been wise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString">for other reasons...</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTenCommandments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTenCommandments">The Ten Commandments</a></em> has a love story between Moses and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodSiblings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodSiblings">his adopted half-sister</a> Nefretiri. Not only is this romance definitely not in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">source material</a>, but the huge buildup in the first two hours of the film was abruptly derailed when Moses is exiled halfway through the film and gets foisted off on a princess from the desert. The emotional tension when he eventually returns to find Nefretiri married to his adopted brother is minimal. Nefretiri serves very little purpose in the overall film, and her one or two important actions could easily have been accomplished without the romantic tension, fluff, angst, and generally useless buildup that added an hour of length onto the already-four-hour-long film.
</li></ul><ul><li> The entire romance plot from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThingsToDoInDenverWhenYoureDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThingsToDoInDenverWhenYoureDead">Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead</a></em> can be edited out of the movie with no effect at all on the story. This has, in fact, been done by some file-sharers. They simply removed every scene with the woman in it. The movie is reportedly none the worse for wear.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> films helmed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBay">Michael Bay</a> were infamous for this, crossing over with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanFocusedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanFocusedAdaptation">Human-Focused Adaptation</a>.

It got worse when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MeganFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MeganFox">Megan Fox</a> refused to come back for the third film, resulting in Mikaela being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">replaced with some generic new girl who contributed even less</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersAgeOfExtinction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersAgeOfExtinction">Transformers: Age of Extinction</a></em> is widely considered the nadir in this regard, due to a scene where the plot literally stops dead in its tracks <em>just</em> so a side character can explain in detail why it's okay for him to have sex with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkWahlberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkWahlberg">Mark Wahlberg&#146;s</a> underage daughter. Mercifully, when the series was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot">rebooted</a> with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bumblebee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bumblebee">Bumblebee</a></em> and Bay was replaced by Travis Knight, any and all Romantic Plot Tumors were excised with extreme prejudice; the movie even has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> at this near the end, making it seem like Charlie and Memo are going to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString">Strangled by the Red String</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch">only for him to get bluntly and embarrassingly shot down</a>.

<ul><li> A lot of people feel this to be the case about the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnitaBlake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnitaBlake">Anita Blake</a></em> series. However, the veer from "action-packed, fast-paced vampire mystery/shoot-'em-up" to "S&amp;M filled smut novels with tacked-on mystery chapter" (<em>Micah</em> being the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> example) is so extreme that it's more like a before-the-fact Actual Plot Tumor on a larger and more bulbous Romantic... thing.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AubreyMaturin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AubreyMaturin">Aubrey-Maturin</a></em> series books come to a screeching halt on 2 occasions due to romance/females being added to the story. The first (in post-captain) is somewhat excusable, as it establishes their wives and family early in the series, and was described as the author's homage to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneAusten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneAusten">Jane Austen</a>.
</li><li> The romantic plot between Maximillian Morrel and Valentine de Villefort in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCountOfMonteCristo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCountOfMonteCristo">The Count of Monte Cristo</a></em> has little importance to the overall plot, except for giving the Count an opportunity to redeem himself at the end. It doesn&#146;t help the fact that both characters are rather bland <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuritySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuritySue">purity sues</a>, whose relationship shifts the readers&#146; attention from far much more interesting members of the cast. It might be the major reason why their plot arc is cut out of many adaptations or Maximillian is replaced by a much more charismatic Albert in others.
</li><li> The Brazilian 1956 classic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDevilToPayInTheBacklands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDevilToPayInTheBacklands">The Devil to Pay in the Backlands</a></em> seems to suffer a little with this trope. Let's see, there's a <span class="font-s">FREAKING WAR</span> going on, with a character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather">seeking for revenge</a> and others doing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">deals with the devil</a>, but mostly people just remember the gay love storyline.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote">Don Quixote</a></em>, the last chapters of the First Part solve the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveDodecahedron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveDodecahedron">Love Dodecahedron</a> between Dorotea, Don Fernando, Lucinda, Cardenio, Clara and Don Luis, leaving Don Quixote as a mere spectator in his own book. In the Second Part Cervantes makes an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">Author's Saving Throw</a> when Don Quixote opines:

</div></li><li> The author of the <em>Fallen</em> series apparently believed that the audience would be more interested in Luce and Daniel's dry, abusive relationship than an epic angel war and the threat of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a>, to the point that the plot of each book can be boiled down to "Luce spends the first 80% of the book fawning over Daniel/angsting about how Daniel might not <em>really</em> love her/literally watching all of her past reincarnations fall insta-in-love with Daniel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot">with actual angel stuff being shoved into the last 20% of the book</a>."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FiftyShadesOfGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FiftyShadesOfGrey">Fifty Shades of Grey</a></em>: Ana and Christian's romance <em>is</em> the main plot in the first book, but beginning with the second book, important things like Jack sexually harassing Ana and carrying out an elaborate revenge scheme against her and the Greys, Christian's ex Leila stalking him and Ana, and so on, are barely given any focus at all or occur mostly off-page, so we can focus on Ana and Christian's relationship drama and sexy times. It doesn't help that the romance is arguably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString">rather unconvincing</a> at best, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticizedAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticizedAbuse">abusive and dysfunctional</a> at worst.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WayneBarlowe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WayneBarlowe">Wayne Barlowe</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GodsDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GodsDemon">God's Demon</a></em> has a romance between <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sargatanas and Lilith</span> that feels like a completely gratuitous and cliched shortcut to cheap pathos. You could cut it without affecting the story at all.
</li><li> More than a few <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> fans felt this way about the Harry/Ginny hookup in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince">the sixth book</a> - even those who supported the ship or had no real shipper bias to speak of.
<ul><li> Some felt this way about how things played for Ron and Hermione in the sixth book as well.
</li><li> In general, the relationship dramas of <em>Half-Blood Prince</em> are highlighted by two key facts. Firstly, it gives the impression of cramming plenty of relationship development into one book, with Harry/Ginny feeling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString">Strangled by the Red String</a> thanks to Harry's feelings for her coming rather suddenly (barring subtle hints that many readers took as poor writing) and his "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">chest monster</a>"; Ron/Hermione meanwhile embodies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension">UST</a> since the fact they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut">Cannot Spit It Out</a> becomes tiresome due to overexposure. Secondly, major developments (which are smattered through the novel) aside, the book is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherEpisode">Breather Episode</a> that comes between the tense <em>Order of the Phoenix</em> (which was about preparing for a war that the Ministry of Magic refused to believe was on the horizon) and the climactically fast-paced <em>Deathly Hallows</em> (which brings all the tensions between the cast to the fore and finally resolves them, while they're on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuest">The Quest</a> as the war finally breaks out in full).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames">The Hunger Games</a></em> unfortunately suffered from this, even though the author made a point to avoid it. In the final book in the series, <em>Mockingjay</em>, this happens even more tragically when the author chooses to focus on how Katniss is torn between the kind, gentle, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressedDude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressedDude">Distressed Dude</a> Peeta and the quiet, brooding badass Gale instead of focusing on the second American revolutionary war. It's even lampshaded by Haymitch at one point: when Katniss goes to him - with bigger things on her mind than her romantic entanglings &mdash; he caustically asks her, 'What's the matter? Boy trouble again?'. The author has hinted that the triangle was a result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jaws">Jaws</a></em> there is an illicit love affair, lasting one afternoon, between Matt Hooper and Ellen Brody. It seems so contrived, it is easy to believe the rumor that it was the product of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement">better known (and more critically praised)</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws">film adaptation</a> thankfully removes it and makes Brody and Ellen a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> couple instead.
</li><li> Some fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKingkillerChronicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKingkillerChronicle">The Kingkiller Chronicle</a></em> felt that the Kvothe/Denna subplot and especially the Kvothe/Felurian chapters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWiseMansFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWiseMansFear">The Wise Man's Fear</a></em> (60+ pages of faerie sex dropped into the middle of a heroic fantasy novel) distract from the more interesting main plot. The fact that Kvothe's motivation for running off with Felurian is basically "might as well since I'm here" doesn't help either.
</li><li> <em>The Magicians and Mrs. Quent</em> manages to have <em>two</em> of these, each managing to be more egregious than the other for different reasons. The first half of the book could be reduced to little over a few pages without hindering the story any; instead, it spends two hundred pages setting up a romance between main character Ivy and another main character, Mr. Rafferdy. Naturally, as the book has "Mrs. Quent" in the title, this goes nowhere; instead, their romance is broken off because Rafferdy is a nobleman and Ivy isn't, and therefore their marriage would be inappropriate. Ivy then goes to the countryside and, after a romance that's developed in all of five pages, marries Mr. Quent. The Romantic Plot Tumor with Mr. Rafferdy is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">Egregious</a> for being mere filler; the Romantic Plot Tumor with Mr. Quent is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">Egregious</a> for being a textbook case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString">Strangled by the Red String</a>, with absolutely none of the development put into this romance as was put into Ivy and Mr. Rafferdy's, as well as the fact that Mr. Quent is an <em>earl</em>, and therefore he and Ivy shouldn't be getting married in the first place.
</li><li> <em>Marked</em>, the first book in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHouseOfNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHouseOfNight">The House of Night</a></em> series had Zoey get a hot boyfriend and try to fend off her ex-boyfriend, but it was still mostly about Zoey becoming familiar with the vampyre world. The second book, <em>Betrayed</em>, put more focus on Zoey finding herself having <em>three</em> boyfriends at once, but the vampyre plot still had more attention and importance. The third book, <em>Chosen</em>, is when this trope fully emerges, with Zoey's juggling of her three boyfriends taking up as much space as the much more interesting plot with Aphrodite and Stevie Rae, if not more. It tapers off for a bit after Zoey finds herself boyfriend-less at the end of <em>Chosen</em>, but is back with a vengeance in the fifth book, <em>Hunted</em>, with Zoey even getting a new suitor to fill the place of the one she lost. It's probably telling that the most highly rated book of this series on Amazon is <em>Untamed</em>, the one where Zoey's love problems <em>don't</em> take up a large part of the plot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaximumRide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaximumRide">Maximum Ride</a></em> began life as a fairly decent kids' series, full of action and fighting stereotypical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientists</a>. By book five, <em>Max</em>, the relationship between Max and Fang has become the entire focus of the (thin anyway) plot.
</li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RealmOfTheElderlings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RealmOfTheElderlings">Realm of the Elderlings</a></em> books, the <em>Farseer Trilogy</em>, quite a bit of time is spent on the Fitz/Molly subplot and it gets quite tedious to listen to Fitz endlessly pining and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst">wangsting</a> over her when there's far more important matters going on (this is especially egregious in <em>Royal Assassin</em>), especially as Molly herself isn't an interesting or even particularly likeable character and instead just spends her time bitching about how Fitz doesn't spend enough time with her and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">gets angry with him for having a life outside of her.</a> You get the impression Fitz merely likes her because she's the only girl his age he knew growing up. It's even lampshaded in the third book when Kettle points out to Fitz that their love for each other was more about who they used to <em>be</em> rather than who they are and their relationship is based off childhood memories and not much else. Even Fitz comes to see Kettle's right <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and decides to gracefully back away and let Burrich settle down with Molly instead, knowing Burrich deserves to be happy</span>.
<ul><li> To a lesser extent in the <em>Liveship Traders</em> trilogy, there's the Althea/Brashen subplot that is initially just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> on both sides, but they go through a cycle of meeting up/flirting/arguing/having sex/miscomunnicating/storming off/pining, repeated several times over the course of the books and it gets quite tiresome after a while, especially as Althea's goal of winning back <em>Vivacia</em> takes a backseat to her obsessing over her feelings for Brashen <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> which is probably why she ends up not getting the ship back at the end of the books.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SoLongAndThanksForAllTheFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SoLongAndThanksForAllTheFish">So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish</a></em>, which neglects most of the usual cast and the plots about the dolphins and God's final message in favor of Arthur and Fenchurch's love story. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DouglasAdams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DouglasAdams">Douglas Adams</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">actually suggests</a> that readers who don't care about Arthur's sex life skip ahead to the last chapter, "which is a good bit and has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Marvin</a> in it".
</li><li> <em>Story of Tom Brennan</em>. The last quarter of the book gets steadily overtaken by the romance between Tom and Chrissy, which just <em>somehow</em> solves everything.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SuperPowereds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SuperPowereds">Super Powereds</a></em> is about five superhero kids in college, but it's really more about their college romance than it's about their superheroing.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipKDick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipKDick">Philip K. Dick</a>'s <em>We Can Build You</em> begins with the protagonists constructing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots">Ridiculously Human Robots</a> in the shape of historical figures, and getting themselves involved with a business magnate who might be too clever for them. Then the protagonist's pathological romance with the robot constructor begins taking center stage and overtaking the plot, until &mdash; in the last two chapters &mdash; all other subplots are jettisoned in order to resolve the romance, and then the novel ends abruptly.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em> books, the author goes on and on about the Faile-Berelain-Perrin triangle, and devotes pointless chapters to Perrin's agonizing over his kidnapped wife while plodding along aimlessly in his search for her, adding tedious bulk to an already horribly bloated series. Really, most of the love stories in <em>The Wheel of Time</em> were tumors.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a> has suffered from this a lot, despite being an action series:
<ul><li> Graystripe/Silverstream &mdash; Whether their romance was tragic or over-dramatic, Graystripe will forever be associated with this relationship, and almost everything in the series involving him is somehow tied in with Silverstream and his love/obsession with her.
</li><li> Firestar/Spottedleaf &mdash; A much more divisive ship than the above (probably the most divisive of the series, in fact). Little to no relationship was built between the two while Spottedleaf was still alive, yet the entire rest of the series treats it as though they had a big, intricate romance that ended in tragedy. Their "relationship" serves to the plot quite a bit despite barely existing at all. Sometimes, like in the cast of Firestar's Quest, the focus is so into this shadow of a ship that the main plot gets pushed to the side.
</li><li> Bluestar/Oakheart &mdash; In the first series, their romance was considered a tragic story that threw both, but especially Bluestar, into a sympathetic light. In Bluestar's Prophecy, once Oakheart enters the picture, almost Bluestar's entire arc is about her underdeveloped, sudden, and short romance with him.
</li><li> Brambleclaw<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">/star</span>/Squirrelflight &mdash; While their relationship is considered one of the better ones for the most part, the plot sometimes decides to spend WAY too much time on their relationship drama and has Brambleclaw give <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Disproportionate Retribution</a> to Squirrelflight after the plot involving their kits. The New Prophecy focuses on them for almost half of the arc, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bramblestar's Storm</span> may as well be called "Brambleclaw and Squirrelflight: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a>".
</li><li> Leafpool/Crowfeather &mdash; These two suffer from the same issues as Bluestar/Oakheart above, only without the prior build-up. What's worse is that their relationship is the focus of more than just one book; half of The New Prophecy, the last two books of The Power of Three, and about half of Omen of the Stars is heavily reliant on their fling in Starlight and Twilight. Of course, considering what it resulted in, it is partially understandable. However, plenty of fans are sick of them at this point.
</li><li> Dovewing/Tigerheart &mdash; Their relationship was pretty drawn out, Dovewing's feelings spanning almost the entirety of Omen of the Stars and serving as a major plot for her, despite Tigerheart's devotion being rather limited and being seen as a traitor in her eyes for helping his Clan hold her sister hostage and being in the Dark Forest. By <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bramblestar's Storm</span>, set a whole 6 moons after the ending of Omen of the Stars, she still has very obvious feelings for him. Understandably, their relationship, bearing almost no substance, got old fast. If one never read the chapters told through the POV of the 3 other main characters, one would think an imminent war wasn't about to break out between the living cats and the vengeful cats of the Dark Forest.

<ul><li> A common criticism of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em> is how much unneeded drama is mined from romantic foibles, especially Oliver Queen's, mostly because a lot of it comes down to one party lecturing the other (often with them presented as right to do so, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedWrongness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedWrongness">while the audience often disagrees</a>) or them arguing over issues that could be avoided by talking it out like adults.
<ul><li> Oliver/Laurel was the first to get flak for this with cheating, sleeping with the sibling, love triangles and romantic angst &mdash; however, Oliver/Felicity, previously a popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple">Fan-Preferred Couple</a>, proved to be far worse, becoming a huge part of the show (with many finding it causing a negative effect on Felicity's character), while other couples like Carly/Diggle and Donna/Quinten have gotten similar complaints about being needless subplots. In fact, Oliver/Felicity became so hated that it turned <em>Oliver/Laurel</em> into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple">Fan-Preferred Couple</a> after Felicity replaced Laurel as Oliver's official love interest. It's an oft-cited reason for the extremely poor quality of <em>Arrow</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Season</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">Four</a>, which is universally regarded as the worst season of not just <em>Arrow</em> but of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrowverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrowverse">Arrowverse</a> as a whole, as their romantic drama completely dominated that season.
</li><li> The only romantic couples that seem to be universally liked are Diggle/Lyla and Roy/Thea, in large part because of their comparatively less drama (at least, Roy/Thea grew out of their drama and became probably the healthiest couple on the show, while Diggle/Lyla apparently worked out their drama before the show started), with Sara/Oliver and Tommy/Laurel being mostly well-liked (with the exception of shipping-related issues), for similarly having little drama that they didn't work through in a healthy manner and only breaking up due to plot reasons. As a result, though, the show has become <em>infamous</em> for its focus on complex romance, to the point that talking about shipping among fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014">The Flash (2014)</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD">Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow">Legends of Tomorrow</a></em>, and/or any other comics book show, to result in arguments due to it "ruining" <em>Arrow</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Kara/Lee/Sam/Dee <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveDodecahedron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveDodecahedron">Love Dodecahedron</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica</a></em> got completely out of control, hurting the otherwise-enjoyable Season 3. Which is an accomplishment for a quadrangle that only existed in four mid-season episodes out of 20 in the season overall, but it seems to really stick out in fans' memories. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a> between Kara and Lee lasted until the series finale, though to a lesser degree, as the writers largely abandoned the messy quadrangle for the infinitely sweeter and more organic Roslin/Adama romance.
</li><li> The entire cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">The Big Bang Theory</a></em>. Especially in the later seasons, it is very difficult to find an episode that doesn't revolve around their various relationship issues. Even Sheldon, who has a near total lack of romantic desire, is not immune to this. The sole main character who doesn't have a girlfriend spends the bulk of his time either trying to get a girlfriend or being miserable because he doesn't have a girlfriend. The series has effectively gone from being about geeks and geek culture to being about geeks and their hot girlfriends.
</li><li> The 11th UK series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother">Big Brother</a></em> was thought to be the last ever at the time, and was promoted as a grand finale to the franchise. What it ended up being about was nothing but the showmance between Josie and John James. It took up most of the screentime, with hours of them just sat under a duvet, and their fans multivoted to evict everyone who wasn't sucking up to them or even who just looked at them the wrong way, leaving a very hollow series. And, surprise surprise, they weren't together much longer after the series had ended.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em>: The Buffy/Angel elements in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS7E21EndOfDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS7E21EndOfDays">End Of Days</a>"/"<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS7E22Chosen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS7E22Chosen">Chosen</a>" and the entire episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS05E20TheGirlInQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS05E20TheGirlInQuestion">The Girl in Question</a>" are argued as Romantic Plot Tumors for their respective series, whose leads both changed and developed drastically different lives from the one they had together. Making it worse was their proximity to the end of each series, which used precious screentime that could have been dedicated to setting up the storyline of the finale.
<ul><li> This happened in Season 3, as well. Instead of solely focusing on the much more interesting storyline of a Slayer (Faith) turning to the dark side, along with the Big Bad's motivations, half of the season was dedicated to Buffy and Angel sorting out their issues, despite the fact that it was utterly obvious how it was going to end (Angel would leave to star in his own show, breaking up with Buffy). In other words, they stretched out a conflict (of whether or not they could be together) that could have realistically lasted about three episodes (and actually <em>did</em> end during the first half of the season).
</li></ul></li><li> While the Richard Castle/Kate Beckett relationship dynamic on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em> is <em>not</em> one of these, since the relationship dynamic between the two has for better or worse been the central driving engine of the show since the first episode, one of the frequent criticisms of the 'significant other' arcs of seasons three and four was that splitting Castle and Beckett up to be with other romantic partners damaged the chemistry between them and just bogged the showdown with unnecessarily angsty and predictable subplots that ultimately didn't really go anywhere.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015">Daredevil (2015)</a></em>:
<ul><li> Up to twenty minutes per episode for the first several episodes of Season 1 were spent on Foggy and Karen's budding relationship. This was negatively received, with many fans calling it boring filler and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiveGeeksAChance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiveGeeksAChance">Give Geeks a Chance</a>-type romance.
</li><li> Some feel this way about Matt and Karen's brief dating arc in season 2. While the build-up and initial execution is sweet, the fact that it's ended so abruptly just as it was getting started due to Elektra's re-entrance into Matt's life, <em>and</em> the fact that there are some viewers seem to prefer him with Elektra, made some people feel like it was kind of pointless. Matt coming clean with Karen about his secret identity in the last scene of season 2 doesn't help, as many (especially the Matt / Elektra shippers) believed that Matt was only settling with Karen because of Elektra getting killed by the Hand.
<ul><li> On the flip side, though many fans liked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElodieYung" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElodieYung">&Eacute;lodie Yung</a>'s performance as Elektra, some didn't feel convinced by the relationship between her and Matt. Other detractors state that it only added an unnecessary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BettyAndVeronica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BettyAndVeronica">love triangle to the plot</a>, or took up too much screen time when a slew of other interesting events was going on. The fact that her hijacking of Matt both directly and indirectly played a role in the breaking up of Nelson &amp; Murdock also doesn't help.
</li></ul></li><li> Season 1 has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> case with Wilson Fisk and Vanessa Marianna. Fisk spends the season dealing with his criminal empire while also courting Vanessa, but in time, his focus on Vanessa gets to the point that Leland Owlsley and Madame Gao try to have her killed to get Fisk back on track.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter">Dexter</a></em>:
<ul><li> Various seasons are afflicted with this to different degrees, such as 2 and 5, but the granddaddy of them all must be Season 4. We're repeatedly taken away from the A-Plot of the series to concentrate on LaGuerta and Batista's relationship. It's particularly galling because there's no build-up to this romance: they're already lovey-dovey by the time we see them and Batista's previous relationship is merely handwaved away. Oh, and this plotline affects the A-Plot in precisely <em>one</em> instance. Even worse is that it combined LaGuerta, whom many fans can't stand, and Angel, who is a fan favorite and perhaps the most likable person on the series.
</li><li> And there's Hannah McKay, whose relationship with Dexter in Seasons 7 <strong>and</strong> 8 took focus away from more interesting characters like Isaak Sirko and Evelyn Vogel. It eventually swallowed the plot to the point that it becomes Dexter's main arc and the fight with the antagonist and Dexter's dark passenger hobby feels more like the B-plot instead.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift">Genre Shift</a> between the Classic and New series from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBudget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBudget">No Budget</a> children's horror-comedy serial to a reasonably-budgeted flagship export under the BBC's "Original British Drama" imprint means that the show focuses a <em>lot</em> more on romance now than in the old days - both for better and for worse. A lot of this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">necessary to get the show made at all</a> &mdash; in 2005 the BBC was not making science fiction shows <em>or</em> family shows and everyone with experience making them had left the industry. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies">Russell T Davies</a> had to pitch the revival by associating it with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera">Soap Opera</a> that was the 'family show' of the time. This did help <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldGuardVersusNewBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldGuardVersusNewBlood">boost the show's popularity</a> and achieve a similar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleDemographicAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleDemographicAppeal">Multiple Demographic Appeal</a> as the show had had during its '60s and '70s heyday, but <em>every</em> season arc ends up having romance and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">The Power of Love</a> as a key, if not overwhelming, focus, which many Classic series fans find alienating (they'd long been used to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHuggingNoKissing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHuggingNoKissing">No Hugging, No Kissing</a>), and even many non-Classic fans find cheesy and poorly executed. The relationship - later confirmed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfSaintPaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfSaintPaul">Word of Saint Paul</a> as a romance - between the Tenth Doctor and Rose Tyler was the first to attract controversy over this, with the Doctor spending several episodes moping over Rose being trapped in an alternate universe. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat">Steven Moffat</a>'s disinterest in writing active villains (preferring malfunctioning machines or time loops gone wrong) and background in romantic comedy meant that his promotion to showrunner made the romance elements even more prominent:
<ul><li> The decision to introduce River Song, who not only acted as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">Spotlight-Stealing Squad</a> in every one of her appearances but actually <em>married</em> the Doctor in Series 6 (after several years of hinting). After the conclusion of the Clara Oswald arc in Series 9 (see below), the first thing Moffat did in the post-season <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2015CSTheHusbandsOfRiverSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2015CSTheHusbandsOfRiverSong">The Husbands of River Song</a>" was <em>reintroduce</em> River despite having written her out in a supposedly final way in the Series 7 finale. He then repeated what Davies did with Rose and the Tenth Doctor by having the Twelfth Doctor moping over the loss of River in the next episode, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2016CSTheReturnOfDoctorMysterio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2016CSTheReturnOfDoctorMysterio">The Return of Doctor Mysterio</a>", which is set shortly after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the 24-year Time Skip</span> that ended "Husbands" &mdash; and was <em>also</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a> that spelled the much-longer-than-usual break between Series 9 and 10, which works the relationship into the background of a new companion, but also firmly brings the River business to an end to the point that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she does not appear, even as a Glass Avatar, in this Doctor's Grand Finale while Clara Oswald does</span>.
</li><li> The Series 7 episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS33E1AsylumOfTheDaleks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS33E1AsylumOfTheDaleks">Asylum of the Daleks</a>" has a subplot where Amy and Rory are working their way through a divorce, which has no connection with anything else that happens in the episode. Their very <em>presence</em> in the episode feels unnecessary since they don't advance the plot in any way. It's even more grating seeing as neither the divorce or what caused it are ever mentioned again after they've got back together at the end of the story!
</li><li> Series 8, despite having a brand-new Doctor played by a charismatic and well-liked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCapaldi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCapaldi">Peter Capaldi</a>, focused strongly on the romantic relationship between the companion Clara and her new boyfriend Danny, meaning the Doctor and the monsters were often pushed to the sidelines. Even "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E4Listen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E4Listen">Listen</a>", the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> episode pitched as being about the Doctor having a mental breakdown, gives most of the screen time to Clara going on a bad date with Danny and using time travel to meet his child self and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalGrandson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalGrandson">Identical Grandson</a>. Ameliorating this somewhat is that from "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E6TheCaretaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E6TheCaretaker">The Caretaker</a>", the midpoint of the season, onward a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> situation is established (as confirmed via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfSaintPaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfSaintPaul">Word of Saint Paul</a> &mdash; the director of the episode &mdash; in the DVD commentary), putting an implied romance between Clara and the Doctor <em>on top of</em> the ongoing scenario with Danny. This plot is wrapped up in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonFinale">Season Finale</a> with a coda in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2014CSLastChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2014CSLastChristmas">Last Christmas</a>", and from there...
</li><li> This trope is <em>justified</em> in the final three episodes of Series 9. Clara <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a></span> and from there the Doctor temporarily becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds</a> over the matter. Along the way, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> returns to his home planet of Gallifrey after spending hundreds of years believing it was gone</span>. As that event wrapped up one of the revival's longest-running story arcs, many fans felt it warranted the central focus of an episode or two, and thus became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot">They Wasted a Perfectly Good Plot</a> in the service of confirming the Doctor and Clara had been elevated from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicLifePartners">Platonic Life-Partners</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers">Star-Crossed Lovers</a>. The justifications? First, excising the romantic aspect of these episodes would leave the finale trilogy without a substantial plot. Second, there's a clear implication &mdash; supported by such actions as trying to delay River Song's death and <em>blowing up a star</em> in order to send Rose a farewell message &mdash; that it is <em>dangerous</em> for the Doctor to fall in love with anyone, as it risks turning him into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheSuperman">Beware the Superman</a>. This makes "romantic plot tumours" directly related to the Doctor relevant to his ongoing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, <em>especially</em> in his twelfth incarnation, since the lessons he learns from his relationship with Clara ultimately allow him to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> finally love River the way she wanted him to, and for twenty-four years at that</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> A lot of screen time in Season 4 and 5 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DowntonAbbey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DowntonAbbey">Downton Abbey</a></em> is taken up with the recently widowed Mary's love triangle with Charles Blake and Anthony Gillingham. Mary vacillates between the two of them until finally, Gillingham's character is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerailingLoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerailingLoveInterests">derailed</a> in order to have Mary break up with him, and then he decides to marry another woman, leaving the path clear for Mary and Blake. Just when it looks like the two will finally get together, they agree they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterAsFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterAsFriends">better off as friends</a>, and Blake moves abroad. The entire love triangle has no real effect on any events in the show, nor on Mary, who gains yet another new love interest in the Christmas special following Season 5.
</li><li> One of the criticisms of the Niles/Daphne pairing in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em> was that not only were Niles and Daphne less interesting once they got together as a couple than when they were doing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrequitedLoveSwitcheroo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrequitedLoveSwitcheroo">Unrequited Love Switcheroo</a>, but that their relationship gradually began to take over the show and crowd out all the other characters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em>:
<ul><li> Finn and Rachel's relationship fits in this category for quite a few viewers. A story about a group of quirky, diverse and talented misfits trying to move beyond their small-town life and pursue their dreams via their shared love of music... and at least a third of each episode focuses on Finn and Rachel's on and off again romance. Seeing as both the characters are talented, white, straight, and able-bodied, it's easy to see why people found this to be tedious at times. The fact that the actors of Finn and Rachel eventually got into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceOnTheSet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceOnTheSet">actual relationship</a> and the fact that this pairing was supported by prominent columnists in the entertainment industry and the mass media doesn't help things either. Post-graduation, their on-and-off tango had no tension since it was clear they'd be together in the end. However, the untimely death of Cory Monteith pretty much put an end to that.
</li><li> The fourth season love triangle with Marley, Ryder, and Jake takes a good chunk of time out of almost every episode, and feels <em>very</em> uninspired due to the fact that all three characters are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">copies</a> of original ones: Marley was dubbed "The New Rachel," Jake is Puck's half-brother and has his attitude, and Ryder is yet another football jock who secretly loves to perform. Considering the nature of the show, and the fact that the two boys have much better chemistry with each other than either of them have with her, many fans wished they'd just come out as bi and go at it.
</li></ul></li><li> For many fans the John/Aeryn relationship finally degenerated into this in the fourth and final full season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em>. After coming up with convincing reasons for UST and angst for three seasons, much of S4 seemed like making up excuses to first have them angst and then rapidly get them together for the final third because the writers suddenly decided it was time. And Aeryn, in particular, lost practically all the dimensions she had previously so that almost everything was about her relationship with John. Most fans who feel like this think that the writers did manage to redeem the 'ship for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrapItUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrapItUp">Wrap It Up</a> "The Peacekeeper Wars".
</li><li> The Nicole/Bryce/Keiko situation on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FlashForward2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FlashForward2009">FlashForward</a></em>. While there were some legitimately heartwarming moments, this entire subplot could have been cut out of the show with minimum impact on the overall story, and it occasionally killed the momentum of the main solving-the-blackout mystery. Mark and Olivia's marital drama also verged on this, although that did tie into the plot more regularly.
</li><li> Claire's relationship with West in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em> was not one of the show's more successful moves, not least due to West being the only person in the entire run who Claire had absolutely NO chemistry with. Including Sylar and her UNCLE
</li><li> In the fourth installment of the A&amp;E/Meridian <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HoratioHornblower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HoratioHornblower">Horatio Hornblower</a></em> adaptation ("The Wrong War" or "The Frogs and the Lobsters", depending on what country it was released in), Horatio gets into a brief romantic subplot with a local girl during a mission in France. The story was already dealing with three separate plot threads and the romance with Mariette could have been taken out without changing any major events, and since Mariette's never mentioned after the conclusion of her little story arc, its usefulness as character development for Horatio is questionable. The fact that Mariette is given very little personality and isn't terribly popular even among the portion of the fandom that <em>doesn't</em> ship Horatio with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter">Breakout Character</a> best friend doesn't help.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em>:
<ul><li> TV critics have this opinion of the Cameron/Chase romance. Fans mostly loved it, partly because it was the only happy ending/positive portrayal of love in the series, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveHurts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveHurts">of course</a> that didn't last long.
</li><li> As much as House/Cuddy is loved, so too is it reviled for not only going absolutely nowhere for so very long but for a while popping up in <em>every single episode</em> without fail, often with little-to-no justification.
</li><li> Judging by the amount of screen time it got, the writers also thought fans were a lot more interested in exploring Taub's love life than was really the case. Taub? Interesting character. Taub/Whoever? Romantic plot tumor. The show becoming <em>The Many Loves of Dobie Taub</em> for a while was a tumor <em>on</em> the tumor.
</li><li> The relationship between Thirteen and Foreman was extremely unpopular for several reasons. Their relationship had very little build up, progressing from a mild dislike of each other to being in a relationship with only a couple of scenes of development. Furthermore, many fans were of the opinion that each of them had better chemistry with just about every other character on the show. Finally, both Foreman and Thirteen were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">very unpopular characters</a> to begin with, so a lot of fans just didn't care what happened to them.
</li></ul></li><li> Many fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfAnubis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfAnubis">House of Anubis</a></em> believed that it became overpowered by the romance in the second season, despite the mystery being the main plot. It got to the point where the characters themselves seemed more interested in romance than the life-threatening curses they were under.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em> suffered from this greatly. The series started out with Ted focusing on trying to get together with Robin, succeeding by the end of season one, and then them breaking up at the end of season two. Not so bad yet, namely since that at that point it was treated as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">Foregone Conclusion</a>, and we knew sooner or later, Ted would meet his real wife. But then as the show went on it continued to have Ted and/or Robin pining for the other only to repeatedly go through a lesson that they just weren't right for each other, all the way up to the final season. And then the final episode came. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The ship between Robin and Barney, one that a lot of fans preferred no less, was almost immediately thrown out minutes after the episode began, and much later it turned out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedInTheFridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedInTheFridge">Ted's wife fell deathly ill six years prior to the events of the show's framing sequence</a>. The plot tumor took over in-universe as well as it revealed that even though Ted was telling his kids the story of how he met his future wife, the fact that he focused more on Robin when he was telling the story was actually because he wanted permission from them to start dating Robin again, all so they would hook up at the last minute.</span> All this after it was thoroughly established that the two did not belong together. Needless to say, a lot of people were unhappy.
</li><li> While the Rio/Mele romance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JukenSentaiGekiranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JukenSentaiGekiranger">Juken Sentai Gekiranger</a></em> was very popular with English-speaking fans, the focus on their relationship to the exclusion of the heroes (resulting in little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> for any of the Gekirangers except Jan) is cited by some of the Japanese fanbase as a reason why the show didn't do well commercially.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKiva" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKiva">Kamen Rider Kiva</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> between Otoya Kurenai, Yuri, and Jiro. This is dragged out for several episodes, leading to a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerailingLoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerailingLoveInterests">Derailing Love Interests</a> as Jiro is turned into an obsessive lover who's prepared to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfICantHaveYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfICantHaveYou">kill Yuri</a> if she won't marry him. Finally, Otoya and Yuri get together &mdash; and then he dumps her for Maya, the mother of the show's protagonist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dhampyr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dhampyr">Wataru</a>. The entire storyline has little to no effect on the plot and is generally considered by fans to be pointless and superfluous. Its only function seemed to be to hint that Megumi might be Wataru's sister &mdash; but he later gains <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Taiga</span> as a long-lost sibling, so this subplot still served no purpose.
</li><li> Kiva also features a subplot in which Wataru's friend Shizuka develops a romantic interest in him and tries to come between him and his official love interest Mio. Inexplicably and without warning, Shizuka then decides that Wataru and Mio are perfect for each other, and becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">Shipper on Deck</a>, again with no relevance to or impact upon the story. The focus on romantic storylines (much more than is typical for a Kamen Rider series, which usually feature little to no overt romance), some of them seemingly pointless, is a possible reason why Kiva is one of the least successful entries in the franchise.
</li></ul></li><li> The Jack/Kate/Sawyer love-triangle on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>. Became especially grating when the series committed to a definite endpoint, and every second spent on this was one less second that could have been used clearing up the show's numerous mysteries and dangling plot-threads. Also because the writers proved that they could write relationship arcs that are well done and popular among the fans (see: Desmond &amp; Penny)...yet suddenly they couldn't do the same with the <em>main one</em>. This is taken to insane levels in the Season 5 finale, where Jack wants to erase the entire timeline by blowing up a nuclear bomb... because his relationship with Kate didn't work out. He doesn't seem to realize that this would mean they'd never meet in the first place! Juliet was also added to this romantic plot tumor. Additionally, Juliet suddenly changed her mind about detonating that hydrogen bomb because she thought that her relationship with Sawyer might end because Kate came back to the island. Really, the way Kate, Juliet, Sawyer, and Jack felt about detonating that hydrogen bomb was extremely arbitrary and depended entirely on how they felt about their role in this love polygon from hell at a given moment.
</li><li> The Kimberly/Tommy/Katherine triangle in the first seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</a></em> didn't start this way, and was actually pretty well put together, all things considered. Then came <em>Zeo,</em> and the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">Ass Pull</a> "Dear John Letter" Kimberly sent to Tommy. Katherine was forced to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieForOurShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieForOurShip">Die for Our Ship</a>, relationships on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> have been handled <strong>very delicately</strong> ever since, and "Tommy Oliver = Jesus" jokes began (since at this point Tommy had also become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">Spotlight-Stealing Squad</a>.)
</li><li> The Jim/Maggie/Don love triangle was pretty easily the most widely reviled plot thread of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNewsroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNewsroom">The Newsroom</a>.</em> Season two seems to be going out of its way to excise the tumor with extreme prejudice.
</li><li> While the love triangle between Mikay (the heroine), Jao, and Gino in the Filipino series <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_and_I">Princess And I<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is a major plot line, it has since become malignant that other larger plot threads are moved to the sidelines. This is mainly due to the series producers wanting to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">cash in</a> on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShiptoShipCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShiptoShipCombat">Jaomik vs. Migi wars</a>. Even with the story resolving the triangle when Mikay accepted Jao's marriage proposal (in a scene that suspiciously looked more like a wedding, the series still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanderingtotheBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanderingtotheBase">played up the triangle due to the clamor of the fans of the actor playing Gino to have more screen time</a> (a common headache in most Philippine soaps).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS">The Office (US)</a></em>: The Andy/Angela/Dwight plotline in Season 5, where Angela is with Andy but still in love with Dwight, consumes a lot of screentime and a large amount of Dwight's screen time during it. It's not helped by Angela and Dwight, the main couple of the triangle, coming off as unlikable or unsympathetic as they cheat, hurt and lie to Andy, who was an all-around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> at the time and Angela herself being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">The Scrappy</a> since her introduction.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime">Once Upon a Time</a></em>:
<ul><li> Emma's relationship with Hook is this for pretty much all fans who don't ship <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiosyncraticShipNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiosyncraticShipNaming">Captain Swan</a> because of how it elevated the importance of an extremely polarizing character above that of several other well-established characters from the first season, and because the show sometimes seems to go out of its way to make Hook look good even when he doesn't deserve it.
</li><li> Regina's relationship with Robin started off relatively well-received, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo">if poorly developed</a>, but it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbandonShipping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbandonShipping">quickly devolved</a> after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Marion turned out to be alive, and then Robin cheated on her with Regina while she was frozen and dying.</span> The writers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">tried to fix it</a> by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">having Marion turn out to actually be a glamour-ed Zelena</span>, but this really only made things worse because the faux love triangle <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and resulting pregnancy</span> turned out to be one of the least popular plot lines in the show's history up to that point.
</li><li> Though it started out extremely popular, most fans now feel this way about Rumple and Belle's relationship. The characters seem to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoYoPlotPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoYoPlotPoint">stuck in a cycle</a> of manufactured drama and both will and unwilling separations. At this point, even fans who used to be hardcore <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortmanteauCoupleName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortmanteauCoupleName">Rumbelle</a> shippers are tired of it.
</li><li> Henry and the new Cinderella in Season 7. Many fans argue that they are nothing more than a much more boring rehash of Snowing (plus, them being a copy of Snowing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">was intentional</a> on the writers' part), with their romance arc rushed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> (in one episode they kiss and two episodes later it skips to Henry announcing Lucy's birth and then an eight-year time skip <em>in the same episode</em>) leaving no time to develop their relationship at all, and furthermore fans (especially Henry/Drizella shippers) argue that Henry and Ella have no chemistry whatsoever, which is essential towards a believable love story. Yet even though their romance in the past is rushed, somehow the writers still have time to show these two onscreen together all the time.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PeakyBlinders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PeakyBlinders">Peaky Blinders</a></em>, Tommy and Grace are teased in the first Season even though Grace is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> working for his enemy, she eventually falls for him for real but still ends up selling him out and leaves Birmingham at the end of the first season. Come season two and Tommy has a new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a>, May, but ends up in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> with Grace when she briefly returns to Birmingham and the season finale has <em>three</em> women (May, Grace and Lizzy) waiting for him.

Tommy continues to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> hallucinate Grace years after her death</span> and seems inexplicably incapable of getting over her even after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he marries Lizzy and has a daughter with her</span>. This is especially egregious because she's the only character Tommy does this with - he lost his first love, Greta, and his friends <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Danny and Freddie</span>, his own mother and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em>John</em></span>, but none of them keep showing up and interrupting the story over and over again when they're supposed to be gone like Grace does.
</li><li> The writers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinHood">Robin Hood</a></em> <em>KNEW</em> that Jonas Armstrong (Robin Hood) was leaving at the end of the third season. Why then did they think that it was anything even <strong>close</strong> to a good idea to have him involve himself with Kate, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">the team liability</a>? The actors had no chemistry at all, and the "romance" served no purpose whatsoever except to milk time away from better characters and more interesting plots, secure Kate's position as the most hated character on the show, and make Robin appear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">impossibly shallow</a>, Kate being his second girlfriend since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his wife's horrific death</span> and the woman that his best friend is blatantly interested in. Even more illogically, the writers actually go to the trouble of bringing back <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Marian for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TogetherInDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TogetherInDeath">Together in Death</a> scene</span>, making Robin/Kate even <em>more</em> pointless than it already was.
</li><li> This has been a recurring issue on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RoyalPains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RoyalPains">Royal Pains</a></em>, to the point where the showrunners once issued a moratorium on Dr. Hank Lawson's love life after viewers complained that he seemed to spend too much time going into and out of relationships.

<ul><li> The Cook/Effy/Freddie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriangRelations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriangRelations">love triangle</a> in series 3 was one of those that looked perfect on paper, but was <em>horrendous</em> on screen; Cook's an unlikeable twat, Freddie can't act and Effy can only get away with being weird and mysterious when she's a side character (like she was in the first two series). The triangle was so all-consuming that it destroyed every other storyline it touched (not for nothing did it become known as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">"Triangle Of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomyDoomsOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomyDoomsOfDoom">DOOM"</a>), including most notably the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">Bromance</a> between Cook, Freddie, and JJ. The only storyline to escape unscathed - the Naomi/Emily/Katie triangle - is the most popular of the season, and by some distance. It's quite revealing to draw out all the significant relationship triangles to see how they interact (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHatesMathematics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHatesMathematics">they do form a planar graph</a>) because it demonstrates how central the Cook/Effy/Freddie triangle was and how important it was that it was done well. Which it wasn't.
</li><li> The much-criticized fourth series may have managed to turn the previously well-written Naomi/Emily relationship into a tumor in series 3. Evidently feeling that nothing was so interesting as overblown romantic angst borne of dishonesty and unfaithfulness (because that was working out <em>so</em> well will Effy/Freddie/Cook), the writers gave Naomi and Emily a season-long relationship breakdown which, along with the aforementioned Effy-based love triangle, consumed all screentime to the detriment of other characters' development.

Their relationship also dragged about four years/seasons past the traditional high school sweetheart stage.

The writers hadn't planned on pairing the two &mdash; it started being hinted at once they learned that fans already thought there was something going on between the couple &mdash; and it was clear that they had no idea where to go with it. It was buried at several points (with an entire episode practically dedicated to ending the ship), yet it crops up again every time, including several plot arcs where both Jack and Sam found someone but, of course, ended up ending those relationships in favor of the UST. It even became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> in the series, where every single Alternate Universe showed them being together, usually because Sam wasn't in the military in that universe.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrangerThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrangerThings">Stranger Things</a></em>: Season 3 falls into this, with an awful lot of drama in the season being stemmed from characters' romantic relationships, especially in the cases of Mike Wheeler / Eleven and Joyce Byers / Jim Hopper. Many have also noted that a lot of the show's familial relationships have taken a backseat to the romantic ones, and it doesn't go unnoticed since Jonathan Byers is reduced to being Nancy's sidekick with minimal interactions with either his mother or with Will. Likewise, Joyce is relegated to being Hopper's sidekick (and Hopper himself is reduced to a cariacture of his season 1 self). Mike and Nancy meanwhile are so isolated that casual viewers might not remember that they're siblings.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Studio60OnTheSunsetStrip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Studio60OnTheSunsetStrip">Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip</a></em> suffers from this, devoting more time in the last half of its single season to the Matt/Harriet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a> than to the stronger storyline about another character's brother becoming a POW.
</li><li> The Sam/Amelia romance on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> suffered from this. The romance being told entirely through flashbacks robbed the audience of seeing the natural progression and framing the story in opposition to not just the current <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a>, but also the much more interesting storyline of Dean escaping Purgatory, essentially set the whole romance up as a plot tumor. The most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">Egregious</a> example would be showing Dean first finding himself in Purgatory, then cutting to... Sam running over a dog and meeting Amelia. What really upset a lot of viewers was that Sam basically abandoned his brother to purgatory to pursue this relationship, which felt like a serious bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment">Character Derailment</a> for a pair that had literally gone to Hell and back for each other.

<ul><li> Bill and Sookie. This is a particularly bad example as <em>True Blood</em> has a lot of really interesting ideas (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">discrimination against vampires</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityImmorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityImmorality">how would Immortals function in the real world</a>) that were pushed to the side for a love triangle (with shapeshifter Sam).
</li><li> Later, Andy and Holly. These were two secondary characters whose attraction to each other not only came out of nowhere, but their relationship (and their children's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlirtyStepsiblings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlirtyStepsiblings">relationship</a>) suddenly became a major part of the show in the later seasons. What made matters worse was that Holly was a very distinctive character at first: the first Witch introduced in the series, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GranolaGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GranolaGirl">Granola Girl</a> and a feminist but not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist">overbearing about it</a>, and was instrumental in bringing down Season 4's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. But once she became Andy's girlfriend, all that was forgotten and her entire characterization revolved around her relationship with him, and she became a crying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a> to boot.
</li><li> Sam and Nicole. He had to rescue her when her college-age group of humans-for-supernaturals activists reached out to the local werewolves and got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">killed for their troubles</a>, including her previous boyfriend. It was particularly weird watching her have sex with Sam in the shower when by that point, her boyfriend had just been murdered a few days ago. A huge chunk of his side of the romance had to do with the fact that he had gotten her pregnant and sensed it before she did, but that did not keep the whole thing from feeling extremely forced. The protests of Nicole's mother ("You're traumatized and you just met this man who's twice your age...") were supposed to sound unreasonable and prejudiced, but frankly, she said everything viewers were saying.

For starters, Dolls was abruptly killed off, which ended the love triangle permanently, only for two more triangles to start up and at the same time.

As a result, Wyatt had to go back to her and break Lucy's heart in the process. Wyatt was so determined to make his marriage work, and he and everyone else were so distracted by Jessica's return, that he was blind to clues about the real reason she was there until she kidnapped Jiya and stole their timeship. It turned out that Rittenhouse had gone even further back in time to train Jessica to become a lethal agent of theirs, and sent her to manipulate Wyatt in order to destroy the team from the inside. Everyone was angry with Wyatt for his willful ignorance (except for Lucy, who was pissed that he dumped him but understood his situation). Wyatt tried to rectify his mistake, but after Jessica lied about being pregnant, his decision to spare her indirectly led to Rufus' death. In the end, Wyatt realized that the only way to truly fix things was for Jessica to die at the time she was supposed to, which Flynn ensured happened.</span>

Any potentially romantic opportunities were then left in sidequests. Contrary to that, the <em>Lineage and Legacies</em> arc was practically nothing <em>but</em> Cheria and Asbel's very obvious romance. Asbel is portrayed from the beginning as thinking of Cheria in a special way, both get very stuttery around each other and blush a lot, with the rest of the party teasing the two about it as well.

Their interactions are always awkward, they don't really advance their romance past this highly awkward stage and it gets worse as the game progresses. More and more scenes seem to <em>shove</em> the two of them together, which does not work well with the aforementioned awkwardness.

The fact that any romantic scene between the two of them is a YMMV moment itself on whether it actually counts as romantic or something else, and the game heavy-handedly shoving the two together a lot makes any potential romance between them unpleasant to go through in the game.

The attempts at romantic scenes come across as very awkward and out of place and while his spyrite technology does advance as well, it comes at the cost of viewing said awkward scenes.
</li></ul></li><li> Thrall and Aggra from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a>: Cataclysm</em>, whose romantic arc received more attention and focus than most of the expansion's other plots despite having almost no relevance to the actual story. Metzen, one of the lead writers for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, outright loathed the Thrall and Jaina ship which was extremely popular amongst the fanbase. He wanted everyone to know that cross-species relationships just weren't going to happen on his watch. Even if he had to shove a forced romance down everyone's throats to make his point.
<ul><li> One could argue the impracticality of them falling in love given that they belong to two warring factions, but in the tie-in novel <em>The Shattering,</em> it is specifically stated that Thrall cannot be with Jaina because "she is not an orc." Seems silly when you look at some of the canonical interracial relationships in the game, such as the gnome in River's Heart and his human wife, or, more famously, the human Rhonin and his high elf wife, Vareesa Windrunner, who even have two half-elf children.

In practice, it wasn't that it was more complicated, just that it filed things under that category that humans don't.

It didn't overrun the entire story, and the subplot is sweet and not many fans complain about it. It still counts because while it distracts from the main story, the main stories themselves are so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">controversial</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anvilicious</a> that the audience actually <em>welcomes</em> the distraction.

Even after new showrunners took over, this idea stuck; when romance plots <em>do</em> occur in the show, they are both the main plot of the episode and reserved for side characters, such as Princess Cadance and Shining Armor's marriage. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a> breaks that rule somewhat by showing that Pinkie Pie is now married to Cheese Sandwich, but the romance isn't given much focus other than "look how much the main characters have grown", and there is no romantic <em>plot</em> to speak of since the romance happened entirely off-screen during the decades-long <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>.

<ul><li> Season 3 took the growing romance issues from the previous season and doubled down on them, almost as though the writers were actively trying to make shipping fans of the show as upset and confused as possible. Starting off, Star likes Marco but has to go back to Mewni due to the events of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a>. Marco is dating Jackie, but she dumps him knowing that Marco has stronger feelings for Star (though he doesn't realize this yet), allowing Marco to move to Mewni to be near Star. Unfortunately, Star has gotten over Marco and is now back together with her ex-boyfriend Tom, meaning that Marco is left pining for Star when he realizes he's in love with her. Meanwhile, the side characters of Kelly and Tad break up for the umpteenth time but say this time is the final time, leading to Kelly and Marco sharing strong <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> in spite of them having very little interaction beforehand. But that's derailed when Star and Marco share a kiss towards the end of the season, albeit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForCheating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForCheating">not for romantic intentions</a> but still resulting in them rethinking what their relationship actually is. The heavy and confusing teasing of several pairings simultaneously takes the focus off more lore-related plot lines, mainly the Queen Eclipsa <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and Heinous</span> plot.
</li><li> While Season 4 doesn't neglect the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> as much as Season 3, it continues the trend Season 3 began by stretching the romantic plot further and further despite also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">blatantly telegraphing a "Starco" ending</a>. In addition to showing the rocky nature of Star and Tom's relationship, primarily due to actions on Star's side of things, the show offers numerous moments for the two to break up only to perpetuate the relationship. Meanwhile, Marco and Kelly get together in a G-rated version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendsWithBenefits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendsWithBenefits">Friends with Benefits</a> so they can move on from their former flames, but this is brought up for only one other episode before they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc">abruptly break up</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenBreakup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenBreakup">off-screen no less</a>. Fans believed that "Beach Day" would be the episode that would lead to them finally getting together, but it turned out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a> and they remain friends. Tom would finally break up with Star shortly after that episode, however, and then directly tell Marco that he'd be fine with him dating Star. But by that point, the Myth Arc was back in full force and ready to head towards its resolution. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Star and Marco would finally share a quick (non-cheating) kiss during "Here to Help" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastMinuteHookup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastMinuteHookup">with only three episodes left in the series</a>. Just in time for their love to cause a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MergedReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MergedReality">Merged Reality</a> of Earth and Mewni, so they can continue their relationship after the destruction of magic. The love-based merging of world was quickly seen as just another divisive move in an already polarizing series finale, where even fans that loved it feel <em>both</em> the lore elements and romance elements were incredibly rushed in order to fit everything into 22 minutes.</span>

</li><li> One of the more heavily disliked aspects of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2012">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012)</a></em> is Donatello's constant crush on April. It wasn't so bad during the first season where it just popped up every now and then, but in season two the new writers decided to take it and make it the primary aspect of Don's character, making every single one of his appearances devoted to him lamenting on his crush on April and getting jealous over Casey, which has also wound up limiting April's character development as well. Even worse is by the end of the season it seemed that the whole love-triangle aspect was finally resolved, only for the whole thing to come back with a vengeance early on in the third season. By this point, fans have become sick of it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em>. In general, the romantic relationships among the cast end up getting a disproportionate amount of focus, at the expense of the other subplots and important friendships among the characters. This becomes far more noticeable after the episode count for each season was sliced in half, forcing the writers to cram a lot more into the episodes instead of being able to spread things out.
<ul><li> Many feel that the belligerent love triangle between Duncan, Courtney, and Gwen in the series got a little tired at some point. But there weren't too many episodes of it.
</li><li> Plenty of fans, especially adult fans feel this way about the ongoing romantic tension between Mike and Zoey between <em>Revenge of the Island</em> and especially <em>All-Stars</em>; already coming across as overblown and repetitive, with Mike's Multiple Personality Disorder seen as distasteful in serving as the sole obstacle of their romance, many have gone so far as to blame the critical failure of the latter season almost entirely upon this plot.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Off</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDramaPresentsTheRidonculousRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDramaPresentsTheRidonculousRace">Total Drama Presents: The Ridonculous Race</a></em> had Carrie/Devin for the parts of the base that found them blander than the rest of the cast with a plot that was extremely predictable. It's worth saying that the reaction was never as negative as previous <em>Total Drama</em> examples, probably thanks to <em>Race</em> being a full-length season so their romance didn't stifle the other plots due to competing for limited airtime.
</li><li> <em>The Ridonculous Race</em> also had Stephanie/Ryan. Unlike with Carrie/Devin, the reaction to them is about as negative as previous <em>Total Drama</em> examples (if not, worse) due to many finding their immaturity to be very insufferable (most of their post-breakup conversations boil down to them yelling and screaming at each other) as well as dodging elimination <strong>three</strong> times due to most of them conveniently falling into the "Non-elimination episode if an important character loses" trap that the original series was guilty of.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub">Winx Club</a></em> has to juggle the main plotline alongside six different romantic subplots, a few tend to fall by the wayside. While no single romantic relationship is consistently a plot tumor, and they all further the action at some point, such as Bloom going to Earth <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after finding out about Sky's fianc&eacute;e</span>, Tecna's getting her Charmix <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by having feelings for Timmy</span>, and Aisha turning to the warrior fairies after the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">death of Nabu</span>, at any given time in the series the majority of the relationships featured aren't doing anything for the plot.

<ul><li> The media has often been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstNewsJudgmentEver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstNewsJudgmentEver">accused of this when it comes to news</a>, with focus on celebrity gossip, relationships, and breakups over... well, real news. An example would be <em>The New York Post</em> on January 1, 2012. On December 31, 2011, news sources reported about further unrest in Syria, the acknowledgement of Kim Jong Un as the supreme leader of North Korea and a warning about the nation not changing their policies, general elections in Jamaica, saber-rattling by Iran against the United States and Israel (or the other way, depending on how you look at it), and Russell Brand ending his marriage to Katy Perry. <a class="urllink" href="https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/2011-12-31-front.jpg?quality=100&amp;strip=all&amp;w=744">Guess which story showed up on the front page of the New York Post<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
