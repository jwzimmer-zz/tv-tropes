<ul><li> Quite a few examples in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider">Tomb Raider</a></em> series.
<ul><li> Natla in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider">Tomb Raider</a></em>. She goes down in only one or two bullets, and it's easy to shoot her dead thinking she's just one of the other flying enemies in the area.
</li><li> This trope is parodied in the <em>Tomb Raider</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">custom game</a> "Simply Purple". Roaring sounds are heard, the player is bombarded with medipacks and other supplies, ominous music plays, and... the boss is a little dwarf that can't even attack Lara properly.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Joachim Karel</span> in <em>Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness</em>, if he could even count as a boss. All you have to do is run away from him. Considering that he's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a powerful Nephilim</span>, you'd think he'd be a little more challenging.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eckhardt</span> immediately before that "battle" also qualifies, as you can literally dodge most attacks by just ducking, and even if you do get hit, it doesn't damage you that much anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ganondorf from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em>. He's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TennisBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TennisBoss">Tennis Boss</a> and not even a good <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TennisBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TennisBoss">Tennis Boss</a>. A previous boss called Phantom Ganon, which is supposed to be weaker than the real Ganondorf, is more challenging, as the arena you fight him in is much smaller, giving you less time to react to the blasts. Even in his Ganon form, where his attacks will do a massive amount of damage if they connect, he's still a complete joke, as he's incredibly slow with equally slow attacks. Beating him is as simple as rolling under his legs and whaling on his tail over and over again.
</li><li> The final battle of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks">The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks</a></em> can easily end up as this for aggressive players. When you start actually fighting Malladus, he will almost <em>never</em> attack if you constantly hit him with your sword (this is actually the point of the battle, to get Malladus to face away from Zelda so she can shoot him in the back). The short "short" sequence before this is also nearly impossible to fail, as Zelda, whom you must defend from Malladus' flaming boulders while she charges her magic, will never die if she gets hit, but simply lose focus. You lose health if Zelda is hit, but the flaming boulders tend to drop recovery hearts.
</li><li> Ganon from the infamous CD-i game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaCdiGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaCdiGames">Link: The Faces Of Evil</a></em>. All you have to do is throw the Book of Koridai at him, and..."No! Not into the pit! <em>It burrrrrns</em>!!!"
</li><li> Also in <em>The Faces Of Evil,</em> a single bomb in the Glutko's mouth kills it.
</li><li> In <em>The Wand of Gamelon</em>, Zelda just has to throw the titular Wand at Ganon to defeat him: "The chains! <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo">NOOOO!</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillMeetAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillMeetAgain">You haven't seen the last of me!</a>"
</li><li> Hot Head, the next to last boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaLinksAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaLinksAwakening">The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</a></em>. Despite his only attack (the lava particles from when he submerges) doing <strong>four</strong> hearts of damage, it is very possible to stunlock him with the Fire Rod. The flames from the fire rod that stay for a few seconds can stunlock him, giving you free hits on him. It's possible to defeat him after dousing his flame shell, never submerging again.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ganon</span> from the linked <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames">The Legend of Zelda: Oracle Games</a></em>. His attacks, while strong, are very slow and predictable, allowing you to go up to him, spin attack, then use Pegasus seeds to get away before he launches his attack. To top it all off, he doesn't have a final form and is weaker than the vanilla bosses of each game <em>and the boss just before him</em>.
</li><li> Zant from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em>. He takes you to previous boss arenas and requires you to use the same item used against it. Once you figure that out, he becomes simple, and he is not helped by the small number of attacks he possesses. Even the final phase, where he takes out swords, is easy because it boils down to waiting until he stops attacking and hitting him.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The final battle with Ganon</span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em>. In spite of looking great and its amazing music, the fight essentially boils down to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">shooting the glowing weak points on Ganon's body with light arrows. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">While he hardly ever tries to move or turn around</a></em>. And even though he hits hard, this is only if he actually hits you, as his only real attack is firing slow, predictable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams">mouth lasers</a> at you.</span> Especially anti-climactic considering that the fight comes right after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Calamity Ganon, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss">lengthy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">grueling</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalExamBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalExamBoss">Final-Exam Boss</a> that uses the attack patterns of the previous Ganon bosses. The anticlimax can be somewhat mitigated on speed runs, as your lack of equipment will certainly make the fight much harder</span>.
</li><li> Ganon in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI">The Legend Of Zelda I</a></em> would either be this or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">Hopeless Boss Fight</a>, dependent on whether you found the Silver Arrows. Even though he's invisible and constantly teleporting, his projectiles just don't do enough damage to an endgame-ready Link, meaning that attacking the air and dodging occasionally will be plenty to get in the needed three hits and bring him down.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrueCrimeStreetsOfLA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrueCrimeStreetsOfLA">True Crime: Streets of L.A.</a></em>: General Kim is the Anticlimax boss of the worst ending, a rather feeble opponent who can be taken down with repeated jumpkicks. If you play each ending in order, General Kim is surprising for two reasons; being the actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the final ending, and being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClimaxBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClimaxBoss">Climax Boss</a> requiring more fighting skill than any other fight and a tough driving-shooting challenge.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrueCrimeNewYorkCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrueCrimeNewYorkCity">True Crime: New York City</a></em> has two ending paths. The "bad" ending ends in a simple 2-dimensional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs">Good Old Fisticuffs</a> fistfight against the police captain in a cramped subway car (where you simply punch him until you back him off the screen and off the train), which is rather anticlimactic compared to some of the insane Kung Fu boss fights earlier in the game (including a sword fight against a 7-foot tall Black Samurai Rap Star). Contrast that with the original <em>True Crime: Streets of LA</em>, where the "true" final boss, General Kim, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking">was the best fighter in the game</a>, and the only opponent you had to beat with strategy (mostly blocking then counterattacking) instead of simply button mashing.
</li><li> Even though he's the leader of The Five, and actually knocks Mike on his ass in the cutscene where he's finally introduced, Dr. Victor Batrachian from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowMan">Shadow Man</a></em> is far and away the easiest boss to kill. Given as how he had depopulated an entire prison over the preceding 72 hours without even bothering to unstrap himself from the electric chair, the fact that he comes after you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUser">with a baton</a> is a little embarrassing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em>
<ul><li> You slug your way through <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaIISimonsQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaIISimonsQuest"> Castlevania II: Simon's Quest</a></em>, enter Dracula's castle with the kickass music, make your way slowly to his altar, re-assemble his body parts... then proceed to kill him with fire before he can even get out of his entrance animation. Even if you don't use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> fire weapon, he's still ridiculously easy. He goes around and around in circles, and doesn't do much else; all you have to do is stand in the corner and throw daggers.
</li><li> Dracula in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaI">the first game</a> starts off as a challenging foe, with his minuscule weak spot you have to jump to hit, fireball attacks that spread just enough to be tricky to parry, and love of teleporting directly on top of you for a pile of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollisionDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollisionDamage">Collision Damage</a>. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">final form</a> looks tougher, but is far slower and more predictable, and doesn't do much aside from jump around the room. On top of that, he's also become weak to holy water, to the point that with a bottle of the stuff and a Triple Shot (the former of which is even in the boss room), you can straight-up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfHurting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfHurting">stunlock</a> Dracula's last form and hit him with holy water until he dies. Even with his high damage, he's nothing compared to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell">Platform Hell</a> beforehand.
</li><li> While much harder, Dracula is still nothing special in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a></em>. Despite having 10,000 HP and being able to hit pretty hard, it is very possible to beat him without any familiars, spells, or even items, since all that HP is shared among his three heads, making it possible to do three times the damage per hit that you'd normally do. He's still significantly harder than most of the bosses in the game, though.
</li><li> There's also his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperCastlevaniaIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperCastlevaniaIV">Super Castlevania IV</a></em> incarnation. Most of his attacks are easy to dodge with the possible exception of the second one; however, you can actually get healed after that attack (if you attack it), and he uses it on two occasions.
</li><li> Dracula Wraith in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaHarmonyOfDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaHarmonyOfDissonance">Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance</a></em>. His first form is just classic Dracula, which is really easy to dodge in this game, and his second form is a giant eyeball... thing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's basically an amalgamation of the body parts you had to collect to get to this point.</span> Its only attacks are to shoot a beam, which can be dodged by simply crouching, and to swing his arm at Juste, which can be dodged by being at the edge of the room. Sometimes he uses these two attacks at the same time, but this can also be dodged by crouching and then sliding to the end of the room.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaLordsOfShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaLordsOfShadow">Castlevania: Lords of Shadow</a></em> continues the series' tradition of underwhelming final boss fights, this time with Satan. He does a pretty credible impression of a challenging boss, with lots of health, potent and hard to avoid attacks that can be chained to devastating effect, the ability to summon groups of dangerous adds, and the same mechanic from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">utterly brutal</a> Silver Warrior fight, in which the player has to rapidly cycle between light and shadow magic in order to do more than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a>. He could easily be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a> himself, except for one thing: so long as the player hits him with the right type of magic, each successful attack restores a preposterous amount of health. A single hit can bring back 20-25% of Gabriel's health, so the sort of 3-hit chain that any player who has gotten this far can execute in their sleep can restore one from critical to near-full. Oh yeah, and this is the one fight in the game in which Gabriel's magic gauges can never run out.
</li></ul></li><li> The final boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow2">Saints Row 2</a></em>. The first 3 are fairly epic in their own right, including an ATV vs Jeep fight in a mall and a sword fight on a burning ship. The pre-boss fight was hell in a handbasket, using a helicopter to fend off other helicopters while attacking several gate locks in order to get at the guy. The final boss? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dane Vogel in his office, who you can quickly proceed to blow up with a well-placed satchel charge</span>. Even the lead-up to it isn't that great, making it feel like the whole thing was just put in for a final mission arc.

<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mikiko</span>. After a fairly intense battle with Kage, you think you're done, but wait, one last fight...that will go down in two shots, tops. After an entire game of the poor AI keeping you from doing anything, shooting this final boss will give the player more satisfaction than anything else in this game.
</li><li> Kage Mishima's no Spring Chicken himself; despite being a melee-oriented enemy, he's very slow, making it very easy to just back away from him and unload your best heavy gun into his face. He does have a ranged attack where he sends a wave of ghosts at you, but that can also be avoided by running in circles.
</li></ul></li><li> The Shadowlord in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NieR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NieR">NieR</a></em> is this, particularly if you are fighting him on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">second, third, or fourth playthrough</a>. Sold as a badass, protective father in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a>, the final battle consists of dodging (read: rushing through with a spear) insane <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">waves of magic</a> until you get close enough to strike him. After three hits, he's down and the game is over; his badassery from before not even dignified a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">handwave</a> (although there was a bit of a hint that he'd <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">lost the will to live</a>).

<ul><li> Saddler from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em>. As the final boss in a game filled with tough, memorable boss fights, you'd think his fight would be pretty epic. But that isn't the case, with an obvious weak spot, a surprisingly low amount of health, and attacks that do relatively little damage. Plus, the fight takes place in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy">an area that contains several traps which can be used against him</a>, making the fight even easier. He provides a more challenging fight against Ada in <em>Separate Ways</em>, but in the last part of the battle (which corresponds to Leon as per the main story), all she has to do is speedrun through the towers of the island's pier while dodging a few enemies to reach the rocket she's supposed to throw to Leon for him to finish Saddler instantly.
</li><li> Birkin's final form in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2">Resident Evil 2</a></em> is just a giant blob who can't even hit you if you don't stand next to him.

He has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">very damaging attacks</a>, but he is the only enemy in the game who can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Knockback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Knockback">knocked back</a> by attacks, and his AI is also bad. It's possible to jump onto the right side platform and spam projectiles in his general direction, or even just corner him in the correct spot and smack him whenever he pulls his weapon out.

After getting 5s on every level on the first five planets to unlock the sixth planet &mdash; the toughest part of which is probably getting 5s on the boss levels &mdash; and going through two of the most insane levels in the game, you get to the last boss and...he's about as tough as Nitros, at worst.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain">Legacy of Kain</a></em>:
<ul><li> Despite being one of the most powerful creatures in existence, doing battle with Kain in <em>Soul Reaver</em> isn't very impressive in comparison to his sons. Each time you fight him, you only need to smack him three times while he stands still and shoots lightning bolts at you, and then you watch a cutscene.
</li><li> The end of <em>Soul Reaver 2</em>, and the closest thing the entire game has to a boss encounter. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's completely impossible to die because the Reaver keeps your health at maximum, and you can't even drop the sword to give yourself a challenge.

Once the heads are gone, all the Hydra can do is charge at you, and the headless body goes down in just a few hits.
</li><li> The final battle in the official tie-in game to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace">The Phantom Menace</a></em> makes it possible to kill Darth Maul in just a few seconds by Force-shoving him into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit">Bottomless Pit</a>.

When you finally meet up with him, he's standing still, facing the wall and not even noticing you. All you have to do to kill him is <em>walk up and touch him</em>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shantae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shantae">Shantae</a></em> games has a pattern of giving the players a relatively easy penultimate boss fight before bringing in the absolutely brutal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>. For the plot-critical examples:
<ul><li> Despite being much-hyped as a Doomsday Device, the All-Purpose Steam Powered Tinker Tank in the first game has little defense against Shantae since the Tinkerbats had apparently forgotten to install anti-personnel weapons on it. The only way it could damage the Half-Genie heroine is if she falls on the tank treads or stands in front of its two steam vents, both of which are trivial to avoid since she has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameFlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameFlight">Harpy form</a> by that point. It's not quite to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroEffortBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroEffortBoss">Zero-Effort Boss</a> levels, since you still need to figure out how to destroy it, but you have all the time in the world to do so.
</li><li> The Pirate Master, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> of <em>Shantae and the Pirate's Curse</em>, is this if you fail to collect all 20 Dark Magic. With only two kinds of attacks that are easily blocked or avoided, and a lot of moments where he leaves himself wide-open to a series of hair-whips, there's a reason why he's one of the easiest bosses to defeat in the game without taking any damage<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0tst9');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0tst9" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0tst9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Second only to the first boss in the game</span> according to the Global <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam">Steam</a> Achievements stats. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Of course, if you do manage to collect all 20 Dark Magic, he will then change to his true form for a real challenge.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Widget from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OverlordDarkLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OverlordDarkLegend">Overlord: Dark Legend</a> could easily be killed by just standing out of the reach of his flamethrower and letting the red Minions attack him with their fireballs from a small ridge. Since they are standing on a higher level than he is, his close combat attacks won't reach them and he only attacks them with the flamethrower, which they are immune to. Then you have to wait until he dies and realize that this was the final boss.
</li><li> While all of the boss battles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tomba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tomba">Tomba!</a></em> are fairly easy, the battle against the Final Evil Pig is especially pathetic. He can only harm you via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollisionDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollisionDamage">Collision Damage</a> since his sole spell simply freezes you in place for a few seconds, there are no environmental hazards, and worst of all, he goes down just as easily as any of the other Evil Pigs: one toss into the Evil Pig Bag, and roll credits. Thankfully, the sequel takes deliberate measures to avert the trope by turning his arena into a pit-filled deathtrap, giving him attacks that actually hurt you, and requiring <em>five</em> tosses into the bag to finish him off.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLittleMermaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLittleMermaid">The Little Mermaid</a></em>, Ursula's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a> form is even easier than her first form. Her only new power is the ability to control the water current, which can be easily overcome, and there are no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleMinorMinion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleMinorMinion">starfish</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpiny">urchins</a> this time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry">Devil May Cry</a></em>:

As Lucia's final boss and looking so disturbing and freaky, you'd think that this monstrosity could put up a good fight. Instead, despite its size and even if you get hit from its moves, you'll likely be able to kill it by <em>standing still, throwing daggers non-stop, and just move out of the way of its poisonous attack or towards the other end of the crevice you're in</em>.
</li><li> Sanctus Diabolica of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry4">Devil May Cry 4</a></em> is one of the easiest final bosses (and possibly bosses period) in the series by a wide margin, with attacks that, while reasonably hard hitting, are choreographed from so far away that they can be dodged blindfolded, low defenses, and an "ultimate attack" that can be easily turned back on him to inflict even more damage. He is, in fact, easier than his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss">Disc-One Final Boss</a> form half-way through the game; which, while not especially challenging, at least has a rectangular arena that makes him harder to catch, a smaller window to attack him in, and no "ultimate attack" besides the Savior's downward punches, which can also be used against him.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UrbanReign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UrbanReign">Urban Reign</a></em>, after proceeding through most of the game solo taking on various criminals, gang members, psychopaths, martial artists, and a couple of giants that the game simply describes as "monsters", the last boss is none other than <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the corrupt Mayor, who dies with about 2-3 punches</span>. But he's the only one who uses a gun, and the game doesn't hesitate to make its damage realistic.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrudeBuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrudeBuster">Two Crude Dudes</a></em>, the last boss is a pint-sized scientist in a labcoat who can't do anything except run around and ineffectually thump you while you kick the bejesus out of him. Unfortunately, once you've had your fun, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">mutates</a> into a pretty badass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss">Sequential Boss</a>.
</li><li> The final boss of the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KunioKun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KunioKun">Kunio-kun</a></em> game (<em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Renegade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Renegade">Renegade</a></em> being the American localization), an evil Yakuza boss named Sabu, is depressingly easy to beat. Although he's the only baddie who uses a gun and can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">kill with one hit</a>, he can only shoot along one single trajectory, so all you have to do is duck right in front of him and keep whaling on him until he goes down.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiverCityRansom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiverCityRansom">River City Ransom</a></em> for the NES, the final boss, Slick, is quite easy compared to the second-to-last fight against the Dragon Twins. Even more so if you have two players.
</li><li> In the GBA remake Slick is a beast of a fight, using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGenreChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGenreChange">telekinesis powers</a> &mdash; he still isn't as strong as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">the Dragon Twins</a>, but he's not a trivial fight anymore.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamAsylum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamAsylum">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a></em>, Killer Croc is <em>heavily</em> built up as a massive threat, with a torn-apart animal cage with skeletons in it, the patient diaries where he <em>bites a man's hand off</em>, and the fact that he's a Nine-Foot-Tall lizard man. When you face him, he's more a stage hazard than an enemy, where all you have to do is slowly walk across platforms, occasionally tossing a batarang if he decides to show his face.
<ul><li> Joker. All you do is run in circles, wait for him to get bored, and beat up his mooks before pulling him down with the Batclaw and punching him in the face while he's stuck in the ground. This repeats three times. Honestly, the previous fight with the Titan henchmen and army of mooks was harder.
</li></ul></li><li> The Sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity">Batman: Arkham City</a></em>, has the fight against Penguin.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamKnight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a></em>, the final game in the main trilogy, has a lot of these as a side effect of completely eschewing hand-to-hand boss battles and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">Puzzle Boss</a> confrontations in favor of Batmobile battles and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutsceneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutsceneBoss">barely interactive cutscenes</a>. Of particular note:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">Man-Bat</a> is built up as a hulking, inhuman monstrosity that has already brutally murdered at least one person, and could surely give Batman a challenging fight. He does not attack, and you beat him by tracking him down throughout the campaign and flying into him like you would a drone, whereupon Batman doses Man-Bat with a syringe of antidote in a non-interactive cutscene.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyroManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyroManiac">Firefly</a>, who was the subject of an epic boss fight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamOrigins">Batman: Arkham Origins</a></em>, here simply flies away while you chase him in the Batmobile and occasionally lobs a fire attack into the road below.

Both of them are huge targets, which makes them incredibly easy to combo, and also have an easily exploited AI. The only thing that makes them remotely difficult is that in the odd event they do decide to use one of their stronger attacks and manage to connect with it, it can send you flying even at a low percentage.

<ul><li> Shinnok in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat4">Mortal Kombat 4</a></em> definitely qualifies, seeing as you've known all along how he fights and he doesn't offer that much of a challenge like, say, Shao Kahn did in previous installments. And it's not just because you can regularly select him: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberBandAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberBandAI">Rubber-Band A.I.</a> just doesn't seem to work on him like it did for Shang Tsung and Quan Chi in <em>Deadly Alliance</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame">Fighting Game</a> veterans, and even some who've never played a <em>Mortal Kombat</em> game before, would find Shao Kahn this across the different installments. His taunts run in a pattern, which give fighters easy hits. Shao Kahn on the Game Gear is especially easy, as he has half the life of a normal contestant, and his attacks don't do any more damage than a normal fighter. Considering Kintaro can be beaten with simple strategy, one can play the game wondering why Mileena wasn't made the final boss.
</li><li> In the Game Gear version of the first game, while Shang Tsung is still very hard, it falls onto Goro to be the letdown boss. Considering he is considered so iconic to the series, it's odd that Raiden is much harder to take down in the game, since Goro will only block when attacked, not retaliating unless you pause to rest your thumb (he can be beaten by continually hitting the "kick" button). It makes him feel like a chance to rest after those brutal endurance matches.

Then he goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a> and... he's basically a joke. His strategy is to hover, firing slow-moving projectiles that don't do much damage, while you charge up finishing move after finishing move. There's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a> ending if you beat him in under two minutes. Some people achieve it by accident.

Disable the shield with 3 ICE picks (bypassing the hacking minigame), shoot 2 EMP grenades. Shoot 6 EMP grenades to her shield, shoot her twice. Use your assault rifle with AP cartridges: just pull the trigger, and she is downed... And you still have bullets in your magazine. Deactivate her shield, jump over the ledge, and hit her at close contact. Or, if you're the OSA type, just spam cryokinesis for 12 seconds. And you are not even hit once while doing this!

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Doom">Doom</a></em>
<ul><li> Many consider the boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DOOM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DOOM">DOOM</a></em>'s third episode, the Spider Mastermind, easier than the boss of the second episode, the Cyberdemon. The Mastermind's biggest advantage is an autotracking chaingun attack, but the giant green outhouse in the middle of the arena means there's plenty of cover. If you found the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">BFG</a> hidden earlier in the episode you can sprint up in the creature's face and 1HKO it before its AI has registered that the fight has started.
</li><li> The Cyberdemon itself poses comparatively little threat, though he was seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a> in the early days of the franchise. He's the embodiment of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss">Damage-Sponge Boss</a>, with the highest health in the game (beating out even the Spider Mastermind) and rockets that chop off half your health in a single direct hit. But as he's usually fought in a massive open area, and his rockets, though faster than most projectiles in the game, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PainfullySlowProjectile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PainfullySlowProjectile">are not hitscan weapons</a>, he tends to be fairly easy for anyone who knows how to circlestrafe properly or anyone with a mouse-and-keyboard setup. Without the BFG, he's mostly a waiting game of how long it takes to whittle him down while he spams rockets ineffectually; with it, he's a downright pushover. Many fanmade maps tend to treat him as less a boss and more a beefy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook">Elite Mook</a> (same with the Spider Mastermind, to a lesser extent).
</li><li> Both of the above are exacerbated in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoomII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoomII">Doom II</a></em>, where basically every encounter with the Cyberdemon and Spider Mastermind has some kind of gimmick making them way easier than they should be. For instance, in MAP 20, you encounter both of them in the same room... and hostile to each other, at which point the challenge becomes "wait for ten seconds and then kill the badly-injured survivor."
</li><li> The Icon of Sin in <em>Doom II</em> makes the Spider Mastermind look like an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss">SNK Boss</a>. It consists mainly of a wall texture, and its only threat is the monsters spawning by it. How do you kill it? Activate the elevator, ride it up, take out your rocket launcher, and fire the rockets at the gigantic glowing red spot in the middle of its forehead a few times, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCameo">John Romero</a> is dead. The only challenge comes from the fact that you have to time the shots to <em>just</em> before the elevator reaches the top, since the vanilla Doom engine has a vertically fixed camera, meaning that you have to ride the elevator three times to finish off the boss while enemies spawn like crazy. If you're the sort of person who plays with a source port that allows vertical mouselook, you don't even need the elevator.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom64">Doom 64</a></em>'s final boss, the Mother Demon, shows up when you have the ludicrously overpowered Unmaker, not to mention there's both an invincibility and a supercharge in the same room. Grab the supercharger and fire the Unmaker at her, and she tends to die in about ten seconds.
</li><li> Far more damning (heh) is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom3">Doom 3</a></em>, in which the programmers had the right idea by making the Cyberdemon the final boss, but cocked it up by making him easier to kill than virtually any other enemy in the game. His rockets are fired rarely and are extremely easy to dodge, and he is taken down after a few hits with the game's superweapon that automatically hits after being charged up.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom2016">DOOM (2016)</a></em> repeated history with the Spider Mastermind as the final boss and comparatively disappointing. The two previous boss fights were both two-stage encounters and therefore more difficult that the Mastermind's single-stage fight. It's still a hectic and challenging single-stage fight, but it's very easy to end it thinking "wait, why isn't it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed">turning red</a>?"

She does nothing but stay there with her tentacles swaying in the air; the challenge is in fighting a ton of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">high-level enemies</a> standing between you and the teleporter, but when you do reach it, the horrible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>, biggest of all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">bads</a>, ruler of an entire evil dimension and invader of worlds is killed... by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleFrag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleFrag">telefragging</a>.

While a fairly challenging boss in its own right, able to rapidly shoot its railgun and fire BFG blasts with impunity, any savvy players will have stockpiled a few quad damage and invulnerability bonuses. The game predicts this and strips your inventory of invulnerability bonuses before the fight, but it doesn't extend this to quad damages. Activate one, bring out the hyperblaster or chaingun, and the Makron doesn't stand a chance.
</li><li> The final boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeIV">Quake IV</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Nexus, which is essentially a giant brain</span>, is pathetically easy &mdash; it simply rests there for you to shoot at it when its shield is down. The only challenge comes from the fact that it is sending regular enemies after you at the same time.

Some consider it the easiest boss in the game. Also, it takes the form of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a small child</span>. This wouldn't be so much of an anti-climax if you haven't seen the concept art of what the final boss was originally going to look like, however.

However, you're armed with the exact same weapon that kills them in one hit too.
</li><li> The final level in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournamentIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournamentIII">Unreal Tournament III</a></em> is just <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a duel between Akasha and Reaper</span> and plays out like any other match.

Instead of fighting it in a cool freeform boss battle, it's a stationary target that you just shoot at a few times from a rooftop a couple hundred feet away. What's worse is that you've known from the start of the game that the villain has the same kind of timesuit as you, and even though his is a beta version, you've been facing hundreds of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredMooks">Superpowered Mooks</a> with time powers reverse-engineered by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. So naturally the player expects an epic one-on-one battle against your evil counterpart, but no, what you get is not a battle but an execution.

However, his head is completely unprotected and all it takes is a few bullets to the face to drop him. Pretty poor compared to the game's earlier 3 bosses, who are all equipped with full body metal armor and full-auto mini-rocket launchers.

Lovecraft-esque alien abomination</a>... which has one way to seriously damage you, a ranged attack launched from its tentacles. These are very easily shot off and take forever to regenerate. With the tentacles dealt with, you can just plink The Destroyer in its weak point until it's dead, periodically taking cover to easily avoid its other, highly predictable attacks.</span>

At first, you fight <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the not-so-good doctor</span> and he goes down as easily as any of the standard mooks and the credits roll past at lightning speed. Then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dr. Ned comes back as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">undead abomination</a>, tears away the end credits, and screams "It's not over yet!".

</li><li> Also from <em>Borderlands</em> is Skagzilla.

<ul><li> Wilhelm is set up as a devastating combatant &mdash; the Guardian Angel is terrified of him, and the four protagonists from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands">the previous game</a> combined couldn't defeat him. But the actual boss fight is underwhelming, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBoss">annoying at worst</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">There's an in-story reason for this: letting you defeat him is part of Handsome Jack's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a>, as the power core Wilhelm gives you upon defeat ends up being sabotaged. Jack had also weakened Wilhelm with poison beforehand so that he would go down easier, but any indication of this was left out of the game for some reason, possibly by accident</span>.
</li><li> The final boss, The Warrior, can also qualify; just stand in the middle area, shoot his weak spot whenever he appears, and if you're fast-ish, he'll just flinch instead of attack.

One of the sidequests involves breaking into a heavily secured lab to destroy an unspeakable horror locked in a heavily secured lab. Multiple characters warn you that you should absolutely never enter the lab and face the monster. If you do, you find that the monster is a clone of the Destroyer from the first game...<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and it's about 1/20th the size of the real version, has only one attack that does piddling damage, and can be destroyed in roughly half a dozen shots</span>.

</li><li> Most solo Boss battles, such as the first Big Daddy or Subject Omega, can be defeated with the drill alone &mdash; as the drill stops all opponents except the Big Sister moving while at the same time dealing large amounts of damage, all you need to do is go up to your enemy and start drilling.

The worst is Morgan Everett's ending (kill Page) &mdash; to do so, you simply run around Area 51 to deactivate some power units. Page dies miserably seconds after you deactivate the final device.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Walton Simons</a> is supposed to be the brawn to Bob's brains and the true physical challenge you have to overcome, which would've made Page's non-involvement more forgivable - after all, he's the mastermind, defeating him should be an ideological victory. Unfortunately, Simons, for all his bragging about wielding newer and improved version of augmentation technology, is a pushover. He has a powerful weapon, and he's accurate with it, but because of bugs he doesn't use his augs properly, meaning you can kill him with a single missile, and his AI is really dopey, so he behaves almost like a rank-and-file mook.

<ul><li> Otto Giftmacher of E4M9 is by far the easiest boss in the game due to him carrying a Rocket Launcher as his only weapon and his rockets don't have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hitscan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hitscan">Hitscan</a> ability of the bullet-based guns. The relatively slow velocity of the rockets make them pretty easy to dodge and he has the least amount of maximum health compared to the other bosses (even Dr. Schabbs has more health than Otto). In addition, the room he's in has no Mooks to provide support for him and contains four cutaway walls flanking the north and south sides that provide easy cover from his rockets and there's another adjacent room with two more cutaway walls, giving you plenty of space to prepare for his rockets.
</li><li> Dr. Schabbs of E2M9, while having more health than Otto Giftmacher, is still a relatively easy boss to deal with (unless you play on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Death Incarnate difficulty</a>, in which he becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss">Damage-Sponge Boss</a>, somehow having the highest maximum health out of any boss in both <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em> and <em>Spear of Destiny</em>). He only attacks by throwing syringes at you and like Otto, they are not hitscan, giving you time to dodge them. The only real difficulty in this level are the mutants who flank him for support to challenge you and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">they are considerably more dangerous than Schabbs</a>.
</li><li> Gretel Grosse of E5M9 is this as well due to her being a gender-flipped carbon copy of her brother Hans from E1M1. The same strategies used against Hans also applies to Gretel, only this time the room she's in has two cutaway walls that give you good cover from her hitscan machine guns. However, after she's dead, she drops a key that leads to the final room <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KaizoTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KaizoTrap">which is full of heavily armed guards ready to surprise you upon opening it</a>.

He's since been upgraded to regular war boss status with 20,000 HP.
</li><li> Ragnaros is actually a <em>lot</em> easier than several other bosses fought within the same dungeon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>. Really, Ragnaros is just....damage-the-snot out of him. Easier said than done, but he's still <em>quite</em> easy considering he's the lord of all fire elementals and created a volcano just by being summoned.
<ul><li> Plenty of bosses became this over time when people begun to get used to them and could know the strategies. And in the case of <em>Wrath</em>, all had epic gear from raids being more accessible so they could destroy the bosses <em>very</em> easily.
</li><li> One of the bosses in the Brawler's Guild is Razorgrin, a mighty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreateningShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreateningShark">Threatening Shark</a> bearing the title of "Terror of the High Seas". Sounds fearsome, until you realize you are fighting the shark <strong>on land</strong>. The poor thing can only move by slowly flopping about. The fight is basically a joke for ranged characters. Meleers, however, have a harder time of it since they need to fight Razorgrin while being dangerously close to its jaws, which can shred through the heaviest armor like paper in a single bite. Until Blizzard patched the shark to be attackable from behind without fear of getting bitten, Razorgrin was an Anti climax Boss for ranged characters yet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a> for meleers!
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> of <em>Cataclysm</em>, Deathwing, initially proves quite the challenge, with players on his back trying to pull off pieces of his armor so he can be blasted with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Artifact of Doom</a>. The battle afterwards, where he's fallen into the ocean and making his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastVillainStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastVillainStand">Last Villain Stand</a>, is much easier, and is especially disappointing by never serving up grand finale editions of the classic "dragon mechanics"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3odkg');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3odkg" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3odkg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">breath weapon cone, tail swipes, and an air phase!</span>, given that he is supposedly the most devastating dragon in multiple worlds. His son Nefarian pretty easily retains the title of "most infamous dragon final boss".
</li><li> In Antorus the Burning Throne, final raid of <em>Legion</em>, the Coven of Shivarra is generally considered the hardest fight. This especially stands out when one considers that lore-wise the following two bosses are literal physical gods.
</li></ul></li><li> Shiro Tagachi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a>: Factions</em> is extremely easy, especially when you consider that the missions you have to complete to get to him are rather hard or annoying.
<ul><li> Shiro takes a few... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">okay, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">a handful of awesome skills classes</a> by the time you see him in Nightfall. The Lich, not so much.</span>
</li><li> Even easier than Shiro is the Undead Lich in <em>Guild Wars: Prophecies</em>. The lich has so many weaknesses it's not funny, and even if you don't kill him correctly and are forced to fight him twice, he's still a rather pathetic final boss.
</li><li> In fact, you have to fight <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">BOTH Shiro Tagachi and the Undead Lich <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualBoss">AT THE SAME TIME</a> in Nightfall! That's how easy they are.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Abaddon</span>; after the likes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Varesh</a>, the mission is <em>far</em> more laid-back and easy to complete.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em>, the hyped out end-game boss Zhaitan, one of the Elder Dragons, one of the most powerful beings in the GW2 universe, practically an Eldritch God, ended up as this. You don't get to fight him at all; you board a gunship and defeat waves of monsters while Zhaitan flies above you. Once all the waves of monsters are down, a cutscene shows Zhaitan getting shot; you and your group boards a bunch of cannons, and basically shoot him while he stands there staring, for 5 minutes. Even <em>after</em> the bug that prevented him from attacking you was fixed, it's still much less difficult than the fights that came before it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em>, it is not uncommon for high leveled players to do no quests, then do them when they can tackle a dragon without breaking a sweat and beat the stuffing out of huge monstrosities with little to no trouble. It ends up making all but 2 quest bosses pathetically easy.
<ul><li> Changes to leveling up prayer have made pretty much all of the bosses from earlier quests this. The prayer skill has some mid level prayers which grant complete immunity to attacks, but only one style at a time. At first, prayer was tough to level, but now, it's become easier, such that Protect prayers are standard among lower-mid-level players. Since most monsters in older content used only one attack style, they can't even scratch a player. Special mention goes to Nezikchened and Tarn Razorlor, both of whom drain prayer to make up for only using melee. A single dose of Prayer Potion, which can be bought easily, will fix this. Nowadays, pretty much any boss, and many of the Mooks you fight on the way to them, will either ignore your prayer completely or use multiple attack styles.
</li><li> Ever since Evolution of Combat came out, all but the strongest of bosses from before it are now painfully easy, as the player can simply spam special attacks at them until they die.
</li><li> <em>RuneScape</em>'s most infamous example is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveQueen">Mother Mallum</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the Temple Knight quest series. The series is heavily inspired by the works of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a> and the Mother herself is based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">his monstrosities</a>, so nearly everyone expected an extremely difficult fight. Instead, she turns out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">Puzzle Boss</a> whom the player doesn't even fight; she takes control of you and control shifts to three supporting characters (the only time in the main game this happens, actually) who use tricks to take her down, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy">by squishing her under a conveniently placed pillar</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says this was done to create a quest series that could be completed in its entirety by mid-level players; players overwhelmingly felt this goal was not worth foregoing a cool boss fight. The backlash was strong enough that Jagex has seriously considered doing a rework of the quest.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> with the fight against the zombie Jed. Jed is a villainous slaver who had been causing trouble for the player for some time before he finally got killed in a cutscene, but then he comes back again as a zombie and the player must kill him for the final time. When the fight starts, a big health bar appears at the top of the screen, which is something that normally only happens for the toughest bosses in the game, and the dialogue builds it up as an epic final confrontation, but he has so little health that he dies in one hit.
</li></ul></li><li> The Sith Emperor in the Jedi Knight's quest of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a></em> becomes this as soon as you know two tricks &mdash; one, solve the puzzle to get a good set of gear for your little astromech.

The mechanics the boss throws at you are things you have very likely seen before in other battles and even if you get hit, you won't get damaged too terribly even with gear that barely meets the minimum item level required to enter the fight. Despite the fact that the fight is <em>very</em> flashy and full of spectacle, it's quite easy. The optional "extreme" version of the same fight is a lot tougher.

First you fight Gate, who cannot be damaged by a direct attack; you have to dissipate his attacks so the shrapnel can hit him. When you fight Sigma in the next level, Gate hasn't had time to restore his body to full specs once again (and Sigma backstabs him without letting him finish repairing him). Instead, you start with his "Reborn" form, which is a zombie-like, worn-down, minimally functioning body that can barely move. With the right powerups, you can literally shoot him to death from your starting position. After this, Sigma ditches the junker body for his "Final" form, which <em>is</em> functioning and literally armed to the teeth with a plasma cannon array in his mouth. Sigma's battle body can be easy depending on which character you select. Ultimate Armor X can quickly stomp everything in the stage but this, while Shadow Armor X can shred Final Sigma in a minute-90 seconds, but struggles with the stage enemies Sigma generates.

Doppler himself has three moves, one of which isn't even an actual attack and the other two of which are extremely easy to dodge. He even has a weakness to the Acid Burst, which can do up to <em>five</em> units of damage to him when fully charged.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZero1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZero1">Mega Man Zero 1</a></em>, Harpuia appears to be intimidating as a general, but he has a very infamous chink in his attack pattern you can exploit to make him all but helpless. Switch to the Ice Chip, charge up the Z-Saber, leap over his two sword slashes with a jump dash and then leap over him once he tries to pull a third, nail him from behind with the Z-Saber, and he gets knocked back and frozen by the charged ice attack, which plays against his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors">elemental weakness.</a> It also resets his pre-programmed pattern and makes him repeat his sword slashes over and over each time he gets struck by the fully-charged ice attacks. Rinse and repeat, he's done. If he can use his EX Skill because you're at S or A-rank, that adds in a little unpredictability. Unfortunately, this is all but killed in the next game installment: Harpuia becomes <em>FAR</em> deadlier, now zipping around too fast to lock into a cycle, and given new moves that force you to back away and rely on long-range weapons like the Buster Shot Gun or Shield Boomerang. Worse, he's flat-out <em>lethal</em> if he uses his new EX Skill, where he resorts to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam">Beam Spam</a> hellstorm around half health that can rape you dead in seconds &mdash; one you'd have to be insanely lucky to dodge unscathed each time he uses it.

After what is quite possibly one of the hardest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">Boss Rush</a> stages in any Mega Man game (which they totally cheat in by replacing one of the bosses with a new two-against-one situation with a fresh set of attacks on tap), Elipzo shows up and is an absolute pushover. His first form can be beaten easily as long as you avoid the six-orb drain attack, which he telegraphs and is relatively easy to dodge. His second form is even easier. He's a huge floating target with only one attack that is actually somewhat hard to dodge. The rest of his attacks are pathetically simple, another isn't so much an attack as much as giving you a platform to jump on and take a <em>free shot</em> at him, and one can even be stopped by slashing the orbs.</span> The only truly nerve-racking part of this final stage in the game was the spike pit nightmare you have to traverse just to reach him. Harpuia was actually more threatening in his normal form than the final boss ever was, because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam">Beam Spam</a> he keeps pulling mid-fight is a real mean bitch to constantly and very barely dodge in such a confined space, while in the final battle, it's just a cheap throwaway boss that made use of a room too big for the fight to get truly interesting (though for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn">Scenery Porn</a> and plot-related reasons).

He even had a restraining energy halo spam attack and a deadly EX Skill variant of the move that could paralyze you mid-air and cause you to plummet into the abyss below without having a chance to break free in time and land safely by angling your fall to the one safe platform left. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Elpizo</span>'s boss fight amounted to using a room with too much empty space for rent &mdash; you could literally pound away at his health from the safety of a corner. However, the third game polished the boss fights with the final boss Omega Zero, who is fast enough to keep up with you no matter how hard you try to outrun him, and his attacks leave nowhere to hide instead of slowly hitting a minimum of the room, dashing any hope of retreating from him. The fourth game's final boss <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeLimitBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeLimitBoss">gives you only 2 minutes to win</a>, leaving you with no room to resort to cheap tricks,

After he absorbs the Dark Elf, he turns gold and the only things different from the first battle are faster attacks that are still painfully easy to dodge and he now makes use of his huge broadsword, which, too, was meant to do more than just stabbity-stab. Then Omega kicks it into high gear and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">transforms</a> into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfTheFiftyFootWhatever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfTheFiftyFootWhatever">giant armored warrior</a> with some dangerous moves at his disposal, but he's still fairly predictable and easy to beat.

</li><li> <em>Advent</em> has the fight against Vent or Aile as Mega Man ZX. This should be one of the toughest challenges in Ashe or Grey's journey - the previous protagonist, who was amazing enough to take on Serpent after absorbing the power of a Model W, and has had three more years to get tougher. And granted, on the ground, Model ZX is nigh unstoppable, with unpredictable attacks that are barely telegraphed aided by incredible speed and a strong three-hit saber combo. The combo in particular can absolutely shred Ashe or Grey. So if Model ZX is so powerful, why is this an Anti-Climax? The fight takes place in an underground quarry, with walls on both sides of the arena. If you stay on the ground, Model ZX will rip you apart. Simply climbing the walls, however, reduces the fight to an utter joke, as the majority of Model ZX's attacks <em>don't reach you.</em> Model ZX will spazz about on the floor, trying and failing to hit you, and you can simply wait for the three-hit combo to jump down, fill Model ZX with lead, and then jump back up again. It gets even better if Model ZX tries the one attack that <em>can</em> hit you, since they'll try to climb the wall and <em>slooooowly</em> slide down it, trying to shoot you with the buster. You can easily get off three charge shots on ZX, or spam Model H's air slash, or bash Model ZX with Model L, or even <em>find a use for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaMan">Rospark's</a> upward shots.</em> If this is your first time playing, Model ZX will likely be the first boss you fight you don't take any damage on.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a></em>'s final boss is in comparison much easier than all the other bosses (except for dumb Boom Boom and the flying form is actually harder!) because he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy">suicides himself with butt smashes</a>. You can also exploit the fact that you can touch Bowser's lower part of the body and not take damage. If you're in Super form, just crouch. In other words, you just have to wait until when you have to dodge on the very moment Bowser slams through the final layer of the floor and falls to his doom.
</li><li> Corona Mountain, the final level of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioSunshine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioSunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a></em>, can bring gamers to tears, particularly the section where you have to navigate the volcano's interior on a shaky mudboat by squirting water at specific angles. However, if you can make it to Bowser, the final boss fight is a piece of cake; all you have to do is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundPound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundPound">Ground Pound</a> the platforms around his hot tub (which is very easy once you learn his pattern, which isn't overly difficult to do) and he's finished.
</li><li> Compared to the other Bowser fights in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBros">New Super Mario Bros.</a></em> sub-series, the one in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBros2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBros2">New Super Mario Bros. 2</a></em> is very easy. It consists of Bowser (in giant form) attacking Mario with fireballs from the background while Mario hops from platform to platform in a vertical auto-scrolling sequence, which is less demanding than the father-and-son <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualBoss">Dual Boss</a> in the DS and Wii U games and the horizontal escape sequence in the Wii version. And the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a> battle (against Dry Bowser) is identical.
</li><li> The final Bowser fight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a></em> is somewhat difficult... at least for the first phase. After a big to-do about him reemerging from the fight even more powerful, the fight changes to a very gimmicky section of ground-pounding meteors at Bowser. This fight is especially sad due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongSongShortScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongSongShortScene">the wonderful music that you might not even get through one listen of</a>.
</li><li> The final bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioIsMissing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioIsMissing">Mario Is Missing!</a></em> and <em>Mario's Time Machine</em> (the NES versions). Both are supposed to be Bowser. The former is about half Mario's height, looks more like Wendy Koopa, and dies in seconds; the latter looks correct, but still dies in seconds. Their AI is even worse, because it doesn't exist. They just walk back and forth endlessly in a straight line and take damage when jumped on, in a game in which Mario/Luigi can neither get hurt nor die. It's as pathetic as it sounds, and probably explains why the other versions just didn't bother to have a final boss at the end of them.
</li><li> The RoboBrood refight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a></em> is far easier than the original, due to the new setting and enemy captured to fight it. That's because in the second fight, not only are you on the Moon with low gravity (trivialising the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColossusClimb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColossusClimb">Colossus Climb</a> aspect of the fight in the process), but you're also controlling a Hammer Bro who can rapid fire shoot hammers (which will destroy the leg armour and expose the boss to damage in about 20 seconds). Still, it is found at the end of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">Boss Rush</a>, so perhaps it's meant to be an easy end to a gauntlet of potentially annoying battles.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure">Sonic Adventure</a></em>, the Chaos 6 boss battle in Big's story can be beaten in under 10 seconds. It's also Big's only boss.
<ul><li> Perfect Chaos himself is not very hard at all and is <em>the final boss of the entire game.</em> To wit: you cannot actually be damaged in this fight, simply be blown backwards (Super Sonic is invincible, after all). Your enemy is your ring counter (much like it was in the Doomsday Zone of <em>Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles</em>), which will plunge you into the water when it expires. You collect rings along the way and the objective of the fight is to reach Perfect Chaos as fast as possible while dodging his attacks, so you're encouraged not to shuffle your feet anyway. You damage Perfect Chaos simply by running into him at top speed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles">Sonic and Knuckles</a></em>, near the end of Sonic's game, you finally get the chance to fight Knuckles &mdash; who's been a thorn in your side in the cutscenes since the beginning of <em>Sonic 3</em> &mdash; and it's trivially easy to beat him without getting hit once. Then there's the final boss in a normal playthrough of Sonic 3 (without the Lock On), Big Arm: It isn't necessarily <em>easy</em>, per se, but compared to other 16-bit Sonic games, it definitely doesn't feel like final boss material.
</li><li> The 3DS version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations">Generations</a></em> brought Big Arm back, but as the <em>first boss</em>, so it was given a ridiculously predictable pattern and easily dodgeable attacks. The whole boss fight can be ended in under 30 seconds, and even less if you come back to the boss after unlocking the homing attack.
</li><li> The original 16-bit <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog1">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> had a fairly easy final boss, too. One of its attacks is an instant kill even with rings, as it crushes you, but this attack is telegraphed with enough time to get out of the way. Its other attack is...four extremely slow-moving projectiles. That's it. Even without rings, it would be extremely easy.
</li><li> The final boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehogCD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehogCD">Sonic the Hedgehog CD</a></em>, the Psycho-Egg, is just Eggman in his normal vehicle with four panels that flip around and whatnot, and it's a case of dodging predictable attacks and waiting for a chance to hit him, or just taking the hit and then damaging him using invincibility frames. It's not overly hard or very exciting, especially compared to the final bosses of Sonic 2 or 3&amp;K. It's made worse by the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">the epic race with Metal Sonic</a> comes before the final boss.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdvance2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdvance2">Sonic Advance 2</a></em> has surprisingly rough boss battles throughout the entire game, mostly because they're all of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetBackHereBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetBackHereBoss">"Get Back Here!" Boss</a> variety. The exception is the final boss, which is completely stationary and a complete joke as a result. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">Boss Rush</a> to get to the final boss is actually harder. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a> is more challenging, though.
</li></ul></li><li> The final boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankGoingCommando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankGoingCommando">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Going Commando</a></em> can be an example unless you're under-levelled, and if you have the RYNO2 it's basically a matter of holding down the fire button. It's actually possible to kill him <em>without so much as setting foot in the arena</em>. (See <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3D5UDohVgk">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.)
</li><li> The final boss fight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankUpYourArsenal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankUpYourArsenal">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Up Your Arsenal</a></em>. While the fight right before (fought on foot) with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Dr. Nefarious</a> is fairly difficult and requires pretty good dodging, the second and final fight with his super weapon turned into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> can be won by just circling the boss and holding down the fire button. Because you're in a vehicle at the time, running out of ammo is a non-issue, and the boss's attacks all boil down to "shoot a bunch of missiles that probably won't hit if you're moving".
</li><li> The endboss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroCore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroCore">Hero Core</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Annihilation mode</a> is ridiculously easy compared to the kind of stuff you have to put up with on Hard. Granted, you are fighting it at level 0, but you'd think it would be a slightly more difficult endboss, or one that made Hard seem easy.
</li><li> Though not the final boss, Annihilator Iosa from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Iji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Iji">Iji</a></em> is surprisingly easy for someone who, in the backstory, survived a shot from a weapon that annihilated an <em>entire planet</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">You find out that the planet-stopping invulnerability is just a puzzle mechanic. She has the same shielding that all doors have that make them utterly invincible to weapons fire... but still open to being kicked.</span> She can only fire horizontally, and there are platforms conveniently located above her head that allow you to dodge her weapons <em>and</em> fire down lasers onto her.
</li><li> The spider in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Limbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Limbo">Limbo</a></em>, being as it's the only recurring enemy in the game, qualifies: its legs are razor-sharp, can (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">and will</a>) impale you in a single strike, and it can follow you pretty much anywhere. However, the last time you encounter it, it's taken so much punishment that it only has one leg left, which attacks once and then gets stuck.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Croc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Croc">Croc</a>: Legend of the Gobbos</em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Secret Sentinel</a> can be wiped out in something like 20 seconds.
</li><li> Gnasty Gnorc from the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpyroTheDragon1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpyroTheDragon1998">Spyro the Dragon (1998)</a></em>. He takes <em>two</em> hits, and spends three quarters of the battle running away from you.
</li><li> This trope is a plot point for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperStarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperStarWars">Super Star Wars</a>: Return of the Jedi</em>. Darth Vader was the final boss in <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> and was quite challenging. In this game, Vader is fought before the Emperor and goes down very quickly. This shows how Luke has grown stronger between games when he completed his Jedi training.
</li><li> The true final boss for <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarioLandII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarioLandII">Wario Land II</a></em>, once you've unlocked all of the treasures and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreasureMap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreasureMap">golden panels</a>, is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook">Giant Spear Man</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecurringBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecurringBoss">Recurring Boss</a> who only needs to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp">jumped on</a> a few times in order to be beaten.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Cactus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Cactus">Shotgun Ninja</a></em>: The final boss rides a grenade-spamming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">Mini-Mecha</a>. Except, if you have some grenades left (and you most likely do), you can simply stay above him and toss down a couple of them, which is enough to kill him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlySpy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlySpy">Sly Spy</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> has no attacks other than trapping you with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DescendingCeiling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DescendingCeiling">Descending Ceiling</a> behind a destructible force field. (His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh">Evil Laugh</a> doesn't count as an attack.) After breaking through the barrier, you can take him down in one hit.
</li><li> The final boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountryReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountryReturns">Donkey Kong Country Returns</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tiki Tong</span>. The stages leading up to him are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a>, at times bordering on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell">Platform Hell</a>, but the fight itself is shorter and easier than most of the other boss fights throughout the game; he dies after seven hits (a tougher, earlier boss takes nine), all of his attacks are <em>glaringly</em> telegraphed, and all but one are extremely easy to avoid. In addition, a couple of his moves actually involve dropping a health-restoring item onto the arena (they're meant to trick you into getting hurt, but it's fairly easy to nab the item and dodge the hit). If you do lose a life, you're not given the chance to get Diddy Kong back, meaning your health is shot in half, but if you made it that far in this challenging game in the first place, it really shouldn't hold you back. In fact, getting to him is harder than beating him, since you have to pilot a barrel rocket up the face of the tower and have to avoid spikes, moving gears, and columns that come in on both sides that will kill you instantly.
</li><li> In the Super NES game, <em>Tiny Toon Adventures: Buster Busts Loose</em>, Dizzy Devil is defeated via a rather unique way; you have to feed him. That's it, when you feed him enough, the fight is over, and the level is cleared. Before anyone says, "this game is for kids, it should be easy", try playing the game &mdash; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">this game is not easy.</a></em> Besides, all the other bosses in the game are handled the same way as most bosses, so there's really no excuse.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IWannaBeTheGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IWannaBeTheGuy">I Wanna Be the Guy</a></em>: Sort of. After a grueling battle in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Dracula</a> throws pillars of fire, flames, unkillable blobs, the freaking Moon, and Delicious Fruit at you, he claims that he's tapping into an even more powerful form. Cue transformation into <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a Waddle Doo that dies in a single shot</span>.
</li><li> Ballser in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Something" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Something">Something</a></em>, mostly because he is a spriteswap of the noob boss sprite. His patterns are easy to predict as a result.
</li><li> Baby Bowser in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisStory">Yoshi's Story</a></em> isn't a particularly difficult final boss to begin with, but is made still easier by the fact that you're provided with a near infinite amount of fruit to recover your health with. There's even a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibilityPowerup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibilityPowerup">Heart Fruit</a> available, and taking him out before it wears off is a breeze thanks to the infinite eggs it grants you.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheAdventuresOfLomax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheAdventuresOfLomax">The Adventures of Lomax</a></em>, Evil Ed. Pretty much all you have to do is to keep spinning around and throwing rocks at him while avoiding occasional bombs. The only thing Ed does is making boulders and bombs appear on the stage. During the first part, he just stands on a floating rock and does nothing while boulders keep coming from left and right. It's made even more ridiculous when you notice that during the second part of the fight, he uses <em>hand puppets</em>.
</li><li> The "final" boss in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpoilerAlert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpoilerAlert">Spoiler Alert</a></em>. He dies in one hit (other bosses take three or more hits to kill).
</li><li> Astaroth in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostsNGoblins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostsNGoblins">Ghosts 'n Goblins</a></em> is extremely easy to defeat, as long as you have the shield equipped (otherwise, he can't be fought). All he does is shuffle predictably back and forth, occasionally shooting a slow-moving fireball. If that wasn't enough, the game also locks you into facing his direction, so you can keep up a barrage of shields while jumping backward. You'll probably have less trouble with him than some of the game's many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Demonic Spiders</a>, even considering the fact that you need to use the game's worst weapon to beat him.
<ul><li> Sardius in Super Ghouls and Ghosts is a cakewalk, all you have to do is stand under one of his legs and get the timing of the spawning platforms vs. his scatter beam attack right and you'll never get hit. The real challenge comes just before this battle, where you have to take on Astaroth and Neboroth with the Goddess bracelet.
</li></ul></li><li> The final boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheAngryVideoGameNerdIIAssimilation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheAngryVideoGameNerdIIAssimilation">The Angry Video Game Nerd II: ASSimilation</a></em> is "Death Mwauthzyx", the giant monster featured in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AngryVideoGameNerdTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AngryVideoGameNerdTheMovie">AVGN movie</a>. For a being presented as all-powerful in the film, he's an underwhelming final challenge with very predictable attacks and who spawns lots of mini-clones that can be milked for energy-restoring beers. The final boss of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheAngryVideoGameNerdAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheAngryVideoGameNerdAdventures">previous game</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fred Fucks</span>, was several times harder despite being a mere human.

<ul><li> The Collector in LBP1 is actually rather easy to beat, possibly to make up for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">Bunker</a>...
</li><li> The final Titan in LBP3 is pretty easy if you are even only semi-decent at the game.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AHatInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AHatInTime">A Hat in Time</a></em>, the finale of Alpine Skyline doesn't even have a proper boss fight like the other chapters, but rather, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelInBossClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelInBossClothing">Level in Boss Clothing</a> where you have to kill the three main purple flowers instead. Each of the flowers goes down in just four hits without much effort, and the only real challenge is getting to the flowers through some new obstacles. Despite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a> building up to the finale as you collect the Time Pieces, the origin of the flowers is never explained beyond that, and the NPCs are just simply relieved that they're gone at the end.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/CrashBandicoot2CortexStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/CrashBandicoot2CortexStrikesBack">Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back</a></em>: Hands up if you defeated Dr. Neo Cortex on the first try. It's really easy since you only need to keep up with him and spin him thrice, and the only thing that can prevent you from doing so is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic">the controls of the jetpack</a>. It does not help that the boss before, N. Gin, is qualified as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a> by many.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Le Paradox</span> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlyCooperThievesInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlyCooperThievesInTime">Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time</a></em>. For someone who has built up since the beginning of the game, all the boss fight amounts to is a bunch of quick time events that give the player too much time for button presses and a few very easy platforming sections. What makes this an even bigger let down is that the previous level is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestLevelEver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestLevelEver">easily among the best in the game</a> and the previous boss fight with Ms. Decibel was a bigger challenge then this one.

<ul><li> Bossmin, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> of <em>Yosumin!</em>. The final stained glass stage and penultimate fight against Goldmin are utterly brutal, the former requiring specifically matching <em>999 Redmin</em>, and the latter requiring <em>4</em> board-clearing Yosumin, matches (which can only be gotten either through sheer luck or careful and deliberate planning) and multiple Goldmin, which sparingly appear and can easily be removed from the board before you can get to them by the sudden appearance of a Bigmin or accidentally triggering a Badmin. By comparison, Bossmin is a cakewalk, only requiring, among a few relatively easy square sets and the usual stained glass collection, 999 of <em>any</em> Yosumin and 9 Badmin, which at this point in the game are guaranteed to appear one-at-a-time and you've likely been regularly triggering <em>by accident</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AdventuresOfLolo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AdventuresOfLolo">Adventures of Lolo</a></em> has the Great Devil/King Egger. He's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutsceneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutsceneBoss">Cutscene Boss</a> in the first game, getting casually turned into an egg and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeRunHitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeRunHitter">knocked into the horizon.</a> In the second game, he's actually fightable, but he's not much harder; he spits out easily-dodged fireballs and is a huge target that moves predictably. Since your egg shots can block his projectiles and you have infinite ammo, you can kill him by just taping down the fire button and then leaving. The third game is the only one where he's even a little challenging, but even then, his fireballs remain both blockable and slow. He even has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">Hopeless Boss Fight</a>, but one that would still be pretty easy if he didn't have infinite health.

Though powerful, in this mission the player has control of all six of their squads (whereas it is limited to four in all other missions) as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">Gabriel Angelos</a>, and the poor thing manages to attack maybe three times before being killed. In contrast, the entirely optional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Bosses</a>, the Avatar of Khaine and Warboss Bonesmasha, are at least a magnitude more resilient, with the former in particular the single most difficult task in the game.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberianSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberianSun">Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun</a>: Firestorm</em>'s last mission Cabal deploys against you the gigantic Core Defender. Three times the hitpoints of the second-heaviest unit in the game, weapons so powerful they'll devastate any ground force, level buildings in two hits, and with a longer range than all fixed defenses. Surely it must be suitably defended from air attacks, right? Nope &mdash; scare up a few jumpjet infantry units and down the fearsome Defender goes. And if you don't even want to bother with <em>that</em>, just force-fire artillery on a bridge as it goes across &mdash; and watch it vanish in a splash.
</li><li> The Waterwraith from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin">Pikmin</a> 2</em>. After spending every preceding floor of the cavern it's encountered in as an invincible monstrosity relentlessly stalking the player, literally steamrolling over their armies of the titular creatures, and providing the series' most famous case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a>, you reach the final floor. And there you find the Waterwraith's one weakness. And from that point, the boss is turned into such a joke that even the boss music changes to a more cheerful reprise as the creature starts to panic. As one would probably guess, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> is very satisfying after the aforementioned Nightmare fuel.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedievalIITotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedievalIITotalWar">Medieval II: Total War</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the base game, the Mongols. Their armies of horse archers are terrifying in open field battles... but when you fight them in your cities or at a bridge, they just turn into fodder for your spearmen, archers and crossbows. As for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">the Timurids</a>, well, winning in open battles is possible, but it requires locking down their archers. And cavalry. Lots and lots of cavalry.
</li><li> In the <em>Britannia</em> expansion, if Scotland is losing ground then William Wallace might spawn with an impressive army of highlander units with units light years ahead of Scotland's production centres, great weapon and armour ratings and tons of experience. Except William fights as a general in a unit of Highland Nobles, <em>foot infantry</em>. So one well-timed cavalry charge, and...
</li><li> Also in <em>Britannia</em>, King Haakon of Norway arrives with a huge army to oversee the conquest of Britain. While a strong general with a formidable force, he is also an old man and will likely die not long after he arrives.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> series has its fair share.
<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasy1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasy1">original Final Fantasy</a></em> on the NES, it's very well possible to defeat the final boss, Chaos, in one turn. A Master in particular can defeat him in one attack, potentially depleting all of his 2,000 HP.
</li><li> After fighting your way through the Ice Cavern and defeating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Adamantoise</a>, the traitorous General Borghen appears at the exit to fight the party. While the Adamantoise can be a nasty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdBoss">Early-Bird Boss</a>, Borghen is a complete pushover. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And when you meet him as a zombie in hell, he's once again a pushover compared to the other bosses of the dungeon.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Emperor himself</span> is barely more threatening than the mooks with him in the battle. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He doesn't stay dead for long, though.</span>
</li><li> In a very stunning moment, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell">Useless Useful Spell</a> in <em>Final Fantasy Legend</em> <strong>actually works</strong> on the final boss! This is a bug, though; the Saw is supposed to instantly kill any enemy with defense below a certain (fairly high) value, but instead it only kills enemies with a defense <em>above</em> that value. Obviously, the final boss has the highest defense in the game, so.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyMysticQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyMysticQuest">Final Fantasy Mystic Quest</a></em>, the Dark King is weak to the hero's Cure. Cast Cure on the boss to break the damage limit and do over 10,000 damage. You can potentially kill him in two-three casts if your level is high enough. Even more amusing: the Dark King has multiple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a> forms. However, they all use the same HP counter &mdash; the Dark King merely changes form dependant on how damaged he is. If your Cure spell does enough damage, the Dark King will actually skip forms trying to keep up.
</li><li> Also in <em>Mystic Quest</em>, the very first boss, the Minotaur, is undead, and vulnerable to your Cure spell. Chances are you'll be hoarding your casts till Fireburg, but you can spare one to take him on with, right? Failing that, just have Kaeli cast Life, since she leaves the party right after anyways.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>: Palmer easily qualifies. Most players who get into the boss fight against Palmer expect him to be strong since they had fought Shinra villains (the TURKs and Rufus) previously and they were able to hold their own in a fight. However, Palmer in battle is downright pathetic. His only attack is shooting his mako gun that has a fire, ice, or lightning effect and can be nerfed with M Barrier or nullified/absorbed with certain armor or materia. His only redeeming feature is having a big chunk of HP.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em> has the first fight against Seifer, which is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelBoss">Duel Boss</a>. Sadly, it mostly just serves to show that Squall is Seifer's superior; with a bit of grinding it's actually possible to have higher stats than Seifer in every way, including health. Fortunately the game gives you several rematches, and none of them are this easy.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em>, the fight against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Seymour Omnis</span> is pretty much a joke considering that his previous appearances have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a> for many players. It makes it even easier if you utilize his own built-in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors">Elemental Rock&#150;Paper&#150;Scissors</a> that <strong>YOU</strong> can manipulate to choose his weakness...or just summon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Anima</a>.

It can be pretty easily defeated within one or two staggers, and is vulnerable to several status effects.</span> As an homage to the <em>Final Fantasy Legend</em> final boss, it is possible to kill it with Vanille's Death Full ATB Skill while it is staggered; however, the chances of that happening are pretty slim.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the final stage in Kefka's four-form boss fight can be considered anticlimactic. There are multiple methods to defeat it in one turn, the blindness that it can cast on you doesn't work in the original SNES version, and if you prepare, you'll have ample time to heal from the Fallen One attack. The boss's signature attack, Goner, can't even kill you, and when you compare this form to the third form, Rest, which ended off its fight casting an instant-kill attack twice, it can be considered underwhelming. However, when it comes to story purposes, (the boss's grand entrance and lively as well as somber boss theme), this battle isn't anticlimactic.</span>

Yes, it's the last boss you fight, but it has a Light weakness that is disappointingly easy to exploit and not enough Physical Defense to tank it. Its gimmick is that it can evoke copies of your characters to parallel that character's attacks with Dark, but a decent setup can vaporize those and still deal terrible, terrible damage to the Ba'al.
</li><li> After the intensely difficult task of acquiring all of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">demon's souls</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls">aptly named title</a>, you take a trip to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">King Allant, who has almost no offensive ability whatsoever aside from some sluggish lunges with the Soulbrandt sword, as he is in a captive and weakened slug-like form, effectively letting you punch him to death, if you so desire it.</span>

<ul><li> OD-10 from Cube's chapter. The entire chapter lacked battles, so Cube is incapable of having leveled up. But OD-10 is pretty disappointing, nonetheless. It has eight little spheres around it, healing OD-10, whenever they get hit. The spheres can be easily taken out with one attack. OD-10 itself has no attack that damages Cube a whole lot and can be easily defeated by having Cube stand right next to it and letting OD-10 hit him. His counter is always activated and eventually deals enough damage to kill it.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Straybow</span> in Oersted's chapter. The final boss of the scenario and, while the emotional aspect is there, a pitiful battle in general. The boss is not a fighter, anyway, and one or two attacks can easily kill.
</li><li> In the Final chapter, after defeating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the game, Demon King Odio, the boss then turns into <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his original Oersted form</span>. This boss is still intent on fighting and the player can, but the parameters have been altered to their original form, making this a pitifully easy battle to win, even if it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelBoss">Duel Boss</a>. However, this counts as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadEnding">Bad Ending</a>.

But they are rehashes and, with your leveled-up party, are nowhere near the threat they were in the original chapters.
</li><li> The Frogsnake Demon in Obormaru's chapter can be this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">if the player has gone through the scenario, in a specific manner</a>.

<ul><li> In the first game, the final boss just stands there occasionally sending demons or firing fireballs at you. Its human bodyguards present a much greater threat.
</li><li> <em>Gothic 2</em> had a similar issue, especially if you're a mage. The final boss is an undead dragon, and most players pick up the spell "destroy undead" at some time or other. They fixed this in the expansion by giving all dragons insane regeneration and high armour.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em>:

<ul><li> The final battle against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Mankar Camoran</a> is fairly anticlimactic. He's a decently leveled character, but he isnot overly challenging. The only caveat is that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">resistant to magic weapons</a> (which you'll almost certainly be wielding by default at this point) and is backed up by his two kids, who keep respawning after you kill them.
</li><li> The expansion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bads</a> aren't much better. Jyggalag is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent">Daedric Prince</a> of Order (<em>Shivering Isles</em>) and Umaril the Unfeathered is an ancient Ayleid sorcerer (<em>Knights of the Nine</em>). Both are far easier to defeat than they should be, but by then the player character can be very tough anyway and it seem they simply haven't kept up.
</li><li> Mannimarco is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a> of the Mages Guild questline and also seriously fails at delivering the level of threat he was renowned for in-story, being a fairly generic mage. Thankfully, there's a mod that overhauls him and his entire dungeon to be suitably terrifying and difficult.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>:
<ul><li> This strikes twice at the end of the main quest. The only plot relevant Dragon Priest (extremely powerful undead sorcerers) is easily the weakest of them all and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Alduin</a> only appears to differ from the elite Ancient Dragons (which you've likely been slaughtering in droves) by having a few more hit points. It's even worse during the final battle in the afterlife, since you are assisted by the souls of three legendary Nord warriors
</li><li> Ulfric Stormcloak, should you choose to side against the Stormcloaks in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar">Civil War</a> questline, is hilariously weak. Ulfric is one of the first NPCs you encounter which, due to a quirk in the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelScaling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelScaling">Level Scaling</a> system, means that he is scaled to be challenging to a level 1 character no matter when you face him. This was adjusted in a patch, but he's still quite weak, wearing almost no armor and wielding a steel axe with a very minor enchantment.
</li></ul></li><li> Both of the main bosses in the <em>Dawnguard</em> DLC fall into this - after surviving a much more challenging set of waves of enemy units, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Vythar</span> is standing on a balcony that overlooks a large cliff. One use of Unrelenting Force is all it takes to finish him off, since one thing vampirism doesn't grant immunity to is fall damage, and after defeating Naaslarum and Voslarum, his gear can be collected. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lord Harkon</span> also feels underwhelming as a result, no matter how many of his vampiric abilities he uses, since he doesn't send waves of enemies to wear you down.
</li><li> The final boss of the Thieves Guild storyline, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mercer Frey</span>, gets a huge amount of buildup, and a big deal is made about how you can't fight <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> him</span> 1-on-1. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he's</span> no different from any other mook aside from being able to turn invisible, and if one merely climbs the stairs on either side of the statue, the fight can be ended easily with Unrelenting Force.
</li></ul></li><li> Monstar in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario">Paper Mario</a></em> is an intentional example. He only has 20 HP, low for that point in the game, and he has one attack, whick looks flashy and ultra-powerful, but ends up only doing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">1 point of damage</a>. Once you defeat it, it's revealed that the creature was being controlled by a gang of Star Kids wanting to keep intruders out.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Doopliss</span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a></em> is <em>also</em> an intentional example. Not only do you get to him shockingly quick, but he has a piddling 40 HP and his idea of a decent attack is turning into a shadow of Mario and throwing your own <em>standard attacks</em> at you. Compared to the previous boss who had 60 HP and an arsenal of buffs he's not very imposing, and even the narration remarks how refreshingly easy of a battle it was. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then "Mario" and your party leave, the camera stays fixated on the shadow of Mario, and you're suddenly controlling that. Cue entire second half of a chapter where you have to fight your own friends and the guy who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">stole your body</a>, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">defected former member</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMiniBossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMiniBossSquad">Shadow Sirens</a> lending you a hand.

<ul><li> Depending on the situation, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonetail</a></span> may fall into this. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Pit of 100 Trials</a> is an optional but <em>insanely</em> difficult challenge, with its great depths in playtime, lack of save and recovery blocks, and not to mention the progressive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Demonic Spiders</a>, despite the breathers with badges every 10 floors, with the challenge culminating in a fight against the boss at the 100th floor guarding arguably the game&#146;s greatest badge. However, rather than <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bonetail</span> himself, the brutal enemies may actually take the cake in difficulty. Despite having the highest stats in the whole game, it&#146;s not all that easy for him to fit in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a> category when compared to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Shadow Queen</span> and even his younger brother Gloomtail. The former can attack three times per turn (2/3 times <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain">drains HP</a>) and the latter, despite being obviously weaker and easier, has two incredibly powerful moves his older bro lacks. However, the strain of completing the previous 99 floors of the Pit of 100 Trials contributes to the difficulties faced when fighting <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bonetail</span>, as items, FP, and HP are more likely to be depleted by the time he is reached than when the player confronts <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Shadow Queen</span>, having save and recovery blocks right beforehand. Despite this, other than stats, one of the things that makes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bonetail</span> stand out is its unique fire breathing, which can give you one of four negative status ailments. However, using the Feeling Fine badges will leave only the freeze breath to give a status effect, making him much easier to handle, with his only standouts being using an occasional freeze breath and at random intervals recovering his HP (20 to be exact and two times possible at most).

The first phase can beaten after just one Vellumental summoning and two 1000 Fold attacks. After this, all the Toads you collected leave, and you can't use any weapons or items. This basically means every coin you've collected, every Toad you've found, every weapon you equipped, and every item you bought throughout the game was completely meaningless. The two phases after the first phase are just simple mini-games that involve a little bit of jumping, button mashing, and rotating.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pope Zera</span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandiaII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandiaII">Grandia II</a></em> is initially very tough, having <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">superimposed his will over the dark god Valmar</span>'s. But after the first time you beat him, the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Valmar</span> portion breaks apart and he flees, leaving <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the pieces of Valmar you collected earlier in the game behind him</span> to stall you. Every single one turns out to be stronger than he is, the only dangerous spell he has is the game's ultimate explosion-damage spell, but you can see it coming a mile away and all your characters are faster than him, fast enough to knock him out of it and cost him a turn while he's charging up. He also has a meager 32000 HP, which makes it possible to kill him in two to four turns if you're strong enough. But the two most glaring weaknesses he has are that 1: He is a single target, while all other bosses had multiple parts or allies to prevent you from just cancelling all their attacks, and 2: he is <em>not</em> affected by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualBossImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualBossImmunity">Contractual Boss Immunity</a> to Millenia's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Spellbinding Eye</a>, which renders him completely immobile for several turns. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> in that the characters themselves mock him for being so pathetic before delivering the final blow. His mind may have been strong enough <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to bend a god to his will</span>, but he forgot he was a puny human beneath all that bluster.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em> has secret boss, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mettaton NEO</span>, available only in the Genocide Run. The previous boss, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Undyne the Undying</span>, was one of the most difficult fights in the game, so one may think that this boss ramps up the difficulty even further. Not so; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">like most other Genocide bosses, he can be killed in a single turn. In fact, if you try to wait for him to attack, <em>he does not attack at all.</em> It is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneVictory">impossible to lose</a>.</span>
<ul><li> In fact, pretty much all the bosses in this mode, aside from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Undyne and Sans</span>, could be considered this since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you one-shot them</span>.
</li><li> The Pacifist Run's final boss, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Asriel Dreemurr</span>, also counts. His presentation and music are very impressive, and his attacks are quite difficult to dodge, but all challenge is instantly thrown out the window when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you realize that you can't actually lose the fight. Whenever you "die", you simply get right back up and continue to fight the boss.</span>

</li><li> The four dragons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarDragonSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarDragonSong">Lunar: Dragon Song</a></em>. The plot makes you expect one hell of a fight, as do the graphics &mdash; the dragon is so big your characters are shrunk slightly to fit them on the screen. But the dragon will go into rest mode, not to awaken until the next turn ends, if you hit it hard enough... which is easy to do. Rinse, repeat. Unless you're underlevelled, the dragons are pretty much the easiest bosses in the game.
<ul><li> One exception to the rule is the Black Dragon, who will eventually take a form of a darkened version of Jian who won't be stunned like the other dragons while in this form and also inherits Jian's special ability of attacking three times at once and stacking damage. This, however, is hardly an exception, because once you learn Dark Jian only attacks when your Jian attacks and mimics every other command Jian does, you can make your Jian stall by using items or cards while Dark Jian will continuously heal himself with HP Gabryel and Flora can tear through anyways.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX">Dragon Quest IX</a></em>: Just like Rhapthorne, Corvus doesn't appear to get that much stronger when he goes into his second form. (He has less health than a mere <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClimaxBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClimaxBoss">Climax Boss</a>, King Godwyn... and that's not even <em>adding</em> the health from his first form. Heck, Godwyn even has more HP than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Barbaros</a> in his second form!) He more or less just gains a few new attacks, can inflict status ailments, etc... but once more, he doesn't really offer that much new to the game. Kind of a shame that this was intended to be the hardest game.
<ul><li> That is, until you reach the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss">Grotto or Legacy Bosses</a>. Corvus was practically just put there to make sure you're ready for them.

<ul><li> Similarly, the final boss of <em>Fallout 2</em> was absolutely brutal, and borderline impossible... unless you hack the turrets in his room and convince a squad of Enclave soldiers to back you with a high Science and Speech skill, respectively. After that, he can still kill you easily if you're not careful, but he'll go down fairly easily.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> gives your character a whole lot of motivation to kill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">Benny</a>, but dealing him his death is rather simple. He can go out with a whimper through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathBySex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathBySex">Death by Sex</a>, or dismissed to crucifixion. If you face him in combat on his own turf, his weak trophy gun makes him no tougher than the rest of his gang. He was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">supposedly an expert</a> knife-fighter from his tribal days, but can be faced in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GladiatorGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GladiatorGames">single combat in an arena</a> with mediocre unarmed skill.
</li><li> There's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItIsPronouncedTroPAY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItIsPronouncedTroPAY">Caesar</a>, who, should you go out of your way to assassinate him, is a pushover compared to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PraetorianGuard">Praetorians</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Dragon</a>. Of course, the actual challenge is simply getting there and getting out, considering he has an entire camp of Legionnaires surrounding him. (And in fairness, he's in his 50s and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkLordOnLifeSupport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkLordOnLifeSupport">he has a brain tumor</a></span>, that'd probably impede his fighting skills a bit.)
</li><li> His counterpart, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure">General Lee Oliver,</a> isn't much better (though, oddly, Oliver can beat Caesar in a fight without much trouble). The only challenge in the fight is his rangers, which, if you're at the point of facing Oliver, you've already killed plenty of. If you've gotten your hands on upgraded Securitrons, they become a greater threat to you than Oliver, in the five seconds of them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">indiscriminately bombarding his position with rockets.</a>
</li><li> If you choose to fight him, Salt-Upon Wounds in <em>Honest Hearts</em> is as tough an opponent a boss is likely to be by himself. However, you're fighting alongside <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">the Burned Man</a> himself, who will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">curb stomp</a> him and his mooks easily even if you do nothing at all.

</div><ul><li> Father Elijah, the final boss of Dead Money, is pretty easy to kill in combat alone (plus you can hack a terminal to cause the turrets in the room to shoot him). The hardest part of the fight is escaping the vault after your bomb collar's detonation sequence is activated, since you have 60 seconds to go back the way you came (even though the entrance is 20 steps away, but is blocked by a laser barrier). However, you don't even need to fight him in the first place. As soon as the door opens, you can start your escape, and by the time Elijah realizes you tricked him into coming into the vault and starts the 60 second timer, you'll be less than 10 seconds from the elevator (which is a one-way trip, trapping Elijah in the vault forever). Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">after everything you went through to get here</a>, you deserve a break.

The argument that convinces him to kill himself isn't particularly impressive either, as it basically just amounts to telling him that he sucks and should die. And if your Science skill is high enough, you don't even have to attempt those. Furthermore, Eden's self-destruction code is in Autumn's office, not exactly well-hidden either.

Of course, this is mostly due to the fact that Super Sonic has been activated for the final fight, and by the end of the game you have the eye-hand coordination to pull off the simple rapid tapping patterns.

On Neutral, however, there's an extra boss fought in between Lucifer and the Godly bosses: Kuzuryu, the gigantic dragon controlled by Lucifer that had gone berserk after his death and threatens to destroy the world and kill everyone. Stephen and even Daleth ask Aleph to kill it...only for a joke of a fight to start that, if the party is strong enough, can be auto-battled &mdash; while Lucifer had deadly status attacks and Satan and YHVH can one hit kill a character, Kuzuryu has nothing going for it.

It has five very predictable forms that can be taken out easily provided you can spread around resistances, as each form uses a different element. Its ultimate attacks are simply a buffed Megidolaon with no extra fluff and a skill that maxes its stats and minimizes yours, which can easily be canceled out with Dekaja and Dekunda. Though it should be noted that it's not entirely the boss's fault &mdash; the preceding boss, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Meganada</span>, is widely considered to be one of the toughest bosses in both games, and in beating it, you're probably more than prepared for what comes next.
<ul><li> The first game also has one in Ravana, who is somehow both this and, story-wise, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClimaxBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClimaxBoss">Climax Boss</a>. While his first form is rather tricky, players of <em>Nocturne</em> will immediately recognize the gimmick from the Ongyo-ki fight, and the second form is only challenging due to the unique <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(until you reach the final boss, anyway)</span> ailment he inflicts, which is an incurable (by the player, at least) version of Panic. Other than that, it's a rather simple fight, with his strongest attack being easily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">no-sold</a> by throwing up a Void/Drain Force.

<ul><li> There's even an option to sacrifice one of your teammates to weaken his power, which is completely pointless and makes you wonder just how underlevelled the devs seemed to think you would be at that point. Note that the Exile near the end of this game can easily destroy most other "bosses", except maybe Darth Sion and Traya. But that only serves to improve the constant feeling near the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">how awesome your character is</a>, nothing quite like defeating Atris <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleStrokeBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleStrokeBattle">with a single blow</a>.

<ul><li> The Summoner. You fight through a reality-bending Escher twister full of demons in search of a power-mad sorcerer, who keels over in two or three hits on Normal difficulty. The weakest super-unique creature in the game, hands down. Only the non-boss uniques in the first act are squishier.
</li><li> Diablo himself on higher difficulties: he's not easy, but the Super Uniques you fight in the Chaos Sanctuary are much harder. It doesn't help that you can heal up near the seals, since he will never go near them, and ranged characters can even snipe at him while out of range from his attacks.
</li><li> Baal is even worse than Diablo: His attacks aren't all that strong, and the worst he can do is use a pair of curses that give mana burn and half physical resist &amp; speed, respectively. Even worse, the last 2 Super Unique monsters you fight in Baal's throne room before you face him are much stronger.

<ul><li> Even if you're not a Grass Type, Groudon starts so many squares away that if you have Iron Thorns or Silver Spikes, you can toss so many at him that he'll go down in a round or two of hits when he finally gets to you.
</li><li> And in the post-game, there's the Western Cave dungeon.

Then, when you unlock the dungeon, you go through 98 floors of powerful enemies, monster houses and such, where you're certain to gain at least five levels for your team along the way. Then, at the very end, you get to Mewtwo...who doesn't have much in the way of attacks and is easily beatable in a few attacks thanks to the levels you gain on the way to him.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">Pok&eacute;mon Red and Blue</a></em>:
<ul><li> The eighth Gym Leader of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">Pok&eacute;mon Red and Blue</a></em> is Giovanni. He also just so happens to be the leader of Team Rocket, and you already had a few serious encounters with him in Celadon and Saffron City, so you can expect this to be one doozy of a fight, right? ...well, no, actually. His team consists entirely of Ground-types with low Special stats, so you can easily steamroll him with a Water or Grass-type. In fact, you should already have a Pok&eacute;mon with Surf (a strong Water-type move) to even be able to reach him. To drive the point home even deeper, if you happen to be playing the Yellow version, the first Pok&eacute;mon in his lineup (a Dugtrio) only has Ground-type moves. It's theoretically possible to beat it with a <em>level 2 Pidgey</em>, since it will never get hurt.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">Pok&eacute;mon Gold and Silver</a></em>:
<ul><li> Olivine Gym and by extension its leader Jasmine. Jasmine's Pok&eacute;mon are level 30-35 - way ahead of the last gym (and even the <em>next</em> gym). She's also using the newly discovered Steel Type - so surely this should be a difficult gym of the likes you have little to no experience facing, right? Wrong - Jasmine's the only opponent in the gym. And since all fire types are special in this game, a good fire type (Such as a Typhlosion with Flame Wheel) will <em>wreck</em> her Pok&eacute;mon. If Steelix <em>doesn't</em> get knocked out, it might even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">use Sunny Day</a>, which will ensure its demise. This is changed in the remake, in which Jasmine at least pust up <em>more</em> of a fight due to the physical/special split and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScissorsCutsRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScissorsCutsRock">short of massive overleveling</a>, her Pok&eacute;mon might actually be able to get a few hits in on you.
</li><li> The entire Johto Elite Four is this. They're about ten to fifteen levels lower than every other Elite Four in the series (partly because you then explore a second region afterwards), have fairly predictable teams with weak Pok&eacute;mon (and to make it more blatant, the fairly weak Bruno is the only non-champion member returning from the last game) and are generally pretty easy to defeat with less than half a team.
</li><li> While Mewtwo is often a powerful opponent that's hard to beat and harder to catch, getting to it in <em>HeartGold/SoulSilver</em> is far more difficult than actually fighting it. Its moveset at the level it's fought at (70) leaves it with Psycho Cut, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff">Amnesia</a>, Power Swap, and Guard Swap. The latter two merely swap your status buffs and its own, and Psycho Cut runs off its weaker Attack stat. If all that weren't enough, sticking a Dark-type in front of Mewtwo leaves it utterly unable to fight back.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Pok&eacute;mon Ruby and Sapphire</a></em>:
<ul><li> One of the criticisms of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Pok&eacute;mon Ruby and Sapphire</a></em> was that the person who meets the default Rival archetype (Brendan or May) doesn't even fully evolve his/her Pok&eacute;mon and is only fought a very small number of times. This is what makes more people consider Wally as the rival, since he actually challenges you in Victory Road while Brendan or May give up. The leaders of Team Magma and Team Aqua also apply, seeing as they only use three Pok&eacute;mon each; they also use all the same kinds of Pok&eacute;mon that their minions use, so you're already used to battling them.
</li><li> With proper training and knowledge of opponents, using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Shed</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">inja</a> can turn almost any battle, <em>including the Champion</em> into this. To clarify, Shedinja has only one hit point, so any attack it suffers will one-hit KO it; <em>however</em>, to compensate, it has the ability Wonder Guard, which makes it immune to any attack that isn't super-effective. This means that several of your opponents, even late in the game, will be absolutely helpless against it. Wallace, for instance, only has one team member who's even remotely capable of damaging it (Luvdisc, who can use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects">confusion</a>-inducing Sweet Kiss). As soon as she goes down, you've already won.
</li><li> Tate and Liza have only two Pok&eacute;mon, at a point in the game when most gym leaders have at least four, and both of them are weak to Surf, a powerful move that you are required to have in order to get to the gym in the first place. Oh, and you face them in a double battle, which makes it even <em>easier</em> because Surf can hit both of their mons at once, making it entirely possible to win the battle with one attack.
</li><li> Maxie and Archie only have three Pok&eacute;mon and all of them are used by the other members of Team Magma / Aqua. Even in the remake, where they have Mega Evolution for their last battle, they can be taken out easily. Maxie has it the worst since his signature 'Mon has a quadruple weakness to Water in a region flooded with the stuff.
</li><li> The whole Hoenn Elite Four is like this (except Steven and Wallace), but Glacia is probably the worst. Not only is her Ice Pok&eacute;mon team remarkably easy to beat, but she seems to have no relevance at all to the plot of the game, only saying five lines in the entire game, <em>none</em> of them having any real importance whatsoever. Glacia is especially bad when you consider that Hoenn only has two families of Ice-Types, making her team <em>very</em> repetitive. In the remakes, she at least gets a pair of Froslass to add to her team... but in the original Ruby and Sapphire, Froslass didn't exist yet. This means that one of the Elite Four has two Pok&eacute;mon (a pair of Sealeo) who <em>aren't even fully evolved</em> on her team.
</li><li> Zinnia in the remakes' Delta Episode. Faced at the climax of the plot, she's a powerful Lorekeeper with a team of powerful dragons that wants to stop a catastrophe by harnessing the power of Rayquaza. Her team includes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantAwesomeJustAddDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantAwesomeJustAddDragons">Mega Salamence, Noivern, Altaria, Goodra, and Tyrantrum</a>. With such a setup and such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> Pok&eacute;mon on her team, you'd think this would be a challenging boss battle, right? It would be... if not for the fact you'll more than likely sweep all of her Pok&eacute;mon with your newly-acquired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Mega</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Rayquaza</a>.
</li><li> After Zinnia, you face Deoxys, a powerful Mythical Pok&eacute;mon previously only encountered via real life limited-time events. At level 80, ten levels higher than Rayquaza, you'd expect a great challenge. And you get that... if you try and catch it there and then. Unfortunately, in a straight-up battle, while Deoxys is quick and powerful, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">it can't take</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">hits very well</a>, meaning just about anything from Mega Rayquaza will knock it out... assuming it doesn't get one-shot by Deoxys, that is. Even then, Deoxys's only attacks are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Hyper Beam</a> (which leaves it a sitting duck for a turn) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretArt">Psycho Boost</a> (which gets less dangerous the more often it's used).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Pok&eacute;mon Black and White</a></em>:
<ul><li> Skyla in Black and White: Her entire team is weak to electricity, with her signature (highest-leveled) Pokemon having a <em>double</em> weakness. Why is this bad? In order to reach her gym, you have to pass through the Chargestone Cave, which, if you couldn't tell from the name, is chock full of electric-types. If you don't have a Pok&eacute;mon that can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle">wipe her team</a>, you have only yourself to blame.
</li><li> Marlon from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2">Pok&eacute;mon Black 2 and White 2</a></em>; for the eighth Gym Leader, he's practically a pushover. You could probably beat his entire Gym with little more than one strong Electric Type and a Grass on the side for the few trainers that have Water/Ground hybrids. There are only two edges he really has &mdash; one is that all three of his Pok&eacute;mon know Scald, which is useful against Pok&eacute;mon that use physical attacks, which you likely aren't going to use against Water Types save Thunder Punch, Seed Bomb, Power Whip and such. The second is that his Jellicent is very bulky and can use Recover, but even then it's mostly an issue of being stalled out moreso than being disadvantaged.
</li><li> For that matter, the Champion, Iris, has been deemed as this by quite a few players. For starters, she's only one level higher than the Elite Four before her. In addition, while it looks like they overpower her like crazy, all her Pok&eacute;mon are either weak to type coverage that's relatively simple to obtain (Ice and Fighting-type attacks in particular, both of which are more than easily obtainable), very slow and easy to hit (Lapras, Aggron, and Druddigon), or both. Most of them also have rather underwhelming movesets in the initial battle, at least on Normal Mode. The rematches and Challenge Mode do buff her movesets up considerably, though.
</li><li> There's also Black/White Kyurem. Similar to the Pok&eacute;mon Stadium example above, unlike the past main series Pok&eacute;mon games where you have to capture the Legendaries, this one forces you to actually fight and KO it. Despite being a Legendary Pok&eacute;mon, you still have a possible team of six Pok&eacute;mon (or one really over-leveled one if you're the kind of person who only uses starters) in a battle system more designed around using a team instead of one on one. It's completely possible to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO">OHKO</a> it on the first turn with the right move even if you're a little below the intended level for fighting it.
</li><li> The final battle with N. His legendary dragon can be easily defeated by your own due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Artificial Stupidity</a> (it loves to use its signature move, which you're resistant to and can power up your own dragon's signature move as well), and most of his other Pok&eacute;mon can be one-shotted with the proper type matchups. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchBoss">But then you face the real</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">who isn't nearly as much of a pushover</a>...
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Pok&eacute;mon X and Y</a></em>:
<ul><li> Whereas some of the prior villain leaders were nasty pieces of work and Ghetsis in the original <em>Black and White</em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>, Lysandre in <em>X</em> is a complete joke. You fight him literally right after you get Xerneas, which wouldn't be so egregious if he didn't have a Mienshao, a Honchkrow, and a Mega Gyarados, all of which the Life Pokemon treats as fodder via Moonblast. Pyroar will survive this move on the first shot, but even if Xerneas can't take it down, that still leaves the rest of your team. He's less of a comedy in <em>Y</em>, as Yveltal doesn't have the same killing power against Honchkrow and Gyarados.
</li><li> And we have the Champion from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Pok&eacute;mon X and Y</a></em>, Diantha, who is widely considered even worse. With Pok&eacute;mon weak to Steel, Ice and Fairy-type attacks up the alley, and some with unorthodox movesets, there are quite a few Pok&eacute;mon that can tear through her with little concern. Her ace, Mega Gardevoir, while strong, doesn't come out until last, and although it can hit pretty hard, its physical Defense leaves something to be desired, leaving it easy prey for an Iron Head or Shadow Claw.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pok&eacute;mon Sun and Moon</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first Totem Pok&eacute;mon in Moon, Totem Raticate, is Dark/Normal and thus takes <em>quadruple</em> damage from fighting attacks. Not only are fighting types plentiful right outside its cave, said cave contains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleYetAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleYetAwesome">Brick Break</a>, which is generally considered the Fighting move of choice for completing the game.
</li><li> The final Totem Pok&eacute;mon, Totem Kommo-o, has a quadruple weakness to Fairy and appears in an area with the Fairy-type TM, Dazzling Gleam. Dazzling Gleam can be learned by a lot of Fairy-types and even a few Pok&eacute;mon that aren't part Fairy. If that wasn't enough, you also get Fairium Z just before fighting it, and its two allies, Hakamo-o and Scizor, are both Level 32 and essentially sitting ducks. This is mitigated somewhat in <em>Ultra Sun and Moon</em>, where it's given Poison Jab (super-effective against Fairy-types), a Roseli Berry (which lessens the power of super-effective fairy attacks), and is fought before receiving Fairium Z rather than after, and its ally Scizor is much higher leveled.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostFinalBoss">Post-Final Boss</a> encounter with Tapu Koko. You're introduced to the powerful guardian deity (which is capable of taking on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">the Ultra Beasts</a>) at the very start of the game, and now you fight it... yet despite this build-up, in addition to there only being one of it versus what is likely a full party of six, you've just become the Champion, and thus any one member of your team will likely knock it down in a few shots.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">Pok&eacute;mon Sword and Shield</a></em> would avert this with Leon, whose team and movelist composition proves that he earned the title of "Champion".

<ul><li> The Gaping Dragon and Dark Sun Gwyndolin are jokes. In both cases, the environment actually helps you. The Gaping Dragon's attacks are easy to avoid thanks to the huge boss arena and the fact that it takes a few seconds to recover after trying to charge you. Gwyndolin only uses easy to avoid ranged attacks and has no melee attacks, in an endless corridor with plenty of columns for you to hide behind. The battles are more tedious than difficult, since Gaping Dragon has high health and Gwyndolin is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetBackHereBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetBackHereBoss">"Get Back Here!" Boss</a> who teleports away every time you come near him.
</li><li> Quelaag isn't a very difficult boss either, especially for ranged characters, since her only ranged attack is slow and has extremely short range. Even melee characters shouldn't have any trouble as long as they avoid her shockwave attack.
</li><li> Pinwheel is a near-memetic example of this trope, especially compared to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">the dungeon he's in</a>. By the time you get to him, you should be leveled up and have good enough weapons to curb-stomp him into the ground immediately. This is most likely due to the fact that he can be encountered very early in the game and was balanced as such, but most players encounter him later due to how unintuitive and difficult it is to get to him at all. His attack patterns and damage are fine, he just has low health by late game standards (about as much as the Taurus Demon or Capra Demon) and thus by the time players encounter him he goes down in two combos.
</li><li> The final boss <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gwyn, Lord of Cinder</span> becomes this if you're good at parrying or exploit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">Good Bad Bugs</a>.

</li><li> The Bed of Chaos only takes <em>three hits</em> to kill, but what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">three hits</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">they are</a>.

Being a large, immobile target with highly-telegraphed attacks and residing in an arena with a wall fixture that the player can hide behind to avoid most of his attacks does not do him any favors.

Any damage Behemoth actually manages to do becomes moot when you realize you can heal up the entire party <em>twice</em> in the time it takes for him to get off one measly attack. The only nuisance with the fight is the fact that you have to hit the horn on its head to damage it, which is high up above the ground... except this is easily mitigated by simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColossusClimb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColossusClimb">jumping up onto its back</a> and wailing away at it on its shoulders.

He's easily beatable by the time you finish the game, and can be beaten with relative ease with just spellcasters (yes, that icludes Colette).

It's presented as a very important battle, in terms of emotions for the characters and storyline, as defeating this boss means you will be offered a pact with Origin, so you can obtain the Material Blade. Since it's a duel, you only get to fight as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Lloyd</a>. Problem this, the boss is a pushover &mdash; he still uses some of the spells he used when you were fighting him with a full team the last few times, but lacks the bigger damaging spells like Judgement and doesn't even use his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Overlimit</a>. The battle is likely made easier, to compensate for the fact that one has to fight it solo, but fails to live up to the in-game tension that was being built up. The post-battle scene also implies that the boss wasn't going all-out, after all, due to being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">Death Seeker</a>.
</li><li> Despite being the penultimate plot-mandated Summon Spirit to obtain, the battle against Luna and Asuka. They are fought only <em>after</em> having gotten the other elemental Summon Spirits, which includes Shadow, whose element they are weak to. The player also has obtained the Tethe Seal: Dark skill for Sheena and the Amethyst, a skill and accessory that make the target's/wearer's attacks Dark-elemental, which means you go into the battle with more than enough options to make whatever weapon your party has equipped strong against the Light Summon Spirits.

<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Therion Teresa</span>, despite being a Therion, proves to be the weakest of them all.

</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aifread</span>. The entire game is spent listening to Eizen and his crew hyping him up as this badass.

The final boss, the Life Virus, was basically a glorified virus with a very predictable moveset and a shield that went down long enough to whale on its health and waste it in so early as <em>one turn flat</em> with the proper battlechips. To be honest, you can soley rely on the Program Advance Guts Shoot &mdash; it does 500 damage, so two hits of that will pulverize <em>any</em> boss lacking a protective barrier or guard.

Its opposite version counterpart, Gregar, puts up much more of a fight in every regard, although it is relatively easy as well.

However, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> of the game, Queen Slug-For-A-Butt, is almost equally pathetic. She does have an attack &mdash; summoning insects with her scepter to attack Jim &mdash; but the casting animation is long, and attacking her in the middle of it interrupts her. If you shoot the Queen at any time you can, it is not particularly hard to keep her locked down completely, killing her without even letting her fire off one attack.
</li><li> Both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">final bosses</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OFF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OFF">OFF</a></em> are real pushovers. The context of these boss fights is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">near the end, you can chose to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelingPlayerCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelingPlayerCharacters">root for one of two opposing people</a>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PureIsNotGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PureIsNotGood">Batter</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">Judge</a></span>. No matter who you choose, the fight will be very easy. The bosses both have an absurdly low HP stat equivalent to the very first boss, and if that wasn't enough, you will additionally get a huge advantage depending on who you choose. If you choose to play as the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Judge</span>, he will be at an extremely high level; his strongest attack can 2HKO the boss. If you choose to play as the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Batter</span>, you will outnumber the boss four to one. And if even that wasn't enough, you can cheese the boss battle entirely by choosing to play as the character you are rooting against, and then lose on purpose. Not that it would be necessary.

<ul><li> The Untouched Inquisitor, in terms of story, is one of the most vile players in this whole game, having purged the Dome of Light, an utterly devoted and joyful church of the same religion he had, because his twisted mind saw sin in it. All the lore you find within the now-forgotten Dome speaks of his destruction of the place, how he sacrificed everyone inside to fit his version of holiness and made restless phantoms out of everyone involved so that his "Untouched" could flourish. The Untouched Inquisitor, in terms of gameplay, is probably the easiest boss due to his somewhat predictable (if high-range) attacks and frankly unimpressive damage, and the only difficulties he poses are the fact he can float around (giving melee builds some difficulty) and that he has decent knockback to his strikes. Ultimately, the fails to match up to the lore that hypes him up and ends up eclipsed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">the once-proud, now enslaved pet of the Dome whose will he personally broke</a>.

They simply don't put up that much of a fight, because one of them is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute">a dumb brute whose style of attack you've already seen several times</a>, and the other's attack style relies more on positioning and traps, and thus isn't much of a threat to someone who's learned proper positioning, not to mention gets utterly gimped to uselessness if her brutish partner dies. The fact the lore makes the pair one of the most powerful entities in the whole island does not help them much. Neither does their story-wise position: they're stuck between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">the most infamously hard boss of the game (who is related by family to one of the pair)</a> and either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> to the final enemy and the entity responsible for sinking your ship at the start, or a triple encounter that is significantly harder and also a big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a> as a whole.

The atmosphere is suitably dramatic, but for players anticipating an epic final challenge it can be somewhat of a letdown. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Thankfully, the postgame unlocks two new endings, which both have more traditional and challenging <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Bosses</a>.</span>

This owes to the fact that he's simply a slow-moving wall of health that mostly uses powerful offensive spells on occasion. One of the heroes who happens to be linked to him story-wise can learn an attack that deals maximum amounts of damage to this boss.

It unfortunately doesn't live up to the hype, mostly thanks to the numerous amounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> setups the player has access to at this point, and Aurelia is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposelyOverpowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposelyOverpowered">Purposely Overpowered</a> for this portion of the game.

Even on their hardest charts, they don't exactly deliver in the challenge department:
<ul><li> "Battle Against a True Hero" is known amongst fans for being the boss theme of the first legitimate challenge on a No Mercy run. In <em>Groove Coaster</em>, its most difficult chart is rated 9 out of 15 (charts in this game generally start being considered "boss" charts at level 12 or 13). Unlike "MEGALOVANIA" below, it doesn't even get an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Extra</a> chart. The instrumentation of the track gives off the feeling that it had the potential to be a very difficult track.
</li><li> "MEGALOVANIA", of all tracks. Given the intensity of the track and the hefty context that it plays in in its source game (namely, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss">obnoxiously unfair fight</a> with one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Bosses</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sans the Skeleton</span>, where victory means <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">topping off the No Mercy run, destroying the world, and permanently tainting all future runs</span>), the Hard chart is not terribly hard by the standards of "boss" tracks, only being rated a 10 with no unique gimmicks to speak of. A December 2018 update did give it an Extra chart rated 12, which is more of a challenge if only by a few notches.

<ul><li> Almost every final boss in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gradius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gradius">Gradius</a></em> series is the Bacterian emperor, who usually takes the form of a large brain and either fires easily-avoidable attacks or just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroEffortBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroEffortBoss">sits there and does nothing,</a> giving the player a chance to take him down. Exceptions to this pattern are in <em>Nemesis II</em> and <em>Salamander II</em>.
</li><li> A self-parody series named <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Parodius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Parodius">Parodius</a></em> also has these. <em>Parodius Da</em> has an octopus who claims he's "The strongest" (A reference to Gofer from <em>Gradius II</em>), but you can shoot his legs off or wait until they let go, much like the Xaerous Brain from the original <em>Gradius</em>. In its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Omake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Omake">Omake</a> level, you find <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a penguin waking up and sitting on a bomb. He takes out a sign out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hammerspace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hammerspace">Hammerspace</a> that says "The End". You just ignite the bomb, watch him fly (and fall), and get the many bells that come out</span>.
</li><li> While in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Otomedius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Otomedius">Otomedius</a></em>, the Gofer sisters' Odin Core is most definitely not an anti-climax, the final form of Dark Force in Otomedius Excellent is. After dealing with two difficult forms, the third one is just her child form, shrouded in a bit of black mist and shooting easily dodgeable projectiles.
</li><li> The ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AfterBurner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AfterBurner">After Burner</a> Climax</em> for the arcade which involves nukes also ends rather anticlimactically even if you let the nukes go off, as your Carrier's CWACs destroys the missile and takes only mild damage from the shrapnel. But the stage beforehand will make most AB players wonder how he can get past all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">missiles</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">flak barrages</a>.
</li><li> While far from a pushover, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> battle with Andross in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox64">Star Fox 64</a></em> is easier than most of the other bosses in the second half of the game. He's easy on either of the paths: the final stage of the easier one stays in corridor mode, making its attack tough to dodge, but can be killed literally by mashing the fire button as fast as possible (and one bomb or two), whereas the harder path <em>does</em> up the conditions of the general battle, but essentially has no attacks once you destroy his eyes, meaning that as long as you know how to outmaneuver him, he's basically a sitting duck. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note05hia');"><sup>Explanation&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note05hia" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note05hia');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Andross' Brain is faced in All Range Mode, and he's <em>fast</em> (as fast as your Arwing while boosting, in fact), and can only be hurt by shooting a small greenish spot on the side of his brain, but if he loses his eyes, you can only be damaged by ramming into him or the easily dodged mines he leaves, or getting caught into his tentacles, which <em>will</em> damage you badly, but that only happens if you carelessly fly low towards him. In other words, the most dangerous element of this fight is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalOverconfidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalOverconfidence">the player's own hubris coming to bite them in the ass.</a></span>
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> in the last wave of Bravo Sector (the first episode) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaptorCallOfTheShadows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaptorCallOfTheShadows">Raptor: Call of the Shadows</a></em> is unusually easy when compared to the bosses from the previous two waves. This eggshell-shaped capital ship that defends the oil rigs that you probably have already destroyed opens up with only large salvos of missiles and a few number of aimed flak balls at you, which are relatively easy to dodge. While it has two white guns that look like its damaging plasma cannons, for some reason, they don't even fire (presumably due to either a bug or being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> to not work in the game), which pretty much plays this trope straight.

</li><li> The final boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea2CursedMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea2CursedMemories">Disgaea 2</a></em> is very easy for the fact that unlike any of the other final bosses in the series, he has no minions to deal with, meaning it's just a simple task of whittling down his less-than-impressive HP before he can defeat all 10 of your units.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemShadowDragonAndTheBladeOfLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemShadowDragonAndTheBladeOfLight">Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light</a></em>. The first has pathetic accuracy and damage, making him little more then a "gate" requiring the player to obtain the Starlight spell in order to damage him. The final boss can easily be defeated by putting Marth with the Falchion or a decently-leveled Tiki in front of him, ending your turn, and attacking. It's possible to even land a lucky critical strike and take him down in <em>one hit!</em> In the remake of <em>Shadow Dragon</em>, Medeus becomes a much bigger threat on higher difficulties, but this is counterbalanced by the fact that if you don't have Tiki and the Falchion, it also gives you the chance to get Nagi (essentially a better version of Tiki, who was already capable of fighting him) and a somewhat downgraded Falchion, removing the potential of not having at least one unit capable of killing the big guy. With the right exploits, it's possible to have Tiki, Nagi, and <em>both</em> Falchions, meaning Medeus becomes a speedbump.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGenealogyOfTheHolyWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGenealogyOfTheHolyWar">Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War</a></em>:
<ul><li> Julius, the final boss, is ordinarily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>. His stats are extremely good, and he's armed with the Loptous tome, which, aside from a notable boost to his already high Resistance, <em>halves your attack power before defence is applied</em>, making it near impossible to do any damage to him. And he's got a good selection of skills, too &mdash; Charge lets him keep blasting you with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove">Meteor</a> tome from afar, Nihil means you can't hope for a lucky crit, and if you get his HP below 40, Wrath kicks in, meaning his attacks are now critting hard enough to one-shot nearly anything. Oh, and he regenerates 20 HP every turn. So what makes him fit this trope? If you recruited Julia back, she'll have the Naga tome, which negates the attack-halving effect of Loptous, sticks on massive statboosts on top of that, and with her crazy resistance and the HP-regenerating Circlet item, he can barely damage her. And she <em>also</em> has Nihil, which shuts down Wrath. As long as you got her back (not that it's easy, mind you...), beating him is a cakewalk.
</li><li> Bishop Manfroy, arguably the true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the game, really isn't much more than a slightly beefed-up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook">Dark Bishop</a>. He has good stats and some Leadership Stars, but his weapon is the fairly common Jormungand tome, which doesn't boost up his stats and is so heavy that it tanks his Speed down from 24 to 4. At that point, his Adept and Pursuit skills (which trigger based on Speed) aren't very helpful, and Seliph is probably going to be taking minimal damage and doubling Manfroy in return. Compared to Ishtar, who's fought in the same map and has 30 Speed <em>while weighed down by her Tome</em>, Manfroy is little more than a speedbump&mdash;then again, reaching him tends to be the real challenge, as it requires you to rush your way through or past a dozen powerful enemies while Julius is shooting meteors at you.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThracia776" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThracia776">Fire Emblem: Thracia 776</a></em> is a rather difficult game, considered by many to be the hardest in the series. Except that its final boss, Veld (or Berdo or Beld/Berd, depending on who translated it), is essentially just an overleveled Dark Bishop (a fairly common <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook">Elite Mook</a>) with moderately high stats, some extra Leadership Stars, and a unique tome. While the map he's on is quite difficult, taking Veld himself down is barely any harder than dealing with any other Dark Bishop, not requiring any special weapons or specific characters. He'd actually lose if you tossed him up against most of the minibosses in the very chapter you fight him in. If you want to humiliate him, it's pretty easy to use Tina and her Thief Staff to whisk away that special Tome and defang him completely, and since he has only 11 Build, you can follow this up by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyRewarded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyRewarded">capturing</a></em> him.

The bosses of these three bonus levels &mdash; Brunnya, Jahn, and Idunn &mdash; are all far easier to beat than Zephiel! The final two bosses, Jahn and Idunn, go down quite easily, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and not even the extra qualifier that the <em>real</em> true ending only occurs if the Binding Blade is used to strike the final blow should keep you from being able to see it</span>. Idunn in particular is infamous for the fact that Roy with the Binding Blade can kill her <em>even on a 0% Growths run.</em>
<ul><li> There's also Sigune, the Falcoknight boss on the Ilia route. Her stats are at least decent for a boss, but as a boss, she is set to be immobile. Being immobile is a problem, since the biggest selling point of her Falcoknight class is her high movement. Being a boss literally <em>took away her biggest strength</em>. Oh, and she does not have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualBossImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualBossImmunity">Contractual Boss Immunity</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAir">Arrows and Aircalibur</a>, meaning any decent archer will kill her no problem.

As a Sage with decent stats and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove">Bolting</a> tome, he can do some real damage at long range, especially given that most of your units at this point won't have much Resistance, and he has enough Speed (and the advantage of sitting on a ruin) that he can dodge a lot of your attacks. If you choose to fight him normally, he can be deadly. However, Kishuna shows up early in the level, causing an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a> field for ten squares around him... which just so happens to leave Aion helpless while you whale on him. (The con is that said field inhibits <em>your</em> own magic users and by that point you don't have the long-range Physic Staves handy, so you better work around that too.) As long as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnidiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnidiot">you don't kill Kishuna first</a>, Aion will be pretty easy to deal with.
</li><li> There's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a> Denning, a late-game boss...of the <em>Sniper</em> class, leaving him unable to hit any unit in an adjacent square to him. Since you have to spend the full number of turns in the level even if you beat him in advance, most players find it preferable to surround him with four units and leave him until the final turn so enemy reinforcements continue to spawn for experience. Note that this is two chapters from the endgame.

<ul><li> Oliver is a corrupt senator who serves as the villain for the portion of the game that takes place in Begnion. After several chapters of chasing him (one of which consists of four separate battles), you finally corner him... And while his stats aren't <em>too</em> bad, they aren't anything special either. To add to it, about halfway through the final battle against him, a group of four friendly units, one of whom is extremely broken at this point in the game, will show up and start decimating Oliver's remaining forces. At this point, as long as you aren't outright trying to get yourself killed, the battle is yours &mdash; even if you refuse to aid them, Tibarn and his forces will eventually finish the chapter on their own. The <em>actual</em> challenge is to make sure that one of <em>your</em> units deals the final blow so you can get Oliver's Nosferatu tome.
</li><li> Petrine is one of the more prominent antagonists throughout the game, being the only one of Daein's Four Riders other than The Black Knight himself to be a major character and a recurring threat throughout the story. She's built up to be an extremely formidable warrior who is able to fight <em>Greil</em> of all people into a stalemate, and has practically made a sport out of roasting her enemies with her famed Flame Lance. Alas, when you finally get to fight her late in the game, it turns out that said Flame Lance runs off of her magic stat, which, while high for a physical-based class, is still not high enough to be truly deadly. As a result, characters with high resistance, especially Sages, will barely be scratched by it, and will be able to make short work of her in return.

<ul><li> The Black Knight. You've spent the better part of two games waiting to kill this guy, and when the battle finally comes, Ike stomps him. You can literally do nothing and you'll still win just by counterattacking; and if you equip Ike with a Hammer, you can kill him in a single attack. The hardest part of the battle is keeping him alive long enough for your other characters to get the Wishblade. This is especially disappointing when you consider how hard he was in <em>Path of Radiance</em>.
</li><li> Most members of the Begnion senate, except for Lekain, are this. They're all fought in Part 4, in the chapters preceding the Endgame, but since all of them are Bishops with low defense and speed, they are practically jokes who stand no chance against your army.

The only mildly troublesome thing about him is a skill that boosts his Accuracy and Evasion by 20 until the 7th turn, but it's still reasonably easy to take him out before then.
</li><li> The first time you fight Validar in Chapter 22, he has the exact same stats he had in the premonition <em>at the very beginning of the game.</em> But then you fight him again with stats appropriate for that stage in the game, and he is still largely a non-threat due to his abysmal Speed and lack of any powerful Skills despite being a Level 18 Sorcerer. Hard Mode does toughen him up considerably, though, giving him the Dragonskin ability (the only other enemy who has it is the Final Boss), as well as the very dangerous Vengeance skill.
</li><li> Aversa also falls into this since, like all flying units, she suffers from a crippling weakness to bows and wind magic, and can be easily curbstomped by any appropriately-leveled unit with access to either.

<ul><li> Leo in <em>Birthright</em> Chapter 18 is built up as a powerful opponent and the confrontation with the Avatar &mdash; who he considered his brother/sister &mdash; is emotional, but he's a joke of a boss. He has very low stats for a Level 12 promoted unit (he has better stats bar HP when he joins as a playable unit in <em>Conquest</em> Chapter 14, and at Level 2), so he poses little threat, <em>plus</em> he's fought in a very small map that makes it easy to just run up to him and beat him in one or two turns.
</li><li> Garon is the second-to-last boss of both <em>Birthright</em> and <em>Conquest</em>, but he's not very threatening. His main weapon is an axe, which naturally has low accuracy (especially if against an opponent with Weapon Triangle advantage). As long as the Avatar hasn't been reclassed to something that can't use a sword, they can just walk right up to Garon and use the upgraded Yato to easily take him out in a round or two.
</li><li> If the player trained the Avatar well, Xander can become this in <em>Birthright</em> Chapter 26, as it will only take one or two hits from the Noble Yato to down him, on top of this being possible to do in one turn. It doesn't help that this comes after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Elise's death</span>, and it's especially jarring given that Xander was a walking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">Hopeless Boss Fight</a> in <em>Birthright</em> Chapter 12.

Von Bolt, by comparison, is at best unremarkable, and is widely judged as a nerfed Sturm (Sturm buffs his units' attack and defense by 20%, Von Bolt by 10%, Sturm ignores terrain, Von Bolt doesn't, Sturm has a single 10-star power that nukes a massive area for eight damage and buffs his units even further, Von Bolt has a single ten-star power that blasts a small area for three damage and freezes a few units for a turn).

Once the flunkies and the mini-boss are destroyed, the final boss' first form is completely immobile and all its attacks have a maximum radius, so if you've fitted your wanzers with missile launchers, you can chip away his health without him being able to damage you. The second form is more powerful than most standard enemies, but it's a mech that you've fought and beaten several times before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(Driscoll's)</span>, so you should know what to expect by now. On top of that, this is the only mission where you can deploy all the pilots you've recruited over the course of the game, so you're more than welcome to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a> him if that's your style.

You fought them both previously and their tactics haven't changed since then, thus they aren't that difficult to take down. The only challenge comes from one of them cheating by them constantly saying your last hit didn't count and applying status effects on your party because they felt like it. Once <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Doctor Timothy/Timmy</span> intervenes to stop the cheating, you pretty much have the fight in the bag.

Unfortunately, the characters leading said armies are all level 1, making their armies enormously gimped by the game's auto-resolve system (which they're not immune to). While they get bonuses against NPC factions like Kislev and Kraka Drak, once they hit the player they're liable to get bogged down and slain by overwhelming numbers relatively quickly. A common meme about the game is that the game's <em>true</em> Everchosen is the Norscan chieftain Surtha Ek, whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">all-chariot armies</a> are likely to have rampaged through the northern Empire multiple times before the End Times even begin.

Able to be used infinitely, they will more or less guarantee you victory. CA would later revisit the battle, but it's still not particularly difficult by any stretch &mdash; the battle you get if one of the AI factions finishes the battle first is generally considered to be harder even if you've got two AI allies with you, as the defending faction will be given a powerful end-game army and your allies will mostly have low-tier units.
</li><li> The End Times in Mortal Empires (see the first game above) is even easier than in the second game, thanks to a lot of new factions and a lot of rebalancing. Following <em>The Hunter and the Beast</em>, where a patch removed the auto-resolve bonuses 'major' factions gain against 'minor' ones, it's not uncommon to see Kislev invade and settle Norsca before defeating The End Times all on its own without the player's involvement.

While Dragons are the strongest units in the game, a decently-sized army led by a high-level Hero won't have too much trouble with them, and without a human leader, the dragons don't get a bonus to their stats or spell assistance. The previous three missions against the rival lords are significantly more challenging, especially Lord Alamar (the Warlock lord) who's likely to have twice as many dragons, as well as dozens of other units, by the time you face him.

Unlike the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Moon Lord</span>, though, <em>none</em> of its attacks go through walls.

These are: a Zombie deck, which by itself is tougher than anything the game has used before, a Water deck, a Lightsworn deck (an archetype of rare cards deliberately designed to be overpowered before the ban list nerfed it &mdash; this game is before that nerf &mdash; and comprised of cards so rare that it's difficult for a player to fully assemble a Lightsworn deck of their own), and a Dark Armed Dragon deck, modelled after a deck that won multiple real life tournaments. Oh and they have the computer's "luck" to help them out... After that absolute hell, you get to save, then fight the final boss... Jack Atlus, using a poorly built, unoptimised deck that is built for flavor. And it is a joke.

Unfortunately, his deck lacks any real synergy, and is laden with very high-level monsters that slow his strategies. The field being a mishmash of terrain also means he lacks the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeDeck">Theme Deck</a> advantage of lesser opponents.

You go to the bottom of the maze and pick up the key while dropping coins to keep her distracted, then open the chest in the middle of the maze and wait for her to finish picking up the coins, at which point she starts coming after you again and gets sucked into the chest.

Too bad that for its 3rd edition incarnation (and others), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateMook">it moves slow, can't fly, and has no ranged attacks</a>, meaning anything that does and has a decent damage output can poke it to death without harm. It has a pathetic will save that any wizard that should be encountering him can beat (barring natural 20) and no immunities to the effects that target will (even the ones that people avoid using because every other high level monster beside Big T is immune to them). You can have your very own pet Tarrasque for a day/level (that can easily be renewed before it expires with no effort, just command it to lower its SR and fail the will save) via Dominate Monster. One noticeably laughable design choice is that over half its feats are some of the worst feats in the game (which was something of a recurring theme for monster feat choices- they often tended to be ones that were extremely weak and made no thematic sense). It doesn't help that ever since it was created, gamers have had unofficial "easiest/silliest ways to defeat the Tarrasque" contests. One particularly noticeable one involves a goat with a jar of green slime tied around its neck. The Tarrasque eats the goat and the slime then destroys it from the inside.
</li><li> The <em>Red Hand of Doom</em> adventure features the Ghostlord, meant to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">Hopeless Boss Fight</a> &mdash; he's encountered when the party is around 8th level, and he's CR 13, so on paper, the only way to beat him is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingTheMonsterToDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingTheMonsterToDeath">talk to him</a> and convince him not to join the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. However, the Ghostlord is pretty miserably-built for CR 13; he's a lich ex-druid 6/blighter 5, which translates to his first six class levels <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyLevels">being useless</a> and his next five levels being in a fairly weak prestige class designed to compensate for his first six levels being useless. On top of that, he's already used his 5th-level spells when you encounter him, so he's actually down to 4th-level blighter spells, making him effectively a 7-8th-level druid. And just to seal the deal, the room he confronts you in is pretty cramped, making it easy to dogpile him, and one of the items you can pick up is a Staff of Life, which can potentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReviveKillsZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReviveKillsZombie">one-shot him</a> outright.
