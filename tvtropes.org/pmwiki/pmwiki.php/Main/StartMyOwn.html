</li><li> After having helped save the world at the end of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon2000">Pok&eacute;mon 2000</a></em> movie, the Team Rocket trio have this discussion amongst themselves:

</div><div class="indent"><strong>James:</strong> That's good! Or is that bad?
</div><ul><li> Team Rocket also threaten to do this in a later episode, when they find their memberships have expired. It is quickly pointed out they can just reapply.
</li></ul></li><li> This is the premise of the manga <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GothicSports" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GothicSports">Gothic Sports</a></em>, where, motivated by the fact that they simply would never see any play in their school's normal soccer team, a few girls (with two guys...) get together and start their own team for the school.
</li><li> Ryuusuke and Eiji of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BECK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BECK">BECK: Mongolian Chop Squad</a></em> initially play in the same band, Serial Mama, until personal differences and a missed opportunity with a record producer drive them apart. Both find success with their respective bands: Eiji's Belle Ame is commercially-successful, backed by influential producer Ran; while Ryuusuke with BECK have a much longer arc of struggles before gaining world-wide recognition.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/LoveChunibyoAndOtherDelusions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/LoveChunibyoAndOtherDelusions">Love, Chunibyo &amp; Other Delusions</a></em>, Rikka forms her own school club, the "Far Eastern Magical Nap Association", which is more or less a legalized excuse to let her delusions run amuck with Yuuta, Kumin and Sanae tagging along, willing or not. Nanase-sensei approves the club as a social circle, only because she noticed Rikka's determination to see her dream come to life despite lacking the prerequisite five members. Then it becomes a full-fledged club once Shinka actually applies, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">hinting to her past life as another deluded teen herself</span>.
</li><li> Z, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a> Film Z</em> was once a member of the Navy, but got so fed up with their corruption that he left and formed his own private army. Problem? His methods are too extreme for even Admiral <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">Sakazuki</a></em>.
<ul><li> In the main storyline, Trafalgar Law was once a member of the Don Quixote Pirates, even being prepared to become Doflamingo's right-hand man on the Heart seat. (Dolfamingo's top Co-Dragons have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingCardMotifs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingCardMotifs">Playing Card Motifs</a>). However, after Doflamingo killed the current Corazon, his own brother and Law's favorite person, Law broke away and eventually formed his own crew, the Heart Pirates, so he could eventually take revenge.
</li></ul></li><li> Hoshi-no-Tsuji High and Middle School in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicOfStella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicOfStella">Magic of Stella</a></em> institutionalizes this trope, as it doesn't require a faculty advisor to start a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseSchoolClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseSchoolClub">Japanese School Club</a>; a few student members and the appropriate paperwork already handles it. The series is about a club that make <em>doujin games</em>, which would be unthinkable everywhere else.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans">Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans</a></em>: The main characters are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">Child Soldiers</a> who serve as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">expendable cannon fodder</a> for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PMC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PMC">PMC</a> who use "Run away while using the brats as human shields" as Plan A...and Plans B, C, D, etc. Understandably, they have issues with this, so they decide to start their own...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters">by killing off their bosses</a> and taking over their facilities, changing the name from CGS to Tekkadan.

The Outdoor Activities Club was born of Chiaki and Aoi's desire to experience the outdoors at a much more relaxed pace than the athletically-focused Hiking Club.
</li><li> Kanna <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissKobayashisDragonMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissKobayashisDragonMaid">Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid</a></em> has very little interest in joining any of the established dragon factions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DadsOffFightingInTheWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DadsOffFightingInTheWar">due to the war being responsible for her parents' neglect</a>. Instead, she started the "Kanna Faction".
</li><li> Like the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicOfStella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicOfStella">Magic of Stella</a></em> example above, Sakuragaoka High School in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheDemonGirlNextDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheDemonGirlNextDoor">The Demon Girl Next Door</a></em> has a rather hands-off attitude on the establishment of clubs, as long as the club's objective can be fulfilled in the entire time the applicant is in school. As a result, the school has clubs for black magic, polishing human specimens, drafting anti-zombie manuals, or just playing with cats, while Mikan's proposal of growing tangerines (her namesake) is rejected, since it takes five years for the tree to start bearing fruit.
</li><li> After certain events reveal the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">corruption</a> and incompetence of parts of the Hero Association from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OnePunchMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OnePunchMan">One-Punch Man</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">various members, both heroes and staff leave to start the Neo-Hero Organization.

</li><li> In the backstory of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KarateShoukoushiKohinataMinoru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KarateShoukoushiKohinataMinoru">Karate Shoukoushi Kohinata Minoru</a></em>, Kaburagi Ryu karate started when their founder, Kaburagi Juzou, had to leave the already established Koudan Kaikan under undisclosed circumstances (Tachibana, who followed Kaburagi out of Koudan Kaikan, once claimed he was forced out by his former pupil Izumi when he became the Koudan Kaikan president, though Izumi denied the charge and stated Kaburagi should have become president in his place and left on his own).

<ul><li> Dota 2: Team Secret was founded after The International 2014 with the help of legendary now-former Natus Vincere captain/support Clement "Puppey" Ivanov, and had also brought together his teammate and support partner Kuro Salehi "KuroKy" Takhasomi, midlaner Gustav "s4" Magnusson, and former Fnatic support duo Johan "BigDaddyN0tail" Sundstein and Tal "Fly" Aizik. However, months after this formation, Fly and N0tail would soon depart/be kicked(?) from the roster, with Evil Geniuses's Artour "Arteezy" Babaev and Ludwig "zai" Wahlberg taking their places. The team was dubbed as quite possibly the most start-studded roster ever built leading up to The International 2015, having also won 4 LAN's to prove their status as favorites. But with this much talent, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreStrugglingTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreStrugglingTogether">there was also a problem of egos clashing despite their success.</a> At The International 2015, this became part of the reason why they were sent home in 7th-8th, a solid, yet extremely disappointing finish for a team of their caliber.
<ul><li> At the post-TI5 shuffle, Puppey was the only remaining member left on the squad, with KuroKy leaving to form his own 5-man team, to eventually be signed by NA/EU organization Team Liquid, s4 returning to Alliance, and Arteezy and zai returning to Evil Geniuses. Puppey's new roster included the unpredictable yet talented Jacky "EternaLEnVy" Mao and his longtime partner Johan "pieliedie" Astrom, talented Romanian midlaner Aliwi "w33" Omar, and Danish veteran Rasmus Berth "MiSeRy" Filipsen. The team, like the previous iteration, was loaded with talent. They finished 2nd at The Frankfurt Major and 1st at The Shanghai Major. But like before, problems started to arise.
</li><li> Before The Manila Major, w33 and MiSeRy were kicked out of Team Secret, with Arteezy once again coming in, this time taking Saahil "Universe" Arora with him. The ensuing Major saw them get eliminated in the <em>first round</em> of the Lower Bracket stage. This was more than enough for Universe to leave the team and rejoin EG. Sam "BuLba" Sosale would take his place. At TI6, they would be eliminated in the first round once again.
</li><li> It was at this point that reports arose that Secret had not been paying some of their players (and manager) the money they earned from the tournaments they participated in along with their merchandise sold under the Team Secret banner. Including this is the organization's manager and Puppey himself taking a paycut from the winnings earned. There were also reports of bullying within the team. Eventually a TwitLonger from Puppey was released, stating that all financial obligations were now met, and that the team's manager was then let go and hired a new manager.
</li><li> After TI6, the only player who remained not named Puppey was pieliedie. Taking their places would be former MVP Phoenix teammates Lee "Forev" Sang-don and Pyo "MP" No-a, and Fnatic midlaner Yeik "MidOne" Nai Zheng. Forev didn't stay long, returning to MVP just nearly three months into his tenure, with Maurice "KheZu" Gutmann coming in, and in May 2017, pieliedie would also leave to join his old teammates in Team NP, and Yazied "YapzOr" Jaradat would take his place. This iteration would have inconsistent success throughout the season, with their lowest point being a 9th-16th finish at The Kiev Major, upset by Brazil's SG e-sports. At TI7, they would fall 9th-12th courtesy of eventual champions Team Liquid.
</li><li> The roster shuffle pre-Dota Pro Circuit 2017-18 had MP and KheZu leaving the team, and in their place were Marcus "Ace" Hoelgaard, and Adrian "Fata" Trinks. They had mixed success all throughout, but their 2nd place finish at ESL One Hamburg and wins at Dreamleague Seasons 8 and 9 gave them the majority of the points to qualify for TI8, finishing 4th in the DPC standings. At the tournament itself, they improved...albeit marginally, finishing 5th-6th, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats">once again at the hands of Team Liquid.</a>
</li><li> Post-TI8 and into the 2018-19 DPC, Ace and Fata would leave to reform Ninjas in Pyjamas's Dota 2 squad as part of Peter "ppd" Dager's 5-stack, paving the way for Secret to sign Michal "Nisha" Jankowski and the return of zai to the lineup. Already they look unstoppable against many other teams as shown in The Kuala Lumpur Major, only beaten by Virtus.pro in the Grand Finals 3-2, and have dominated in the Chongqing Major EU Qualifiers, taking the 1st seed once again. However, time will tell if they can continue this momentum heading into TI9.
</li><li> Over the course of the organization's existence, the team's went through many shifts and ups and downs. Eventually, it went from a team desiring to create an all-star team to a team focused on building around a certain player, in this case Puppey himself, as he also takes a role in building some of the younger players with huge potential, like Nisha and YapzOr. Over time the organization has also decided to sign players in other pro games such as Rocket League, Fortnite, and Rainbow Six: Siege. The organization as a whole has shied away from controversy since the one that impacted them in late 2016, and has become better since.
</li></ul></li><li> Dota 2: OG was founded after The International 2015 mainly through the efforts of best friends N0tail and Fly, along with former Team Secret manager Evany Chang. Their other three founding members and teammates were Fly's compLexity Gaming teammate David "MoonMeander" Tan, Andreas Franck "Cr1t-" Nielsen, and Amer "Miracle-" al-Barqawi. Initially starting off as (monkey) Business, they rebranded to OG prior to The Frankfurt Major.
<ul><li> At Frankfurt, they were unsuccessful in the group stage, resulting in them starting off in the Lower Bracket. And then they performed what is arguably the greatest Lower Bracket run of all time, defeating Fnatic, Mineski, Virtus.pro, TI5 runner-up CDEC Gaming, EHOME (who also had started from the Lower Bracket as well), and TI5 champions Evil Geniuses to face off in a grudge match against Team Secret, and capped off their unbelievable run winning 3-1 against them.
</li><li> The Shanghai Major...did not fare well for OG, finishing 7th-8th after losing to Fnatic, but the roster held strong, bouncing back at The Manila Major and taking their second Major title, defeating Team Liquid 3-1. With two Major wins under their belt, along with Miracle- becoming the first player to reach 9000 MMR, they were the absolute shoe-ins to win TI6.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingElimination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingElimination">You all know what happened next.</a> After dominating the group stages, they would go on to lose 2-1 to MVP Phoenix, and then get knocked out 2-0 by TNC Pro Team. Unlike what happened after Shanghai, the team couldn't stick together after their disastrous and embarrassing loss at TI. Only Fly and N0tail stuck together, with Cr1t- moving on to Evil Geniuses, MoonMeander going to Digital Chaos, and Miracle- leaving to go to Team Liquid. In their place were s4, Jesse "JerAx" Vainikka, and Anathan "ana" Pham. This OG would go on to win two more Majors in Boston and Kiev, making Fly and N0tail 4-time Major winners, the most of anyone. But at TI, they just couldn't perform well to the hype, as while they got revenge on TNC, they would then be eliminated by LGD Gaming, finishing 7th-8th.
</li><li> ana leaves the team, and Roman "Resolut1on-" Fominok would be the team's new midlaner. This time, however, they lost their form during the 2017-18 DPC, only managing to gain a Minor win at MDL Macau. By March 2018, Reso left the team, resulting in coach Sebastien "7ckngMad" Debs standing in until they could find a new midlaner. It wouldn't come. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">And then Fly and s4 would leave OG for EG, just mere days before the China Dota2 Supermajor.</a>
</li><li> Not to mince words, but the sudden departure of the two utterly broke the rest of OG, especially for N0tail, who had a really close bond with Fly. As a result, OG withdrew their invite for the Supermajor, and had to look for players to fill in their roster for the impending arrival of TI8. N0tail found their midlaner in Topias "Topson" Taavitsainen, and ana returned to the team. With the team having reformed just for the sake of making it to TI8, not many, if there were any, had them making a deep run.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderdogsNeverLose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderdogsNeverLose">You all know what happened next.</a> After dominating the EU Qualifiers, they managed to do well in the group stage with a 9-7 standing, enough for a spot in the Upper Bracket, where they faced off and defeated VGJ.Storm. Then came Evil Geniuses, and OG won it out after an amazing comeback performance in Game 3. Then they went up against PSG.LGD...and made another phenomenal comeback in Game 3, punching their ticket to the Grand Finals. PSG.LGD would sweep EG for another shot at OG. What then followed was an epic 5-game series that was highlighted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">OG's comeback performance in Game 4.</a> OG would go on to win Game 5 and The International, breaking the East-West cycle.
</li><li> By this point, OG has arguably become the most successful Dota 2 team of all time, having won 4 Majors and a TI, and so far, they are the only ones to have won a TI and more than one Major (the only other team having won a TI and a Major is Team Liquid). The team has gone through huge success in the 4 Major wins and the downs of TI6 and TI7, but now they have won The International. The only team who can be able to surpass that level of success is Virtus.pro if they can win TI9 (what's even more amazing if they do so is the fact that the current VP roster (except for RodjER as he had joined them in February 2018) had stayed together for two years and counting).
</li></ul></li><li> CS:GO: From the ashes of what was once Team SoloMid/Questionmark, Astralis was formed on January 18, 2016, consisting of an all-Danish roster of Nicolai "dev1ce" Reedtz, Peter "dupreeh" Rasmussen, Andreas "Xyp9x" H&oslash;jsleth, Ren&eacute; "cajunb" Borg, and Finn "karrigan" Andersen, once they were able to obtain the rights to the Astralis name from the original founders of the 1.6 Finnish team.
<ul><li> Their first year had a very mixed bag of results, with a 3rd-4th place finish at the MLG Columbus Major and a 5th-8th finish at the ESL One Cologne 2016 Major. Unfortunately, even with their newly created organization, they still couldn't surpass the demons that had plagued them over the past few years, which was their inability to make it to a Major Final, due to their tendency to choke. Ultimately, it wasn't skill-related, but more of a mentality issue. Over the course of the year, cajunb would go to Team Dignitas in exchange for Markus "Kjaerbye" Kjaerbye, and with karrigan acquired by FaZe Clan, they would acquire their new in-game leader in Lukas gla1ve Rossander. Following that, they made the pioneering decision to hire a sports psychologist to help improve their mental game. And like that, their results skyrocketed. They would finish 2016 with a 2nd place finish against OpTic Gaming in ELEAGUE Season 2, and a 1st place finish against OpTic once again at the ECS Season 2 Finals.
</li><li> 2017 started off on a high note for the Danes, as they would win the first LAN of the year: the ELEAGUE Major: Atlanta 2017 against Virtus.pro. They followed that up with a win at IEM Season XI World Championship against FaZe. Unfortunately, over the course of the year, dev1ce had been sidelined with a hiatal hernia that kept him out for most of the year, but even with him back in time for the PGL Major Krakow 2017, they just could not defend their Major title against a surging Danylo "Zeus" Tslenko-led Gambit Esports, who would go on to win the Major after defeating fellow dark horses Immortals. With dev1ce sidelined, it led to another mixed year, ending on a subpar note with a 9th-10th finish at the ESL Pro League Season 6 Finals.
</li><li> Astralis would start 2018 in terrible fashion, with an early elimination at the ELEAGUE Major: Boston 2018 courtesy of eventual champions Cloud9, finishing 12th-14th. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">And in sudden fashion, Kjaerbye left the team in February to join North.</a> The Danes were scrambling to quickly sign their fifth player, and in time came Emil "Magisk" Reif.
</li><li> What no one could've predicted was the start of yet another dominant era. Starting off in a dominant win at Dreamhack Masters Marseille 2018, it began their rise to the top (and the Intel Grand Slam). They would truly cement their era with their ascendant run at the FACEIT Major: London 2018 with only <strong>two</strong> map losses throughout their entire run from the New Challengers Stage (in lieu of their early group stage elimination at the previous Major in Boston) all the way to the bracket stage, where they dominated every single team in their path, becoming the latest team to win multiple Majors. And at the ESL Pro League S8 Finals, they would win against Team Liquid, and as a result, the first ever Intel Grand Slam title.
</li><li> 12 Grand Finals appearances. 10 trophies. Major Champions. Grand Slam winners. The overall #1 team in the world. 31-0 on Nuke over the course of nine months (February-December). Summed up, everyone was just a witness to Danish dominance in 2018.

Gagne and a couple of smaller promoters from the upper midwest broke away and formed the AWA in 1960, with Gagne as champion and boss. The WWWF formed under similar circumstances in the New England region in 1963: NWA champ "Nature Boy" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BuddyRogers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BuddyRogers">Buddy Rogers</a> was reluctant to wrestle outside of the NE area. When the NWA had him lose the belt to Lou Thesz, he quit the NWA in protest, then joined with the regional promotion, Capitol Wrestling Corporation, to form the WWWF.

</li><li> For many years, the Memphis wrestling territory was run by promoter Nick Gulas.

</li><li> Behind the scenes (mostly) example: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffJarrett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffJarrett">Jeff Jarrett</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a> came to foster a mutual loathing for each other during Jeff's last <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> run, to the point that, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a> went under, neither Jeff nor Vince were at all interested in working with the other &mdash; Vince even announced, live and simulcast on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWERaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWERaw">WWF Raw</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCWMondayNitro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCWMondayNitro">WCW Monday Nitro</a></em>, that Jeff was "G-double-O-double-N-double-E... GOONNEE!" So Jeff (with the help of his father, long-time promoter Jerry Jarrett) started his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling">Professional Wrestling</a> promotion, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">TNA</a>, which continues to thrive and gro&mdash;okay, which <em>is still around</em> today.
<ul><li> On a side note, it should be noted that Jerry Jarrett is a long-time friend of the McMahon family; he personally delivered the wrestler who would become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VladimirKozlov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VladimirKozlov">Vladimir Kozlov</a> to the WWE. Also, Jeff Jarrett said that Vince was one of his biggest supporters during the death of his wife, so things have probably been patched up between the two.
</li><li> Having been pushed out of TNA by his major investor, Dixie Carter, Jeff looked to repeat the feat by starting a new promotion, Global Force Wrestling. His quest to get GFW a television presence was met by many a setback, but the GFW brand nonetheless survived and eventually ended up supplanting the name TNA, as the major investors who replaced Carter brought Jeff Jarrett back, along with as many wrestlers associated with GFW as they could, and allowed them to permanently take over "iMPACT", TNA's main television show. Though someone apparently got cold feet, as iMPACT quietly dropped the GFW branding after a while.
</li></ul></li><li> His time in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Evolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Evolution">Evolution</a> left a deep impression on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton">Randy Orton</a>. His ousting from the stable is largely considered his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a>, and left him a strong hatred for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a> and to a lesser extent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista">Batista</a>. However, what shows Randy's inability to get over what happened in Evolution is his formation of his stable the Legacy, an obvious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of Evolution, but this time with Randy as the leader of the group and his quest to keep hold of the WWE Title paralleling Hunter's own quest to remain World Heavyweight Champion.

And two other founding members of The Corre, Justin Gabriel and Heath Slater, walked out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheNexus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheNexus">The Nexus</a> shortly after Barrett was deposed, unhappy with the way Punk was running things. Barrett is quick to point out that, unlike with The Nexus, he is not the leader of The Corre, as it's a gathering of equals; then again, he said that about The Nexus at first too. It took a few months, but Barrett's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">It's All About Me</a> attitude took over, and Gabriel and Slater promptly disbanded the group because of it.

JudgeSpear long ago started a game he called <em>Super Mario Fusion: Mushroom Kingdom Hearts</em>, a fan game focused on Mario visiting other dimensions. The influence of other developers made it mutate into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MushroomKingdomFusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MushroomKingdomFusion">Mushroom Kingdom Fusion</a></em>, a game that took <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCrossover">Mega Crossover</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>.

When he became active again, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MushroomKingdomFusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MushroomKingdomFusion">Mushroom Kingdom Fusion</a></em> was so different from his original idea that he decided to leave it be and essentially used this trope <em>on himself</em>.
</li><li> Has occurred in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGame">Video Game</a> industry as well. While working at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Atari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Atari">Atari</a>, Jay Miner (having previously developed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atari2600" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atari2600">2600</a> console and 800 computer) designed what would become the Amiga. Frustrated that Atari wouldn't produce it, he left, starting his own company, Hi-Toro, to build it. Hi-Toro went bankrupt, but Commodore bought them and the Amiga design, eventually manufacturing it themselves.
<ul><li> A handful of Atari programmers during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Ray Kassar</a> era were disgruntled that not only were they not getting credit for the games they created, but such information was treated as top secret. So they formed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Activision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Activision">Activision</a>, the world's first third-party gaming company, which upon creation gave credit to the programmer who created the game right on the game box and in television commercials.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts">Electronic Arts</a> was also founded for similar reasons not too long afterward. Now look at what they've become, although in hindsight, Activision is no different.
</li><li> The development studio <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TriAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TriAce">tri-Ace</a>, known for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOcean">Star Ocean</a></em> series, is named for the three employees who left <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TelenetJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TelenetJapan">Telenet Japan</a>'s Wolf Team studio to strike on their own. One of them was the main programmer of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia">Tales of Phantasia</a></em>, who was frustrated with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BandaiNamco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BandaiNamco">Namco</a> that occurred with the game's development.
</li><li> A sad case is when most of the old-school developers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BlizzardEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BlizzardEntertainment">Blizzard Entertainment</a> (the people responsible for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em> one and two, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo">Diablo</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft">StarCraft</a></em>) left to form their own game studio, made the Diablo-clone <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HellgateLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HellgateLondon">Hellgate: London</a></em>, and bankrupted.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TelltaleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TelltaleGames">Telltale Games</a> is another example, founded by ex-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucasArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucasArts">LucasArts</a> employees Kevin Bruner, Dan Connors and Troy Molander after LucasArts all but abandoned the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureGame">Adventure Game</a> genre.
</li><li> Like the Telltale Games example above, Tim Schafer and Ron Gilbert also left LucasArts at around the same time to form <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DoubleFine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DoubleFine">Double Fine</a>.

This resulted in them turning the peripheral into a stand-alone console and entered the game market themselves, determined to teach Nintendo and Sega a lesson...which they did, displacing Nintendo's position at the top of the game industry with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> while contributing to the death of Sega's hardware business, and then retaining their stranglehold on the market with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a>, forcing Nintendo to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">re-think gaming entirely</a> in order to get back on top with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii">Wii</a>. To be fair however, Sony's hands aren't clean in this. Sony had inserted a buried clause that would have resulted in Sony getting a very significant portion of the profits from all sales and complete control over licensing. Nintendo's CEO at the time, Hiroshi Yamauchi, was furious when he found the clause and thought it was a great insult, and decided to fight fire with fire by humiliating Sony in public in return, which in hindsight turned out to be a bad idea.
</li><li> Similar to the above, Atari passed up an opportunity to distribute the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> in the US, leaving Nintendo to market and distribute the NES on its own. You know what happened next. Many video game fans think that was for the best; while the NES would have come to North America a couple of years earlier, it's likely that Atari's mismanagement would've simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatVideoGameCrashOf1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatVideoGameCrashOf1983">dragged Nintendo down with them</a>, dooming the entire video game industry to a Japan-only niche.
</li><li> Nintendo and Sony were so worried about large companies trying to co-opt their new consoles that they immediately rejected Microsoft's attempts to integrate online gaming into their console, so Microsoft <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XBox">started their own console.</a>

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MonolithSoft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MonolithSoft">Monolith Soft</a> was founded by staff from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SquareEnix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SquareEnix">Squaresoft</a>, notably the developers behind <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Xenogears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Xenogears">Xenogears</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ChronoCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ChronoCross">Chrono Cross</a></em>.

</li></ul></li><li> The video game <em>Jawbreaker</em> was a case of this. It started out as a near-perfect port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PacMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PacMan">Pac-Man</a></em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atari8BitComputers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atari8BitComputers">Atari 8-Bit Computers</a> done by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sierra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sierra">On-Line Systems</a>. However once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Atari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Atari">Atari</a> caught wind of it, rather than do the decent thing and license the program, they attempted to bully the programmer into giving them the game.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerseyJackPinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerseyJackPinball">Jersey Jack Pinball</a> was started when game distributor Jack Guarnieri noticed his customers wanted expensive pinball games with deep rules and lots of mechanical toys, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SternPinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SternPinball">Stern Pinball</a> was moving towards simpler, low-budget tables.

</li><li> It's been suggested that this trope was what inspired the inception of 2-D fighting game <em>Beast's Fury</em> by Evil Dog Productions; the leader of the development team, Ryhan Stevens, wanted the same fame and recognition (if not more) as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skullgirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skullgirls">Skullgirls</a></em>, which had enjoyed a very successful crowdfunding campaign.

</li><li> A successful example of this trope: Eric Barone, having just graduated from college (computer science) decided to start making a game for fun and to practice his programming, he was a big fan of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/HarvestMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/HarvestMoon">Harvest Moon</a></em>, but considered the series to had gone downhill after <em>Back to Nature</em> and was unable to find something he thought was a suitable substitute for PC. He started to developing a <em>Harvest Moon</em> clone under the moniker ConcernedApe, but the project gradually grew in scope, and four years later, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/StardewValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/StardewValley">Stardew Valley</a></em> was born.

However, two famous victims are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/LiveJournal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/LiveJournal">LiveJournal</a>, which has a half-zillion clones at this point (all of them near-<em>perfect</em> clones in fact, due to the site's open-source codebase), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/DeviantART" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/DeviantART">DeviantArt</a>, whose restrictive policies led to the creation of SheezyArt and later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FurryFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FurryFandom">FurAffinity</a>. In most such cases, the result is similar to the comedic examples in fiction, with so many people starting their own site that none of them have many users.
</li><li> Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWikiRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWikiRule">Wikis</a>. Many are started because they have focused subject matter, but many others are founded because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>'s standards of notability and citation somehow exclude them, or they think there's something biased about it. For instance, Conservapedia was created by a group who decried Wikipedia's "evidence" and "objectivity", and made their own online encyclopedia with their <em>own</em> bias. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes">This very wiki</a> specializes in covering the tropes of popular culture. Since Wikia allows anyone that wants to start a Wiki to do so, this happens quite often with those who don't like the guidelines, procedures, etc., etc. of a particular wiki. It often doesn't end well, since most of these people are neither suited to be admins nor have the ability to gather followers to their new wiki. One of the most prominent examples (and far more successful than most) is the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> fandom's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunBasedTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunBasedTitle">Wookieepedia</a>, which came about when Wikipedia purged a great many <em>Star Wars</em> articles as "non-notable". Copies of the purged articles were part of the core of Wookieepedia in its early days. Now Wookieepedia is the 5th-largest Wiki in existence.
</li><li> An infamous example is Encyclopedia Dramatica, which was originally started as a place to chronicle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Livejournal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Livejournal">Livejournal</a> drama after Wikipedia purged it due to no-notability.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GaiaOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GaiaOnline">Gaia Online</a>, being the progenitor of the avatar role-playing message-boards, had a ton of these spring up during its early years (Magivolve being one of, if not the very first). Most of these, however, did not have the server space to support a massive userbase or funds to run a website, and even more were run by people who couldn't program and used bought or free code and assets to build their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualPaperDoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualPaperDoll">custom avatar</a> and currency systems. Staff and moderators were hired from members of their own userbase (most of them being teenagers), with the owners barely eclipsing their early twenties themselves. As a result, they weren't run nearly as well as Gaia and most closed down in a few years, while the ones that are still alive haven't updated since their heydays.
</li><li> Once Box Office Mojo got a counter-intuitive redesign that even hid part of the content behind the paywall, some former fans decided to <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBOMRebuild/">get together and make a film box office site like the old BOM<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Whether it will take off remains to be seen.

<ul><li> QQ was created after one too many crackdowns and censures on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame">Role-Playing Game</a> board, where some members found the site's rules against NSFW content too restrictive. A few got together and created a place with basically <em>no</em> rules against NSFW... <em>anything</em> so long as it was posted in the correct place.
</li><li> Due to some unpleasantness regarding an admin being '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner">retired</a>', <a class="urllink" href="http://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/">Sufficient Velocity<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was spun-off, with many threads cloned or moved. Acted as an alpha site when SB reached capacity, then the users which had evacuated shuffled back when its problems were resolved at the eleventh hour. Is since better known for it's more... in-depth approach to site rules and moderation.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note04r88');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note04r88" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note04r88');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">With two of SV's three founders and owners being lawyers, the SV site rules and community compact are significantly more developed than most sites bother with. This is partly as a result of Athene's 'retirement' (as noted above), and partly to do with the fact that it was created by <em>lawyers</em>. As such, SV has a four tier staff hierarchy, three different kinds of staff, and a democratically elected (by users) Community Council responsible for reviewing staff action. Whether this results in enlightened discussion, institutionalised oppression, or makes no difference whatsoever, is generally a matter of personal opinion.</span>

It's effectively what Tumblr was before the massive content ban.

So, with Grumpy, they make their own "project" and a subsequent club to go with it. The girls retaliate by forming their own club, and a montage of the two clubs one-upping each other in their projects ensues, with McKenna stuck in the middle, not wanting to pick a side. She eventually gets the two clubs to see how silly they're being by making a club with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotBuddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotBuddy">Wingnut</a>, and calls them out when they band together to exclude her club.

<ul><li> Texas oil tycoon Clint Murchison Jr. wanted to buy the then-flagging Washington Redskins in 1958, but he backed out of the deal after Redskins owner George Preston Marshall changed the terms that were unfavorable to him. As a result, Murchison formed the Dallas Cowboys in 1960, and the most-well known rivalry in NFL history was born.
<ul><li> What's more, Murchison purchased the rights to the Redskins' fight song, "Hail to the Redskins". Murchison gave the song back to Marshall, in exchange for Marshall's vote that would allow the Cowboys to be formed (at the time, a unanimous vote among NFL owners was required for a new team to be formed, and Marshall was the lone holdout, due to him wanting to maintain the Redskins' fanbase in the Southern US).
</li></ul></li><li> This is the state of boxing with four "main" sanctioning bodies (five if you count the IBO): the WBO, IBF, WBC, and the WBA. This means that at any time there are (usually) four champions in any given weight class. Becoming "the" champ is damn near impossible because of a set of convoluted rules that pretty much disqualifies boxers from holding all the belts at the same time. This, compounded with all of them being notoriously corrupt and numerous other organizations springing up almost daily, effectively make belts worthless.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8z36v');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note8z36v" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8z36v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Only two boxers in the 2010s, Terence Crawford and Oleksandr Usyk, successfully unified all four belts. Crawford did it in the light-welterweight class in 2017, and Usyk in the cruiserweight class the following year. Less than two weeks after Crawford unified the light-welterweight belts, he gave up his IBF belt because he didn't plan to fight before that group's deadline to fight its top contender, and not long after that gave up his other belts and moved to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">more lucrative</a> welterweight class. Usyk gave up his cruiserweight belts in 2019 to move to the even more lucrative heavyweight class.</span>
</li><li> In March 1995, Tony George, head of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (home of the Indy 500), announced the formation of the Indy Racing League (IRL; now known as INDYCAR), ostensibly to make open-wheel racing in America less Euro-centric and give more direct control of the sport to track owners. Oh, and the majority of the drivers at the Indianapolis 500 (25 out of 33) would now have to be from the IRL. The existing sanctioning body, CART, responded with a blanket boycott of all IRL races and scheduling the new US 500 to run at the same time as Indy. The split remained for thirteen years before the sport was reunified under the banner of IRL and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndyCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndyCar">IndyCar Series</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">Ironically</a>, racing fans, confused and frustrated by the split, turned in droves to stock car racing and NASCAR.
</li><li> The American Basketball Association formed in 1967 to compete against the NBA, but was actually a long-term plan to merge its teams with the NBA, which happened (for some of them) in 1976.
</li><li> The founder and first president of the ABA went on to form the World Hockey Association in 1972, and was the most successful challenge to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalHockeyLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalHockeyLeague">NHL</a>'s dominance in North American hockey and helped bring down the NHL's reserve clause. The WHA administration refused to incorporate the reserve clause (which allowed a club to extend a player's contract by a year when it expired and do so indefinitely, effectively binding a player to one club for his entire career) and set a then-landmark $2.7 million salary for Bobby Hull. Though the league didn't survive the Seventies, four of its teams merged with the NHL.
</li><li> The NHL itself was the result of a long-running dispute in the predecessor National Hockey Association between Eddie Livingstone, principal owner of the Toronto Shamrocks and Toronto Blueshirts, and the other owners of the league (Montreal Canadiens, Montreal Wanderers, Ottawa Senators, and Quebec Bulldogs). The other owners realized the NHA's constitution meant they couldn't expel Livingstone, but they could vote to suspend the NHA (officially because too many of their players were overseas fighting in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>) and then form the National Hockey League where those owners could keep Livingstone out. Which is what they did in 1917.
</li><li> The NFL has been challenged by several rival leagues, among them the American Football League, the United States Football League, both versions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a>'s XFL, and the Alliance of American Football. Of these challengers, the AFL was successful enough that it eventually merged with the NFL without losing any teams, and led to the creation of the biggest event for the sport, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl">Super Bowl</a>. The others... not so much (the USFL was successful enough in a few areas that the NFL later added expansion teams in those places, but the first XFL was highly gimmick-driven and taken seriously by approximately nobody; the Alliance of American Football, while having tons of potential, crashed and burned due to legal issues; and the second XFL was an effective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/COVID19Pandemic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/COVID19Pandemic">COVID-19</a> casualty, though a group led by none other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson">Dwayne Johnson</a> bought the league out of bankruptcy, opening the door to a possible return).
<ul><li> The genesis of the American Football League in particular is a perfect example of this trope: In 1959, the National Football League had only twelve teams, had no interest in expansion and only one team - the then-Chicago Cardinals - was considered to be on the market. Texas oilman Lamar Hunt had a meeting with Cardinals general manager Walter Wolfner (husband of team owner Violet Bidwill) who basically blew Hunt off. Wolfner bragged that they had suitors from all over the country, mentioning groups from Denver, Houston and Minneapolis, so he really didn't need to deal with Hunt. As Hunt flew back to Dallas, he realized that if there were really that many parties trying to get into pro football, there was no reason they couldn't just start a new league. The eight-team AFL debuted a year later, and quickly became a league to rival the NFL. The documentary <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullColorFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullColorFootball">Full Color Football</a></em> has the story in greater detail.
</li></ul></li><li> Australian television magnate Kerry Packer attempted to buy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cricket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cricket">Cricket</a> broadcasting rights from the Australian Cricket Board in the 1970s, but they refused, so Packer formed World Series Cricket, signing many of the players from Australia, England and the West Indies.
</li><li> Similar to the Dallas Cowboys example, and also crossing over with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnVillain">Create Your Own Villain</a>, when the Cleveland Browns fired Coach Paul Brown, who the team is <em>named after,</em> he joined the new AFL and formed the cross-state Cincinnati Bengals, who not only are the Browns' second biggest rival behind the Pittsburgh Steelers, but also will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">never let Cleveland forget this</a> by playing their home games at <em>Paul Brown</em> Stadium. It should be noted that, at the time of the Bengals' inception, Brown knew the AFL/NFL merger was a done deal and that the ensuing league realignment meant his new team would likely be placed in the same division as Cleveland.
</li><li> When the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishFootyTeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishFootyTeams">English football team</a> Wimbledon F.C. decided to relocate to Milton Keynes in 2002, a lot of Wimbledon fans were rather upset. In response, they formed their own club, AFC Wimbledon. In less than a decade, the new club had made it into the Football League, and in 2014, they beat the relocated "Milton Keynes Dons" in a cup match. Then AFCW joined MK Dons in League One (the third level) in 2016, and in 2018, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThereWasMuchRejoicing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThereWasMuchRejoicing">there was much rejoicing</a> throughout England as MK Dons were relegated to League Two, meaning that in 2018&#150;19, AFCW would play at a higher level than MK Dons for the first time. Though that only lasted one season; MK returned to League One for 2019&#150;20, and both remain at that level in 2020&#150;21.
<ul><li> In 2005, a group of Manchester United fans unhappy about Malcolm Glazer's takeover founded their own club, FC United of Manchester. FC United are, as of 2015-16, in the sixth tier of the league.
</li><li> A much older and more prominent example: when Everton were first founded, they played their home matches at Anfield. In 1892, after a dispute over rent, Everton left to go play at Goodison Park instead and Anfield's owner, John Houlding, decided to make his own team. He thus founded Liverpool F.C. with some of his old Everton friends, and one of English football's fiercest rivalries was born. Other teams in Europe, such as Italy's Inter Milan and Spain's Real Betis, were founded in a similar way.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalBasketballAssociation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalBasketballAssociation">Pat Riley</a> spent five years as the head coach of the New York Knicks, building his team into a gritty, grind-it-out playoff powerhouse. Known for their physical play and rough fouls, they made it to the NBA Finals in 1994, where it took the full seven games before the Houston Rockets defeated them. That, along with several other heartbreaking losses, prompted Riley to step down as coach of the Knicks. Instead of retiring, however, he took the reins down at South Beach, where he became the head coach and team president of the Miami Heat. However, like the Paul Brown example above, Riley crossed it over with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnVillain">Create Your Own Villain</a>; the Knicks became the biggest reason as to why he couldn't win a championship in the late 90s, eliminating the Heat three straight years after making the Conference Finals against the Bulls. Unlike the Knicks, however, Riley stuck around, and although it took a while, he finally did achieve what he couldn't with New York - a championship to Miami.
</li><li> A very common way for new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NCAA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NCAA">NCAA</a> conferences to form, with several schools breaking away from one conference to start another. Both the Southeastern (1933) and Atlantic Coast (1953) conferences were created by large breakaways from the Southern Conference (and became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MorePopularSpinoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MorePopularSpinoff">More Popular Spinoffs</a>). The modern Pac-12 started after several schools were kicked out of the old Pacific Coast Conference (but eventually most of the remaining PCC members joined the new conference). Then there's this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveReality">Recursive Reality</a> situation: In 1938 several schools left the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference to start the Mountain States/Skyline Conference. In 1961, most of those schools joined with a few others to start the Western Athletic Conference. Then in 1999, eight WAC schools broke away to form the Mountain West Conference.
</li><li> Facing sponsor pullout, the J. League side Yokohama Fl&uuml;gels hastily arranged a merger with cross-town rival Yokohama Marinos in 1998 to form Yokohama F. Marinos. A significant portion of Fl&uuml;gels' fans, however, refused to change their allegiance to merged side and considered Fl&uuml;gels to have dissolved instead. What they did, then, was to fund a new club&mdash;Yokohama FC&mdash;to take over Fl&uuml;gels' place.

<h2>Politics</h2>
<ul><li> Finland. The duchy of Finland had been a part of the Swedish kingdom until 1809, when Russia conquered and annexed her after a war. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRussianRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRussianRevolution">The Russian Revolution</a> started and the Czar abdicated, a power vacuum was created in Finland. The bourgeoisie and the intelligentsiya wanted to stay with Russia; the nobility wanted to re-join Sweden. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">In the end,</a> Finland eventually declared herself an independent state 6th December 1917.
</li><li> This is notoriously commonplace with left-wing and socialist groups, who always seem to have trouble sticking together when disagreements arise. To wit: The Party for Socialism and Liberation, a major Marxist-Leninist organization in the United States, was split off from the Worker's World Party, and the Worker's World Party split off from the Socialist Workers Party, the Socialist Workers Party split off from the Communist Party USA, the Communist Party USA split off from the Socialist Party of America, and the Socialist Party of America split off from the Socialist Labor Party of America!
</li><li> In 1824, Andrew Jackson won the popular vote in the United States presidential election as one of four candidates running under the banner of the Democratic-Republican Party, but the Electoral College was split. The party elite in Congress ended up awarding the presidency to Jackson's rival, John Quincy Adams. In response, Jackson founded his own party, the modern Democratic party, and ran against Adams four years later, winning in a landslide.
<dl><dd><ul><li> And in response to <em>that</em>, other elements of the disintegrating Democratic-Republican Party formed the Whig Party in 1833 to oppose Jackson. 15 years later, the Whigs were split over the issue of slavery which caused some of the anti-slavery Whigs to start their own Free Soil Party. Then in 1854, with both of those parties failing, former Free Soilers and northern Whigs got together to have another go at starting their own party: the modern Republican Party.
</li><li> The Democratic party also split over the issue of slavery, resulting in the 1860 election (won by Abraham Lincoln) featuring four major presidential candidates, including two Democratic candidates and a "Constitutional Union" candidate. Unlike the Republican party, the Democratic party sort of healed their rift after the Civil War, only to split 80 years later over the issue of Civil Rights. However, the Dixiecrats - the Southern Democrats - rather than forming their own party, instead gradually took over the Republican party.
</li></ul></dd></dl></li><li> This trope is credited as one of the reasons that Libertarianism (in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanPoliticalSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanPoliticalSystem">American sense</a>) has so much trouble becoming a party with any real power. There are simply too many different groups that consider themselves Libertarian to ever organize.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> disliked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamHowardTaft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamHowardTaft">William Howard Taft</a> and the growing conservatism of the formerly moderate Republican party (and felt personally betrayed by his former protege Taft's role in that rightward shift), so after a failed attempt to unseat Taft as the Republican nominee (few states held primaries in that era, so party bosses had almost complete control over the nominating process and they were firmly in Taft's corner) he started his own progressive liberal party in 1912, known informally as the Bull Moose Party. As with all United States third parties, it failed and instead split the vote so the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WoodrowWilson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WoodrowWilson">Democrat</a> won.
<ul><li> That was Roosevelt's intention. He hated Taft's policies and would have rather seen a Democrat win than Taft get re-elected. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HangingSeparately" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HangingSeparately">So he created the new party to sabotage Taft</a>. And in the process he left Taft with the ignominy of being the only incumbent US president to finish <em>third place</em> in his reelection bid.
</li><li> Despite the failure of the Bull Moose movement, most of its adherents threw in their lot with the Democrats after Franklin Roosevelt - 5th cousin of Theodore - announced the New Deal policy platform in the 1930s.
</li></ul></li><li> The 13 British colonies in North America had a bit of a problem with the mother country's bad habit of forcing legislation (and taxation) on them without their permission (since it would be too much of a hassle to ship American politicians across the Atlantic to Parliament), so they decided to start their <em>own</em> independent government, with an eye towards fixing all the grievances they had with Britain. Britain of course took exception to that, the Americans took exception to their exception, the Americans won, and history was made.
<ul><li> And of course the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCivilWar">American Civil War</a> was a failed attempt by the rebellious southern states to form a new country due to fears that the country would restrict or ban Slavery (and a bunch of other, minor political and social tensions as well). The same conflict led to the creation of the state of West Virginia, when it turned out that those Virginians living in the Appalachians wanted nothing to do with the whole 'slavery' or 'secession' stuff and decided to secede from Virginia and rejoin the glorious 'murrikan motherland.
</li></ul></li><li> Even Al Qaeda <a class="urllink" href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ap-exclusive-rise-al-qaida-saharan-terrorist">is not immune to this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, with <a class="urllink" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/28/moktar-belmoktar-terroris_n_3349176.html">Moktar Belmoktar<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, a former disgruntled employee starting his own terrorist group after Al Qaeda wrote him a scathing letter accusing him of, among other things, failing to carry out a single operation, not filling out expense reports, not attending meetings <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">and not answering his phone when they called</a>.
</li><li> Political parties, especially those positioned far from the center, usually start out this way with some radical from a more "grounded" party feels their party sold out and breaks off from it. For example, every left wing organization or party in Sweden, be they democratic socialists, syndicalist or outright Stalinist descends from the left-to-center-left Social Democratic party in one way or the other.
<ul><li> Similarly, high profile members of far-right parties in the UK have a habit of suddenly deciding that the party is too moderate for their tastes and splitting off to form parties more in keeping with their personal ideals. Prominent examples include former British National Party members Paul Golding and Jayda Fransen, who split away to form Britain First, and would-be UKIP leader Annie-Marie Waters, who suffered a surprise defeat in the 2017 UKIP leadership election, and subsequently stormed out of the party and formed For Britain.
</li><li> A recent example from Canada: In September 2018, Conservative leadership runner-up Maxime Bernier, disgruntled with actual new party leader Andrew Scheer not being hard enough on immigration for his tastes, quit the Tories and founded the People's Party of Canada, a party with much the same views as the Conservatives but with a more libertarian, populist and, of course, anti-immigrant stance.
</li></ul></li><li> In the Philippines, the Liberal Party got its start in the 1940s as a splinter-off faction of the Nacionalista Party (virtually the only party in power at the time, as the country/semi-US-colony was essentially a one-party state). Disgruntled party members, chief among them Manuel Roxas (who would go on to be President in 1946), left and started their own party to challenge the Nacionalistas at the polls. Not that it really mattered party-wise, because the two parties differed very little in ideological leaning, and party-switching or "turncoatism" was rife&#151;a reality that still holds today under an ostensibly multiparty government. The Liberals in fact were the originators of the "start-your-own-party" trend regardless of ideology or beliefs.
</li></ul><p></p><h2>Education</h2>
<ul><li> This is how Cambridge University was formed. A bunch of students were kicked out of Oxford, made their way across the country, and started their own university.
<ul><li> This is also how University College London, the third university to be founded in England after Oxford and Cambridge, came into being. Unlike Oxford and Cambridge, it was entirely secular and allowed women in on an equal footing with men, inspired by the (then) radical philosophies of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham">Jeremy Bentham<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> The University of Bristol was genuinely founded by a man whose son failed to get into Oxford. The original 'college' is now the Physics Department.
</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h2>Clubs</h2>
<ul><li> A couple of the early 20th-century industrialists started their own golf clubs, university endowments, etc., because they kept getting shunned by old money families.
<ul><li> In the same way, New York City's grandest palazzo, the Metropolitan Club, was organized by J. P. Morgan in protest against not being admitted to some of the city's other exclusive private men's clubs. He showed <em>them</em>.
</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h2>Religion</h2>
<ul><li> Quite a few Christian sects got started because of this trope:
<ul><li> The Religious Society of Friends, better known as the Quakers, who formed their own sect of Christianity because its founder, George Fox, objected to the Anglicans' emphasis on ceremony.
</li><li> Martin Luther was excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church. So he started his own church! With beer! And wives for the clergy! <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch">And no corruption!</a>
</li><li> Henry VIII wanted to divorce his wife, Catherine of Aragon. When the Pope refused to annul Henry's current marriage, Henry formed his own church, the Church of England, installed himself as its head, and divorced her anyway.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10ewgt');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note10ewgt" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10ewgt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Also, Catherine had been his brother's widow, meaning by the convention of the time his father had needed a special papal ruling to allow him to marry her at all, making his annulment request a bit hypocritical.</span>
</li><li> The Baptist church in the United States in the 1800s favored abolition of slavery. The Southern Baptist church splits off in 1845 as an explicitly pro-slavery sect.
</li><li> The Free Methodist Church's name comes from their abolitionist roots. That, and their refusal to charge for seats.
</li><li> Christian humorist Adrian Plass, in one of his novels, mentions the concept of church groups splitting so often that some people are in danger of dissenting themselves right back to where they started...
</li><li> Mormon Fundamentalists are what happens when, deciding mainstream Mormons were wrong to abandon polygamy, hardcore religious nuts start their own. This came about, mind you, after Joseph Smith did the same thing to Christianity. (Although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mormonism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mormonism">Mormons</a> would disagree with labeling their church as reformed.)
</li><li> The Episcopal Church in the US went through this following the election of a gay divorced man as bishop of New Hampshire. This caused many conservative Episcopal parishes to separate themselves into the Anglican Church in North America. For the time being the Episcopal Church retains membership in the international Anglican Communion (though relations are strained) and the ACNA has not been granted full communion (although some churches within the Anglican Communion are in full communion with ACNA instead of the Episcopal Church).

</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h2>Arts</h2>
<ul><li> In the art world of the 1860s, the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_des_Refuses">Salon des Refuses<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was started in Paris by a group of artists, now referred to as the Impressionists, who were infuriated at being constantly rejected by the official Salon de Paris.
<ul><li> The Secession movement in Vienna, for much the same reasons.
</li></ul></li><li> The Metropolitan Opera Company was founded by a group of businessmen who were annoyed by being unable to obtain box seats at the Academy of Music.
</li></ul><p></p><h2>Technology</h2>
<ul><li> An early example in the technology world was a group of engineers known as the "Traitorous Eight" who worked under William Shockley, the inventor of the transistor. Irritated by Shockley's increasingly erratic behavior and iron-fistedness, the Traitorous Eight quit and formed Fairchild Semiconductor, which in turn spawned Intel.
<ul><li> Software, too, especially <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Half of the software listed on <a class="urllink" href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> would not exist without this trope, though it's usually spurred on by avoidance of restrictive licenses. Where religions have schisms, free/open-source software has "forks".
<ul><li> Granted, this trope is at the heart of FOSS software: according to their philosophy, anyone who thinks they <em>can</em> do better should be given the opportunity to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsSeeYouDoBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsSeeYouDoBetter">prove it</a>.
</li><li> In the BSD world, OpenBSD and DragonFly BSD owe their existence to the fact that their founders had disagreements related to the development of NetBSD and FreeBSD, respectively.
</li><li> Allegedly, one of the main reasons <em>Linux</em> came about was because Linus Torvalds was becoming increasingly frustrated with several of the design decisions that went into the design of <em>Minix</em>, a payware educational Unix distribution for personal computers, that he was forced to use at college. He then managed to get into a heated argument with the creator of the distribution while he was airing his greviences on usenet. After his pride was badly torn up by the creator and his fanboys, Linus decided to start his own, and the rest is history.
</li><li> Also, the main reason ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) was created was because the OSS (Open Sound System) team had announced that they were going to split their driver packages into two- a free package for the most common consumer cards and a paid-for package for the higher end prosumer and professional sound cards. The Linux developers, whose motto was to have Linux running on <em>everything</em>, were repulsed and thus started their own.
</li><li> As a side note, a different issue with OSS' drivers, namely lack of security, was what gotten the OpenBSD developers to create their own OSS-like set of drivers.
</li><li> When dying computing conglomerate and open-source champion Sun Microsystems got bought over by the database megacorp Oracle, Oracle proceeded to discontinue OpenSolaris several weeks later, barely hiding their greed and hinting that people who want to continue using Solaris will now be subjected to either a crippled free version called <em>Solaris Express</em>, or have to pay up for a full version, where previously OpenSolaris was completely feature-compatible with the paid Solaris system save for the lack of tech support. Thing is, the license for OpenSolaris allowed the last version produced before Oracle shut the gates to the source code to remain free. The biggest contributors took the last version of the OS and forked, and <em>illumos</em> was born. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11xl4a');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note11xl4a" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11xl4a');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is also a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnVillain">Create Your Own Villain</a>, as the team originally had no plans to fork until Oracle decided to give them the finger.</span>
</li><li> At the same time as it screwed the OpenSolaris community, Oracle's behavior stifled the development of OpenOffice. Many of their developers were laid off or left on their own accord, they went on to form The Document Foundation and fork OpenOffice into LibreOffice. Oracle did eventually just give OpenOffice away to the Apache Foundation, but that only created a bitter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomRivalry">Fandom Rivalry</a> as a result.
</li><li> And to show that things come in the power of three, Oracle buying up Sun also gave them control of the MySQL database engine, which they then proceed to cripple as to prevent the free option from competing fairly against their flagship product. Again, many devs left and forked the last Sun-produced version, this time into MariaDB.
</li><li> Another high-profile fork in the open-source community was the FFMPEG/LibAV schism in the software project that underlies nearly all video-related open source applications. Emerging from political turmoil within the FFMPEG project, the effects of the split the sent shockwaves through the broader open-source community, particularly Linux users, due to Ubuntu (one of the most popular distributions) initially siding with Libav. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12kr6y');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note12kr6y" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12kr6y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(see <a class="urllink" href="http://blog.pkh.me/p/13-the-ffmpeg-libav-situation.html">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for further commentary, though it's a bit old).</span> More than half a decade later, the two projects are still developed separately, with Libav pointedly ignoring FFMPEG's existence and FFMPEG continuing to expend effort to merge Libav's improvements back into itself in addition to doing its own development. The turmoil surrounding the issue has ceased, however, since most of the projects that initially sided with Libav have since gone back to FFMPEG.

NeXT was basically made up of every stereotype about Apple turned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. Its products generated a lot of buzz for their ease-of-use, technical sophistication, and striking aesthetic designs, but they were also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper">ludicrously expensive</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBackwardsCompatibilityInTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBackwardsCompatibilityInTheFuture">not compatible with any existing products</a> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13lwi6');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note13lwi6" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13lwi6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Bill Gates famously quipped "NeXT has an interesting feature called incompatibility"</span>.

Ironically, NeXT's legacy would be salvaged when Apple purchased them in 1997 in order to use their NeXTSTEP operating system as the basis for what became Mac OS X, bringing Jobs back to Apple in the process. Though at first he only held the position of "advisor", he quickly rose to the position of CEO, which he held until shortly before his death in 2011.

<ul><li> Adidas and Puma, two rival sport shoe companies, began as one company founded by brothers Adolf "Adi" Dassler and Rudolf Dassler. After the two had a violent fall out in 1948, the original company folded, with Adi founding Adidas and Rudi founding Puma. Their home town of Herzogenaurach became fiercely divided between the two brands, even the two football clubs; one was sponsored by Adidas, the other by Puma. The hatchet was <em>finally</em> buried in the late 2000's with a Peace One Day-sponsored soccer match, however Adidas and Puma remain independent concerns. Meanwhile, the brothers remained bitter rivals to their deaths (events like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicianVersusPerformer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicianVersusPerformer">the original shoemakers going with Adi and the original management going with Rudi</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">each brother trying to denounce the other as a Nazi to the Americans after WWII</a> certainly didn't help), and while they're now buried at the same graveyard, their graves are as far away from each other as possible.

</li></ul><p></p><h2>Business</h2>
<ul><li> Ferrari is involved in <em>three</em> examples:
<ul><li> First, inter-company politics in the early sixties led a group of engineers to jump ship and form their own company, ATS. Unfortunately, their first effort came across as lackluster and they folded after a couple of years. However, they were revived in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>.
</li><li> In the mid-sixties, Ferruccio Lamborghini, president of what was then primarily a tractor manufacturer, came to Enzo Ferrari to complain that his recently purchased Ferrari had a faulty clutch. He also explained that he had tried the clutch from one of his own tractors in the car and it worked fine. A fierce argument followed, and Lamborghini looked through his car some more and decided that his company already had the ability to make most of the necessary components for a luxury automobile. The rivalry continues to this day.
</li><li> In 1963, Ferrari was desperate to secure funding, and the company entered serious talks with Ford about purchasing the company. When Enzo Ferrari learned that the Americans wouldn't allow him to keep control of the racing team, he broke off the negotiations. Ford (and Henry Ford Jr. in particular) was so incensed that they designed the GT40 specifically to challenge Ferrari's record in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The GT40 went on to win Le Mans four times in a row. This event was dramatized by the 2019 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FordvFerrari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FordvFerrari">Ford v Ferrari</a></em>.

</li><li> Dave Thomas (the restaurateur, not the actor) made a name for himself as assistant to Colonel Harland Sanders. Had he stayed in line, Thomas would probably end up inheriting the reins of KFC, but due to personal disagreements with the good Colonel, Thomas struck out on his own and founded his own restaurant chain, which he named after his daughter Wendy.
</li><li> When Brazilian movie magazine SET was sold to a different publisher, one of the editors went to start its own publication, <em>Preview</em>.

</li><li> Boyd Coddington's hot rod shop, Hot Rods by Boyd, faced bankruptcy in 1998. So, president Chip Foose left to form his own company, Foose Design. The two companies endured a fierce rivalry right up until Boyd Coddington's death ten years later.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> as it exists today came about from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney">Walt Disney</a> losing his contract with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Universal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Universal">Universal</a> in 1928. The studio later founded its own distribution company Buena Vista in 1953 after disagreements with its previous distributor RKO Radio Pictures.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarmanAndIsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarmanAndIsing">Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising</a> were two Disney animators who stayed with Universal after Walt Disney left in 1928, and they in turn left Universal in 1929 to form their own studio. In 1933 they teamed up with producer Leon Schlesinger, who got them a contract with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a> to distribute their new <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> series. Then in 1934 they left that studio and went to work for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MGM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MGM">MGM</a>.
</li><li> Charles Mintz, Disney's one-time distributor and the man most responsible for causing Walt to leave Universal in 1928, was himself dropped by Universal in 1929. His response was to fully take over his wife Margaret Winkler's company the Winkler Studio (which he had been <em>de facto</em> running since 1924), renaming it the Mintz Studio and signing a deal with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColumbiaPictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColumbiaPictures">Columbia Pictures</a> to distribute cartoons. Mintz eventually became indebted to Columbia and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColumbiaCartoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColumbiaCartoons">lost his studio to them in 1939</a>, passing away one year later.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UbIwerks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UbIwerks">Ub Iwerks</a> left Disney in 1930 to create a new studio with Disney's former distributor Pat Powers. Although he pioneered many new animation techniques in his shorts, Iwerks' studio was never profitable and he was dropped by Powers in 1936. After his studio went bankrupt a year later Iwerks retired from animation altogether, opting instead to rejoin Disney in 1940 as the head of their newly-formed research and special effects department.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArtBabbitt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArtBabbitt">Art Babbitt</a> left Disney as a result of him leading the 1941 studio animator's strike (and after a lawsuit he filed against them in 1947) and created <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColumbiaCartoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColumbiaCartoons">UPA</a> in 1948, which pioneered the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedAnimation">Limited Animation</a> technique that was prevalent during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDarkAgeOfAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDarkAgeOfAnimation">The Dark Age of Animation</a>. After decades of bad blood he buried the hatchet with Disney shortly before his death in 1992, and was named a Disney Legend in 2007.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonBluth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonBluth">Don Bluth</a> was a Disney animator who was unhappy with the mediocre animated films that the studio was churning out after the death of Walt Disney. He and twelve other animators left Disney in 1979 to form their own animation studio, with the intention of replacing Disney or at the very least providing Disney with some genuine competition to force them to make better movies. The studio ended up succeeding on both fronts: it replaced Disney as the premier American animation studio in the 1980s <em>and</em> it forced Disney to step up their game... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">but as consequence</a> Disney regained its powerhouse status in the 1990s and Bluth couldn't keep up, leading to the closure of his original studio and then later his second studio.

Lasseter's ad department turned into a short film department after buyers became interested in seeing how extensively the software could be used, and these shorts caught the attention of Jeffrey Katzenberg (who had replaced Miller as Disney's studio head in the mid-1980s). He signed the studio (renamed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar">Pixar</a>) to create a series of computer animated films in the early 1990s, and the rest is history.

Unlike Don Bluth his studio is still around today, but it was never anywhere near as successful as Bluth's was.

Disney shuttered and sold Miramax in 2010, while The Weinstein Company was thrown into bankruptcy in 2017 following the firing and arrest of Harvey over sexual abuse allegations that spanned decades.
</li><li> Jeffrey Katzenberg left Disney in 1994 after arguments with then-CEO Michael Eisner, and went on to co-found <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DreamWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DreamWorks">DreamWorks SKG</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> and David Geffen.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrionPictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrionPictures">Orion Pictures</a> was created by former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UnitedArtists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UnitedArtists">United Artists</a> executives who were fed up with its then-owner Transamerica's influence on the company.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FactionParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FactionParadox">Faction Paradox</a> started out as characters in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DoctorWhoExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DoctorWhoExpandedUniverse">Doctor Who Expanded Universe</a>, specifically the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EighthDoctorAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EighthDoctorAdventures">Eighth Doctor Adventures</a>.

</li><li> A (possibly apocryphal) story has it that the founder of Netflix did so after his outrage over a $40 Blockbuster late fee inspired him to start his own video rental service. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfCardsUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfCardsUS">With blackjack!</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OrangeIsTheNewBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OrangeIsTheNewBlack">And hookers!</a>
</li><li> After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MGM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MGM">MGM</a> shut down its animation division in the 1950s, animators William Hanna and Joseph Barbara formed their own animation studio, appropriately titled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera">Hanna-Barbera</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> Netflix's popularity has encouraged major studios like Disney and Warner Bros to start their own streaming services rather than license their content to Netflix or other services like Hulu or Amazon Prime.
</li><li> This was essentially what led to the creation of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dassault_Rafale">Dassault Rafale<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> - France was originally collaborating with the UK, Germany, Italy and Spain on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/RealLife/CoolPlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/RealLife/CoolPlane">Eurofighter project</a>, but they wanted to make a carrier-capable version; when it became clear that none of the other countries wanted to bother with one, France withdrew to pursue their own project. Similar to many other examples of this trope, the Rafale actually entered service before the Eurofighter.
</li><li> In the mid-70s, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas">George Lucas</a> wanted to do a feature-film version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FlashGordon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FlashGordon">Flash Gordon</a></em>, so he set out to acquire its rights. But when he was outbid by Dino DeLaurentiis, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">he decided to create his own space opera</a>.
<ul><li> This is a double example. After deciding to create his own movie, Lucas had a <em>very</em> grand image for the special effects (poor effects being one of the things keeping sci-fi mostly confined to B-movies). When he couldn't find anyone who made the grade, he got together some college buddies and revolutionized special effects with his own company. They're still around today- you probably know them as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IndustrialLightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IndustrialLightAndMagic">Industrial Light and Magic</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> This is effectively the story behind the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>: after dealing with flops made by other studios with their characters and only getting a small percentage of the profits the ones that were hits made, Marvel decided to make <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan">Iron Man</a></em> on their own, and the rest is history. Possibly a subversion since Marvel was later bought by Disney (see above for the numerous studios founded by ex-Disney employees), but Disney has let the MCU function fairly independently.
</li><li> The ice cream chain KaleidoScoops was started in 1999 by a bunch of Baskin-Robbins owners who had their franchises terminated due to underperformance.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasiOka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasiOka">Masi Oka</a> decided he wanted to break into the game industry, since he enjoyed playing games and wanted to make some, but the studios he approached with his ideas turned him down. So, he asked a bunch of college kids about to graduate if they wanted to come work for him,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14e7gi');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note14e7gi" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14e7gi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">One imagines their response was somewhere along the lines of, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">"Is the sky blue?"</a></span> and that's how <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MobiusDigital" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MobiusDigital">Mobius Digital</a> got started.
</li><li> When the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic">cult</a> online game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em> was shut down <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">for some reason</a> and NC Soft seemed unwilling to sell it, fans immediately considered developing a replacement, which became <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfTitans">City of Titans</a></em>. Less than three months later, even before the original game's shutdown had been completed, founding member Golden Girl started <em>another</em> project, <em>Heroes and Villains</em>, over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeDifferences" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeDifferences">Creative Differences</a>. <em>City of Titans</em> will be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Sequel</a> (as in, revamping the game mechanics to some extent), while <em>Heroes and Villains</em> is apparently supposed to be <em>City of Heroes</em> with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialNumbersFiledOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialNumbersFiledOff">Serial Numbers Filed Off</a>.
</li><li> This is how the telephone industry got started. When Alexander Graham Bell's initial design was rejected by Western Union, then the leading distributor of telegraph services, he took the design to Joseph Henry, who saw its potential. Western Union tried to cram their patent into the office before Bell did, but eventually gave up, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn">believing the telephone to be a minor threat to their telegraph monopoly that would fizzle out soon.</a> They ended up shooting themselves in the foot with this decision, as in only 3 years, there were 30,000 sets worldwide, and 2 million sets by 1900. Thus, Western Union ended up being the one to fizzle out (save for use as a money-wiring system) and Bell's telephone company is still around to this day. You might have heard of them: a little company named AT&amp;T.
</li><li> Animation studio Format Films was founded by former employees of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColumbiaCartoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColumbiaCartoons">UPA</a>, all of whom left when UPA was sold to businessman Henry Saperstein.

</li><li> According to some of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Charles M.

</li><li> This is how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ImageComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ImageComics">Image Comics</a> came into being. Several artists who worked on most of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a>'s top-selling properties in the late 80's to early 90's, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToddMcFarlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToddMcFarlane">Todd McFarlane</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobLiefeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobLiefeld">Rob Liefeld</a>, and <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarcSilvestri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarcSilvestri">Marc Silvestri</a>, were dissatisfied with how poorly they were treated, in particular not owning any of the properties they created while working under Marvel. In 1992, they all left Marvel to form their own company: Image Comics. Image itself would not own anything other than its name and logo, and published the comics while the creators retained ownership, an arrangement completely unheard of at the time. Image single-handedly revolutionized the comics industry, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Youngblood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Youngblood">Youngblood</a>'s first issue being the all-time best selling independent comic at the time of its release. At the height of its success, Image actually beat out D.C. in sales, forcing them to take drastic measures like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDeathOfSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDeathOfSuperman">killing off Superman</a> (albeit temporarily) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Knightfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Knightfall">crippling Batman</a> in order to keep up with them.

<ul><li> Likewise, Musk spent time keeping up on the latest efforts in the automotive industry towards the wide scale development and production of electric cards, and repeatedly urged the company AC Propulsion to pursue broader development of its tzero prototype - something the company utterly refused to do. Shortly thereafter, Musk would co-found Tesla Motors, which became Tesla Inc. once it expanded into solar energy and large-capacity batteries.
</li></ul></li><li> This can occur sometimes in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Speedrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Speedrun">Speedruning</a> communities when new glitches or techniques are discovered that radically alter how the speedrun of a game plays. Either the pre-existing categories accept the new technique, which prompts those opposed to it to create a new category that bans it to preserve the old style of play, or the pre-existing categories ban the new technique, which results in new categories that allowing it in order to to explore what new kinds of metagame develops around the technique. The result of this is that the leaderboards for some games can several tabs on sites like speedrun.com.
</li><li> In Malaysia, Chatime attempted wrest control of the stores from the franchisee of the time in 2017 due to usage of ingredients that are from suppliers instead of from Chatime themselves, as well as the franchisee not paying the royalties in licensing for the rights to use the name. The franchisee's response? Immediately cutting ties and rebranding to Tealive. Although Chatime did try taking the franchisee to court (they lost the case in Malaysia, although they tried again in Singapore and the battle is ongoing). Chatime opened their own stores in Malaysia a year later in 2018, also making this a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnVillain">Create Your Own Villain</a>.
</li><li> Some of the biggest names in roller coaster manufacturing today are spinoffs from other companies.
<ul><li> Bolliger &amp; Mabillard have designed over 117 roller coasters around the world. The company's founders, Walter Bolliger and Claude Mabillard, originally began as engineers at Giovanola, a contractor to roller coaster manufacturer Intamin. During their time at Giovanola, they helped design the company's first stand-up roller coaster, Shockwave at Six Flags Magic Mountain.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note19fhxs');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note19fhxs" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note19fhxs');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Later the defunct Batman The Escape at the defunct Six Flags Astroworld</span> They also worked on other projects, such as Z-Force at Six Flags Great America.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note20xdzo');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note20xdzo" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note20xdzo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which was the only ever "space dive coaster" built. It ran at Six Flags Great America until 1987, then as part of a ride rotation program Six Flags implemented at the time, rotated to Six Flags over Georgia for three years, then ended up at Six Flags Magic Mountain from 1993 until its demolition in 2006</span> In 1987, a change of management at Giovanola led Bolliger and Mabillard to leave and start their own firm, originally comprised of just themselves and two draftsmen.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note21j0il');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note21j0il" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note21j0il');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Giovanola continued to use the two engineers' box track design, which is seen on their two hypercoasters, Goliath at Six Flags Magic Mountain and Titan at Six Flags Over Texas</span> This was all they were made of when they built their first roller coaster, Iron Wolf at Six Flags Great America, in 1990.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note228s7a');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note228s7a" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note228s7a');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Now converted into a floorless coaster called Firebird at Six Flags America</span> In 1992, they built their first inverted coaster, Batman: The Ride at Six Flags Great America, and from there on, the rest is history.
</li><li> Great Coasters International, one of the leading names in wooden roller coasters in the 21st century, was founded by Mike Boodley, a designer at the 1990s wooden roller coaster construction firm of Custom Coasters International.
<ul><li> Custom Coasters International themselves were more or less the successors to the Dinn Corporation, on account of their founder being the two children of Dinn Corp.'s founder Charles Dinn. When CCI went bankrupt and liquidated in 2002, most of their designers stuck together to constitute a new firm called The Gravity Group, best known for their construction of The Voyage at Holiday World (the world's second longest wooden roller coaster behind only The Beast at Kings Island).
