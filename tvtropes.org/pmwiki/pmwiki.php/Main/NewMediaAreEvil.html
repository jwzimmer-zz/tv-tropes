Typically, this is a fringe phenomenon, and political and religious radicals will be bewailing the development while the media just reports on it.
</p><p>At other times, though, the negative press goes far beyond basic opinions and phenomena that we can document on camera. Speculation goes on that devious things are afoot. When this goes too far, a reporter is at risk of spouting "New media are evil!" Otherwise-rational people faced with uncertainty about what the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMedia">New Media</a> is actually like decide that &#151; just to be safe or to grab some attention &#151; they should go with the most inflammatory, headline-grabbing description they can come up with.
</p><p>The motivation to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Demonization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Demonization">demonize</a> a medium can go much deeper than the desire of the media itself to make headlines. In our giant, pan-corporate world, there's a good chance that some news outlets are owned by a guy who owns a major recording label. All of a sudden HQ's interest in stories about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalPiracyIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalPiracyIsEvil">devious pirating activities</a> becomes quite noticeable. To an audience generally uninformed about what the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMedia">New Media</a> is like to begin with, whether or not the story is true is irrelevant: the ring of truth is what becomes important.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Bear in mind that the impression given can largely be due to ignorance, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyBebopAtHisComputer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyBebopAtHisComputer">Cowboy BeBop at His Computer</a> misstep taken by someone who is already predisposed to distrust this "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a>" character in the first place.
</p><p>Take the Internet as an example; though it has come to dominate our lives today, it had a much greater mystique in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> when it first became mainstream. People taking up professions in the media industry as a career and most of the people involved today <em>still</em> don't have a full grasp on what the Internet is, so when the assumption is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsASmallNetAfterAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsASmallNetAfterAll">It's a Small Net After All</a>, all of a sudden every little instance of graphic pornography or 4chan vandalism ends up speaking for the Internet as a whole. New Media Are Evil decreases a great deal once the industry and society have adjusted to major technological advances and sees them as the norm. In other words, when the Medium stops being New, it stops being Evil.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>This is by no means limited to the Internet, although the sheer <em>density</em> of information we receive today can make it seem that way. Almost every new medium of communication or expression that has appeared since the dawn of history has been accompanied by doomsayers and critics who have confidently predicted that it would bring about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a> by weakening the brain or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrStrangelove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrStrangelove">polluting our precious bodily fluids</a>.
</p><p>The same thing has happened to basically every type of media in history, making this trope as old as mankind itself. Writing itself was hugely suspicious for example, as people feared that it would cripple the ability to memorise things, as this was now no longer needed as everything could be written down.
</p><p>Sometimes the doomsaying has a kernel of truth. New media do change old media, sometimes for a net loss of quality in art or information. Most often, though, the new medium allows a new freedom from the old medium that makes for more opportunity. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Older Than They Think</a>, as you can see from the very first examples.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ancient Times&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> According to accounts recorded by his student <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Plato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Plato">Plato</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Socrates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Socrates">Socrates</a> was hostile toward <em>writing</em> (which, while not exactly <em>new</em> in his time, was still the latest medium to come down the pike). Essentially, Socrates claimed that putting an idea down in written form "killed" it by depriving it of a mind in which to "live", making it worthless. His argument can be found in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.units.muohio.edu/technologyandhumanities/plato.htm">a dialogue<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> as... written in <em>The Phaedrus</em> (written by Plato, we should note; Socrates left no texts). This, of course, makes this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>.
</li><li> Besides that, Plato himself, in his specifications for the perfect state, included censorship of <em>poetry</em> in case it introduced subversive ideas.
</li><li> Something similar, though not <em>quite</em> as old: The Jewish Torah, according to tradition, has two parts to it, the Written Torah and the Oral Torah. The Written Torah makes up the first five books of what we know as the Tanach, Hebrew Scriptures, or Old Testament, whereas the Oral Torah eventually became the Mishnah and Talmud. For many centuries there was a strong directive to keep the oral Torah... well, oral. The point was that people were meant to memorize, discuss, and generally learn it out loud, and so keep it on the tip of their tongue. Writing was well and good for the general tenets, but not the specific details. However, it was later recognized that, what with exile, massacres, and the contemporary Roman Empire systematically hunting down all ordained rabbis (who, as their final exam, had to know the entire oral Torah letter-perfect) the whole memorization thing wasn't going very well, so the Mishnah (and later, its expansion the Talmud) was formalized in writing in around 200 AD.
</li><li> An Egyptian Pharaoh protested that the ability to write things down would inevitably result in his subjects' memories atrophying from disuse.
</li><li> Early Christians also tried to resist the introduction of punctuation and <em>spaces between words</em> into the Bible, because they thought that not having to parse words and sentences in your head made reading <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsEasySoItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsEasySoItSucks">too easy</a>. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note09nyf');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note09nyf" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note09nyf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Ancient Greek was written without spaces and punctuation, instead using the word "KAI", meaning "and", to indicate breaks in thought.</span>
</li><li> Solon was very displeased upon seeing the formerly all chorus Athenian Theater get actors added to it. He even asked the first actor if he's not ashamed of lying in front of so many people. Sometime later, he made a theater reference upon seeing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Peisistratos</a> pulling off a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit">Wounded Gazelle Gambit</a>.
</li><li> In <em>The Gallic Wars</em> Caesar wrote about one Germanic tribe that despised writing, on the belief that writing makes people (and specifically their memory) lazy.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medieval Europe&nbsp;</div><div id="folder1" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Some medieval Catholic theologians railed against the printing press, declaring it a creation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">the devil</a>, mostly because, as it grew widespread, its most popular uses both undercut the Church's authority: the mass production of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a> in the local language instead of Latin (which broke the Church's monopoly on interpretation of Scripture), and the distribution of the works of Luther and other Protestant reformers (which threatened the Church, period).
<ul><li> It is interesting to note that the reasons they gave for their opposition to the printing press was its efficiency &mdash; it could produce almost perfect copies of any given work... And everyone knows that since perfection isn't human, it must be the devil who's making it possible. (Which of course is theologically silly even if you accept the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">Insane Troll Logic</a> because the devil isn't perfect either. If the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">Insane Troll Logic</a> is sound, it must be God who made the printing press.)
</li></ul></li><li> It may come as a surprise, but European musical polyphony is a relatively recent invention, dating back only to the middle ages. It was, of course, immediately viewed by some as fundamentally immoral (because it made it impossible to understand the lyrics), and on those grounds, Pope John XXII banned polyphonic music in 1322 &mdash; by some accounts simply from liturgical use, by other accounts entirely. Later, after it stopped being new, another pope overturned the ban.
<ul><li> Of course, it helped having music introduced by de Palestrina and others which was both polyphonic and comprehensible.
</li></ul></li><li> Around the 13th century, Chess was considered a game of the devil, and forks were a devil's instrument. The fork argument makes some sort of sense; it looks like a pitchfork, and the devil loves those. But chess? Some also believed that it encouraged gambling and were offended that it allowed commoners to kill kings.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1xrlk');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1xrlk" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1xrlk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Allegedly, that's the reason even today, chess only allows forcing the king into surrender.</span>
<ul><li> It contains forks.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2bfx8');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2bfx8" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2bfx8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Those not familiar with chess terminology, moving a piece so it threatens two of the opponent's pieces in such a way they are forced to save only one and likely sacrifice the other is called "forking".</span>
</li><li> The idea that chess encouraged gambling became such a prevalent thought because people used dice to make sure the game went faster, the church found gambling to be a devil's thing.
<ul><li> According to some sources, dice wer used to determine who makes the next move, making the game luck based, but the familiar no-randomness form was fully acceptable.
</li></ul></li><li> In 1254, King Louis IX (the holy one) forbade his siblings to play the game of chess.
</li><li> The promotion was also seen as controversial because it allowed every pawn to be promoted into a queen. Since the queen was the king's wife it would mean that a king could have more than one wife and the idea of even someone being able to have more than one wife was considered to be a perverted thought at the time as people were firmly rooted into Christian faith.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note39jlf');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note39jlf" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note39jlf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In its Persian root the queen is a minister. Thus, the pawn gets a promotion. Similarly, bishops originally were war elephants, but that's another story.</span>
</li><li> It also came to Europe from Persia&mdash;a Muslim country. (Check Mate is from Sha-Mat, Persian for "the king is dead.")
</li><li> The fact that the Queen is the most powerful piece was also controversial in some cultures for being unfeminine or emasculating the King. Alternate, gender-neutral titles like "the King's advisor" were used for the piece until the 15th century (see note about Persia, above).

<ul><li> The moral panic against reading novels has been around for centuries before being replaced by newer media. One of the earliest examples is a central plot point in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote">Don Quixote</a>, where the main character goes mad from reading too much chivalry novels, and believes he is a knight himself. During this time, it was believed reading could cause gout, catarrhs, wasting, indigestion, colick, crudities, vertigo, consumption, and wind (according to dr. Robert Burton).

<ul><li> The word "novel", meaning a story, comes from the older meaning of "something new and unfamiliar". Before the 1600 people publishing fiction tried to dress up embellished legends as true history (e.g. the legends of King Arthur and Robin Hood) or obvious and deliberate allegory (e.g. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Utopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Utopia">Utopia</a>), but improvements in literacy, trade, and communications created a market for entertaining fictional stories set in the present day. In England during the 18th-century novel-reading became widespread, with many novels being specifically targeted at women, and this triggered a <a class="urllink" href="http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/49661">slow-motion moral panic<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that lasted for much of the century.

<ul><li> As the telegraph began to allow rapid communication across the globe, some newspaper editors complained that it was destroying the art of journalistic writing. Instead of spending days or weeks on a story, reporters had to write quickly while the news was still new.
</li><li> The invention of the telephone not only prompted screeds bemoaning the impending death of literacy (because no one would need to write letters anymore), it also prompted widespread panic among law enforcement agencies, who realized that it allowed criminal gangs to conspire and plan crimes <em>without having to meet in person, from the privacy of their own homes</em>. According to some accounts, there were actually a few abortive attempts to outlaw the telephone for this reason (sound familiar?); instead, cooler minds prevailed, and wiretapping was developed instead.
<ul><li> "The Hacker Crackdown", by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceSterling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceSterling">Bruce Sterling</a>, goes into great detail about turn-of-the-century anxieties about what the telephone meant for society and draws a parallel with the early online networks.
</li><li> In the film <em>Kinsey</em>, Alfred Kinsey, Sr preaches that it promotes lust, allowing a girl to hear the voice of her suitor on the pillow next to her. Or, of course, phone sex.
</li></ul></li><li> Piano rolls &#151; long scroll-like rolls of paper coded with holes in them for use in player pianos &#151; were the first medium for cheaply making mass-produced "recordings" of music. At the time they were invented, the music industry was composed solely of publishers of sheet music. Predictably, these publishers saw the sales of pre-recorded performances as a major threat to their income, and lobbied the Congress (Parliament/Senate) of the American Union to not only ban piano rolls and player pianos, but to pass a law requiring any new system for music reproduction be subject to a veto from a collective association made up of all the music publishers. Congress didn't give in to their demands and instead created the "mechanical license" system. But not before the 19th-century equivalent of the RIAA trotted <em>John Phillip Sousa</em> before Congress to declare apocalyptically:
<div class="indent">These talking machines are going to ruin the artistic development of music in this country. When I was a boy...in front of every house in the summer evenings, you would find young people together singing the songs of the day or old songs. Today you hear these infernal machines going night and day. We will not have a vocal chord left. The vocal chord will be eliminated by a process of evolution, as was the tail of man when he came from the ape.
</div></li><li> Not long after Piano rolls came the phonograph, which could record any sound, not just piano music. The musical establishment predictably threw an even bigger fit, fearing that recorded music would drive live musicians to extinction and deny them proper compensation for their work. No one, apparently, realized that musicians would still be needed to record the music, and would become even more in demand as records allowed them to sell their music to more people than ever before.
</li><li> Supposedly, there was an initiative in Congress during the early 1900s to ban jazz music because it was "a bad influence".
<ul><li> In Belgium there was, oddly enough, no moral panic against it &#151; jazz was actually embraced. This was probably due to the fact that Belgium had barely had any native culture of its own at that point (most popular Belgian music that was not jazz was foreign, usually French for the Walloons and Dutch for the Flemish) and the fact that a few very important jazz revolutions occurred on Belgian soil (such as the invention of the saxophone). The Belgian government of the time was eager to fund anything that was even the slightest bit nationalistic.
</li></ul></li><li> Radio: It didn't matter that some European governments strictly regulated their own radio stations (the Irish government banned jazz, with a ludicrously broad definition of what "jazz" was) when Radio Luxembourg could broadcast sinful music all across Europe. In hindsight, you only have to bear in mind that the RTL group nowadays calls itself as the biggest mass media outlet in entire Europe to know that all that sinful music made them have lots of fame and money long before they expanded their business to television.
<ul><li> Also, early BBC announcers couldn't read out the result of sports events until about 7 AM in order not to hurt sales of evening newspapers.
</li><li> The idea that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonWelles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonWelles">Orson Welles</a>' version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheWarOfTheWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheWarOfTheWorlds">The War of the Worlds</a></em> genuinely caused panic appears to be a rumour made up by newspapers to discredit radio.
</li></ul></li><li> Certain genres of novels were blamed for corrupting the youth &#151; e.g., suggesting to young women that eloping with mysterious strangers was a good idea.
</li><li> This era also produced the most spectacular aversion of this trope, formulated by Wolfgang Riepl in his 1913 work <em>Das Nachrichtenwesen des Altertums mit besonderer R&uuml;cksicht auf die R&ouml;mer</em>. Known as Riepl's Law, it states that:
<div class="indent"><em><strong>New, further developed types of media never replace the existing modes of media and their usage patterns. Instead, a convergence takes place in their field, leading to a different way and field of use for these older forms.</strong></em>
</div></li><li> The notion that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball">Pinball</a> games were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">entirely based on luck</a> led to many cities banning them around the middle of the 20th century, on the grounds that they led to delinquency and gambling. A ban in New York City stood for over thirty years and was only lifted when writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerSharpe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerSharpe">Roger Sharpe</a> appeared in court and gave a demonstration of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">precise aiming skills.</a>

It was feared that the private, secure communication it offered would lead to the collapse of morality in women, as they could get into "clandestine correspondence with unprincipled men" and turn into whores. The last name of the British postal system's creator, Anthony Trollope (who himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">got caught up in this moral panic</a>), is still recognized as an old-timey synonym for "prostitute".

Needless to say, this did not endear the company to many segregationists. Their mail-order competitor Montgomery Ward (which only took cash and didn't let people buy on credit, and thus catered to middle-class white customers) paid people to spread rumors that Richard Sears and Alvah Roebuck were either black or mixed-race in order to discredit them, and many general stores would refuse to sell stamps to black people to let them buy the Sears, Roebuck catalog &mdash; leading the company to put instructions in the catalog on how to ask the post office for it directly.

One (probably tongue-in-cheek) example can be found in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanFreberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanFreberg">Stan Freberg</a>'s 1957 song <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvBiufbKdfE">"Tele-Vee-Shun"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
<ul><li> Hollywood's reaction to television was a panic attack, all but blaming TV for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FallOfTheStudioSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FallOfTheStudioSystem">Fall of the Studio System</a> &mdash; something that had been in progress for years due to mismanagement. After the US government won a huge antitrust suit against the studios in 1948, the major studios dumped huge amounts of their libraries to TV syndication companies, deciding they were of little value otherwise (the VCR was still thirty years away). Worse yet, one of the now-liberated theater chains, United Paramount Theaters, merged with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC">ABC</a> in 1953. Its parent company <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Paramount" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Paramount">Paramount</a> smarted over all of this for years, and even had a hand in (trying to) kill the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DuMont" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DuMont">DuMont</a> network &mdash; which just ended up creating Metromedia, the precursor to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FOX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FOX">FOX</a>. Anyway, by the 1960s, all of the majors, even once-mighty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MGM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MGM">MGM</a>, had TV production facilities, except Paramount. They were finally forced into it by new owners Gulf + Western in 1968 after G + W bought <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DesiluStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DesiluStudios">Desilu Studios</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucilleBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucilleBall">Lucille Ball</a> (the minors never had a problem with TV, since they didn't own theaters, and Columbia Pictures in particular jumped in head-first way back in 1951).
</li><li> In a 1950s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a></em> film serial, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a> has a television station.
</li><li> FCC chairman Newton Minow's 1961 <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasteland_Speech">"Vast Wasteland" speech<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> really wasn't all that important in the long run, was probably a decade too late to have the maximum impact, and unfair: you can take any medium and make it look bad by emphasizing the more vulgar output, not to mention that he illustrated the idea with the idea of staying through one station's daily broadcast schedule without using any discretion of choosing what to watch or even changing channels for alternatives. Plus, Minow's point was to remind TV broadcasters of their duty to the public, not a blanket condemnation of all television. Earlier in the speech he even said "When television is good, nothing &mdash; not the theater, not the magazines or newspapers &mdash; nothing is better," and even admitted to being a fan of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheTwilightZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheTwilightZone">The Twilight Zone</a>.</em> So why was it considered such a landmark speech? Because the print media was terrified of TV taking their audience away, so naturally they decided a government official delivering a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> to television should be given maximum exposure.
</li><li> The famous anti-comic-book screed <em>The Seduction of the Innocent</em> featured as its last chapter an out-of-left-field denouncement of the evils of television.
</li><li> A moment in the history of Flemish television notes that in the early days there was no airing on Monday. That lasted from the launch of Flemish television until 1958. In hindsight, the NIR also had barely any programming output during that time. This just worked in their favor.
</li></ul></li><li> One example of something good coming from this trope: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MisterRogersNeighborhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MisterRogersNeighborhood">Fred Rogers</a> hated TV because the first time he watched it, he saw people throwing pies at each other and wanted to make something better out of it. He succeeded.
</li><li> In the UK, the problem wasn't with Television (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a> commanded too much respect for that), but with <em>Commercial Television</em> (read:<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MisplacedNationalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MisplacedNationalism">American television</a>). In the '50s, when the idea of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ITV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ITV">ITV</a> was put forward, people started to predict terrible things, as the companies would aim at the lowest common denominator. This led many of the stations of ITV in the '60s being as straightlaced as the BBC, for a while anyway. The guardians did have a point when ITV did eventually aim at the lowest common denominator.
<ul><li> In Belgium commercial television also had problems. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FlemishTVStations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FlemishTVStations">VTM</a> was introduced the BRT tried to demonize it. The only reason why it still passed is that the minister of culture at the time stood firmly behind it. Oddly enough this time it was not because they allowed American programming, but because Belgian television critics feared that it would lead to television without quality, which was a realistic fear in the very first years that they made programming. Nowadays most critics would not fear it anymore though, because the fact they can win awards has stimulated them to make more quality programming.

There was a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanPanicNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanPanicNow">moral panic</a> suggesting that RPGs were turning kids into devil-worshippers. When you remember that the major content inspiration, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>, was a respected British linguistics professor and a close friend of ardent Christian scholar/Fantasy novelist, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis">C. S. Lewis</a>, the sheer ignorance of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodSatanism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodSatanism">Satanic Panic</a> around the game is even more idiotic. Not that this has stopped <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ChickTracts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ChickTracts">some Christian fundamentalists</a>, who cannot admit to being wrong in any crusade, from making this argument even today.

</li><li> The synthesizer, while ubiquitous in music from the 80s to today, was controversial in its earlier years. Since one keyboardist can now sound like a full orchestra, there was concern over synths putting session musicians out of their jobs. There was also the misconception that they require no skill or talent, even though they require piano skills and knowledge of how to tweak the sound, especially in the early days of synths. Queen once boasted on their album cover that they don't use synths, even though they ended up using them towards the end of the 80s. The British Musicians' Union even attempted to ban the synthesizer.

"Why spend eight dollars playing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PacMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PacMan">Pac-Man</a></em> when you can buy this Juice Newton album instead?"

It was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareCampaign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareCampaign">Scare Campaign</a> which urged people to sign a petition to ban "pay TV", as people shouldn't pay for what they already had for free and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight">it would be another place where monsters appeared</a>.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder6');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1989 to Present&nbsp;</div><div id="folder6" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In 1989, when radio and television stations would get able to air from very far away, the idea was put forward by corporations that wanted to air television but had problems airing them in their own country to set up headquarters in London and air television for the country they wanted to air for through U-Turn construction. Cue the fact that public radio and television stations in the affected countries would say that this practice ruined television. In The Netherlands, where commercial radio and television remained banned until 1992, the Public Television network there even called the cops to investigate who was behind this criminal activity. In the end the people who aired radio and television there were found, sent to court and charged. Their channels, which were Cable One and TV10 respectively, were then taken off the air.
</li><li> On the same note there is commercial radio. Which ran for a long time, but had a late reintroduction in quite a few countries. In Belgium, for instance, the VRT was so panicked by the permission of commercial networks to broadcast commercial radio that they made <em>Radio Donna</em> in 1992 in an attempt to prevent commercial radio stations from being made. This is probably a positive instance of this trope, as Radio Donna grew and became the biggest radio stations of the late 1990's.
</li><li> Before going into the more obvious example of the internet, the growing prevalence of word processors in the early 1990s (technically starting with the introduction of editable-line electronic typewriters in the '80s, but not accessible to non-millionaires until the 1990s) received a furor of complaints similar to Socrates' objections to writing: being able to delete and replace letters or words before printing text was the death of proper language skills, and thus coherent thought, would degrade memory, etc, etc.
<ul><li> People are <em>still</em> complaining that word processors have killed cursive, assumably because they want in on the more modern version of the "kids these days can't write properly like when I was a kid" complaint. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note83tsa');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note83tsa" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note83tsa');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Curiously, long since the typewriter was invented script fonts and cursive have taken on very specific applications and is now considered a poor choice for body text. Compare the U.S. Declaration of Independence to a modern governmental document for a great example of this trend. There is even an ongoing debate about the whether or not sans serif is more readable then say, old-style fonts which are another form born from handwriting. </span>

<ul><li> The SOPA bill was an almost textbook example of this trope. While many of the supporters say that they are only trying to cut down on internet piracy, the true intentions are essentially trying to censor the internet in the same way as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BannedInChina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BannedInChina">China</a></em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note945rf');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note945rf" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note945rf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">note that this is a comparison the <em>supporters</em> of the bill made first</span>. The many opponents of the bill are left out of hearings, and the last hearing basically boiled down to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">poorly researched</a> railings against the sole witness not for it (but really the only one allowed in), a representative of Google. To give you an idea, many of the supporters don't even use the internet, or even <em>want</em> to know how it even works. And yet, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">they completely ignore internet security experts and numerous tech companies who say the bill is bad news</a> because they <strong>don't believe what they're saying.</strong> Read: people who have barely crossed paths with the internet saying that they're <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll">experts on the subject</a></em> are wrong.
<ul><li> Granted this is <em>far</em> from the first time that sort of thing has happened. It's probably best to expect people supporting these kinds of bills don't know what they're talking about.

</li><li> "He loved Video Games" is something that any gamer is absolutely loath to hear after someone goes on a shooting spree, which started when media linked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a> to the Columbine massacre. Expect to hear at least some news station say this after someone snaps and kills people, even though in many (if <em>any at all</em>) cases, the person never touched a game in their life, or touched a game so non-offensive there's no way it would have warped their minds to the degree that's claimed.

(Never mind the fact that being a game developer is a life long career for some people.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NightTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NightTrap">Night Trap</a></em> is one of the reasons why the ESRB exists today. The game caused controversy and was pulled from store shelves due to its "violent content" and its gameplay being centered around "capturing and torturing young women." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">It's a good thing that none of the senators involved in the hearing</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutShowsYouDontWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutShowsYouDontWatch">actually played the game.</a> Otherwise, they would have found out that none of these things happen and they would have had to rely more on the content in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a></em> to get the ruling that they wanted.
</li><li> Never mind the games, the systems themselves were briefly demonized in the late 90s. As consoles progressively became more sophisticated and powerful, there were numerous unsubstantiated claims that their CPUs could be removed by terrorists and then used as components in bombs, missiles or other remote-control terror-devices. It made even less sense in that some of the parts in said consoles were not proprietary, and anyone who wanted them could just buy them straight from the manufacturer themselves. Nevertheless, some people got as far as demanding anyone who wanted to buy a video game system should have to pass a background check first.
</li><li> Adding xenophobia to the mix, during the U.S. recession in the early '90s, some people resented the fact that the video game industry was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapanTakesOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapanTakesOverTheWorld">dominated by two Japanese firms</a>: Sega and Nintendo.
</li><li> Both games and gamers are <em>still</em> regularly smeared in the media even a decade later, with the "Video games cause violence" arguments being joined by "Video games cause racism, sexism and transphobia," despite running on the same debunked logic as the violent video games argument, and even a scare piece by NBC about how Discord (a gaming-focused social media program allowing people to create their own chatrooms) promotes white supremacy due to a couple chatrooms being used to help organize the 2017 Charlottesville protest (that were promptly deleted by the Discord staff right afterwards.)
</li><li> In 2019 the World Health Organization added "gaming disorder" to its list of diseases, making it the first disorder that pathologizes a hobby. <a class="urllink" href="https://areomagazine.com/2019/06/11/gaming-disorder-the-world-health-organisation-jumps-the-shark/">Critics of the WHO's decision<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> argue that, although there are certainly some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustOneMoreLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustOneMoreLevel">people who take gaming to an unhealthy level</a>, there's nothing substantial that separates it from other forms of entertainment to justify its own disorder.
</li></ul></li><li> According to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118001582.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1&amp;nid=2562">this story<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> published in <em>Variety</em> magazine in March 2009, London-based media research company Screen Digest has calmly announced that free online TV (both pirated and ad-supported legal) is the single greatest threat to broadcast media. The thrust of the article seems to be that since it is so much easier to watch television online on your own schedule, there's little reason to view broadcast media with all of its ads and often arbitrary scheduling. In other words, the internet is offering a better product in the same way television offered a better product than radio.
</li><li> In her <a class="urllink" href="http://light.wordpress.com/2008/02/04/reading-100-from-the-nobel-lecture-of-doris-lessing/">Nobel lecture<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, Nobel Laureate Doris Lessing calmly implied that the almost instant arrival of the Internet (in historical terms) has fatally wounded writing and literature.
</li><li> This also extends to the New Media itself, when attempts to commercialize it are effectively resisted by its users, such as commercial pop-ups being countered by pop-up blockers (which are currently built into every major browser) and other software that cleans ads from web pages (such as the Adblock Plus extension to Mozilla Firefox). Various industry groups are constantly hand-wringing about how this is "theft of service" and how it will bring about the death of the Internet. Because, as we all know, the Internet was built on the rock-solid foundation of advertisement before those pie-in-the-sky scientists and academics got their hands on it.
<ul><li> If you have an adblocker and attempt to use Hulu, you'll get a notice demanding you turn your adblocker off or else the video won't play correctly (generally it will still play, but instead of ads you get black screens for the amount of time the ad would have run for)
</li><li> Though small websites and internet personalities urge people to disable AdBlock for their websites because the ad revenue helps to support the site. This eventually culminated in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScandalGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScandalGate">Adgate</a>, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AtopTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AtopTheFourthWall">Linkara</a> made a video trying to explain this and received a massive backlash for it (although as he himself noted in a later video, far more people complied with his request than complained).
</li><li> It doesn't help that much of the internet is now so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfLoading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfLoading">choked with auto-playing ads and scripts</a> that it's <em>unusable</em> without the blockers.

<ul><li> This isn't the first time, either; back in the late 1980s and early 1990s (when they were bulky and expensive) having a cell phone at school could get you <em>arrested</em>, thanks to the War on Drugs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">The thinking went that "rich people have cell phones, drug dealers are rich people, so people with cell phones are drug dealers..."</a> You can practically use that argument to call for the arrest of rich people. Nowadays, the bans are more because students were using them to cheat on tests (text each other answers, store info, etc) and have proven themselves unable to <em>shut them off</em> and not text during class.
</li></ul></li><li> Wiley Miller, artist of the newspaper comic <em>Non Sequitur,</em> has gone on record about his belief that the Internet is ruining society, and he's taken several potshots at it in the comic.

</li></ul></li><li> Two local FOX News affiliates aired reports separately attacking both the Nintendo DS and the Sony PSP on their effects on children.
<ul><li> The Milwaukee station claimed that Nintendo DS made children easy targets for child predators, in the very unlikely chance that the predator would use his own DS to communicate with the child over Wi-Fi using Pictochat. Aside from the fact that it's far more likely to be in a game playing session than Pictochat, the Wi-Fi reception does not have a long range.
</li><li> A station in Philadelphia called the Playstation Portable a source for online porn from kids (for context, smartphones weren't yet mainstream). Of course, they were mostly showing people with the concern that a kid would own a device with no parental controls, and showing screens of websites showing how to make a bomb. If your kid is searching for such articles, perhaps his troubled nature is the problem, not the game system.

<ul><li> Another set of articles came out about how Twitter makes people <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/ptech/04/14/twitter.study/">"immune to human suffering."<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Read the research that they're talking about &mdash; it has literally <em>nothing</em> to do with Twitter and Facebook. Read a <a class="urllink" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1358">more elaborate explanation<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of what it actually says.
</li><li> There has also been a lot of criticism of social networking sites because it's easy for young people to meet up with strangers. A few cases of girls getting raped or murdered by people they initially met on social networking sites like Myspace have given many members of the public the idea that everyone on the internet is really a middle-aged creeper trying to hook up with teenage girls.
</li><li> The case of a mother who posted to Twitter asking for prayers after her toddler drowned in the swimming pool resulted in backlash about what an awful mother she must be for thinking about Twitter at a time like that, and, of course, claims that her son would be alive if not for her Twitter account. There wasn't even any evidence that she'd been online at the time of his death &mdash; the initial outrage stemmed purely from the fact that she'd used a social media site to communicate her grief. The blog that started the ball rolling with the assumption that she'd tweeted through her son's drowning is now entirely devoted to digging up dirt on her.
</li><li> You'll also hear a lot of stories about people murdering people because of things that happened online. In fact, more often than not, the people involved in these stories already knew each other for years in real life and the argument that sparked the violence just happened to take place on a social networking site.
</li><li> There's also the argument that Facebook causes depression, which isn't really true and is misleading because it's not really FB's fault. It's more that it simply creates a social atmosphere where sometimes, people who already were depressed can become a lot more depressed (like when a person posts to their wall in hopes someone will notice them, their friends don't respond, and the person starts to believe their friends don't care about them). Really any form of communication that involves unintentional ignoring can do this, but FB gets a lot of flak for it these days.

<div class="indent"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladimirPutin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladimirPutin">Putin</a> harshly rejected a call for officials to examine complaints on the Internet about vote rigging in the recent regional elections.

Why should we refer to the Internet?</a>" he said.
</div><ul><li> Considering how much of that porn is produced in Russia, you'd think he'd be nicer about it.
</li></ul></li><li> According to some newspapers, new media is making them go out of business, which is why they are making their content online pay-to-view. They also aren't fond of political sites like Huffington Post or Free Republic which link to their articles and give a little blurb about the contents of the article.
</li><li> New Zealand media ran an article calling Chatroulette "the new pornography".
<div class="indent">"Like its namesake it's dangerous, but instead of a bullet there's adult material!"
</div></li><li> ...and then there's <a class="urllink" href="http://philbradley.typepad.com/phil_bradleys_weblog/2010/05/the-most-stupid-school-principal-in-the-world.html">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> principal, who apparently isn't aware of his own blackboard project for students and wants all internet access to be restricted by parents.
</li><li> Another fun thing: <em>Regelrecht</em>, a TV show by the Dutch TROS, is now starting a public campaign to get libraries to ban access to sex and violence. Of course they aren't talking about books on violent killers or the erotic literature section, they mean access to the internet.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/05/28/michigan-considers-law-license-journalists/">There have been some attempts to make a blogger<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://bigjournalism.com/jlakely/2010/04/29/troubling-precedent-nj-court-says-bloggers-are-not-journalists/">not have the same rights as a journalist<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> Then there's a <em>Maclean's</em> magazine article called <a class="urllink" href="http://www.macleans.ca/article.jsp?content=20061030_135406_135406">the Internet sucks<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (the author calls that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets">terms crude enough for all cyber-dwellers to grasp</a>") which is blatantly one-sided in its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentuateTheNegative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentuateTheNegative">focus on mainstream Internet culture's flaws</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalFallacies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicalFallacies">guilt-by-association approach towards an entire medium</a>.
<ul><li> And yet that was on their website...
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorPhil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorPhil">Dr. Phil</a></em> has this trope every few episodes, usually focusing on 1) Children who are kidnapped by some stranger they met on the internet and 2) Children who spend too much time on the internet or texting.
</li><li> Some years ago, a Danish nerd created a website called Lej en Lejemorder. Which translates to "Book an Assassin". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw">The Danish media thought he was serious, much controversy about the internet ensued, and apparently, the guy also got some serious emails from people who actually did want someone to be assassinated.</a>
<ul><li> On a much more serious note, there <em>are</em> sites only accessible via TOR proxy that allow you to hire hitmen.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10f2zq');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note10f2zq" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10f2zq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Or so they claim. They'll probably just ask for payment up front and laugh at the gullible person who wanted an internet hitman.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Essence</em> magazine had an article about teens and their sex lives. It had this trope in spades, claiming that television and porn are the cause of the rampant teenage sex going on. It also had a little bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMediaPlayingCatchUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMediaPlayingCatchUp">Old Media Playing Catch-Up</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanPanicNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanPanicNow">You Can Panic Now</a>, since anybody that <em>doesn't</em> know that there is porn on the internet probably lives under a rock, or at the very least doesn't have any teenage kids.
</li><li> Some people in the free and open source software community, while often extremely technically literate, are often ambivalent or even outright hostile to social networking sites, mainly due to privacy issues.
</li><li> In a combination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessAesop">Clueless Aesop</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight">Scare 'Em Straight</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">Very Special Episode</a>, ITV's <em>Tonight</em> series seems to head this way; sometimes it just <em>can't</em> deal with the issues surrounding new media correctly, showing some elements of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a>. It's sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">lacking in the research department, too</a> (apart, maybe, from spyware issues.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook">Facebook</a> is <em>constantly</em> being accused of stockpiling users' personal information for nefarious purposes. The paranoia increased tenfold after the company became publicly-traded due to people not knowing what that means, thinking the company is <em>literally</em> public, causing some uninformed users to post meaningless disclaimers that their info is private. Legality aside, the boring truth of the matter is that the only thing Facebook does with your info is use it to send you relevant advertisement, and even that is done by algorithm; Mark Zuckerberg is not leering at your spring break photos or stalking your every move.
<ul><li> Unfortunately, it turns out that the NSA <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_%28surveillance_program%29">is monitoring pretty much every social media and email network<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in the world and stockpiling users' personal information for purposes which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlausibleDeniability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlausibleDeniability">may or may not be nefarious</a>.
</li><li> However, recent events have turned out that Facebook indeed has been selling users' private information, or at the very least, gives other companies dangerous amounts of access to their site data. The issue has become so well documented and widespread that national governments such as the USA and Canada are openly investigating them.
</li></ul></li><li> A debate similar to the VCR incident cited under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalPiracyIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalPiracyIsEvil">Digital Piracy Is Evil</a> is now going on over ebooks &mdash; most notably Amazon's Kindle, which is selling like there's no tomorrow. Is this the end of printed books? Ask anyone who was around in the '50s and worried that television would be the death of movies what they think.
</li><li> With the rise in popularity of 3D printers, it was only a matter of time before someone made a 3D-printed gun. The online group "Defense Distributed" hosts CAD files for a fully functional plastic gun as well as lower receivers and mags for AR-15 rifles (the lower receiver being the part of the rifle that is legally regulated and serial numbered, and in some American states mags are regulated). There was a firestorm of media coverage and panic, up until it was pointed out that the printed parts <em>and</em> gun broke. However, eventually a design was made that was able to handle more than a few shots. A quick search on Wikipedia or Google can show a list of different firearms made with 3D printers. With the exception of the ones made with metal 3D printers, which at the time of writing (Nov 2014) are too expensive to be owned by common people, most 3D printed firearms are glorified zipguns, capable of only firing low-caliber rounds.

While that has some bluster the main complaint is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HollywoodAccounting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HollywoodAccounting">low royalties</a> with these streaming services. Since this affects the livelihood of musicians, it could impact how they work when they get creative.
</li><li> Amusingly enough, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope">Pope Francis</a> recently averted this by stating that <a class="urllink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/pope-francis-calls-the-internet-a-gift-from-god-9080117.html">the internet is a 'gift from God'<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

<ul><li> Similarly, inversions have been posted in local editorials or on tumblr blogs, wherein people thanked the internet for being able to find like-minded people from across the world. (Especially people who live in rural areas) One editorial in particular was of a woman being glad that her kids discovered the internet, as she was the only one at the office with no horror stories of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">receiving the "Do you know where your children are?" phone call</a>, their teenagers being escorted home drunk or finding broken condoms and positive home pregnancy tests.
</li></ul></li><li> When iTunes became popular, there was much hand-wringing from musicians (such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ACDC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ACDC">AC/DC</a>, who kept their songs off of the service for years before finally relenting in 2012) and music enthusiasts that it would kill off the album by allowing people to cherry-pick the songs that they wanted. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/is-itunes-killing-the-album/">This article<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, for instance, hysterically bemoans that young music fans today will never be able to listen to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">"properly"</a> because everyone will just buy their favorite songs instead of the whole album. On the other hand, some iTunes songs can't be purchased on their own in a deliberate attempt to get people to buy the whole album even if all they want is that one song.
<ul><li> Interestingly, the advent of digital music purchasing has led to the resurgence of an even <em>older</em> phenomenon &mdash; singles and EPs, released in closer proximity, are becoming more popular than the longer full-length albums that were made possible by CD technology, and allows artists to dominate the charts.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KidRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KidRock">Kid Rock</a>'s refusal to put his albums on iTunes had the curious side effect of making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">One Hit Wonders</a> out of two anonymous, studio-only "karaoke" bands: His single "All Summer Long" was climbing the charts without being available as a digital download, but this led to people downloading soundalike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverVersion">Cover Versions</a> since they couldn't get the original: Versions of the song by Hit Masters and The Rock Heroes made the Billboard charts on the strength of downloads, with the "Hit Masters" version even briefly overtaking Kid Rock's version.

</li><li> Many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> fans have criticized the prequel trilogy for using CGI instead of physical models and sets like the original trilogy. <a class="urllink" href="http://makingstarwars.net/2013/08/star-wars-episode-vii-cgi-versus-practical-effects/">This article<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> examines the special effects used throughout the franchise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">finding that the techniques used in the PT weren't that different from the OT</a>.
<ul><li> On that note, there was backlash against the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tron">TRON</a></em> film by people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn">who felt that using CGI for special effects</a> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">"cheating"</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> This was not the only backlash in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas">George Lucas</a> was involved. He was in fact also the very first film director to use digital cinema and he popularized the use of it with his company known as THX. There are still a number of famous film directors (such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/QuentinTarantino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/QuentinTarantino">Quentin Tarantino</a>) out there who believe that digital filmmaking will lead to less traditional celluloid filmmaking and thus effectively ruin cinema. Internet journalists soon joined in with the backlash <a class="urllink" href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/119431/how-digital-cinema-took-over-35mm-film">by writing articles arguing the same thing<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

Describing it as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">anvilicious</a> is an understatement. One of the main plot points involves the main character meeting a woman and having a family because he didn't look at his smartphone. Ironically, many families only exist because of the Internet and online dating.

In most cases the problems encountered stemmed either from a lack of common sense while playing or were risks one would take by simply going outside.

Starting within the pages of The Black Dossier and Century 1969, the world of the League started being portrayed in a more pessimistic and problematic way than it had before. Alan Moore in his views takes on that a lot of human culture isn't challenging or advancing as much as it should be. His on-page treatments of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JamesBond">James Bond</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a> shown off this criticism. Bond's original book attitude was turned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> with his whole premise being mocked by revealing him to be both incompetent and not even loyal to the crown.

<ul><li> Moore later attempted to clarify some of this in interviews in which while he does view, for example, Harry Potter to be a less challenging and safer work than, say, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Performance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Performance">Performance</a></em> he doesn't hold that all modern culture is a nadir. This however raised more questions as given from the 1960s onward the world of the League features less and less literary characters period.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11jsse');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note11jsse" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11jsse');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There remains an argument that the literary or written down versions of drama and oral tales by their very format should be judged as less restrictive than film or acted out drama and tales. This viewpoint argues if we were to say British fiction is worse today than the Victorian era we compare the books of then to the books of now instead of the books of then to the films of now and etc. However Moore's League has been open to all fiction but as of late uses far more British film or television references than book references. This has led some to find Moore's comparisons a bit unbalanced.</span> So while we know Moore doesn't indict everyone with this trope, it's hard to know who he would cite as an aversion.

It even included panic-mongering in the form of notes to parents that "If your kids download music, you can pay the price!" with an image of a cop car zooming up to a house with its siren running, presumably so the cops can kick in the door and slam the parents to the floor, handcuffing them and hauling them right to jail because their daughter downloaded "Slave 4 U".

</div></li><li> The 2001 Japanese horror film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Kairo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Kairo">Kairo</a></em> (AKA <em>Pulse</em>) is built around the supposed nature of computers as alienating devices.
</li><li> The film adaptation of <em>The Twonky</em> predicts a future when televisions become able to walk, talk, and use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a>. Apparently, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia">Dystopia</a> uses them to keep the population in line. (The movie was based on a story of the same name by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenryKuttner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenryKuttner">Henry Kuttner</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CLMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CLMoore">C. L. Moore</a>, which was written before televisions became common; in the story, the twonky is disguised as a record player and there's no implication that there's anything wrong with record players as such.)
</li><li> In Japanese film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoodMorning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoodMorning">Good Morning</a></em>, the bratty kid is pestering his parents for a TV, but the adults in the neighborhood have a contemptuous attitude towards television. By 1959, TV was really catching on in Japan, and there as in the USA it was seen as a threat to motion pictures.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Mr. Hayashi</strong>: Someone said television would produce a hundred million idiots.
</div></li><li> The Bruce Willis film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Surrogates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Surrogates">Surrogates</a></em> has a generous offering of this, to say the least. Basically, the robot surrogates stand in for just about <em>everything</em> wrong about New Media and how's it preventing social interaction and true "humanity." The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSurrogates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSurrogates">original comic book</a> has this as well, particularly when the protagonist asks his wife to have dinner with him... and she immediately heads to her room to connect with her surrogate. When he tries to stop her and ask her to have dinner with him <em>physically</em>, she angrily tells him that he may be happy with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> appearance, but she isn't. At the end of the story, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after he lets all the surrogates be shut down, he comes home to find that she committed suicide</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSocialNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSocialNetwork">The Social Network</a></em> subverts this and plays it straight. It's somewhat admiring of the technology we use today, and acknowledges the influence it has on society and why people would use it, but also notes how the people behind it usually don't have the best ideals...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Contagion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Contagion">Contagion</a></em> deliciously follows this trope. As a new global pandemic spreads, Jude Law's character is an intrepid freelance internet journalist with his own popular self-published news blog. He plays on the Real Life trope of the "lone, intrepid reporter breaking the story!" and that Old Media Are evil. In his posts he vilifies the government agencies trying to deal with the outbreak, making it more difficult for them to enforce a quarantine. Stirring so much paranoia about government conspiracies and evil big pharmaceutical companies makes him into an internet celebrity, and soon this...self-employed outsider journalist with no credentials is a guest on every national TV news channel, is being put live debates with CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta. However, instead of posting a report that the government already has a vaccine and is withholding it or something...he tells his thousands of readers that the virus can be cured by taking an over-the-counter herbal remedy, <em>Forsythia</em>. As it turns out, he's bought up massive amounts of stock in national Forsythia manufacturers and is just trying to profit off the disaster. Adeptly manipulating the Old Media Are Evil trope, the more that national officials on TV state he's a crackpot, the more people think they're just trying to cover him up. When the CDC eventually manages to produce a vaccine, he starts saying its unsafe, trying to keep people buying Forsythia.
</li><li> The ABC Family film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cyberbully2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cyberbully2011">Cyberbully (2011)</a></em> seems to behave this way toward social networking sites. While the main moral of the film is supposed to be about all the damage cyberbullying and internet harassment can cause, it really seems to be more like "social networking sites are evil".
</li><li> The horror film <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Antisocial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Antisocial">Antisocial</a></em> takes this to fairly absurd levels as a Facebook-lookalike called "Red Room" &mdash; complete with a Mark Zuckerberg expy &mdash; is ultimately found to be responsible for a contagion spreading across the world that makes you violent, makes you bleed black blood from your ears and nose, and ultimately makes your brain explode out the back of your head. This is because the creators of Red Room encoded subliminal messages in the site that make you want to check it and post things there more often, resulting in your brain growing a tentacled mass that gives your brain a biological wi-fi signal that connects to all other Red Room users. If all that isn't <em>quite</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">anvilicious</a> enough for you, it turns out at the end that the virus also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">brings its victims back from the dead as mindless shambling zombies.</span>

<ul><li> An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanPrint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanPrint">Older Than Print</a> example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy">The Divine Comedy</a></em>; Francesca puts the blame for her damnation on a romantic poem about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur">Sir Lancelot's affair</a> that manipulated her and her brother-in-law to commit adultery. In context, Francesca is clearly just refusing to take responsibility for her own sins, but it remains unclear whether the author agrees that those new-fangled romance poems are sinful.
</li><li> In the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JurassicPark">Jurassic Park</a></em> novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLostWorld1995" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLostWorld1995">The Lost World (1995)</a></em>, one of the characters comment on how the Internet is the doom of all civilization because it will "make everyone have the way of thinking about everything and force conformity." (!!) Then again, this statement was said by a character well-known for being an opinionated jerk who's right less often than he thinks he is. Then again, his point was more about evolution and extinction through behavioral change (of which the book discusses and meditates on at length), and how small groups in isolation evolve faster, and the internet essentially removes isolation from the vast majority of humanity.
</li><li> An older example: in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoaldDahl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoaldDahl">Roald Dahl</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a></em>, the song sung by the Oompa-Loompas after Mike Teevee is shrunk denounces television in favor of reading. This is dated and absurd enough the 2005 movie version changes his obsession to video games (particularly first-person shooters), even though it makes his name and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt">supposed</a> smart-aleck-ness a little out of place. Alternatively, his <em>real</em> fault is being an obnoxious, cynical know-it-all rather than a media obsessive. Either way, they use a fairly close adaptation of Dahl's original song, meaning there is a "TV is evil" message in a 2005 film...

</div></dd></dl><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoaldDahl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoaldDahl">Roald Dahl</a> had a real love-hate relationship with TV. The villainous parents in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Matilda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Matilda">Matilda</a></em> spend all their time watching TV and hate books. And yet, it should be noted that Dahl hosted two TV shows &mdash; <em>Way Out</em> in 1961 and <em>Tales of the Unexpected</em> in the 1980s &mdash; and wrote for some anthology TV shows.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory">2013 stage musical</a>'s equivalent song, "Vidiots", is a cheekier take on the trope. It's about the perils of using electronic media to babysit unruly kids (this Mike Teavee is an outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible">Enfant Terrible</a>; his mom has tried everything else to keep him under control and has since given up). While it makes a valid point that a diet of only instant gratification media won't do much for a kid's mind and life in the long run, it also invokes more hysterical fears for laughs &mdash; "And then like some barbaric Huns/Our toddlers all are packing guns/Now children curse and smoke cigars/Our nurseries now have prison bars..." &mdash; and even pops in some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">Hypocritical Humor</a> with the lines "But OMG will this destroy/The art of conversation?" The version of the song from the 2017 Broadway transfer trades some of the most humorous fear-mongering to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">double down on this trope.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Much of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Fahrenheit451" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Fahrenheit451">Fahrenheit 451</a></em> was just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RayBradbury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RayBradbury">Ray Bradbury</a> ranting about how television (and radios with headphones?) would dumb Americans down, destroy literature, ruin marriages, cause violence, and ultimately kill everyone because nobody took war seriously. Nevermind that Bradbury (much like Roald Dahl) wrote many adaptations of his own stories for TV shows like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AlfredHitchcockPresents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AlfredHitchcockPresents">Alfred Hitchcock Presents</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheTwilightZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheTwilightZone">The Twilight Zone</a></em>...Not to mention a <em>video game</em> based on said book.

</li><li> One of Asimov's stories mentions "dreamies" &mdash; direct neural interface movies. A government official says pornographic dreamies are the one type of pornography which is the worst for the "moral fiber of the nation". (It should be mentioned the rest of the story averts this trope). In "The End of Eternity", dreamies are considered a technology which cannot be allowed to exist &mdash; just like nuclear wars (or replicators).
<ul><li> Another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a> short story, "The Feeling of Power," parodies this trope. It takes place <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InAWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InAWorld">In a World...</a> where calculators are so widespread and have been used for so long, that people have actually forgotten <em>how math works</em>, including how to add single-digit integers. A technician manages to reverse-engineer the science by studying how computers do simple operations and the society gradually extrapolates how to do more complex equations. The people exposed to this "new" science (which they name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallARabbitASmeerp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallARabbitASmeerp">Graphitics</a>) worry that it could be dangerous.
</li><li> Similarly, he wrote a young adult short story about a world in which voice recognition was so accurate and omnipresent that nobody bothered to learn how to read or write. The protagonist creates a "secret code" for his clubhouse which is nothing more than written English.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DoctorWhoExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DoctorWhoExpandedUniverse">Doctor Who Expanded Universe</a></em> novel <em>The Gallifrey Chronicles</em> features a vignette set in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>, in which an alien intelligence introduces a device that's <em>like</em> a mobile phone, but much smaller, strangely streamlined, and with a screen, to a school playground. The children become fascinated, and then antisocial and withdrawn, as the alien radiation brainwashes them. They also start, somehow, <em>talking</em> in a way that skips vowels and uses numbers instead of homonymous words. Yes, the texting generation is an evil alien plot! (Author Lance Parkin may have had his tongue firmly in cheek.)
</li><li> <em>Bad Dream</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnChristopher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnChristopher">John Christopher</a> has this for a technology that doesn't even exist yet &mdash; virtual reality! Some time is spent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster">filibustering</a> about how this panic is different from all the other ones because virtual reality is so much more "real" than television or video games.
</li><li> Ditto for <em>Death Dream</em> by Ben Bova, though it also acknowledges how much better <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Edutainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Edutainment">Edutainment</a> will get when virtual reality exists. Of note is that all virtual reality in-setting is interactive, like video games rather than movies, but you always win the games no matter how badly you play.
</li><li> <em>The Unincorporated Man</em>, which primarily challenges uncontrolled capitalism, takes a chapter to explain how the future world portrayed was nearly destroyed by virtual reality. It's a bit clever about the mechanism, though &mdash; the system portrayed perfectly conforms to the user's wishes, and perfectly simulates any desired experience, so it acts as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine">Lotus-Eater Machine</a>.
</li><li> Referenced in P.N. Elrod's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVampireFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVampireFiles">The Vampire Files</a></em>, which are set in the 1930s. One editorial Jack reads during his nightly newspaper-binge addresses the then-hot controversy about whether having <em>radios</em> in the home is contributing to the downfall of civilized society.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote">Don Quixote</a>: Spain at The Cavalier Years had just discovered the printing press, and books were considered this trope.

<ul><li> At chapter IV of the Second Part, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote">Don Quixote</a> and Samsom Carrasco discuss <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/FallenCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/FallenCreator">Fallen Creator</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>). Don Quixote notices reputed writers that lost prestige when they publish their works on the new printing presses. Carrasco explains that a printed book makes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentuateTheNegative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentuateTheNegative">easier to explore for any kind of error</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">Fan Dumb</a> is always the envy of great creators, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsSeeYouDoBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsSeeYouDoBetter">because they have never produced a book.</a> (Incidentally, Cervantes get a lot of critiques because the first part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote">Don Quixote</a> was plagued with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesContinuityError" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesContinuityError">SeriesContinuityErrors</a>).

To fight him, they have assembled the best special forces operatives and computer specialists, setting up their own operations to fight the Devil's cronies. Every morning, priests and monks perform exorcism rituals on their computers in order to clear them of the Devil's influence, making sure that the key prayers are spoken by a clergyman no lower than an archdeacon.

Ernst Stern, the character that writes the book for him because even he considers his own style to be dry, he decides to add more romantic snippets about the heroes that saved poor people and tragedies in his book that should go about the coffee trade and how to help the future coffee men for the days to come. When Batavus Droogstoppel realizes this he is mad and goes as far as to show him that romanticism is futile by analysing a theater piece.

In fact, the "anonymous" in question is simply the default login to most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Imageboards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Imageboards">Imageboards</a> (the so-called "secret websites" and "underground hacker sites"). The "report" includes a random clip of a truck blowing up, apparently as a "demonstration" and a signal that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanPanicNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanPanicNow">You Can Panic Now</a>. The "anonymous insider" is clearly in on the gag; note use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/FourChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/FourChan">4chan</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">Catch Phrases</a> like "Anonymous does not forgive". The mention of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltraSuperDeathGoreFestChainsawer3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltraSuperDeathGoreFestChainsawer3000">like a real-life video game</a>" earns extra <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil">New Media Are Evil</a> points &#151; such are the things that happen when a local news station doesn't know what they're getting into.
<ul><li> It's worth noting, though, that the "insider" was <em>not</em> in on the gag &#151; 4chan found out who he was and made his life a living hell. Read all about it on Encyclopedia Dramatica. The individual was a former /b/ member who, after his raid request on a girl who rejected him was turned down by Anonymous, continued complaining until a fellow Anon at his school revealed his identity. Hilarity did or did not ensue, depending on who you ask.
</li></ul></li><li> And it's probably enough just to say this: Oh dear lord, the "Special Reports" on the night of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV">Grand Theft Auto IV</a></em>'s release...
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishNewspapers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishNewspapers">British Sun Newspaper</a> (evidently worried that it was failing to meet its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt">P&aelig;do Hunt</a> quota) ran a report on the satirical "Child Beauty Pageants" site that you can find on the in-game internet, which automatically redirects you to the FBI homepage and give you a four-star wanted rating. Apparently, including this was sick (and possibly wrong), and it would inevitably lead to people looking at these sites in real life.
</li></ul></li></ul><h3><strong>Series:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUK">Being Human</a></em>. Ivan mentions offhand that he can pass along messages to the other vampires in Bristol easily, because most of them follow his Twitter feed. A later episode has a vampire use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> to distribute a video of Tom and George transforming into werewolves. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This backfires when the people who see the video chalk the whole thing up to special effects, and it completely fails to throw the human world into the panic he anticipated</span>. On the other hand, that same vampire seems to consider new media as a potential tool humans have to stay connected and win against any vampire attacks ("If you try to attack them, they'll have an army together within minutes. Over <em>Twitter</em>.") and his desire to take advantage of it is just his view that it's a powerful tool for anyone.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackMirror">Black Mirror</a></em> is pretty much <em>New Media Are Evil: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniSeries">Mini Series</a></em>. At least in the earlier seasons, the later seasons tend more towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsBad">Science Is Bad</a>.
<ul><li> "Fifteen Million Merits" depicts a dystopian future where people are continually bombarded with advertisements while doing pointless work to buy pointless stuff, with an ersatz <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFactor">The X Factor</a> and a chance at stardom being the only way out for many people.
</li><li> "The Waldo Moment" shows how a crude cartoon character runs for a by-election in the UK and rides to success on a wave of social media hype and cynical populism. Things go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">From Bad to Worse</a>.
</li><li> "Nosedive" depicts a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsaccharineWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsaccharineWorld">Crapsaccharine World</a> where people rate each other on a Facebook-style app. Your rating defines everything about your life from where you can live or work to <em>your priority for hospital treatment</em>, and people have become narcissistic and status-obsessed as a result.
</li></ul></li><li> Obligatory <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> example from the first season with "I Robot, You Jane", where the boy Willow meets over the internet turns out to be the demon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Moloch the Corruptor.</a> Although to give it its due, the web becomes evil because a demon imprisoned in a book during the medieval ages was inadvertently released onto it, and several techno-savvy magic users were used to reseal it.
<ul><li> Internet dating was a major part of the story. It was 1997! Could almost file this one under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped">Some Anvils Need to Be Dropped</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em> has an episode where a killer believes and acts out on this. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He was cyberbullied in high school before any precedents were set, meaning the kids who he believes ruined his life weren't charged</span>. Therefore, he targets "Snapomatic" (basically Instagram, with a bit of Snapchat thrown in for flavor) celebrities, even using apartment-sharing programs and 3D printers. His ultimate plan involves <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> capturing the creators of Snapomatic and subjecting them to torture in the high school where he was bullied, all under a live feed on Snapomatic where users can vote for which one survives</span> to prove how corrupt New Media are making America. He is called out on this by the main characters, who maintain a more balanced view. The very minor subplot of the episode is Castle filming a "web-mercial" for his latest book because of the positive power he believes the internet has.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds">Criminal Minds</a></em> devoted an entire episode to a killer who targeted victims based on their Twitter feeds, and portrayed the Twitter users as drug addicts. (The episode also took time out of its schedule to blast the concept of "selfies".)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIMiami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIMiami">CSI: Miami</a></em> had an episode ("Cyber-lebrity") where a girl's entire life seems ruined because of a photo (not even showing nudity) of her posted on the Internet. To the point where people are <em>trying to kill her</em>. Then they go after Horatio, uncovering confidential information within <em>minutes</em> because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsASmallNetAfterAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsASmallNetAfterAll">It's a Small Net After All</a>. And Flashmobs show up with a speed and fanatical interest over said girl that, in real life, wouldn't happen if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Britney Spears was french kissing Lindsay Lohan buck naked on top of a circus trapeze in the middle of Times Square with dancing leprechauns doing the macarena in time to music supplied to the Rolling Stones. At noon on a weekday.</a>
<ul><li> There's also the episode where a video game company secretly provided assault rifles to college students so they could recreate not-GTA in real life to drum up publicity for the game. The harshest of the players is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GamerChick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GamerChick">Gamer Chick</a> who's participating because it's literally the only way to get boys to pay attention to her in this age of video games.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY">CSI: NY</a></em>:
<ul><li> An episode where Reed, a blogger, tried to get Mac to give information on the <em>Taxicab Killer</em>. Mac refuses, so Reed proceeds to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">make something up</a>. This whips up hysteria enough that three cabbies murder some random cabbie that they suspect to be the killer, except he was a cop. Considering that bloggers like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Blog/LittleGreenFootballs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Blog/LittleGreenFootballs">Charles Johnson</a> made their bones exposing malfeasance in old media, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anvilicious</a> with a corrupt anvil. And just to drive it home even further, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's the next victim, or is he?</span> It should be noted that Reed's original role in the series was as Mac's long-lost stepson, so there's definitely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal">other</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama">tropes</a> at play here. Still, there's probably a bit of new media hatin' in the mix.
</li><li> It also features a subversion: In "Down the Rabbit Hole", the team discovers that a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">Psycho for Hire</a> is using <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecondLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecondLife">Second Life</a></em> to find info on her targets. She doesn't conform to the "Internet Stalker" archetype at all, and it's made quite clear she doesn't care for the game as anything more than a weapon (as revealed in a sequence where she uses a virus to <em>crash her own server</em>). Plus, it's revealed that Ross is an avid player.
</li><li> Another subversion in a more recent episode &mdash; a Chatroulette-like program alerts the CSIs to a murder before it's discovered (allowing them to be assured that they'll get the best possible evidence); Mac and Jo both experiment with the program and find it to be interesting, rather than harmful. Jo even uses it to show New York to a serviceman in Afghanistan.
</li><li> Later still, being signed up to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook">Facebook</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct">Bland-Name Product</a> as part of a joke is what puts Mac back in touch with an old friend, who ends up being his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> (and occasional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a>) for the remainder of the series. Since the episode's plot involved a fake profile being used by woman to trick the victim (her soon-to-be-ex-husband) into having an "affair" (to use against him in the divorce), which indirectly lead to the murder (the victim saw through it, but jokingly said he'd have her killed so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">she took opportunity to murder him</a> during the robbery at the start of the episode, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> thinking she could frame the robbers - unfortunately it was staged by their daughter, who was sick of both of their crap</span>) this was probably an attempt to avoid this trope.
</li><li> Elsewhere in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIVerse">CSI Verse</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSICyber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSICyber">CSI: Cyber</a></em> lives and breathes this trope. The premise is that crooks and psychos are constantly misusing the internet and online technology to endanger innocent people, either for profit or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a>; the series plays this for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel">Paranoia Fuel</a>, as <a class="urllink" href="http://www.tv.com/shows/csi-cyber/community/post/csi-cyber-review-season-1-kidnapping-20-cmnd-crash-killer-en-route-142542924607/">this article<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> discusses.

It's not content to say because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsOnline">Everything Is Online</a> baby monitors can be hacked, it goes to the extreme of saying "The Internet is full of child rapists and baby killers, those who cause untold death to get off on it and impress those they don't even know, their efforts to annihilate the world is imminent and inevitable, be alarmed, be afraid, code black, code black." Or short version, making the Anonymous Troll an all-powerful hacker terrorist.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2019NYSResolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2019NYSResolution">"Resolution"</a> has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutawayGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutawayGag">Cutaway Gag</a> where, after the villain brings down the communications of the entire UK, having commandeered the bandwidth for its own purposes, a mother and her two sons are shown as utterly horrified that the Internet is down on New Year's Day, meaning they might have to actually <em>talk</em> to each other.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Engrenages" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Engrenages">Engrenages</a></em> had a murder-of-the-week in its second season in which a stereotypical alienated teen boy murdered his slightly older online girlfriend after they met face to face and she rejected him for being too young, then killed himself. However, the general tone of the ep didn't condemn the internet so much as his parents for not noticing how screwed-up he was.
</li><li> Played for laughs on an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGeorgeLopezShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGeorgeLopezShow">The George Lopez Show</a></em>. Max befriends a girl his age online. George is convinced that she must really be a sexual predator and takes over communicating with her in an attempt to lure her out. Cut to the girl's house, where <em>her</em> father and uncle are also convinced that her new friend is a predator and are trying to lure <em>him</em> out. (Both sides even comment that "there's no way a real kid would type like that" to their children). Once the adults meet up and realize that there's no actual pervert involved, they agree to let the kids resume their friendship and even help arrange a supervised real-life meeting between them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HenryDanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HenryDanger">Henry Danger</a></em> had a three-part special (beginning with "A New Danger") where the villain Rick Twittler believes this about social media and feels guilt that he helped to make it such as he created a social media company. Due to this, his plan was to shut the internet down forever.
</li><li> In the BBC reality show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ISurvivedAZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ISurvivedAZombieApocalypse">I Survived A Zombie Apocalypse</a></em>, the virus that created the zombies came from an 'untested new Wi-Fi grid' that mutated some of the British public and was transmitted through their smartphones.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheITCrowd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheITCrowd">The IT Crowd</a></em>, where an <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALZZx1xmAzg">incredibly over-the-top spoof<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of the "you wouldn't steal a blank" anti-piracy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicServiceAnnouncement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicServiceAnnouncement">PSA</a> is shown when the characters are sitting down to watch a film.
<ul><li> Even better, it was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a <em>pirated</em> film.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em>
<ul><li> One episode has a killer who stalked and become obsessed with his victim on an obvious <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecondLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecondLife">Second Life</a></em> rip-off. The crucial clue to finding his kidnapping victim was to find the cabin he built for her in-game, in a location identical to the real-world cabin he built to keep his targets in. That's right, the guy modeled a lake and the attending geography so carefully, and placed his model cabin (also scrupulously accurate to the real-world version) <em>exactly</em> where it was in real life, and on top of that, the <em>Second Life</em> rip-off had such a perfect lighting engine that the detectives found the cabin by dawning the virtual sun and then <em>seeing how the shadows fell</em> and oh my <em>God</em>.
</li><li> In another episode, a kid claimed to have run over and then murdered a woman in a red dress because she looked like a prostitute out of a suspiciously GTA-esque video game, to the point where he was loudly describing the murder on the witness stand while his thumbs were furiously moving around in his lap and supposed mimicking the buttons one would push in the game. Inverted, because the A.D.A. saw right through his bullshit.
</li><li> There's also an episode where a teenager has been murdered. As they investigate her life, they discover that she had sex with men for clothes (and later for money.) They then discover her profile on a website people go on to find casual sex partners (not for pay) and one of the detectives states that it's a "small step" between having casual sex with people you met through the internet and becoming a $500 a night underaged call girl.
</li><li> "Chat Room" also demonizes the internet, with parts of the episode dedicated to Stabler's unease about the world wide web, equating the family's computer with a window for perverts to potentially sneak in through to take advantage of his children.
</li><li> In the episode "Web", a teenager is making child pornography starring himself and putting it up on the internet, and making huge quantities of money from it. The teenager was a victim of sexual abuse as a child, but several lines in the episode imply that this kind of thing happens all the time and your children may start doing it at any moment (Stabler: "Used to be kids were safe when they were at home.") You got to admit that they do think that teenagers are intelligent people. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">So intelligent that they would know how to make their own website and learn the 4 main web-scripting languages in a very short time.</a>
</li><li> <em>Subverted</em> to an extent, however, in an episode where a mentally-challenged teenager is suspected of killing one of his foster sisters as a result of his fascination with a fantasy role-play computer game, with some elements of the crime scene reflecting his interest in the game. The detectives rule him out, however, because he identified with the <em>hero</em> character, not any of the villains; he was acting out his interest in the game to try and protect her, not to harm her.
</li><li> Played painfully straight in "Intimidation Game", another "video games are evil" episode that equates all gamers with delusional terrorists and rapists.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Triple subverted</em> on an episode of the Canadian sitcom <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LifeWithDerek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LifeWithDerek">Life with Derek</a></em>. In one episode, the main character sees her brothers playing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawyerFriendlyCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawyerFriendlyCameo">suspiciously</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider">Tomb Raider</a></em>-esque video game, and is offended by the sexy and degrading female protagonist... until she actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutShowsYouDontWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutShowsYouDontWatch">sits down and plays the game,</a> and realizes that the main character is actually strong and competent and empowering. ...Then her brothers beat it, and she realizes that the "prize" for doing well is seeing the main character <em>topless.</em> A standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">Double Subversion</a>? Well, <em>then</em> she goes and writes an essay for her class about how female video game characters are cool, so long as designers can dial back the gratuitous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService">Fanservice</a>. (Phew!)
<ul><li> Given that controversy surrounding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService">Fanservice</a> among real-life gamers, and the genuine conflict some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GamerChick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GamerChick">Gamer Chicks</a> feel between "this character is objectified and I should not like her" versus "I find playing as her to be empowering," it makes one suspect that there's an actual gamer or two on the writing staff.
</li></ul></li><li> Not necessarily evil, but Mick and Josef in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Moonlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Moonlight">Moonlight</a></em> bemoan the modern Internet-based catalogs for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighClassCallGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighClassCallGirl">High Class Call Girls</a>. They preferred the "good old days" of driving by girls standing on street corners or old-school brothels. For some reason, they assume that these things don't exist.

His adopted mother (the Evil Queen) wanted him to put down the fairy tales so she could go back to bullying the townsfolk without distraction. So, she burns down the playground and "compensates" the boy with a video game system (because, of course, playing those games will make sure he never thinks about storybooks or fairy tales...)

Coupled with some subliminal conditioning, the crew become so addicted to the games that they obey their "master"'s every command.

<ul><li> Played straight in the episode "Virtual Reality" where video games are apparently tools of Satan that makes children do horrible things.
</li></ul></li><li> The Italian crime series <em>Turbo</em> (a ripoff of <em>Commissar Rex</em>, basically) had an infamous episode where a psychically disturbed man was accused of a murder, while the real culprits were some boys addicted to a "forbidden game" which had <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em> 's cover, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeII">Quake II</a></em> footage with a red filter, and was named DUUM II (spelled exactly this way).

</li><li> There is a well known Russian text called <em><a class="urllink" href="https://lleo.me/arhive/humor/serafim.htm">The letter of Father Seraphimius<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, where the titular priest tries to understand modern technology used by his men (written in an exaggeratedly archaic language analogous to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FloweryElizabethanEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FloweryElizabethanEnglish">Flowery Elizabethan English</a>). It ends with him locking away the main computer user, and throwing the electronics into the river.

<ul><li> Having to be fully aware of the irony, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DougWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DougWalker">Doug Walker</a> had a rant in one of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a> vlogs about how the internet and iPhones make us scared to be alone.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ToBoldlyFlee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ToBoldlyFlee">To Boldly Flee</a></em> viciously parodies this trope for all it's worth. A huge subplot is the impending government bill SUCKA, which is a satirizing of the SOPA bill. The government official trying to push it through and deliberately shut down internet reviews is named Lame R. Prick (the person who sponsored SOPA was named Lamar Smith), and he is ridiculously clueless as to how the internet and computers actually work (he tries to turn one on by smacking the monitor, and tells his assistant at one point "I only write Internet policy, I don't understand how it works!"). In the commentaries, the reviewers had a good bit to say about their time fighting against SOPA, and their opinions on whatever is coming next.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder24');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western Animation&nbsp;</div><div id="folder24" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> A memorable episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheProudFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheProudFamily">The Proud Family</a></em> portrayed downloading songs from the Internet as being like drug addiction. Napster (or, as they called it, "E-Z-Jackster") is <em>eeeeeeeevil</em>. It also shows how downloading stuff for free severely affects the economy causing people to lose jobs.
</li><li> Another Disney series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDragonJakeLong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDragonJakeLong">American Dragon: Jake Long</a></em> did an episode which rips into blogging: when Jake goes online and vents about his annoying teacher, every magical creature in the city immediately assume he's putting out a public contract on the man's life, and the assassination attempts commence. This may be an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">Be Careful What You Wish For</a>.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures">Jackie Chan Adventures</a></em>, Uncle, who is a real wizard and not technology-savvy, embraces the internet for the first time. After everything on the screen disappears, he concludes that the internet is evil and a creation of demons, and proceeds to literally "crash" Jade's laptop.
<ul><li> He later <em>cast an entire exorcism spell</em> after his fax machine began printing for the first time. In his defense, the first thing it printed was a symbol for a medieval cult that used evil magic.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em> episode "Lost in MySpace" double-subverts this. One of Hank's co-workers gets so into MySpace that her performance at Strickland Propane suffers, which brings her into conflict with the hard-working Hank. She sets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashMob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashMob">Flash Mob</a> after Hank and they decide to beat him up, except that they attacked Buck Strickland instead, which gets her fired. At the end of the episode, Hank tracks the woman down (using MySpace) to talk things out and she explains that she was just looking for a way to make work more fun; Hank convinces Buck to re-hire her as Strickland's social media manager and everyone's happy. Thus the episode's "villain" isn't social media itself but the unhealthy obsession with it, leading to a standard "All things in moderation" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop">Aesop</a>.
<ul><li> This is played with when Hank expresses disappointment about how all of the violent video games Bobby plays don't affect him, wondering "What's the point?"
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MuppetBabies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MuppetBabies">Muppet Babies</a>.</em> The babies all play video games, but Piggy and Gonzo keep hogging the system in a fierce rivalry over <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct">The Tale</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZelda">of Imelda</a></em>. In addition to featuring some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">surprisingly obscure gaming references</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop">Aesop</a> of the episode is about sharing and good sportsmanship, as opposed to there being anything wrong with the games themselves.
</li><li> Exaggerated example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug">Doug</a></em>, where the title character's obsession with a videogame console quickly begins wrecking his grades and personal life. Instead of turning this into a reasonable lesson on setting priorities and self-regulating one's behavior, Doug is more or less <em>only</em> able to function normally after he ditches the console.
</li><li> Exaggerated by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures">Tiny Toon Adventures</a></em>, which had several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> jabs at videogames as being a mindless, corrupting waste of time<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12r89n');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note12r89n" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12r89n');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">That cartoons themselves have faced the exact same accusation from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> for <em>decades</em> was apparently lost on the writers.</span>, taking its criticism of them into outright vitriol on occasion. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">Of course the show had plenty of games based on it.</a> Even better, Steven Spielberg is a gamer himself. He was reported to have visited Sega's headquarters on occasions and played their games before anyone else, and eventually went on to develop the game series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BoomBlox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BoomBlox">Boom Blox</a></em>.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>, Peter's ignorance was initially attributed to watching too much television in the first season episode "I Never Met the Dead Man," though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>, it has also been attributed to alcohol abuse and mild mental retardation.
</li><li> Played with on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em> holiday episode "Anatomy Park", where Jerry takes away the family's phones for a day of socializing with their family. At the end of the episode, everyone enjoyed themselves even without their devices, deciding to take a break and check on them once more. This happens to be when Rick steps in (who, mind you, had been absent for most of the episode) and chastises the family for being on their phones.
