And there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake">Unwinnable by Mistake</a>, where a glitch prevents you from winning.
</p><p>And then there's <em>this</em>.
</p><p>This situation is for when you can render your game Unwinnable by doing something utterly dumb, or something no sane player would attempt in any conceivable gameplay.
</p><p>This trope overlaps both with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake">Unwinnable by Mistake</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign">Unwinnable by Design</a>. Usually it is the testers' job to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurphysLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurphysLaw">think of the craziest possible decisions a player might make</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight">and make sure the game still works properly</a>. On the other hand, designers may decide they simply cannot prevent unwinnable situations from occurring altogether, and leave them in the game, reasoning that the player <em>deserves</em> such an outcome if they do something so obviously suicidal.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Other times, it's a reasonable oversight. When the fruits of a few dozen programmers gets into the hands of thousands or even millions of players, odds are a number of them are going to be far more creatively insane than anyone could realistically account for. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight">Developers' Foresight</a> for examples of where they actually <em>do</em>, though.
</p><p>In many genres, it's nearly impossible to avoid it. For example, in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter">First-Person Shooter</a>, the player can fire away all the ammunition, enter a fight with a health bar at nearly zero, and save. In a strategy game, one can stay still, not gathering or building anything, and when the enemy attacks with overwhelming force, save. Basically, in almost any game that allows you to save at any time, you can save just before (and sometimes just <em>after</em>) a death, when it's too late to do anything about it. The latter case can occasionally overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake">Unwinnable by Mistake</a> in a game with quicksaves, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory">if you hit quicksave when you meant to hit quickload and have no other saves</a>; autosaves can lead to a similar situation, although you usually need to be playing the game in a slightly-insane manner for it to happen.

<p></p><ul><li> In various types of Business &amp; City Builder <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimulationGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimulationGames">Simulation Games</a>, wasting the starting cash on stupid items and failing to create the basic infrastructure to earn money to progress is this. This sort of situation was what caused the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SimCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SimCity">SimCity</a></em> to add a lose condition. If you mess up too bad, you get a game over. It can happen in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CitiesSkylines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CitiesSkylines">Cities: Skylines</a> as well, but in that game in the basic sandbox mode, if you run out of money without having built the city start properly, you don't lose, your city just sits there empty until you quit.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZooTycoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZooTycoon">Zoo Tycoon</a>:</em> If you spend too much of your money and don't have enough animals and/or things to sell to get some back, you can be put in a situation were you cannot buy more animals and things, and if you don't have enough animals because they all died or something, you cannot even slowly make more money because you won't get enough guests. The only solution other than restarting or loading a save file is to use a cheat code to make more money.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo">Diablo</a></em> has strong <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Roguelike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Roguelike">roguelike</a> influences and can screw you over in numerous other ways.
<ul><li> When you die, the save function is disabled, but not <em>immediately</em>. Yes, saving at this point makes the current game unwinnable. It requires timing by the milliseconds, though. A frame too late and the game disables the save function. The easiest way is probably to get a +HP item and then get yourself down to health lower than said item provides you. When you remove the item, you die. If you click and press ESC almost exactly at the same moment, you get to save without having that item on you. No, there is no time to put it back on.
</li><li> It's possible to make the game unwinnable by abusing the Chamber of Bone entrance in a hilariously stupid way. You need to teleport there before you use the book to open it (either with a scroll of teleport or using a scroll of town portal then going there from town) and leave yourself stuck in a sealed room. Yes, you need to be completely stupid to do this unless you're doing it intentionally for the lulz.
</li></ul></li><li> Play through <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em> without ever taking a level or making a hard save. Get into a fight with an autosave at the start that you can't win at your low level. It's also possible to make the two candidates of the Orzamar throne distrust you, forcing a hard restart.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Banished" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Banished">Banished</a></em>, you can make it impossible to expand your town by wasting all your stone and iron (for instance by making tools and paved roads) and/or abandoning them on the other side of a river and dismantling the bridge that leads there, leaving you without enough stone to rebuild it. Since your only source of those two resources besides gathering are the Mine and Quarry (and they require stone and iron respectively) is the Marketplace (which also requires Iron to build) you're essentially left stranded.
</li><li> It's possible to make <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterRancher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterRancher">Monster Rancher</a> 2</em> unwinnable. You get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a> if, at the start of the month, you have less than 10 G and are unable to feed your monster. In normal gameplay the only way to get this situation is if you saved after the last tournament of the month your monster could possibly enter, you have no items to sell, your monster is too young to sell, all of your monsters in storage are too young to sell, and your monster never brings you any item you could possibly sell for money out of the blue. Another, easier way is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressStartToGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressStartToGameOver">combine monsters at the very start of the game until you run out of money, gaming over before you make it to the ranch at all</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MythTheFallenLords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MythTheFallenLords">Myth: The Fallen Lords</a></em>: in mission 22 "River of Blood" your army starts before a massive wall and your objectives are to enter the perimeter and secure a bridge inside the area. The only gate is blocked by a wooden palisade, but you can blow it up with your dwarves. Unless for some reason you decide to kill them, forcing you to restart since there aren't other units capable of throwing explosives thus becoming stuck outside the wall.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokOnline">Ragnarok Online</a></em>, certain maps have mesas or other landforms or rooms that can only be accessed by teleporting to a random cell on the map. A player who doesn't have the teleport skill can use a flywing item to teleport until they arrive at one of these places, and if they run out of teleporting items on that exact teleport and don't know the skill, they are stuck because these places usually don't spawn monsters and if you are at a high level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable">it's unlikely a monster would be able to kill you anyways</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">even if you took off all your armor and buffs and stood there letting it try to hit you for an hour</a>. There are ways to fix this involving the help of another person (like contacting a GM to help you, or another player to teleport until they get there too and hand over some flywings or Butterfly Wings, get close enough to trade, kill you themselves, or warp you), but on your own, there is no way to get out of the situation, to the point that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> players with the Warp Portal skill would make save points at these places and place warps under random people's feet, teleporting them there without warning and, if they happen to not have teleporting items handy, without any convenient way to leave.

It's unwinnable because the game breaks when bosses are defeated out of the scripted order, and insane because executing it requires you to do a very tricky Shinespark to a path you shouldn't even know exists at that point, then navigate through several areas without the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteFlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteFlight">Space Jump</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime2Echoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime2Echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a></em>, it's possible with some heavy-duty glitch exploitation to skip the scene where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSpilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSpilling">Samus loses her gear to the Ing</a>. The game can continue somewhat normally from there... but under no circumstances should you return to the area where that scene takes place. If you do, then the scene will play again, and all of your items will be lost. If you already collected them, then you can't collect them again.
</li><li> In the American and Japanese versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidZeroMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidZeroMission">Metroid: Zero Mission</a></em>, if you are gunning for a Hard Mode minimalist run<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ahlp');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0ahlp" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ahlp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In Easy and Normal mode, you get five missiles per powerup as opposed to two, so it is still passable in those difficulties</span>, make sure you have either (a) a second Missile tank (or a Super Missile Tank) or (b) the Screw Attack before fighting Mother Brain because in Chozodia, there is a segment where you need three missiles (or two as another wall can be broken with the Screw Attack) to get out of.

<ul><li> It's possible to find a 2-block deep hole in the (indestructible) Bedrock, and jump in with nothing in your inventory. Be sure that the area around you is also lit up or sealed off so that it will be impossible for any mobs to enter into the hole and kill you/aid in your escape. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit">Rage Quit</a></em>. After Beta 1.8 added a hunger meter, it became possible to starve to death in hard mode, though in peaceful mode you can't lose hunger, and in easy and normal mode you can't die of starvation.
</li><li> You can also make a pool of lava in your respawn point. This is a common <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">griefing strategy</a>, since it also ruins the game for anyone else who dies or tries to enter the server without having already created a bed-spawnpoint somewhere else.
</li><li> You can get a command block (this has to be obtained with a console command itself, even on creative) and set it up to the command <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">/kill @a</span>. This will kill everyone on the multiplayer server and yourself (even on singleplayer) if you activate the command block with a redstone impulse. The unwinnable part comes in when you set that command block to repeat mode AND always active (goes off 20 times a second), constantly killing everyone with no way to recover except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelEditor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelEditor">editing the map in an external program</a> and removing the command block.
</li></ul></li><li> It is possible to make the first two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland">Monkey Island</a></em> games unwinnable if you try very hard.

The intended path involves recovering the figurehead from a shipwreck, which requires devising a way to strengthen your spit to win a spitting contest to raise money to charter a ship (which costs 6,000 pieces of eight). However, you can get 1 piece of eight at a time for polishing one of the Men of Low Moral Fiber's peg leg; this cuts off before you get to 6,000, but if you've bought something else from the antiques dealer, you can sell it back to him to get enough. Later, when Guybrush is captured by LeChuck, he needs to strengthen his spit to escape; if you skipped that path and didn't know about the drinks, you're stuck. The CD-ROM and remakes of the game cap the amount of times you can polish his leg at 19 pieces of eight, however.

This is highly unlikely to happen by accident, since fire resistance is very easy to obtain, the Book is usually acquired right before you need to use it, and lava is rare outside the Plane of Fire (which is way past the only part of the game that requires the Book.)

Thanks to the ability to bring Chocobos on board, it's possible to permanently lose access to the airship by bringing a special Chocobo on board, parking it in an isolated area, riding your on-board Chocobo over mountains, rivers, and oceans back to the ranch, and releasing it (along with any other Chocobos you may have). In doing so, you have just lost on-foot access to the Highwind - which, as stated, is necessary to advance through the game. You no longer have any special Chocobos which might be able to bring you to the Highwind. Furthermore, it's impossible to breed any new special Chocobos because doing so requires "good" and "great" Chocobos, which are not found on the first continent.

If you overwrite your only save file then and are too weak to beat the boss... This qualifies as Insanity because the game has way more save slots than any player would need, and the game adds an extra warning just for that section before overwriting your save files telling you that you can't go back if you are too weak, so the only reason to have a single save file and overwrite it then is because you <em>want</em> to trap yourself.

The jump is rather challenging and requires careful timing. Doing this will lead you to the edifice, but the edifice's exit will be too high for Lara to reach, thus preventing her from finishing the level.

That said, they didn't find every possible trap, so some weird cube or portal manipulations may leave you <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u5mkYmD6zI">permanently trapped.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Another example would be piling cameras under the weighted companion cube to support it while it's partway on the button, going through the door where the button to open the incinerator is, and then shoot a portal to make the camera fall through and the cube come off the button, so the door closes and you're trapped.

You can get the cube stuck outside like in that video. Like GLaDOS, The Narrator never helps you, but unlike GLaDOS, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight">you do get some humorous dialogue instead.</a>

If you miss the save point teleportation power the first time by avoiding the pit outside Skytown, then miss it a second time in Stonecastle by <em>jumping over it on purpose</em>, and finally going down the upper branch of Farfall, you can end up stuck in a pit with a save point, unable to escape because you don't have the power
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillDownpour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillDownpour">Silent Hill: Downpour</a></em>, you get the Forensic Flashlight in the Centennial Building. You can switch this out with a standard flashlight in the police station if you hadn't already grabbed it. Then, if you enter the orphanage, you are stuck with a large number of enemies that are invisible without the Forensic Flashlight's ultraviolet setting. Not technically unwinnable, but getting through is statistically impossible.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em> has several that overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake">Unwinnable by Mistake</a>, involving incredibly specific glitches that require extensive work to invoke:
<ul><li> The game has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OptionalPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OptionalPartyMember">Optional Party Member</a> named Shadow, a wandering ninja you can hire temporarily. At one point in the game, if you try to take him back to your main base in Narshe, he leaves at the front gate, before you're properly inside. It's also possible to bring a one-person party with him when you hire him; this one person can be Gau, who &mdash; if you use him to fight in a special location called the Veldt &mdash; can leave temporarily. Therefore, if you use Gau to recruit Shadow, then lose Gau in the Veldt, then take Shadow to Narshe, you can end up with a zero-person party and be unable to do anything. The insanity comes from the fact that you have to traverse most of the game world on foot, then run away from most battles (so Shadow doesn't decide he's earned his fee and leave), with only two characters in your normally-four-headed party for the first leg of the adventure and only one for the later part, to pull this off.
</li><li> There is <a class="urllink" href="http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Airship_glitch">an obscure glitch<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that allows the player to end up with an airship at a stage of the game where this isn't supposed to be possible. Landing in the wrong spot can completely ruin the game's scripting. The glitch starts when you <a class="urllink" href="http://lparchive.org/Breaking-Final-Fantasy-VI/Update%2001/">play almost half of the game without saving, then deliberately die,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> which certainly explains why playtesters never caught it.
</li><li> In the original Japanese release of the game, during the Opera event, if you skip one of the rats on the rafters and finish the event they'll still be in the Opera House in the World of Ruin, however the checkpoint if you die to them is specifically in the World of Balance map. At this point dying to them will take at least half an hour of being attacked and you can kill them in one hit, but if it happens you're back in the World of Balance with all the plot triggers already tripped, and can't get back to World of Ruin. This was fixed in every other version of the game.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2">Final Fantasy X-2</a></em>: Once you pass a certain point in the story, all of the enemies in the world will have been elevated to at least mid levels. If you avoid as much experience as possible throughout the game while also skipping all side events, it is possible to reach a state in which even basic enemies are undefeatable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss">Tales of the Abyss</a></em> has a glitch where, if you remove the game disc from your console while on the world map, the mountains and oceans won't load, letting you walk anywhere. If you're dumb, you can use this to break your save file:
<ul><li> If you put the disc back into your console, the map will re-appear, and if you were standing on unwalkable terrain, you'll be stuck there. If you save in this state, you'll be stuck forever.
</li><li> If you start the Mushroom Road sidequest before entering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">The Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a>, Luke leaves the party to give place to Asch. You can then go all the way to the other end of Mushroom Road to get out to the world map (in a cliff where the Greater Flightstone is) and then use the world map glitch to get out of there without getting Luke back. This lets you play as Asch for as long as you want,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4cijp');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4cijp" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4cijp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">You can go back to Mushroom Road to get Luke back whenever you want, though</span> and Asch replaces Luke in every scene (except for one needed to get Tear's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a>, which will not trigger). If you finish the game while using Asch, you will start the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">next cycle</a> <em>without Luke</em>. Once you get to the tutorial battle, the game freezes because you don't have any character in your party. If you saved your clear data over your only file, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">you are now stuck inside Duke Fabre's Manor forever</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em>: It is possible to avoid picking up the crowbar at the beginning of the game and abuse the physics system to proceed until the Route Kanal chapter where a wall of boards is unbreakable without the crowbar and the player is gated out of being able to go back and retrieve the tool.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Curse status ailment not only instantly kills you, but it also permanently cuts your max HP in half until you cure it. Originally, getting Cursed repeatedly would keep cutting what's left of your HP in half, up to a minimum of 1/8 of your maximum HP. If you were to get Cursed to 1/8 of your max HP and not have any Purging Stones on hand with which to cure it, you could easily get trapped since pretty much anything will be able to kill you in one hit at that point. This could potentially qualify for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake">Unwinnable by Mistake</a>, but what <em>Dark Souls</em> player with any common sense would allow him/herself to be <em>repeatedly</em> Cursed? Fortunately, the game was patched to remove the stacking effect, and you can no longer go below 1/2 of your max HP.
</li><li> You can get stuck during your first run through the Painted World of Ariamis by aggroing the area boss<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5cytx');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5cytx" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5cytx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">She normally lets you leave without attacking, but will never forgive you if you hurt her.

Normally, they'll sit where you left them waiting to be picked up again, but dying or quitting the game makes them disappear permanently. After that, you're left mostly defenseless with only a weak punch to fight with. Exactly one enemy in the area drops either a shield or a spear, both weak and available in the starting area of the game. Going in under-leveled and you won't have enough natural resistance, either. Since you can't warp out the first time you get there, you'll be easily killed in one hit by pretty much everything here, boss included. You can try <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping">Cherry Tapping</a> the boss, but it will require both incredible luck AND skill. Your only other option is to power level your way out by killing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> in the area, but even then you'll have some difficulty and you'll need to get to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyHighLevelCap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyHighLevelCap">Absurdly High Level Cap</a>.

You can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead">cut off her heads</a> by dealing enough damage to them, but this amount is so high that you will most likely kill her before even cutting off <em>one</em> head unless you focus on one head exclusively. However, if you use the Warmth pyromancy to <em>deliberately heal the boss</em>, you can cut off both heads and still keep Freja alive. Without any heads, you can no longer deal any damage to her, and your only option at that point is to kill yourself and start the fight over.
</li><li> Fairly early into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenogears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenogears">Xenogears</a></em>, there is a level where Fei goes by himself into a cave piloting his gear. There is a service robot he encounters, which the game gives you the option to fight and kill. This robot also sells you gear parts, which you'll probably need to survive the wave of boss battles ahead. If you save your game after killing the robot, then the upcoming battles are nearly impossible without a gameshark. And no, you can't just grind to obscene levels, that's not how Xenogears works.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note61nw1');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note61nw1" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note61nw1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><em>Characters</em> can be improved by leveling up, but <em>gears</em> can only be improved by acquiring new parts, which the service robot is the only source of when you are stuck in the cave, and the upcoming bosses are gear-based battles.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade">Xenoblade</a></em>, one quest on the Fallen Arm spawns the Bright Wisp, which drops a key item. Unlike every other enemy that drops a key item, the Bright Wisp respawns. If you defeat it 100 times and loot 100 of these key items, the game will prompt you to discard an excess item (99 is the limit), but as it's a key item, it can't be discarded, and the game is stuck.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a></em> series, survivor bots will attempt to go to you when you're incapacitated so you can be revived. Bots are also programmed to teleport near the player's location should the bot's path finding fail and get stuck. However, should the player go down in a place the bots cannot reach them, even if it's physically possible to get there, the bots will be confused and unable to reach the player, leaving them to bleed out. This can also happen if the player goes down in some place that you can physically reach out to help them up, but because the bot's path finding isn't programmed to go to that spot, you're boned.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em>:
<ul><li> In Vault, a woman gives you a bone every time you talk to her. You only need one (to give to a dog who shows you a secret dungeon), but it's possible to fill your inventory with undropable, unsellable, entirely useless bones.
</li><li> The devs added amusing cutscenes if you do something like navigate Morgall Forest without the Force Gem (getting you stuck in Altin) or give Piers the Lash Pebble before he leaves the party (getting you stuck outside Lunpa's house). The cutscenes fix the respective problems, leaving you free to continue.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X">X3: Terran Conflict</a></em>, firing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindJump">Unfocused Jumpdrive</a> takes you to a randomly generated Unknown Sector. Firing it again takes you back to wherever you jumped from. Each firing costs a predetermined amount of Energy Cells; just in case you've used your very last to fire the unfocused jumpdrive, every Unknown Sector you spawn into has a crate of energy cells free for the taking. If you destroy that crate, however - which is almost impossible to do unintentionally - you're stuck there forever. Fortunately, the game being a mod-friendly PC exclusive means there's no situation that can't be gotten out of by cheating.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ultima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ultima">Ultima</a></em> allows plot-crucial elements to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">unobtainable</a>, overlapping with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign">Unwinnable by Design</a>:
<ul><li> Being unable to have a conversation with an NPC when the NPC's dialogue is necessary to continue or complete the game, by: killing the NPC while having no way to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead">revive</a> them, erasing them or their remains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CessationOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CessationOfExistence">from existence</a>, or putting them in a state of permanent aggro when death and revival is not an option.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVI">Ultima VI</a></em>, Glen the Mortician can turn any corpse in inventory into an urn, including the bodies of plot-critical NPCs, leaving no possibility for resurrection.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIIPartII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIIPartII">Ultima VII Part II</a></em>, the crematorium in Monitor can destroy anything, including quest items and bodies loaded with quest items.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIII">Ultima VIII</a></em>, quest items and plot-critical NPCs are lost when contacting water or lava. Items can be dropped in directly from inventory. NPCs can wander into a body of water. And both items and NPCs can be made to fall in or be knocked in through creative use of the physics engine, such as placing a series of steps and barriers near water, using throwing items like darts, or having too much fun with explosives.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em> E3M9 (Warrens), it is possible to lock yourself out of the first room by pressing the button to lower the first door in the level and then quickly running through the door before it closes. This will prevent you from beating the level.

This leaves you stuck on a balcony with the only way out being to restart. Of course, you have to be really, really trying to pull this off, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MS71OKIJtf4">as shown here.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>

This doesn't actually render your save file useless though, since a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a> simply gives you the bad ending, then sends you into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> minus all your money and any rewards you would've gotten for beating the game.
</li><li> In the SNES <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em> if you sell all your weapons before being sent to the caryards, an NPC hands you a gun that is weaker than any other gun in the game, can't be acquired any other way, and only exists to keep the player from getting stuck in the arena with no weapon. After getting back out, you can still sell all your weapons and armor, hire bodyguards and then run around accomplishing nothing until there's no money left.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StickRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StickRanger">Stick Ranger</a></em>, it is possible to sell all your weapons and then blow all your money, making it impossible to fight bosses to progress in the game or gain any new weapons.

You can't get very far without the hammer, and you'd be stuck at one part of the level without the pick axe. However, it actually is possible to get past the beginning part of the level without getting the pick axe, by getting the hammer, then breaking the rock at just the right moment that the enemy behind the rock is going the other way, then sneaking past that enemy. It's much more difficult than simply going the other direction and collecting the pick axe while doing so, and would probably never even occur to most players that it's even possible to sneak past the enemy here, and really, there's no reason to even try except for the sole reason of getting past the start of the level in a way you're not meant to, which leads to getting stuck in one part of the level, since you won't have that pick axe to climb out of an upcoming pit, and if you kill the enemy in that pit, you'll be forced to reset the game!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AncientDomainsOfMystery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AncientDomainsOfMystery">Ancient Domains of Mystery</a></em> has two bonus dungeons that only open at certain levels; the Pyramid and the Minotaur Maze.

If you gain that level while the orb is inside, the orb is irretrievable, and you can't open the locks on D:48. This is nigh-impossible to do unintentionally.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Strife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Strife">Strife</a></em>, being an early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter">First-Person Shooter</a> game with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGElements" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGElements">RPG Elements</a> and actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPCs</a>, had a few instances of this. The plot, while allowing for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">Multiple Endings</a>, was rather easy to break. One notable example, in a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust">But Thou Must!</a> conversations, you can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a> by outright refusing to advance the plot, which has the added bonus of provoking the local acolytes/rebels/etc into swarming you. There's also a certain sidequest that's less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign">Unwinnable by Design</a> and more this trope if you pick up on the hints that the person giving you that quest can't be trusted.
<ul><li> Newly created characters begin the game with the Backpack, a 16 slot bag. You can acquire up to four additional bags and change those bags as you progress, but everyone is stuck with the Backpack, which cannot be removed or upgraded &mdash; which gets annoying when endgame players have access to 30 slot bags and would really like that extra space. The dev team is aware of this, but have said in the past that one of the reasons keeping them from addressing it is that they're sure some damn fool would find a way to unequip all their bags at once and render themselves permanently incapable of ever picking anything up.
</li><li> In <em>Legion</em> a druid player revealed they were incapable of doing the quest required to gain the artifact weapon central to the new expansion. Why? They had managed to make themselves hated with the Cenarion Circle, <em>the faction all druids belong to</em>, and so could not speak with any of the NPCs. They'd PvPed extensively in that zone and killed guards, destroying their reputation. Not entirely unwinnable as they could regrind the rep in a raid, but still impressive.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftI">Starcraft</a></em> has one in the very first non-tutorial mission, "Wasteland". The mission objectives are 1) find Raynor and don't let him die 2) build a barracks 3) train 10 Marines. And yet, there's no failure trigger for being unable to train more Marines because there are no more minerals on the map. What pushes this up to Insanity is how wasteful you have to be with your minerals to reach this point: aside from the cluster of minerals near your base, there's another hidden mineral cluster that brings the total available to somewhere north of 5000 minerals. the barracks and 10 marines cost 650 minerals total, and you start with 5 marines that also count towards your total. But nothing's stopping you from blowing it all on way more Supply Depots than necessary. And such a failure trigger doesn't seem possible, given the limitations of the Trigger system shown in the <em>Starcraft</em> editor.

One segment requires you to pay five dinars to Ugarte for information (which you can haggle down to three if you "bargain" with him). If you do not have the three dinars before you first meet him, Ferrari will kick you out and you lose the game. What makes this insanity is that you received 100 dinars from Omar on the evening before your departure to Raseir, and you had less than three in-game hours to spend it all before nightfall.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGloryIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGloryIV">Quest for Glory IV</a></em>, it's possible to attack Tanya or Toby; you don't immediately lose the game if you do so, since Toby just kicks you out of Tanya's room; but at that point you still have unfinished business in Tanya's room, which you can't finish because Tanya will kill you if you go back in.
</li><li> Very early in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em> before a method of banning rule breaking players had been programmed, there was an inescapable area called the black hole that rule breakers were trapped in. When players started breaking the rules to get sent to the black hole deliberately just to see what it was like, a method of entering and leaving the black hole was added. Some players then trapped themselves in the black hole by dropping the item that allowed them to leave (possibly due to being tricked into doing this by other players).
</li><li> The MMORPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TricksterOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TricksterOnline">Trickster Online</a></em> allows you to sell or accidentally drop (destroy) quest items necessary for the story quests. They cannot be replaced, petitioning a GM will only get the response 'well you shouldn't have done that'. Although the game is still playable about 1/2 of the single player content is forever lost and all the EXP those quests can give is gone.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ALittleLilyPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ALittleLilyPrincess">A Little Lily Princess</a></em> you have a choice of activities every week. Since you need enough points to unlock activities, you can also choose to skip the week, doing no activity, in order to build up more points for the next week. If you keep refusing to do any activities at all, eventually the story mode runs out of story, leaving you with just the event-activity-choice screen, over and over again. If you <em>still</em> refuse to play an activity and keep clicking "Skip Week" until a <em>hundred weeks</em> have passed, all the activities expire and you are locked into a loop where you can't do anything but click Skip Week. Forever.

If you burn the letter in the temple brazier instead of giving it to her, you'll be unable to progress.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BubbleBobble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BubbleBobble">Bubble Bobble Plus</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiWare">WiiWare</a> remake of Bubble Bobble, while playing Classic mode, if you get an EXTEND on Round 99, something incredibly specific and up to luck, one can skip the final level (Round 100), and go to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinusWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinusWorld">Rounds 101-104</a>. Rounds 101-103 are the three secret bonus rooms, and Round 104 is the EXTEND cutscene's room. Dying once in Rounds 101-103 skips to the next round, but death in Round 104 has no effect. There's no way to attack the Super Drunk, thusly trapping the player forever. Furthermore, if you use a continue after all players die, the Super Drunk doesn't even respawn.
</li><li> In <em>Chaos</em> on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZXSpectrum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZXSpectrum">ZX Spectrum</a>, a wizard's summoned creatures can't use close-quarters attacks on friendly units. But the developer forgot to do the same for ranged attacks. This means a situation can arise where a wizard kills their last opponent (which would normally end the game with a victory) but then turns their ranged units on their own wizard and knocks themself out of the game, too. With no players now left, the game plays out its remaining turns as a series of empty screens, and finally declares a draw.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a></em>.
<ul><li> During the Prologue, Gorion casts a number of Level 3 spells but autokills any enemy he targets with the spell once it is cast. Stay out of his line of sight and use spells like Cloudkill or Stinking Cloud to pacify him from a distance, then awaken him with offensive spells, arrows or melee. The best option possible is to bounce a lightning bolt off the stairs so it hits him multiple times. Killed Gorion, Candlekeep can't be left. The spells mentioned can only be learned after you leave Candlekeep, so you have to go out of your way to import an old character for this to happen.
</li><li> It is possible for your main character to be killed the right moment where you cross a transition into another area. This might lead to an autosave. If for some reasons you didn't do any other previous save and this one overwrites your only autosave, you're basically condemned to reload a perpetual dead character until you restart.
</li><li> Some plot relevant items can be dropped in area with limited access, that will become unavailable after leaving them.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic">Might and Magic</a> IV</em>, people running around with no space in their inventory can lose the one unique weapon required to harm the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>. It is actually possible to get another copy of the weapon with a cheat code &#150; then again, you might be playing a translated version where the code was changed into something undocumented.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em>:

You don't get a game over, but you take a massive hit to your Rank from which it is impossible to make up the difference, meaning it is not possible to get in touch with Jennifer at the point in the game when you require it.
</li><li> There's a glitch in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em> where, if you inexplicably decide to backtrack all the way to the bottom of the comms towers after a certain point in the late game, the lift back to the top of the comm tower will never appear.
</li></ul></li><li> It is possible in older versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne">Bloodborne</a></em> to trigger Rom, defeat her, then trigger Amelia and defeat her then touch the skull, effectively reverting the Moon Phase back to Night right after a player had it at the Blood Moon phase, which walls off parts of the game and ruins a play-through. In order to do this, a player had to deliberately sequence break the game using glitches only a speed-runner would actively be trying to use.
<ul><li> It is possible to fight two cut bosses from the game by inserting specific glyphs which will never come up by accident as they aren't tied to any chalice. The bosses are hard due to glitches, but if the player isn't aware that the only way to return to the dream is by throwing themselves to their death off of a cliff, the player may exhaust every other option until they realize they can't escape this area which has no lantern. As such, without this knowledge, the player dooms themselves to a glitches area they can never leave, and the game autosaves the players progress upon entry.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em>: Sending a calling card forces the treasure of a Palace to materialize, and stealing that treasure is the final step in clearing a dungeon. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItOnlyWorksOnce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItOnlyWorksOnce">It Only Works Once</a>; after sending the card, you start the next day at the Palace with no way out except defeating the boss, and there's nothing stopping the player from exhausting their resources against other enemies in the Palace first. Mercifully, the game does give you an escape clause: in the event that Joker runs out of HP, you can restart to the prior morning before sending the calling card, or if it's too close to the time limit, you can return to one week before the deadline.

Attacking friendly NPCs in this game is never necessary (and while it might be in character for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntimagicalFaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntimagicalFaction">Ziguranth</a> PC, the campaign doesn't assume a raving fanatic).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FallenLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FallenLondon">Fallen London</a></em> has an unusual example where an Unwinnable by Insanity ending is deliberately put into the game: the Seeking Mr Eaten's Name storyline is designed to repeatedly punish the player character in every possible way, culminating in a final choice which will render their character permanently unplayable, without any positive consequences at all, and requiring the player to spend real world money for the dubious privilege. What makes this Insanity is that the game <em>repeatedly</em> tells the player that following this storyline will only make things worse <em>at every stage</em>, and spells out <em>exactly</em> what will happen if you pick the final choice (even warning the player that there won't even be any interesting flavor text), and after a later update, even just entering the storyline automatically grants you an item which will immediately take you out of it at any time. As it happens, the entire thing was written as an experiment to see how far players will be willing to destroy their game just to see what comes next. As Seeking Mr Eaten's Name has become a very popular - and certainly the most well known - storyline, the answer is clear.

</li><li> In the second Vex Chamber, it's possible to push one of the blocks over or into the escape path. Since you can't pull them, you can't get it out of the path to solve the puzzle, nor can you use the escape path, for obvious reasons.

This causes the next cutscene to fail to trigger, leaving Mega Man stuck in the boss room forever. The "insanity" part comes from the fact that not only is Wily's period of vulnerability very brief, and not only does Rain Flush have a delay to it that would make it tricky to use as a split-second reaction, but it doesn't even scratch either of his previous forms (or the vast majority of bosses, for that matter), so it's hard to imagine anyone thinking to use it then.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeathGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeathGate">Death Gate</a></em>: For some reason, on the World of Stone you can drop any inventory item into lava, which irrevocably destroys the item. The game even asks if you are sure. It is probably the only way to make the game unwinnable.

The problem comes from the fact that you can hook onto <em>anything</em> big enough for a hook to latch onto. This includes, among other things <em>Reaper Leviathans.</em> Reapers usually follow quite strict patrol routes, however, they are not bound to a location. Grappling onto them results in them flailing wildly to shake you off/use your PRAWN-suit as a chewtoy, which completely negates their pre-programmed path. They often travel quite large distances while doing this, and once you un-hook and run away, they assume their patrol route <em>wherever they ended up</em>. If one (or multiple, depending on your dedication to grappling apex-predators) ends up near your base, you better hope you have a backup base ready to go, otherwise you're royally screwed.

It is very hard but possible to mess this up by not only losing out the proper solution but also losing all your treasures and access to them for some reason (e.g. getting them stolen by the dwarf), and you will end up stuck later in the game. However, this being Sierra, there are <em>far</em> easier ways to make these game unwinnable.

So they do something the simulation designers never expected: concentrate nearly all of the resources of the human race into sending a high-powered laser to Alpha Centauri, which arrives beyond the horizon of the simulation faster than humanity would reasonably be expected to get there. As a result, the simulation starts collapsing, all of space overlapping with alternate timelines and possibilities as the effect draws closer to Earth, when it is then effectively game over.

Every card has a "BCP" number in the corner, which is used for several things including tiebreakers: in case of a tie for action precedence, each player flips over the next card in their deck and higher BCP wins out. If both have the same BCP, repeat until the tie is resolved. All cards drawn are discarded <em>after</em> the tie is resolved. If one player runs out of cards, they shuffle their discard pile and start drawing cards from there. If their discard pile <em>and</em> their deck are both empty, they automatically lose. Now, if both players made their decks solely out of cards all with the exact same BCP value and they hit a tie while having the same total number of cards in their deck + discard pile, the game would go into a recursive loop until both players run out of cards, ending the match in a double loss.

While this stopped the enemies and final boss from gaining any special powers, this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFinalBossForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFinalBossForYou">prevents the Reckoning, and thus the final boss fight, from occurring</a>. This makes the session doomed to continue in stalemate for eternity.
</li><li> Two siblings had planned on playing the game with only two people rather than the larger groups it was made to be played by (to be fair, they didn't really have anyone else to play it with). This would have (barely) worked, until one of the two killed the other before the game began and then tried to play alone. This resulted in a game so severely different that it could barely be called the same game (but it appears that the game <em>was</em> designed to address this possibility).
</li></ul></li><li> Believe it or not, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Inverted Trope</a> form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableJokeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableJokeGame">Unwinnable Joke Game</a> (the Tetris game that wins itself) can be lost, but you really have to do it on purpose.

Trying to get the cheese will spring a trap that puts your scare meter over 100%, and Garfield will run out of the house in terror. But you have to be playing <em>really</em> stupidly to trigger this - the cheese is one of the first items you see, and you're unlikely to get your scare meter that high unless you're a complete beginner or just messing around.

<ul><li> Invoked in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Pikasprey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Pikasprey">Pikasprey</a>'s "Soft-Lock Picking" series, where he goes out of his way to create traps that'll completely ruin his game. The trope is usually subverted, however, as the point is to try and escape these unwinnable situations without cheating, proving the game can be salvaged with enough patience and effort.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/SpoilerWarning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/SpoilerWarning">Spoiler Warning</a> managed to get into one of these in their <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> playthrough near the end of the Dead Money DLC. At one point, the player is expected to either fight Christine to the death (and use an item to open an elevator) or ally with Christine (and have her open the elevator for you). Instead, Josh had angered Christine into turning hostile, but instead of fighting her he ran away until some timer ran out and she stopped behing hostile. The resulting mix of contradictory event flags meant that he couldn't open the elevator and Christine wouldn't either. They had to use console commands to get past it.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/SwordArtOnlineAbridged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/SwordArtOnlineAbridged">Sword Art Online Abridged</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Kayaba</a> wonders aloud if the players trapped in his game don't crave death... and not just any death, but the stupidest deaths possible, based on how they keep managing to invoke this trope. For example, Thinker agrees to a peace talk in the heart of a dungeon, doesn't bring any weapons, gear, or teleport crystals, and then believes the guy who abandons him there when he tells him calling for help is impossible because of bad reception. And to top it off, he doesn't warn the people who come to rescue him of an approaching boss, which almost gets <em>them</em> killed as well.
