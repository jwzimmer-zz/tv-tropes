<div class="indent">&mdash; <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AtopTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AtopTheFourthWall">Linkara</a></strong> reviewing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SupermanAtEarthsEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SupermanAtEarthsEnd">Superman: At Earth's End</a></em>
</div></div><p>Most children are familiar with the line "Do as I say, not as I do." A Broken Aesop is this in <em>aesop form</em>.
</p><p>Basically, a Broken Aesop is a story where a 'moral' presented just doesn't match the original moral that the story actually contained. Sometimes the resulting moral feels tacked on or just plain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">hypocritical</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Common methods of breaking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> include:
</p><ul><li> <strong>Non Sequiturs</strong>: Having the resolution rely on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWhaleAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWhaleAesop">Space Whale Aesop</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTwistEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTwistEnding">Karmic Twist Ending</a> as opposed to the logical consequences of the lesson.
</li><li> <strong>Not practicing what you preach</strong>: The characters tell other characters and/or the audience not to do something, while doing it themselves.
<ul><li> Commonly in RPGs and Westerns: a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">Thou Shalt Not Kill</a> Aesop is followed by the next major battle having the characters kill something.
</li><li> Characters preach an anti-gun or anti-violence message, while using guns and/or violence to solve their problems.
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Inconsistently applied morals</strong>:
<ul><li> Distorting the moral into "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin">It's only wrong</a> if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveEnforcement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveEnforcement">someone else does it</a>" or "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality">only if the bad guys do it</a>."
</li><li> The character learns a lesson about how the thing he desires so much is not worth it, sometimes sacrificing what he wants for the right thing to do, but in the end, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetAndSourGrapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetAndSourGrapes">he gets what he wanted anyway</a>. This is only true if the lesson was specifically about rejecting said thing.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> Trying to prove that everybody matters, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower">only once they achieve something which proves their value</a>. So still only skilled or famous people are important, they just act in an alternative way.
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Fallacious aesops</strong>:
<ul><li> Trying to teach <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">Be Careful What You Wish For</a> by using a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie">Literal</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackassGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackassGenie">Jackass Genie</a> who never actually <em>gave</em> you what you wished for.
</li><li> Saying anyone can do anything they set their mind to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkFallacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkFallacy">by their own resolve</a>, when the character was born into royalty or privilege, born with some sort of superior genetic power, is just plain talented at what they do, has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe">Powers That Be</a> on their side, or otherwise revealed to be from a powerful, significant bloodline or background explaining their greatness.
</li><li> Learning that you shouldn't be sorry for something that wasn't really your fault, when it was, or learning that you should take responsibilities and accept that it was your fault, when it wasn't.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> Learning about the folly of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge">Revenge</a> in a story where everyone the character wanted vengeance on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin">gets punished or killed for their actions anyway</a>.
</li></ul></li></ul>Not to be confused with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardTruthAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardTruthAesop">Hard Truth Aesop</a>, where the lesson is followed, but it's a lesson that parents probably won't want their kids to learn. Also not to be confused with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWhaleAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceWhaleAesop">Space Whale Aesop</a> where
the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">Aesop</a> itself is strange and/or non-standard, though the two can overlap. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnalogyBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnalogyBackfire">Analogy Backfire</a>, which is when an analogy (which may or may not contain an Aesop) makes a point that is the opposite of what it was supposed to. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolThing">Do Not Do This Cool Thing</a> is when the Aesop of "this thing is bad" fails due to clumsy presentation. See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>.

<ul><li> A commercial for CougarLife.com shows one such cougar, walking around a bar asserting the superiority of older women over younger women. She demonstrates how much more mature and confident she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">by bullying and assaulting the younger women in the bar, who are already on dates, so she can take their place</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Nothing says "Confident and Mature!" like condescending to twenty-somethings about their part-time jobs and shoving them out of their chairs.</a>
</li><li> Dr Pepper made an ad campaign based on individuality and "I gotta be me"... but the commercials had most everyone wearing near-identical red shirts with white text. While all of the text was different, in most crowd scenes everyone looked the same. They <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">sorta fixed this</a> when you could buy your own customized shirt... but then they went around <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">giving people pre-made shirts</a></em>. I guess I don't gotta be me, I just gotta be my shirt.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo">Nintendo</a> isn't immune from this either - in 1995 and early 1996, during the early years of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a>, Nintendo put out commercials about their "arcade-perfect" <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KillerInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KillerInstinct">Killer Instinct</a></em> ports and closed each commercial with "So who needs a new system?" Later in 1996, when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64">Nintendo 64</a> was released, it aired commercials asking consumers to "Change the System." A lot of said consumers did - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">just not to the system they expected.</a>
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3">PlayStation 3</a> commercial for the Move tries to say that motion control gaming is not just for children. It then shows a montage of about 6-9 games set to what may or may not be Chariots of Fire, about two of which most parents wouldn't let their child play. Even worse is the fact that a 12-year-old girl is seen playing one of the less child-friendly games. There's also the fact that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii">Wii</a> made most of its money because motion control <em>was</em> successful for family gaming, which one who is a little more cynical could say is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">the entire reason</a> Sony <em>made</em> the Move.

</li><li> In the 1970s there was a well-meaning anti-smoking PSA starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YogiBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YogiBear">Yogi Bear</a> and friends, <a class="urllink" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RfAtn8jWTaI/TjH_0nMlfqI/AAAAAAAAwZU/ychwjiTzRhc/s1600/%2524%2528KGrHqR%252C%2521lQE4lQLrciiBOLLtq%2528%25296g%257E%257E0_3.JPG">while they had been seen smoking in their cartoons, and sold merchandise featuring smoking<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>.
</li><li> Values.com sponsors the "Pass It On" series of PSAs, one of which is about <a class="urllink" href="http://www.values.com/inspirational-stories-tv-spots/128-Dishes">listening<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Its last scene shows a woman silently washing the dishes while her husband is on his cell phone. He drops it into the sink and has to fish it out, scrambling to pick his call back up, only to have his wife (still silently) take it out of his hands and smugly drop it <em>back into the sink</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser">Instead of being pissed that his wife just drowned a hundred dollar smartphone, he smiles contentedly and realizes the error of his ways</a>, and goes on to focus on listening to her. The moral breaks because the story is about <em>listening</em>, and the wife pulls this stunt <em>while her husband was on the phone</em> and <em>saying nothing out loud herself</em>. What was he supposed to be listening to, if not the person with whom <em>he was already speaking</em>? Keep in mind as well, that's not the entirety of the commercial, as there are other scenes wherein the husband does want to talk and it's the <em>wife</em> who's not listening - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">maybe that's okay somehow?</a>
</li><li> An Australian PSA about staying in school started out with a montage of a group of high school students sneaking out of class to party on a closed-off beach, set to optimistic-sounding music... And ended with a graphic depiction of all but one of them being killed by land mines, as the camera panned out to reveal warning signs about the beach being an explosive testing site. Because the ending is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina">Diabolus ex Machina</a> with no direct connection to the students' decision to cut school, the message instead becomes "don't break into fenced-in beaches"... Which is a perfectly valid Aesop, just not the intended one. Note though that this was a hoax made as a joke by a local ad agency.
</li><li> During the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, the anti-independence (No) campaign ran a video called <em>The Woman Who Made Up Her Mind</em>, which featured a woman talking to a camera in her kitchen about how this talk of independence was all very well, but did the pro-independence (Yes) campaign really know what they were talking about? Did they really know what would happen? She comes down against independence because she "just doesn't think" it will work out, but the lesson that the Yes campaign hadn't done the research and didn't know what would happen is lost, because although the No side was trying to present itself as the party of common sense, the woman doesn't have any facts to back herself up; her own doubts are entirely based on gut instinct and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets">knee-jerk distrust of politicians</a>. It was widely perceived as sexist and patronising for its portrayal of women as incapable of doing a basic Google search, and in the wake of it being shown on TV, the Yes campaign briefly overtook the No campaign in the polls.

</li><li> The Meth Project Ads are mainly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight">horrorshow</a> series about how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad">Drugs Are Bad</a>. For the most part, they do their job admirably, particularly the ones directed by Darren Aronofsky, who's kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RequiemForADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RequiemForADream">famous for that</a>, but a couple of them fall flat. They feature teenagers who wish they had been horribly injured if it diverted them from going to the place they tried meth for the first time. It fits the tone of the ads in general, but the characters are describing a catastrophic traffic accident and physical violence (implied to be a gay bashing) as being preferable to going to a party and trying meth. Meth is a bad idea, but you're a lot more likely to recover from drug addiction than the kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">complete and isolated helplessness due to crippling injury</a> being described as the preferable outcome the ad suggests.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/GotMilk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/GotMilk">A series of 1990s ads featuring milk</a> would have a situation where the character would have had great fortune if they'd just been able to drink a glass of milk and say something. However one of them had a man asked what the name of a new cookie<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note08l5y');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note08l5y" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note08l5y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">an Oreo</span> should be, and mumble "I don't know" through a mouthful of it, leading to his boss choosing the name Oreo and praising him for the idea. So the message is that if we <em>don't</em> have milk we'll do well at work?
</li><li> Believe it or not, Subway Restaurants of all people had this happen on a few occasions:
<ul><li> One ad that aired in the Halloween season had a thin and rather beautiful woman trying to convince two average guys who were eating basic fast food to give their food a try. Fair enough, but her objective for getting them to eat better was so that one could look good in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperific" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperific">female-oriented</a> Halloween costumes. So, not only is the message undermined considerably (i.e., "Don't eat at our restaurant because the food is fresh and healthier; do it so that you can lose weight, look better in skanky outfits and be ogled by strange men"), but the fact she was saying this to men made little sense (and would look a lot worse if she were approaching two <em>women</em> with the same incentive).
</li><li> Another ad featuring a popular character acting as a spokesman for the restaurant. The problem there is that the spokesman in question was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Peter Griffin</a> - you know, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard">a morbidly obese borderline sociopath</a>. Even if he did appear in the short-lived ads for purely an ironic sense, both fans and detractors of the show alike voiced their displeasure with the hypocrisy of the ads, with concerns ranging from accusing the show of selling out to confusion over why a fat guy is a spokesman for a restaurant that (supposedly) encourages a healthier lifestyle.
</li></ul></li><li> Olay's "Make Space for Women" commercial, which premered during the 2020 Super Bowl. Yes, more women <em>should</em> be involved in STEM fields, except the three women going to outer space are portrayed as ditzy, incompetent, and they even end up blowing themselves up in the end when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoesThisButtonDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoesThisButtonDo">one of them presses the big, shiny "Olay" button.</a> Not the kind of stereotypes you want to associate with women in STEM, as these are the very outdated stereotypes that prevent women from being taken seriously in actual STEM fields in the first place.

<ul><li> In his stand-up, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RickyGervais" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RickyGervais">Ricky Gervais</a> identifies the Broken Aesop inherent in a version of the children's folk tale 'The Lazy Mouse and the Industrious Mouse' that he was told by his headmaster at a school assembly. In the story, the Industrious Mouse labours long and hard to prepare himself for winter, whilst the Lazy Mouse bunks off and has fun. When winter comes, the Lazy Mouse has nothing, so goes to avail himself of the charity of the Industrious Mouse &mdash; who, after beginning a lecture about how the Lazy Mouse should have done his own preparing, suddenly turns around and invites him in to share. Gervais notes with exasperation that the moral is mangled from being "work hard and be prepared for the future" into becoming, in his words, "fuck around, do whatever you want and then scrounge off a do-gooder". He also notes that most of the pupils at that assembly took the latter aesop and "kept it up" for the entirety of their academic careers. He also points out that, thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">Rule of Three</a>, the moral of the tale of "The Boy Who Cried Wolf" is not "never tell a lie", but rather "never tell the <em>same</em> lie twice." And rounds it off by inferring that the moral of "Humpty Dumpty" must be "don't climb walls <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticAesop">if you're an egg</a>".

However, they often are, if not broken, then at least hypocritical in the face of the main action: It reminds that "you cannot spot a criminal by their facial features", while the strip is best known for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness">grotesquely ugly villains</a>. It also has exhortations for people to "get involved" when they see a crime committed, while in the strip helpful bystanders tend to quickly end up dead. And so on.
</li><li> E.C. Segar's <em>Thimble Theater</em>, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Popeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Popeye">Popeye</a> first appeared, sometimes had an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndKnowingIsHalfTheBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndKnowingIsHalfTheBattle">And Knowing Is Half the Battle</a> segment in which Popeye would teach morals.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BeautyAndTheBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BeautyAndTheBeast">Beauty and the Beast</a></em> in its various tellings usually ends up having a Broken Aesop (especially in modern versions) that is naturally an inversion of the complaint about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek">Shrek</a></em>. It's believed that the story was originally told to girls who were in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">arranged marriages</a> to men they didn't care for, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> may be involved.
<ul><li> The story is <em>supposedly</em> saying that Beauty comes to see beyond the Beast's appearance and accept him for who he is... except that they're only able to live <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter">Happily Ever After</a> when the curse is broken and he reverts to a perfect Handsome Prince (and thus comes off as "only beautiful people can love each other" instead... though this sort of neglects the fact that the transformation is the <em>Beast's</em> reward, not Belle's). In the versions where he is clearly some sort of animal or mix of animals, this "broken Aesop" cannot be avoided without getting too close to bestiality for most audience members' comfort, so for the writers this is a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">Morton's Fork</a>.
</li><li> The most well-known versions of this tale by Beaumont and Disney actually cut out the worst of the original Villeneuve story's Broken Aesopness. Villeneuve's backstory for the Prince revealed him to have been cursed by a fairy who's explicitly described as "wicked" and "ugly", whereas the good fairy who helps him break the curse is described as strikingly beautiful. Not only that, but there's a <em>second</em> Broken Aesop that emerges when the Prince's mother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalMarriageVeto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalMarriageVeto">refuses to let him marry Beauty</a> because she's a commoner; the Prince and good fairy both argue that Beauty's virtues should make her worthy of his hand on their own, but then the fairy explains that Beauty is actually the daughter of a fairy princess (it makes sense in context... sort of) and hence of royal birth after all, rendering that moral completely moot.
</li><li> There's also the broken aesop that comes from the fact that in a story that is supposed to be about not judging people by their appearances, the most notable aspect of the heroine is her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">beauty</a>. It can make the story seem a bit less about looking beyond appearances and more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyGuyHotWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyGuyHotWife">beautiful women should be willing to settle for ugly men</a>. Some variants avoid this by making Beauty's name at least partially ironic, but usually she is presented as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness">the epitome of both physical and inner beauty</a>, while her less attractive sisters are just as ugly on the inside. Not to mention how many variants <em>explicitly</em> state that the Prince is not just handsome but the handsomest man Beauty has ever seen or even the handsomest one <em>in the world</em>.
</li><li> Christian novelist Karen Kingsbury's <em>Unlocked</em> inadvertently showed up some of the problems with this story by using it as a metaphor for <em>autism</em>. The novel has a beautiful, popular high school senior named Ella (re)befriending a boy, Holden, who has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAutism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAutism">Hollywood Autism</a> and is completely noncommunicative &mdash; a situation triggered when he wants to sit in on rehearsals for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolPlay">School Play</a> of the Disney adaptation of this story as he's drawn to the music. She's playing Belle, and Holden is a metaphorical Beast figure in that he's "cursed" with autism. The whole story is about how music, friendship, and God "break" this "curse" and get him out of his shell, suggesting that autistic people cannot be appreciated for their inner qualities and have fulfilling lives unless others help them become more "normal". If the intended Aesop were being followed, the other characters would be happy with him as he is &mdash; after all, it isn't something that he can help or brought upon himself &mdash; if still helping him to have a more-rounded out life. As well, he's as physically attractive as Ella, and while the author tries to couch this as a reflection of his inner beauty, it again suggests that the hero <em>has</em> to be incredibly handsome to be worthy of the beautiful heroine... and <em>especially</em> if he's disabled.
</li></ul></li><li> The original story of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBluebeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBluebeard">The Bluebeard</a> by Charles Perrault seemed to be going for an Aesop of if you get too curious you may not like what you find. Here's the problem: Bluebeard's wife may not have liked what she found, but it still probably <em>saved her life</em> in the end, if what she found is any guide. If she hadn't looked in the forbidden room, she probably would have wound up getting on his bad side when her sister and brothers hadn't been around. The true moral should be <em>please</em> be curious. Or, "Be curious and not clumsy."
</li><li> The fairy tale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonkeySkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonkeySkin">Donkey Skin</a></em>. It's not enough that the prince loves the beautiful mystery girl who is found hiding as a scullery maid; she has to be outed as a runaway princess before the marriage is acceptable. Even though her hard work, intelligence, and bravery <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15bpr');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note15bpr" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15bpr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">and sneakiness</span> show her to be an amazing young woman.
</li><li> There are countless legends (as well as other types of works) that feature the story of a young princess who is in love with a commoner but cannot marry him because he is not of noble blood. Different stories end differently, but in the majority of cases, this "commoner" will be revealed to have noble blood by the end of the story. The often spontaneous discovery that the commoner is a prince will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlySuitableSuitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlySuitableSuitor">suddenly lift all boundaries</a>, put a satisfied smile on the king's previously-angry face, and be followed by the sound of wedding bells. In other words, while the intended Aesop is usually that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">true love conquers all</a>", it is in fact social status that conquers all, and must be properly matched before true love can do its magic. Now, this may have been fine in the days when most societies on Earth had a strict class structure - even commoners held the misconception that the nobles were somehow innately more elevated than they were, and thus should look after their bloodlines.
</li><li> One of Aesop's fables, <em>The Satyr and the Peasant</em>, is about a satyr who meets a poor traveler lost in the woods, and invites him to his home. He notices the peasant first blowing on his hands to warm them, then blowing on a bowl of soup to cool it off. The Satyr immediately kicks his guest out, declaring that "a man who blows hot and cold in the same breath can't be trusted", metaphorically meaning that someone who frequently changes his mind to avoid committing to a conclusion or to align himself with both sides of a conflict. The problem is, obviously, that the man <em>isn't</em> blowing hot and cold in the same breath, his breath is the same temperature every time! It's just that his breath is warmer than his cold hands and cooler than his hot soup, meaning he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">actually</a> being consistently <em>moderate</em>.
</li><li> Another Aesop's fables, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTortoiseAndTheHare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTortoiseAndTheHare">The Tortoise and the Hare</a></em>, is usually quoted with the moral of "slow and steady wins the race". Except, that's not what happened. The Hare only lost the race because he got overconfident and took a nap during the race. The real moral could have been "don't underestimate your opponent and get cocky." From the point of view of the tortoise, it's more that "slow and <em>steady</em> wins the race if your opponent is fast but <em>unsteady</em> enough in his progress that you can catch up". Or, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=3485">it's a fable about small sample sizes.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> Aesop's tale of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway">Boreas</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfTheSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfTheSun">Helios</a> is often used to promote the moral that gentleness wins over harshness. Except it doesn't work, because the reasons for Helios' victory and Boreas' loss are inherent to the characters. No matter how gentle wind would blow, you'd still cling on to your cloak, while you wouldn't really have any choice but to take it off if the sun suddenly flared.
</li><li> Another fable, "The Cock and the Jewel", is the very short tale of a rooster who goes scratching in the yard to find himself and his hens some food, and turns up a gemstone that someone lost from a piece of jewelry. He says that if its owner had found it, the owner would take it and put it back in its setting because it's obviously a very precious stone, but since he's a rooster and has no use for them, he'd rather have a single piece of corn than all the jewels in the world. The moral is often interpreted as "be content with your own lot", but the rooster clearly understands that a jewel has material worth to others <em>and he can talk</em>. The jewel could have bought him plenty of corn and nothing about his situation would have changed, except he would have succeeded in providing for his family. (Medieval interpretations of this fable tend to make it into a religious allegory and represent the cock as foolish: the jewel, in these versions, represents the word of God and the cock represents people who ignore spiritual matters in favor of material concerns.)
</li><li> An older (or alternate) version of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonestAxe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonestAxe">Honest Axe</a> fable apparently had the moral of "a river does not always bring axes"&mdash;that is to say, "people and circumstances aren't static, so don't always expect the same results, and what works for one person might not work for another." While it's a pretty good message, it's fallen by the wayside for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonestyIsTheBestPolicy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonestyIsTheBestPolicy">the more well-known interpretation</a>, because it doesn't really jibe with the story's events. The second woodcutter doesn't fail where the first woodcutter succeeded because of an outside circumstance or a change in terms or bad luck, he fails because he lied out of greed while his neighbor stayed truthful.

Also, Hermione, other brilliant muggleborn witch? No, she's actually the daughter of the Scarlet Witch, daughter of Magneto and potential Sorceress Supreme, and John Constantine. Same with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Carol Danvers - courageous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> (pre-powers - though as of 2019, in the comics she was always part Kree) who succeeded through wit and skill?

</li><li> Then there's the explanation that most Kryptonians have only the Golden Age power-set under a yellow sun, and only a 'Child of the Thirteen' (Krypton's ruling oligarchy) has the full set.

The only reason the Thirteen unlocked it was because their ancestors made diplomatic marriages with those few non-Kryptonian species they felt were worthy allies and could breed true with, and the hybrids essentially replaced the genes that limited their potential</span>. Exactly <em>why</em> this was done in the first place is unclear.
</li><li> It is also made clear that all those power-sets/inheritances were engineered by the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> in chief, Doctor Strange, as part of his plan to stop Thanos. He explains that it isn't so much power that counts, but personality, how the possessor <em>chooses</em> to use it. He explicitly says that he could have given <em>anyone</em> powers and all, but it takes a special person to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a>, and like Dr Erskine with Steve, he picked Harry because he was a hero <em>in spite</em> of all he had/could do, not because of it.

The problem is that, by definition, the "hunter" character has to be even more powerful than the Mary Sue, they're almost invariably the main focus of the story rather than the actual original protagonists and their job is seen as essential and all-important, they're always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatars</a> to some degree, their victory is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">Foregone Conclusion</a> and their targets are treated as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink">Hate Sinks</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">lose the moment</a> they don't have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">Plot Armor</a>, and their entire existence is based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">taking someone else's character and murdering them.</a> Sometimes this gets lampshaded, subverted, or justified, and often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters">He Who Fights Monsters</a> is introduced, but just as many introduce a sparkly elven princess with a dumb name who deserves nothing but scorn and disgust, and then treat the dimension-hopping, shapeshifting, universally-ordained hunter dripping in technology who shoots her through the head as without fault.

<ul><li> BarlowGirl's "She Walked Away" begins with a girl leaving her home and makes it sound like she was being abused and finally had the courage to leave after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">Break the Cutie</a> moment (<em>If there were tears she laughed, it's time to kiss the past goodbye</em>) but then suddenly has her family singing about how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> should tell her to please come home, making the song's apparent aesop "Home is where the heart is, even if you're being abused." Alternately, she was just a plain ol' runaway. The lyrics are ambiguous.
</li><li> "'Right!', Said Fred" by Bernard Cribbins is about three men trying to move something into another room but they end up taking the things off the "so-and-so" and removing the door, wall, and ceiling of the house. Its apparent moral is "don't be hasty", but it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPun">falls apart</a> when you realise that none of the things they did were hasty <em>per se</em>&mdash; Charlie is usually the one to suggest them (while it's the titular Fred who's called out for being "hasty"), and he always "has a think" before suggesting something. If anything, the moral should be "taking things off is sometimes a bad idea".
</li><li> The Double Take song "Hot Problems" is about two girls "singing" that even though they're hot, they're still imperfect and have their fair share of struggles. At the very end, they laugh and say, "Just kidding; we're perfect!"
</li><li> Parodied by the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FlightOfTheConchords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FlightOfTheConchords">Flight of the Conchords</a></em> song "Think About It", which takes a swipe at well-meaning but ultimately fatuous protest songs. The song raises moral issues but completely misses the point of them:
<div class="indent"><em>They're turning kids into slaves <br> Just to make cheaper sneakers <br> But what's the real cost? <br> 'Cause the sneakers don't seem that much cheaper... <br> Why're we still paying so much for sneakers when you've got them made by little slave kids? <br> What is your overhead?</em>

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a>'s "They Don't Care About Us" has an anti-bigotry/injustice message, even name-dropping Martin Luther King, Jr. at one point. But thanks to poor context, the lines "Jew me, sue me" and "Kick me, Kike me", which were supposed to be refer to Jews <em>being treated</em> badly rather than Jews <em>treating others</em> badly, were misinterpreted as anti-Semitic (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreedyJew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreedyJew">the "sue me" rhyme didn't help Jackson's case</a>). These two lines were changed for the single release and later pressings of the album as a result.
</li><li> Some of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift">Taylor Swift</a>'s songs fall victim of this:
<ul><li> "Mean" is one example. First she states that she won't let the "mean" girl who insults and bullies her draw her into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge">Cycle of Revenge</a>... and then she spends the rest of the song mocking her for how "pathetic" and "alone in life" she is and how she'll never been anything other than "mean". Worse, the song was reportedly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> aimed towards a music critic who slammed Swift's singing. The lesson seems less like "Don't bully other people" than "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">Don't bully Taylor Swift</a>."
</li><li> Then you have "You Belong With Me", where she plays a high school girl who steals another girls boyfriend but only after she dresses and acts exactly like her, despite the music video implying that the original girlfriend was unsavory by virtue of dressing the way she did. The boyfriend seems content in choosing the hotter girl, as looks appear to be top priority.
</li></ul></li><li> "Ridin'" by Chamillionaire (ft. Krayzie Bone) has a message about being racially profiled, but then brags about smoking weed and driving drunk, making it look like the cops are actually justified in wanting to catch them "ridin' dirty".
</li><li> Meghan Trainor:
<ul><li> "All About That Bass" by promotes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop">Aesop</a> that you are beautiful and your body is fine the way it is, but then refers to "skinny bitches", which naturally generated a lot of criticism for undermining its message and stereotyping women based on their weight. This generally ignores the second half of the verse, which acknowledges that thin women can also be insecure about their bodies and that they are perfect from the bottom to the top too. Some other lines also imply that beauty is based on others' opinions. It's also worth noting that the heavyset male dancer in the music video is portrayed as effeminate, campy, and humorous, while the actor playing Meghan's boyfriend is slender. Plenty of men/boys have issues with Body Image, and presenting such a Double Standard doesn't help. It becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight">Harsher in Hindsight</a> after she told <em>People</em> magazine that she tried to go "anorexic" (she really just tried dieting), which was pretty insensitive towards people who actually have eating disorders. Plus, despite promoting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGoGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGoGirl">"girl power"</a>, she claims that she's <em>not</em> a feminist because she thinks it carries a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist">negative connotation</a>, which makes most of her songs seem like Broken Aesops. There's a Bowdlerized version of "All About That Bass" which changes the line "boys like a little more booty to hold at night" to "boys like their girls for the beauty they hold inside"... which completely contradicts the intended message about body positivity.
</li><li> Trainor continued this with "Dear Future Husband", ostensibly a song about treating a female partner properly for a good relationship, but the song relies on decades-outdated gender roles, and the tone of the song is much more aggressive and demanding than it lets on, with statements like "you have to <em>always</em> agree with me or else <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LysistrataGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LysistrataGambit">you won't get sex</a>" and "My family is more important than yours".
</li></ul></li><li> The Finnish song "Albatrossi" ("Albatross") by Juha Vainio tells the story of two childhood friends who went their different ways; the narrator wishes he had been like the other, who took charge of his own life and became a sailor. The central explicit metaphor is that the sailor is like a tireless (and free) albatross, while the narrator has been like a gull, "the man who doesn't finish his work and who builds everything on mere dreams." But the actual story before this was that the sailor ran off to the sea when fifteen, while the narrator stayed behind studying and working as he was expected to do &mdash; and regretted not following his dreams. The sailor may have been more determined to seize the day, but the difference between the characters was hardly that he worked harder instead of building his life on a dream.
<ul><li> The song is based on one of Juha Vainio's childhood friends, who indeed did become a sailor. But given to the fact Juha Vainio had quite hollow legs, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDrunkenSailor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDrunkenSailor">flip side of the maritime life</a> would most likely have proven him disastrous.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>The Christmas Shoes</em> by NewSong gets a lot of criticism for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">less sentimental</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq10bz3PxyY">interpretation of its message<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> , but the message itself is broken just by the events of the song. The opening lines paint the narrator's obligate gift-buying as being against the spirit of Christmas, but the whole point of the story is that the little boy is spending Christmas Eve trying to buy a material gift for his dying mother so she can look beautiful when she meets Jesus... instead of actually spending time with her.
</li><li> Coven's <em>One Tin Soldier</em> is an illustration of the perils of using a moral ideal to justify mistreating others, sarcastically encouraging the audience to go ahead and be an asshole "in the name of Heaven" because you'll always be able to say you did the right thing (and there won't be anyone to call out the winner if they make sure all the losers are dead). Unfortunately, the actual story being told to the children is a fable about the Valley People sacking the Mountain People's castle to steal their treasure, only to find that the treasure is just the idea of peace. The moral fails because the Valley People demand literal gold, and rather than just saying that there <em>isn't any</em>, the Mountain People offer to share their treasure and just never send anything back. Sure, the Valley People are greedy dicks, but the conflict was a matter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">Poor Communication Kills</a>, not a moral issue. It also fails because the Valley People never actually try to justify their actions and their motives are nakedly "take their stuff because we can".

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LemonDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LemonDemon">Lemon Demon</a> song "Geeks in Love" has a fairly good (if tired-out) message by itself, that it is better to be unique and spend time with the rare person who shares your own interests than to be hip and hang with the crowd. However, its music video by Albino Black Sheep functions largely as a tribute to every other annoying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Internet fad</a> in the world, and aligning them with the interests of the eponymous couple. It's not really individualism when you swap one dull set of pop-culture icons out for another just like it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a> examples:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MichaelJacksonsGhosts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MichaelJacksonsGhosts">Michael Jackson's Ghosts</a></em>, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, is a story of how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueBeautyIsOnTheInside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueBeautyIsOnTheInside">True Beauty Is on the Inside</a>, and how just because a person is "different" from others doesn't make them bad. Unfortunately, the two characters Jackson plays both break the aesop. The bigoted Mayor &mdash; a fat, middle-aged white guy &mdash; is presented as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableProfessionalTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableProfessionalTargets">Acceptable Professional Target</a> throughout, with no redeeming qualities. The ostensibly good Maestro &mdash; effectively Jackson himself &mdash; magically imprisons the angry mob confronting them and tortures the helpless Mayor, proving he really was the dangerous "freaky boy" the Mayor accused him of being! Even if you ignore the Mayor and the mob of paranoid parents, the Maestro is still a necromancer who regularly summons a bunch of undead to do his bidding. That's a legitimate concern for an otherwise normal suburban neighborhood.
</li><li> The music video of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bad">Bad</a>" has Michael being bullied by gang members for being a pussy because he refused to "rob" people and doesn't hang down with them a lot. Michael confronts them by &mdash; suddenly appearing in a leather outfit and doing an impressive sing-and-dance routine where he boasts about how "bad" he is. In the end the others who doubted him do respect him. So... what was the message exactly? Give in to peer pressure? It's good to be "bad", because you would rather be called that than being called a coward? Being "bad" equals being a good singer and dancer? It seems that Michael was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint">Comically Missing the Point</a> the gang member was trying to make.
</li><li> "Black or White" has the "panther dance" near the end of the video, where Michael smashes up a car and windows and then transforms into a black panther. It confused a lot of people, especially because the violence is such a contrast with the rest of the video. And the black panther also brings up associations with the Afro-American Black Panther movement, whose members weren't always that peaceful or tolerant to non-blacks either. In later broadcasts the panther dance was cut from the video, which makes it work a whole lot better on its own. When it was finally reinstated racist messages were digitally added to the things Michael smashes in the video, giving it a more understandable context.
</li></ul></li><li> Notorious B.I.G and Puff Daddy's video for <em>Mo' Money, Mo' Problems</em> stars Puff as a golf champion who laments over his recent acquisition of wealth in lieu with the song's title. For some reason, that doesn't seem to stop him from rapping for about three minutes about how awesome it is to be rich.
</li><li> The music video for Pink's "Stupid Girls" contradicts the song's message by associating stupidity with make-up, fashion and anything pink, and implying that playing football makes you smarter and a better person while playing with dolls makes you stupid. What's more is that she holds up a girl being a back-up dancer for 50 Cent is an example of stupidity, which ignores that dancing is a very strenuous activity and someone is bound to be in great shape if they're doing it professionally.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a>'s song "Radio Ga Ga" is all about how music video is ruining music and we should all just listen to the radio instead. The accompanying music video features lavish sets and costumes, footage from the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Metropolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Metropolis">Metropolis</a></em> and a montage of clips of music videos from earlier Queen songs.
</li><li> The animated music video for Teddyloid's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/JapanAnimatorExpo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/JapanAnimatorExpo">ME!ME!ME!</a> is pretty intense and is subject to a few varying interpretations, but the message is laid out fairly clearly no matter which one you go with: mass-produced, consumer-driven sexuality is damaging and unsatisfying compared to real relationships. For all the otherwise well-done and disturbingly powerful imagery, it contrasts the mass-produced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe">Moe</a> sex kittens with the "real" girl by... having the real girl look more or less exactly like them, except she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadonnaWhoreComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadonnaWhoreComplex">dresses modestly and</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">is crying helplessly and in danger</a>. It's really not helping the message to design your bad-girl villains according to the emotionally-manipulative design tropes of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe">Moe</a> type, and then use those exact same emotionally-manipulative design tropes to make your good-girl damsel more sympathetic to the audience.
</li><li> The music video for Disturbed's <em>The Vengeful One</em>, a song about blaming the media for mass shooters, has the band's mascot/avatar... going on a shooting spree against the media, breaking into the news building and gunning down as many of them as he can. It even includes phrases straight out of a psychotic active shooter's manifesto, like "I'm the hand of God, I'm the dark messiah". It turns the aesop from "Stop giving mass shooters attention, it just creates more of them" to "Mass shootings are okay and actually very cool as long as you pick the right target".

<ul><li> Pro wrestling is, at best, a weird place to promote anti-bullying sentiments and at worst, actively undermined by the content of the product (where even the biggest babyface is still going to be using violence and trash talk to resolve his problems) but WWE soldiers on anyway in the interest of doing some good in the world. However, they are still a pro wrestling promotion, and WWE was called out on the dissonance of their anti-bullying campaign "Be A Star" in 2011 by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheWrestlingObserverNewsletter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheWrestlingObserverNewsletter">The Wrestling Observer Newsletter</a> awards by "winning" the award for "Most Disgusting Promotional Tactic" due to their mistreatment of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimRoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimRoss">Jim Ross</a> at the time of this campaign.
<ul><li> Others have pointed out that WWE have a long history of enabling or even actively encouraging extreme bullying and hazing not only between wrestlers but also towards other employees. Although supposedly toned down from the old days it is allegedly still going on, to the point that some people have been driven out of the company.
</li></ul></li><li> A little more understandable but still troublesome is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a>'s "Rise Above Hate" slogan. Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane">Kane</a> was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope">deliberately</a></em> trying to get Cena to break this Aesop and "Embrace the Hate"... but if you examine the two characters of John Cena and Kane carefully, you'll see that a problem has existed there from the very beginning. After all, Cena is hardly brave for refusing to surrender to feelings of hate when he is world-famous, absurdly successful, fabulously wealthy, and is loved by at least a bare majority of the WWE Universe - and thus, has no reason in the world to experience hate. Conversely, is Kane really such a monster for being so full of hate when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">he was nearly burned to death as a child, suffered years of psychological trauma that left him unable to speak for a long time, accidentally killed his high school sweetheart in a car crash (and had this revealed on live television, along with the lie that he killed the girl on purpose and then had sexual intercourse with her corpse), lost the unborn child he fathered and was betrayed by his wife, was tricked into causing the death of his father, and in general is loathed and ignored by the better part of the human race</a>?
</li><li> In late 2000, WWE Commissioner Mick Foley addressed his concern about the growing extreme violence and vicious behavior that Superstars were committing between one another, highlighted by Stone Cold Steve Austin having tried to murder Triple H in a car at Survivor Series. Foley's solution to reign in the violence? Put his six biggest stars all together in a Hell in a Cell Match!

In <em>Les Fourberies de Scapin</em>, he also makes <em>2</em> pairs of people revealed to be actually brother and sister.

</li><li> The concept of there being "no day but today," which is sung about a lot, is subverted in the second act through the use of passage of time: the first act, in which the mantra occurs extremely frequently, takes place in one day while the second takes place over the course of a year (in which the mantra is shown to be faulty at best).
</li><li> <em>Rent</em> also likes to complain about how hard it is to be an artist, but any kind of artistic job working for someone else would be selling out. One wonders what would happen if Roger actually starts selling CDs. Or, indeed, if <em>Rent</em> itself becoming so extremely lucrative means we shouldn't listen to it as it sells itself out...
</li><li> For people who spend the whole time talking about love and loving life, the circle of friends seems to have a lot of cheating, poor communication, and emotional sniping at each other - no one is enjoying themselves very much, or following Angel's lauded example. And, for that matter, Collins, who spends his time loving Angel and loving life with Angel ends up pretty much broken because of Angel's death.

<ul><li> According to the finale, electricity and diesel fuel will eventually run out, but somehow steam power is sustainable. What exactly are we burning to get this magical steam? Also wood/coal burning steam engines are better than environmentally friendly options like solar and nuclear power. This last one may be because it was written in the 1980s.
</li><li> In the closing number "Light At The End Of The Tunnel," the characters do briefly consider solar and nuclear energy, but then dismiss them because 1) How is one supposed to make use of solar power at night? and 2) People would get poisoned by nuclear fallout. Legitimate complaints, oversimplified, to be sure - but, then, this <em>is</em> a children's story.
</li><li> Richard Stilgoe, the show's lyricist, knew full well that steam engines polluted the environment; he claimed that it was far easier for audiences to sympathize with a steam locomotive than a diesel or electric one, since steamers had more of a historical precedent. But the finale, according to him, is meant to symbolize the triumph of "old-fashioned craftsmanship" over new technology. Take a moment to consider why a steam locomotive is not a suitable representative of "old-fashioned craftsmanship."
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Wicked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Wicked">Wicked</a></em>:
<ul><li> Wicked's primary question, 'what makes one wicked?,' and all the messages that go with it, end up mildly broken due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> adaptation. For all of Elphaba's problems, in the musical, she is never truly wicked, so the musings seem kind of pointless. Also, the (admittedly depressing) aesop of 'No good deed going unpunished' is broken by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Elphaba getting a happy ending</span> in contrast to the extreme <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a> of the book.

Our heroes are the Bohemians, underground rebels who oppose the mainstream and wish to reclaim the old ways. At the end of the show our heroes realize that in order to defeat the villains they have to perform an awesome song, mainly Queen's "We Will Rock You". They decide to also broadcast the performance so that the whole world will see and then become Bohemians too. So, mindlessly following trends was bad when it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets">pop music</a> and bright colors, but it's okay when the stuff <em>you</em> like is what is being consumed.

It feels very awkward, however, when the big message that "there is no God" is delivered by one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts">Ancient Astronauts</a> from the species that created life on earth.
</li><li> In a case of a perfectly decent moral being killed by a followup, the ending of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ThePhantomOfTheOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ThePhantomOfTheOpera">The Phantom of the Opera</a></em> was the Phantom letting Christine go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy">because he recognized that she wouldn't be happy with him</a>, because he's a psychotic murderer and she isn't. Moral - "If you really love a person, recognize their right to turn you down." There's also the fact that the Phantom is a pariah because of his appearance, and the main reason he is the way he is owes to this unfair ostracism. Moral - "Bad people are, often, only victims of their environment and could change if they were ever shown kindness." But in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LoveNeverDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LoveNeverDies">Love Never Dies</a></em>, the distant sequel, it's proclaimed that Christine actually <em>was</em> pining for the Phantom, they have an illegitimate kid, and her life with her actual love interest Raul is shown to be unhappy. Meanwhile, the Phantom has become incredibly wealthy and is surrounded by an entourage and admirers, but he's just as much of a violent possessive weirdo as ever. This pretty handily breaks both morals; turns out that the Phantom was right to try to keep Christine to himself forever, and he'd be an asshole no matter what.

In the original version, "The Landlord's Game", the traditional win state where one player owns all the properties was meant to be seen as a <em>failure</em> &mdash; not of the player, but of the capitalist system that allowed it to happen. The players were then expected to play again with modified rules that would result in a stalemate, which would be a successful state as it represents a stable economy of multiple stakeholders. Of course, players found this extremely boring and far preferred playing to win, leading to "everyone's happy with a dictator in charge as long as it might be them".

However, there are issues with this, since the fanboys are always Gamecube fans, the evil Gamer King in an early strip used a staff with a golden Gamecube controller on top (versus Ethan's Xbox one), Ethan playing a Gamecube is referred to as a "sin against the gaming gods"; he mentions that turning the Gamecube into a robot would result into a girl robot, and doing the same to a Playstation would produce a gay one while the Xbox appears to be perfect and sinless.

The author stated that he made the opposite ends of the spectrum so close to show how meaningless the whole thing was, and true to form, the audience is clearly intended to view the practice as wrong and side with the trolls opposed to it... except trolls do <em>not</em> differ only in blood color; it is shown that highbloods actually are stronger, more psychically resilient, and longer-lived, albeit more violent (which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">the trolls</a> would probably consider a <em>good</em> thing anyway) but compensate by having less powerful psychic abilities than lowbloods.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/JackDavidHopkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/JackDavidHopkins">Jack</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Hell Is That Noise</em> is the story of Todd, a soldier who obeys an order to kill children, commits suicide, and ends up in Hell. He argues that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders">he had no choice</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotFightFate">Fate had already decided what would happen in his life.</a> The story and everyone in it judges Todd for refusing to take responsibility for his actions, but that order came from <em>Satan</em> disguised as a general, meaning that Todd was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicPlaything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicPlaything">Cosmic Plaything</a> after all.
</li><li> The non-linear nature of time in Hell tends to screw around wildly with the concept of free will and personal choice; the Devil <em>often</em> resorts to directly manipulating the circumstances of the past and future in order to compel his victims to act, and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">blame them for it all</a>. This is most notable with <em>Drip</em>: It's his own fault that his parents are dead because the Devil has him in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a>: he's sent to live with his grandmother after his parents die, his grandmother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">abuses him until he becomes a violent rapist</a>, and when he dies, the Devil trades him a memento of his dead mother for a favor: the murder of his own parents.
</li><li> This has the added bonus of making the angels complicit in pretty much everything Drip does, since they only refrain from saving any of his victims because "it has to be his choice". Central is later shown to have murdered Bob and Lisa specifically to prevent them from turning away from their life of sin, meaning that actually, choice doesn't matter at all. The correct course of action is the one that generates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal">the most rape scenes.</a>
</li><li> And then there's the part where furries have replaced humanity, but for some reason, are repeating human history exactly, so we still have events like the Vietnam War re-enacted by furries. This means that we still get furry <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesManson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesManson">Charles Manson</a> and furry Jeffrey Dahmer, too. And that would be fine, except that God is deliberately enforcing the re-enactment <em>and is sending millions of furries to Hell for their part in it</em>. This means that God not only deprived every living furry of free will, she also had full and absolute knowledge of what she was forcing them into doing to themselves and each other <em>and what Satan would do in response</em>, but did absolutely nothing to stop it. In other words, she condemned countless innocent people to eternal suffering in order to punish them for something she forced them to do. The entire comic is about choice and personal responsibility, but the only character who has unquestionable free will is God herself, and there are no consequences for anything she does, ever, because she's in charge of the entire universe while everyone else can literally just go to Hell.
</li><li> The general lesson being taught to all those sent to Hell is to realize their own sin and allow them to atone for it, and that Hell exists to force them to confront their misdeeds in life, but they're too busy being tortured to contemplate the philosophical implications of the torture itself. Even the ones who <em>do</em> realize their sin and repent never make it out of Hell, and it's impossible for them to successfully do that unless agents of Heaven intercede on their behalf and the agents of Hell don't prevent it.
</li><li> One of the afterlife's options is Purgatory, an idealized Earth that lacks the oneness with the divine that Heaven boasts, and also doesn't house the kind of sanctimonious goody-two-shoes types that go to Heaven or the assholes that go to Hell. People who go there are offered a chance at reincarnation, a chance to "try again" at life in the hopes that they'll earn entry into Heaven next time. Like all things in Heaven and Hell, it has to be a matter of personal choice to be meaningful, and so to give the choice meaning, returning to Earth after Purgatory means God will intentionally force a second life to be harder than the first and ban all further entry into Purgatory. This all but guarantees that a reincarnated soul who's been to Purgatory is going to Hell, but the choice is there. And then that moral gets shattered into pieces because God is happy to send angels to Purgatory on a mission to "remind" them what kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodPeopleHaveGoodSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodPeopleHaveGoodSex">awesome sex</a> they're missing out on, <em>by offering sex and not taking no for an answer</em>. The comic loves to remind the reader of how important personal choice is, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust">only if the personal choice is the correct one.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PrincessPi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PrincessPi">Princess Pi</a></em> comic had Princess Pi learn to believe in herself and not let bullies' insults bring her down. The Aesop breaks when she starts believing her most mediocre attempts at fulfilling her royal duties suffice, and doesn't let her subjects' complaints bring her down until they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TarAndFeathers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TarAndFeathers">tar and feather</a> her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/SabrinaOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/SabrinaOnline">Sabrina Online</a></em> had a series of strips in December 2010 which were a reference to the sequence in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JayAndSilentBobStrikeBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JayAndSilentBobStrikeBack">Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</a></em> where the two heroes go on the road and beat up everyone who ever criticized them on the Internet. It works in the film because it's entirely in-character. In the comic, however, it's a series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a>s against the strip's critics. One notable strip involves Zig Zag, the viewpoint character for this sequence, beating up a guy who said mean things about her because he thinks he can say anything on the Internet without consequences. This isn't exactly true, but that's not the Broken Aesop. What's broken is the fact that Zig is the owner and star of her own porno company. You know, <em>the industry that has historically relied on First Amendment rights to stay in business</em>? And the "consequences" bit doesn't work either, because legally, Zig Zag committed real-world, premeditated, first-degree assault against a guy who knows her name, her face, and could easily press charges. The implication in the comic is that she'll suffer no repercussions at all. When Sabrina brings this up later, Zig Zag admits that it cost her a small fortune to settle all the legal issues. (But it was "worth it.") Although the incident does get mentioned during <a class="urllink" href="http://sabrina-online.com/strips/SabOnline678.GIF">her trial<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> for assaulting Sabrina's mugger. And <a class="urllink" href="http://sabrina-online.com/strips/SabOnline681.GIF">we eventually learn<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> that Zig was convicted, paid a fine and entered court-ordered anger management counseling.
</li><li> Early on in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Selkie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Selkie">Selkie</a></em>, the titular character offers Todd her favourite food, fish eyes. Todd refuses on account of being a vegetarian, but later Todd's dad says that "part of being a dad is knowing when to suck it up and eat the eyeballs". This is meant to convey a moral about putting your child's happiness before your own, which on the face of it is a sound moral, but the problem is that it only really makes sense when the happiness the child gets is greater than the unhappiness experienced by the parent. This is not the case with the fish eyes because seeing Todd eat the eyes would have only given Selkie a small amount of pleasure (she seems disappointed when he refuses, but only very slightly) while it could have upset Todd a lot more due to conflicting with his moral views.
<ul><li> This aesop is further broken by the webcomic's overarching moral "accept people who are different to you, even if you don't understand them or their culture". According to that, Todd should be accepted for who he is, not forced to eat foods which make him uncomfortable based on the whims of an eight-year-old.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Shortpacked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Shortpacked">Shortpacked!</a></em> constantly complains about fandoms (particularly the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> fandom), as do author David Willis' newsposts. Willis is not only a prominent part of said fandom, but also embodies many of the issues he complains about. This is often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Sonichu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Sonichu">Sonichu</a></em> is ripe for the picking of Broken Aesops. One of the most well known is when Sonichu and Rosechu preach forgiveness... shortly before Rosechu viciously maims Jason Kendric Howell. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">For throwing a pickle at her</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/Xkcd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/Xkcd">xkcd</a></em>, <a class="urllink" href="https://xkcd.com/1576/">"I Could Care Less"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>: The author dislikes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrammarNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrammarNazis">Grammar Nazis</a>. In this strip, one character corrects the form of what the other just said. The other goes on a long explanation about ambiguity and language and human connection and ends with: "I assume you're giving me tips on how to interpret words because you want me to feel less alone. If so, then thank you. That means a lot. But if you're just running my sentences past some mental checklist so you can show off how well you know it, then I could care less." So basically the moral is that you shouldn't criticise the way others say things, because of all these things that are more important about communication &mdash; but the character who talked about this was really only invoking these deep issues to make the first character feel bad about what <em>she</em> said<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note38k29');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note38k29" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note38k29');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">at least provided the first character had the wrong kind of motive in saying it, but that "I assume..." doesn't sound very sincere in the light of what follows</span>. (It is, of course, also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseDichotomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseDichotomy">False Dichotomy</a>, but that's another issue.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/VeganArtbook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/VeganArtbook">Vegan Artbook</a></em> has many examples:
<ul><li> The series continually denounces killing animals for meat is violent, but the protagonists often times have been shown willing to hurt (in Sterk's case, kill) people who disagree with them.
</li><li> It has frequently talked about how animals tend to practice pretty horrific actions, then goes back to its typical message about being compassionate towards animals and scornful of humans.
</li><li> Brie Plausibell is supposed to live by the motto of "Live and Let Live", however, every time her brother Shawn gives her the opportunity to tolerate each other's lifestyles she rejects his offer and refuses to see eye to eye with him or any other non-vegan, due to believing that respecting the right to eat meat is equal to supporting victimizing animals. The narrative treats this hypocrisy as adhering to her views, and frames Shawn as being "anti-vegan."
</li><li> The author continually advocates against bodyshaming, and often depicts Shawn engaging in making fun of those who are thin or fat. However, she portrays pre-redesign Cuntons and Tommy&#151;two of the three recurring characters who are overweight&#151;as grotesque, and implies that their girth is due to eating meat. Even her positively-portrayed vegan Fat Girl character, Mike, is a junk-food junkie (which can be seen as enforcing stereotypes about fat people being obsessed with food) whose weight is attributed to what her mother fed her before she went vegan.
</li><li> The characters and narrative speak out against the evils of bigotry, while displaying disgust for anyone who isn't vegan, objectifying women to spread an anti-meat message, and using sexual orientation as an insult.
</li><li> Killing and eating animals is decried as preying on the weak and defenseless, however, this doesn't stop stronger vegans like Rohit from beating up on weaker non-vegans in order to make a point or misplace their anger on them.
</li><li> One of the main messages of the series is how animal agriculture or hunting is inherently cruel and abusive. But support forcing inherently carnivorous species to go vegan, which can actually be seen as an abusive practice due to how dangerous it can be to them. In addition, it also contradicts the message about how people shouldn't force their wills on animals. In this case, the vegans are forcing animals to comply with their lifestyle, even if it can possibly harm them.
</li><li> When called out on the vegans' many assaults and murders, Yerdian excuses them as being fictional, and therefore no big deal. Yet when a non-vegan does something harmful, it's treated exactly as heinous as it would be in real life despite also being fictional.
</li><li> Her "Evolution of Man" comic blows its anti-violence aesop by showing the human in the "Good" version of evolution wielding a spear.
</li></ul></li><li> The Eye for an Eye aesop from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Aisopos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Aisopos">Aisopos</a></em> might cause more troubles, if you think about it&#133;

</li><li> Doug Walker once made a plea in an editorial, "Is Parody Dead?", that parodies should not just be references and that they all need to be a clear understanding of what you are spoofing. A good message, yet in most of his own videos, including <em>Nostalgia Critic</em>, <em>Demo Reel</em> and his anniversary specials, he makes countless random pop culture references and spoofs that often don't even tie in with the plot of that episode. He and his actors often just dress up as well-known franchise characters, sometimes to avoid copyright issues, but more commonly for no real reason. <em>To Boldly Flee</em> in particular comes uncomfortably close to films like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DisasterMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DisasterMovie">Disaster Movie</a></em> at points, randomly tossing in characters, scenes, and ideas from various sci-fi properties for no real reason.
