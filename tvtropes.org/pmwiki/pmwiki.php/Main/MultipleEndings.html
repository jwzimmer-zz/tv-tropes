</p><p>Multiple Endings are the most commonly seen form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBranching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBranching">Story Branching</a> in video games, used primarily to increase their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplayValue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplayValue">Replay Value</a>, especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualNovel">visual novels</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame">role playing games</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivalHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivalHorror">Survival Horror</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingSim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingSim">dating sims</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame">fighting games</a>. Different strategies or levels of skill in play will result in different endings, rather than all leading to a single predetermined conclusion. Generally, multiple playthroughs are necessary to see all the content, and possibly to unravel certain mysteries. What determines the ending usually involves the path one takes through the game (which can be as simple as choices the game gives in the prompt or as complex as entire alternate levels), whether one completes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>, how well one plays the game (generally, scoring high is good and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuingIsPainful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuingIsPainful">using continues is bad</a>), other characters' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues">Relationship Values</a> towards you (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FactionSpecificEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FactionSpecificEndings">including</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllianceMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllianceMeter">Alliance Meter</a>), and/or how high the player got the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">Karma Meter</a>. Sometimes there are dual-optimal endings depending on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlignmentBasedEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlignmentBasedEndings">which side the player chose to be on</a>. (These can include the Forces of Evil!) The most diverse examples are found in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualNovel">Visual Novels</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingSim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingSim">Dating Sims</a>, including but not limited to:
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p></p><ul><li> The <em>Standard End</em>, which usually involves the least effort by the player. This is usually very short or unfulfilling, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWinnerIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWinnerIsYou">a blank staff roll</a>, if the game is trying to push <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a> on you. Alternatively, it ends the story on a decently happy note, but leaves some <em>massive</em> plot threads hanging with minimal resolution.
</li><li> The <em>Good End</em>, one or more character-specific endings on a positive note. Sometimes referred to as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a> (especially if the lesser options <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">simply aren't</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">that good</a>). In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingSim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingSim">dating sims</a>, this is usually the one where the player character gets laid.
</li><li> The <em>True End</em>, the primary plot ending of a game that has multiple endings. In many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingSim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingSim">Dating Sims</a>, this ending may not be achievable if other endings are not achieved yet. It basically forces the player to finish the game with the "Good End" in order to unlock the path of the true story. When it is still locked, trying to get the "True End" usually results in the "Standard End" or "Bad End" below. The "True End" usually reveals most if not everything that happened in the other storylines, while some events remain mysterious even when the "Good End" is achieved. The "True End" often overlaps with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourBadEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourBadEnding">not always</a>. Also, don't be surprised if there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a> at the end of this road.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> The <em>Good+/Best End</em>, where all the available content is opened up or shown. As the name implies, this is the best out of several possible "Good Ends", and almost <em>always</em> overlaps with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a>.
</li><li> The variably-used <em>Poor End</em>, when the player makes a decision that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails">prevents the story from progressing any further</a> for obvious reasons, making this ending effectively a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver">Non Standard Game Over</a>.
</li><li> The longer and genuinely <em>Bad End</em>, where the more devoted but failed gamer is rewarded with a more prolonged, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">depressing and/or outright disturbing</a> ending. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAWonderfulFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAWonderfulFailure">It's a Wonderful Failure</a>. The phrase <strong>BAD END</strong> itself is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IrisOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IrisOut">Iris Out</a>-type meme, well-recognized in modern parody. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourBadEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourBadEnding">Bad Ends are, paradoxically, sought out</a> in certain dodgier video games.
</li><li> The <em>Joke End</em>, perhaps the rarest of all: some games contain joke endings which are usually the most difficult to obtain, generally requiring the player to use some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> or play in a totally nonstandard way.
</li></ul><p>Some designers include truly "neutral" multiple ends, letting the player decide whether they're good or bad.
</p><p>The major problem with Multiple Endings is that the sequel, should the developers decide to make one, obviously has to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingOffTheBranches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingOffTheBranches">pick only one ending from which to continue the story</a> &#151; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCanonForTheWicked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCanonForTheWicked">probably one of the good ones</a>. This invariably occurs in adaptations to other media, such as novels, comics, and television. Video games have the technical means to solve said problem with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus">Old Save Bonus</a>, wherein the previous game's conclusion becomes the player's personal canon in the sequel. The other problem is that thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> uploads, being able to view multiple endings no longer requires you to replay an entire game (perhaps in response to this, many games now have in-game rewards for getting different endings). Sometimes multiple endings require the player to do different actions or align themselves to different sides in order to see each ending, even if it means going against the main character's nature and goals to achieve it. This can make the story and characters look disjointed and confuse the player when they see the main character suddenly switching sides because of a few actions they did in a previous scene. When done poorly, having multiple endings can cause the player to have more questions than feel like the story is really resolved.
</p><p>Occasionally, the Multiple Endings are also couched with a non-linear plot &#151; in which case, it can become frustrating-verging-on-impossible to find any of the multiple endings, especially if there are multiple "threads" in the plot.

</li></ul></li><li> In addition, there is a choice at the very end of the last level that decides whether <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zulf</span> lives or dies.
</li></ul></li><li> As with its predecessor, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodstainedRitualOfTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodstainedRitualOfTheNight">Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</a></em> features a very similar ending system to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metroidvania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metroidvania">Metroidvania-style</a> <em>Castlevania</em> games. There are three possible endings; two are bad endings with only slight differences to each other where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Miriam kills Gebel</span>. The path to the true ending can be opened if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you get the Zangetsuto from Zangetsu and cut the red moon during the Gebel fight</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em> games have a long history of multiple endings.
<ul><li> In several games, an interesting variety is that the standard ending is the easiest one to get, the one that takes a bit of work is the Bad Ending, and the best and most difficult is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaIISimonsQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaIISimonsQuest">Simon's Quest</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaHarmonyOfDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaHarmonyOfDissonance">Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance</a></em>, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaChroniclesOfSorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaChroniclesOfSorrow">Sorrow series</a> use this.
<ul><li> In the case of <em>Simon's Quest</em>, the "standard" ending (finish in 8-16 days) says unequivocally that Simon died, but hints that a new hero will eventually carry on the fight against Dracula. The "beginner" ending (over 16 days, an <em>extremely</em> slow time) says that the curse was destroyed, but hints strongly that the Belmont bloodline was as well, plus the screen is black and white. In the "best" ending (under 8 days), the curse is broken, and Simon survives and is hailed as a hero, but in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">the very last shot</a>, Dracula's hand emerges from his grave.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaDraculaX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaDraculaX">Castlevania: Dracula X</a></em> is an unusual case. There are three possible ending shots, one for failing to rescue Maria or Annette, one for rescuing only Maria, and one for rescuing both. It is impossible to rescue only Annette; if you don't save Maria, the door leading to Annette will not open. No explanation has ever been offered for this.
</li></ul></li><li> Others just have a bad ending and a good ending. Usually, trying to get the good ending opens up another boss battle, if not more areas to explore. Sometimes the bad ending cuts the game off halfway. The requirements can be not taking too long (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Castlevania64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Castlevania64">Castlevania 64</a></em>/<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaLegacyOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaLegacyOfDarkness">Legacy of Darkness</a></em>), getting all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon">Plot Coupons</a> required (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaOrderOfEcclesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaOrderOfEcclesia">Order of Ecclesia</a></em>), or finding a certain item and using it at the right point (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaPortraitOfRuin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaPortraitOfRuin">Portrait of Ruin</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight">Symphony of the Night</a></em>). <br><br><em>Symphony</em> actually has two variants on the bad ending (one where you don't even <em>have</em> what you need to truly resolve the plot, and one where you do but <em>still</em> manage to screw it up) and two variants on the good ending (one where you haven't explored the castle sufficiently, and the other where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion">you have</a>). Apparently, there was supposed to be another Bad End for <em>Symphony</em>, judging from some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> dialogue found by hacking the game, in which Maria would've been possessed by a demon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaBloodlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaBloodlines">Bloodlines</a></em> has two segmented endings, one for each character, that get longer depending on difficulty.

The endings with Trevor's companions basically tell what happens to them after defeating Dracula. The credits sequence also changes after the second loop.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaRondoOfBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaRondoOfBlood">Castlevania: Rondo of Blood</a></em> has three different endings: two for Richter, depending on whether he saved all of the women Dracula kidnapped; and one for Maria if she is the one who defeats Dracula.

Defeating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> gives a rather bittersweet standard ending <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">where the threat to the world is averted, but the floating island crashes, killing everyone who was still in it</span>.

Also, for both the standard and good endings, the credits (and the art that's displayed during them) vary depending on your in-game accomplishments. The bad ending gets no credits.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Cubivore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Cubivore">Cubivore</a></em> gives you a bad ending if you don't have a large enough number of mutations by the end of your first time through the Chicky chapter.

As such, the entire ending can only be seen if you get the corresponding ten masks. Failing to collect a specific mask instead shows you a picture of said mask rather than the scene, as the scenes are usually related to the things Link has to do in order to get them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks">Spirit Tracks</a></em> has three different endings, depending on Link's answer to Zelda's question about what he wants to become after the adventure, which the player has to choose before the final battle. Choosing "Warrior" gives the player a scene where Zelda watches Link training in the courtyard (and apparently hurting himself in the process); "Train Engineer" causes a similar scene, where Zelda watches him driving by the Castle and pulling the steam whistle. When answering that he's not sure, Link apparently leaves Hyrule after the game, leaving Zelda behind with nothing but a picture showing the two of them on the Spirit Train.

You get the bad ending if you beat the final boss without shooting the symbols on the wall; the ending shows the area exploding with Samus stuck inside, then the words "The End?" appears after the credits. If you're able to figure out what the cryptic messages throughout the game mean and use them during the final boss fight, there is a second part to the fight, and beating the boss there gets you the good ending where Samus escapes.

<ul><li> Domination Ending: After the final boss fight, two doors appear. Choosing the door on the left, Joe doesn't go back to work, but instead allows other Masters to guide him forward after the Bartender cuts off his free will. Years pass, and Joe is now a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexGod">Sex God</a> at the bar. From time to time, police come looking for Joe, but they always succumb to the Bartender too.
</li><li> Corruption Ending: Choosing the door on the right, Joe doesn't go back to work; instead, he asks the Bartender if he can play his guitar at the Bar for free after the Bartender plants a seed of perversion inside of his brain. Years pass, and Joe is now a popular punk rocker at the bar who lives on pleasure.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Boyfriend Ending</a>: This ending can only be achieved if the player does not use any save points. Choosing the white doorway to the far right of the room with an exit sign above it, the Bartender leaves Joe to rebuild on his own terms. The anxiety Joe had regarding his sexuality is gone, and he has the courage to quit his office job and pursue a career in music. After years pass, we see Joe on the couch with his new boyfriend, John, celebrating the release of Joe's debut album. At times, Joe's sexual inner beast surfaces, much to John's pleasure, but it remains under control.

<ul><li> The first game has two endings, the first of which has the heroes kicking Mr. X's ass and saving the city, and the other, which is only possible by having one character accept Mr. X's offer to join him and the other refuse; the winner of the fight between the players will become the new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> after defeating Mr. X. You even get "BAD END" upon the closing of the credits.

<ul><li> Beating Stage Five on Easy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyModeMockery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyModeMockery">has the robotic Mr. X insulting you and Zan telling you that you must try harder</a>.
</li><li> If you fail to save the real Chief, the first bad ending has you fighting Shiva as the final boss, and when you beat him, Zan interrogates him to find out where Mr. X is, but he won't talk, and the crew is at a dead end.
</li><li> A bad ending where the final boss is beaten but time runs out. The bombs explode, people die, the city gets ruined, and the trust the people of the city placed in Axel and the gang is damaged. <em>Bare Knuckle 3</em> attempts to soften the blow by stating that either way, nuclear war between America and Lima has been prevented. That the bombs wrecked the city is incidental; in time this tragedy will be forgotten.
</li><li> And the best ending, where you beat the final boss and save the city from the bombs/prevent general death and destruction around the world.

Each route gets closer to solving the entire situation than the one that came before it with a rather firmly established route order, though the first two at least are interchangeable.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Injustice2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Injustice2">Injustice 2</a></em>, players get two different endings depending on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">if the player decides to spare or kill Brainiac</span>:

In the Insurgency endings, there's still a faint hope that they might someday reverse the process and restore the shrunken cities.</span> At the same time, the existence of the multiple arcade mode endings is justified by the parallel Earth used as its setting being stuck in a time loop.

<ul><li> For Avdol, if he draws The World, it's implied that Dio somehow came <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>, whereas if he draws The Magician, he decides to reopen his shop.
</li><li> For Mariah, whatever card the player gets determines <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">what Mariah thinks of the player</a>. If they draw The World, she tells them they're not as good as Dio is, but if they draw Bast, she wonders if they really are more attractive than him.
</li></ul></li><li> The all-but-forgotten <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KillerInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KillerInstinct">Killer Instinct</a> 2</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Rare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Rare">Rare</a> has multiple endings for each character. In the game, each character may have either one ally (Maya), one enemy (TJ Combo, Glacius, Sabrewulf, Spinal, and Kim Wu), an ally and an enemy (Jago, Orchid, and Tusk), or even two enemies (Fulgore). Basically, whether or not a fatal move is performed (or if the background is interactive) on a specific character decides the ending; you obviously would want to kill your enemy while leaving any allies alive for the better endings.
<ul><li> For one straightforward example, if the player beats the game playing as TJ Combo, if Tusk is alive, TJ Combo sees there is a possibility to rebuild his name in the past, so he foregoes returning back to the present and becomes a champion. If Tusk is dead, Combo is convinced there are no possible challengers, returns to the present, and starts to rebuild his boxing career.
</li><li> A more complicated example is Orchid: Her ally is Jago and her enemy is Sabrewulf. If Jago is alive but Sabrewulf is dead, on his deathbed Gargos reveals Jago and Orchid are siblings and they form a fighting team. If Jago is dead and Sabrewulf is dead, Orchid lives but mourns the fact that she murdered Jago. If Jago is alive and Sabrewulf is alive, Gargos possesses Sabrewulf and attacks, but Jago successfully kills the demon. If Jago is dead but Sabrewulf is alive, Gargos possesses Sabrewulf and attacks Orchid off-guard; she dies and Gargos gets his revenge.
</li><li> Not all the characters' endings are happy though; some are just less than others. If playing as Spinal, if Kim Wu is alive, he dies; but if Kim Wu is dead, he simply is left to an eternity alone without purpose.

</li><li> In Liu Kang&#146;s ending, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he defeats Shang Tsung for the final time and uses his powers to reset history, meeting a more humble Kung Lao and preparing him for the first tournament</span>.
</li><li> In Shang Tsung&#146;s ending, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he absorbs Liu Kang&#146;s soul and he creates a new timeline where he conquers all but Chaosrealm and Orderrealm</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Similar to <em>Injustice 2</em> above, the existence of multiple Ladder mode endings is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified">Justified</a> by the events of the story mode: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the endings take place in timelines that don't conform to Kronika's designs for the New Era and were subsequently undone</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4Arena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4Arena">Persona 4: Arena</a></em> has joke endings for Chie, Yukiko, and Kanji that can be pursued by making certain choices in their respective campaigns.
<ul><li> <strong>Chie</strong>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chie finds Akihiko getting around the invisible walls in the TV World's school by jumping out a window. Smelling beef on the other side, she gives chase and fights Akihiko over the last beef bowl in a convenience store. After claiming victory, she awakes in the Junes food court, only to find that while she was chasing meat, the rest of the investigation team solved the case without her. Carnivore indeed&#133;</span>
</li><li> <strong>Yukiko</strong>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After defeating Teddie, Yukiko worries that her boxed lunch might've spoiled. She decides to test it out by stuffing it into Teddie's mouth. Considering her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef">culinary skills</a>, the result should be obvious. However, Yukiko mistakes Teddie's suffering for rejuvenating effects. When she finds Yu, she tries to get him to eat it. When he resists for perfectly legitimate reasons, she mistakes this as being under the enemy's control, subdues him, and forces him to eat it. She then does the same to the rest of the Investigation Team. She ends up spending the rest of Golden Week alone, working on her cooking while everyone is recovering from food poisoning.</span>
</li><li> <strong>Kanji</strong>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Convinced that everything that happened since falling into the TV World was a dream, when fighting against Naoto, Kanji tells her to stop being formal around him and to just call him "Kanji" instead of "Kanji-kun". Only after subduing Labrys's Shadow does everyone tell him that it was not a dream, that he really did everything that he did, including making his feelings for Naoto more apparent. When Naoto actually does call him simply "Kanji", he freaks out&#133;</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RivalSchools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RivalSchools">Rival Schools</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>United By Fate</em> has a "poor" ending for each character if you didn't fight the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a>, Hyo; these endings are all the same &#151; the character and their partner standing over a defeated Raizo, the narrator noting they had not yet met the "real power" behind the story. Meeting certain requirements unlocks the fight with Hyo, who can be defeated to get the character's "good" endings. Of the "good" endings, the one for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hyo</span> is actually a "bad" ending: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his plan to take over the schools succeeds, but Hyo regrets defeating his twin brother Kyosuke in order to do so</span>.
</li><li> <em>Project Justice</em>:
<ul><li> One bad ending is shown if you beat the Darkside Student Council story, which focuses around that game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, Kurow. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His plan to take over the school succeeds, and unlike Hyo, he <em>gloats</em> about his victory &#151; and celebrates by petting the hair of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">his sister Yurika</a>, whom he has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">brainwashed</a> into becoming his follower along with most of the game's cast.</span>
</li><li> The second bad ending happens in the Gedo High story. If <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Wild Daigo isn't finished off with a Team-Up or Party-Up</span> in Chapter 4, the player's team of Edge, Gan, Akira, and Zaki fight him again in Chapter 5, with Kurow and Momo backing up <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the brainwashed Daigo</span>. After winning that fight, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an ending is shown where Kurow and his group escape, leaving Daigo dead, Akira in tears over his corpse, and Edge and Gan swearing revenge for Daigo's death</span>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries">Soul Blade</a></em> has two different endings for each character, depending on whether they push a button at a certain point in their ending cinematic.
<ul><li> Mitsurugi's ending takes the form of a bonus first-person fight against a soldier wielding a Tangegashima rifle. He will either take a bullet and decide to find a weapon that can overcome the Tanegashima, or evade the bullet, strike down the rifleman, and decide to start training again.
</li><li> Hwang will either forego taking Soul Edge and embark on a journey across the world, or take Soul Edge back to his hometown and go on a killing spree under the cursed sword's influence.
</li><li> Siegfried will either destroy Soul Edge and grieve over his father's death, or take it and become Nightmare.
</li><li> Taki's Rekkimaru dagger shatters. Afterwards, she'll either reforge it, or purify Soul Edge and turn it into a new demon-slaying weapon.
</li><li> Sophitia purges Soul Edge from the world and frees the world from its influence. The player is then treated to either seeing Sophitia commune with birds like a Disney princess, or taking a bath in a lake.
</li><li> Rock will either take Soul Edge in the hopes of finding his parents, abandoning Bangoo in the process; or toss Soul Edge away and stick with Bangoo.
</li><li> Voldo returns Soul Edge to his master's vault. He will either lay the blade at his master's throne and sit upon the throne as its protector, or have the sword break in his hands, driving him mad.
</li><li> Seung Mina returns home to her father, who tests her reflexes with a surprise attack. She will either shirk from the attack, prompting her father to redouble her training; or she will evade it, finally being recognized as an adult and proceeding with her betrothal to Hwang (at least until she runs away from home).
</li><li> Li Long either dies, or lives long enough to be lured by Soul Edge with a vision of his lover Chie to take up the sword.
</li><li> Cervantes either sets out on a voyage of terror across the seas, or has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">My God, What Have I Done?</a> moment and makes amends by banishing Soul Edge from the world, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">sacrificing himself in doing so</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Super <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII">Street Fighter II</a></em> (and by proxy, <em>Super Turbo</em>) allows players to decide whether Chun-Li will continue her career as a detective or live her life as a civilian: choosing the former shows Chun-Li in a police uniform (based on an early design of her character) beating up a group of drug dealing thugs; while choosing the latter shows Chun-Li in a night club beating up a group of thugs trying to harass her. Regardless of which career path she chooses, she still ends up getting into fights.
</li><li> The game based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StreetFighterIITheAnimatedMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StreetFighterIITheAnimatedMovie">Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie</a></em> has three endings depending on the outcome of the final battle between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">the Cyborg</a> and Ryu: the same ending as the movie, where Ryu and Ken defeat M. Bison (if the player loses); a normal ending where Ryu is defeated, only for him to attack Bison and his gang as they celebrate their victory (if the player wins); and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a> where the Cyborg kills Ryu, but Ryu's influence on the Cyborg causes it to betray and kill Bison (if the player wins with a perfect victory).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha">Street Fighter Alpha</a> 3</em>, the ending differs depending on whether the player defeats the final boss (M. Bison for every character besides himself and Evil Ryu, Ryu if the player is M. Bison, or Shin Akuma if the player is Evil Ryu). While defeating the final boss will show the player character's ending, losing to M. Bison or Shin Akuma as the final boss will show Bison's ending, in which he uses the defeated character's body (Ryu in Bison's standard ending) to power up the Psycho Drive and rule the world; losing to Ryu with Bison plays Ryu's ending instead.
</li><li> Jun the Swan's ending parodies the above Chun-Li ending in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TatsunokoVsCapcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TatsunokoVsCapcom">Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All Stars</a></em>.

Ultimate</a></em>'s World of Light adventure mode has three different endings depending on how you balance light and darkness on the final board: tip the balance too far toward light, and you face Dharkon, which causes Galeem to cover the world in light and make it its plaything. Tip the balance too far toward darkness, and you instead face Galeem, which causes Dharkon to cover the world in darkness and destroy everything. To get the "true" ending, you must keep things balanced by alternating defeating light and dark forces, freeing Master Hand and Crazy Hand in the process, using Master Hand to beat up a horde of puppet fighters, and then ascending a long staircase and going through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">Boss Rush</a> of all previous boss characters before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualBoss">fighting both evil entities at once</a>. Interestingly, you must see all these endings for 100% completion, and you can still do the solo battles for the bad endings if you otherwise qualify for the true ending by just approaching that boss.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1">BioShock 1</a></em> has two separate endings. In the better ending, you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">die in a hospital bed, surrounded by the little sisters you've saved. They are presumably rehabilitated and go on to live long, fruitful lives... coming back to the nest to see you off at the end</span>. Otherwise, you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">unleash hordes of gene-spliced homocidal maniacs upon the surface world</span>. Originally, there was only supposed to be one ending (with your decision over whether to harvest or save the Little Sisters affecting nothing other than your conscience), but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> demanded otherwise.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock2">BioShock 2</a></em> follows suit, but is more complicated. There are basically two segments of the ending based on what you did.
<ul><li> If you spared the majority of the NPCs you came across, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eleanor will save her mother, but if you killed most of them, Eleanor will cause her mother to drown</span>. Her justification for either act will be based on whether you killed any Little Sisters. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">If you saved them all, she either spares Sofia because she believes Sofia is redeemable or kills her because that is justice. If you kill at least one sister, she either kills Sofia because it's within her power to do so or spares her because Sofia cannot harm her anymore and she wants Sofia to watch her live her own life free of Sofia.</span>
</li><li> The second phase of the ending is fully dependent on how many Sisters you save. If you save all of them, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eleanor will absorb a dying Delta to serve as her guardian angel and looks around to see all the saved sisters looking at her. The sun is shining</span>. If you harvested all the sisters, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eleanor will absorb Delta against his will to use his skills and abilities in her upcoming plans. She then looks out over the ocean and sees corpses rise to the surface, with no light in sight and the seas stormy</span>. If you harvested some sisters but saved some sisters, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you get a choice when she moves in to absorb Delta. If you choose to let her absorb Delta, the rest of the ending plays out like the pure evil ending. But if you choose to stop her, she drags you to the edge of the harbor so you can watch the ocean before you die while she muses that even though you made a monster of her, perhaps like you redeemed yourself, she too can be redeemed. However, either way she misses you. The weather is dark and depressing, but a single ray of light shines through the clouds</span>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodOmenLegacyOfKain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodOmenLegacyOfKain">Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain</a></em> has a set of two endings depending on a choice made at the very end: As Kain, the player can either kill himself to restore peace and prosperity to the land of Nosgoth, or choose not to kill himself, condemning the land to an eternity of decay as its vampire overlord. Interestingly, the latter of these two endings was made canon in the game's sequels.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a></em>:

The player is given the option to save Roebuck or Polonsky. After the final battle, the character you picked to survive will go up to the body of the other, remove his dogtags, and hand them to you, as Roebuck gives a final narration.</span>
</li><li> Before the final mission in <em>World at War</em>, Reznov will read a passage from Chernov's diary. If the player went and slaughtered helpless Germans during the Soviet campaign, the passages will be critical; if the player spared them, the passages will praise the player. If the player did a mixture of both, the passages will paint the character as a moral question mark. The actual logic behind the morality of the choices is a bit difficult to understand, though, as your choices involve mercy-killing a group of mortally wounded Germans who are writhing in pain as they bleed out, or gunning down a group that are about to be burnt alive anyway by several vengeful Russians wielding molotov cocktails. Turning your weapon onto the guys committing the atrocity just results in the game rebuking you for friendly fire and restarting from the last checkpoint.

If the scientist Karma is even rescued, her survival while on the USS <em>Obama</em> depends on whether, in the previous mission, deep-cover agent Farid keeps his cover by killing Harper (wherein he will be on the Obama to save her when the bridge is taken) or takes his chance to kill Menendez there (wherein he dies, but Harper lives), and also affects whether the Celerium worm is successfully flushed out of the entire network system. The <em>Obama</em> itself is lost or saved depending on whether you choose to kill Admiral Briggs or not and whether you completed all of the Strike Force missions, wherein the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">General Ripper</a> leading the SDC's military in their Cold War against the US is killed and China allies themselves with the US.

<ul><li> The game has a non-standard ending that can be achieved <em>at the very beginning</em>. The impetus for the game is the protagonist, Ajay's, desire to place his mother's urn in a specific place in the fictional country of Kyrat; however, after he is taken prisoner by the antagonist, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Pagan</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Min</a>, at the beginning of the game, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoMisterBondIExpectYouToDine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoMisterBondIExpectYouToDine">he is invited for lunch by him</a>. Shortly after, however, Pagan excuses himself from the lunch to go interrogate a prisoner, asking Ajay to stay put at the table for a while and leaving him unsupervised, which most players take as a cue to leave and start the main plot. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">if the player actually has Ajay do what Pagan said and wait for him to return (which takes about 10 minutes), he reveals that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">he isn't (completely) a bad guy after all</a>. He invites Ajay for a ride in his helicopter, during which he casually dumps several central plot points on the player, which would all have been big dramatic twists during a normal playthrough. He then tells Ajay that he has guessed (correctly) why he is here; to put his mother's ashes to rest. He then lands at the graveyard Ajay's mother requested in her last will, allowing Ajay to fulfill his objective without any fuss, completing the game in about 20 minutes.</span>
</li><li> Or, you can do a normal playthrough like most other players, with the last few missions giving you a few choices.

<ul><li> If you choose to arrest Joseph Seed, he will dump hallucinogenic chemicals about, causing you to suffer from horrifying hallucinations as you fight him and his flock, who consists of all the allies you had made throughout the game who were brainwashed by Seed. After helping your friends break free from Seed's influence and defeating him, the sheriff arrests Seed; however, there is a nuclear explosion in the distance, forcing you and your friends to make for the bunker as more bombs go off en route. The truck crashes into a tree, killing everyone inside but you and Seed, who now has you at his mercy as you both take shelter and, with the world outside burning in nuclear hellfire, he gloats about how he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnewItAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnewItAllAlong">Knew It All Along</a>. This ending would eventually become the canon ending to the game &#151; thankfully, though, the sequel would rectify everything that happened.
</li><li> If you choose not to arrest Joseph Seed and leave him alone in the end, he will allow you and your remaining allies to leave Hope County in peace. As the sheriff declares that he intends to come back with the National Guard, he turns on the radio, which begins to play The Platters' "Only You". Then your vision starts to go red and blurry...
</li><li> Similar to the previous game, there is also a secret ending <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that can be achieved in the very beginning of the game by refusing to put the cuffs on Joseph Seed.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheAdventuresOfMassmouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheAdventuresOfMassmouth">Massmouth 2</a></em> has six endings, depending on whether you manage to save your employer, whether you kill him at the behest of the villain, and whether you side with the villain or kill him. The author tartly noted that this makes a sequel quite impossible, as all the endings may be considered equally "proper".
</li><li> The standard ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne">Max Payne</a> 2: The Fall of Max Payne</em> sees <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mona Sax die from her gunshot wounds</span>. Beating the game on the hardest difficulty level, Dead On Arrival, unlocks an alternate ending in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she lives</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em>, you can get an ending with either the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">loser sidekick</a> (Otacon) or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl">love interest</a> (Meryl), depending on whether or not you pass the torture minigame and if Meryl makes it out alive. While the Meryl ending has now been confirmed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon">canonical</a>, with Meryl reappearing alive and kicking in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots">Metal Gear Solid 4</a></em>, neither ending is explicitly referred to as the Good or the Bad ending (the game calls them Ending A and Ending B). Interestingly, the revelation from the <em>non-canonical</em> ending of <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> is also confirmed as canon (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Meryl is actually Colonel Campbell's illegitimate daughter, not his niece</span>) in <em>MGS4</em>, setting up a major conflict. <br><br>Before that, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty">Metal Gear Solid 2</a></em> featured Snake sporting (and explicitly referencing) the infinite ammo bandanna, the player's reward for reaching Meryl's ending in the previous game, as a subtle hint that the Meryl ending was actually canon (though there's also a hint of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MergingTheBranches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MergingTheBranches">Merging the Branches</a>, as the very start of the Tanker chapter has Snake infiltrating it with the help of stealth camouflage, the player's reward for getting Otacon's ending). The in-game novel, "The Shocking Conspiracy Behind Shadow Moses", offers a different explanation, suggesting that the protagonist of the novel found the bandanna on the beach at Shadow Moses, where Meryl found it in the game. The "alien" who rescued the protagonist (Snake through the eyes of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">Conspiracy Theorist</a>) took the bandanna from him and escaped with it, thus subtly implying that Snake got the Otacon ending. Nastasha's book contradicts this <em>again</em> by saying it seemed Snake managed to rescue Meryl. Incidentally, the theme of the game was about choosing the path to follow when presented with conflicting information about the world, and not fussing about absolute reality.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Substance</a></em> features five non-canonical "Snake Tales" missions. Four of these have two endings, and which one is chosen is usually determined by whether the player kills the final boss or not. Snake Tale A has <em>five</em>, as skipping a large chunk of the mission makes it possible to fight the boss almost straight away, with two alternate endings. The player can also re-enter the elevator Snake uses right at the beginning to end the scenario on a weird note. This could be considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver">Non Standard Game Over</a>, as it does lead the player to a game over screen (with no continue option, though).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes">No More Heroes</a></em> offers a segmented ending in its endgame: After Travis becomes the first-ranked assassin in the country, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an up-and coming assassin breaks into Travis's motel room to kill him while he's on the can</span>. If the player buys all the katana upgrades, the "Real" ending becomes available <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">where Henry kills the assassin, fights Travis one last time, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">announces that he's Travis's long-lost twin brother</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Oddworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Oddworld">Oddworld</a>: Abe's Oddysee</em> features four endings: Standard Good, Standard Bad, Perfect Good, and Perfect Bad, depending on how many of the 99 mudokons you managed to save. The end of the gameplay shows you being captured by the baddies. If you have rescued 50 or more mudokons, they band together and rescue you, and you are hailed as a hero (Standard Good). If you rescued fewer than that, they let you die (Standard Bad). If you rescued all 99, you get the Standard Good ending, but also a teaser for the next game and some production art (Perfect Good). If you killed as many mudokons as possible (some mudokons must be rescued in order to progress in the game), you are appointed Head of Employee Relations by the baddies (Perfect Bad). Oddly, the Perfect Bad ending is the best, as it is the only one that gives you any future advantage in the game &#151; you are provided with a cheat code that will only work once the Perfect Bad ending has been completed. The sequel <em>Abe's Exoddus</em> has a similar ending setup, only the number of mudokons is raised to 300 (with the Good/Bad threshold raised to 150).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PathwaysIntoDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PathwaysIntoDarkness">Pathways into Darkness</a></em> has seven endings, including:
<ul><li> Failing to set off the nuke (bad ending).
</li><li> Setting up the nuke but failing to escape the blast in time (okay ending).
</li><li> Setting up the nuke and escaping on foot (good ending).
</li><li> Setting up the nuke and calling in your helicopter extraction team (best ending).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAY2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAY2">PAYDAY 2</a></em> has two endings upon completion of the White House heist. Beating the heist the normal way unlocks an ending video where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Bain</a> dies from the virus and the crew retires since they have the presidential pardons, making this a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">Bittersweet Ending</a>. The true ending is hidden behind a <em>very</em> lengthy and complex puzzle that involves players needing a ton of specific achievements unlocked, finding a hidden hallway in the White House heist, unlocking a door that requires decoding symbols, entering the room behind the door, and then go back to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">find <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">the Dentist</a> holding Bain hostage. If you can kill the Dentist, take the Mayan gold, and place said gold in the slots inside the secret room, the room gets filled with a white light and the mission is counted as a success. You also unlock a second video where the crew are relaxing on the beach with their riches in Mexico and watch the news to see that U.S. President effectively ends the manhunt on the PAYDAY gang, dubbing the efforts of the police as a success. The crew smiles when they see that the President is actually Bain, whose soul had been put into the President</span>.

<ul><li> <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl</em> has at least seven endings.
<ul><li> Five are "false" early endings obtained by interacting with the "wish maker", often by players who have not fully interpreted the game's plot. Which wish/hallucination you get is based on your interactions and status in the game (in order of precedence):
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zone goes away. If your reputation is good, you wish for the zone to disappear. You are shown a clear sky, green grass. The character's pupils are gone. You have become blind.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Money. If you have a lot of money but a lower rep, you wish for money. Gold coins fall from the sky. The coins are actually bricks, metal, and other debris that you are soon crushed under.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rule the world. If you kill two main characters, you wish to rule the world. The monolith absorbs the character, leaving only a pile of clothes.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Corrupt humanity. If you kill everyone and your rep is very negative, you wish for humanity to be "controlled". The player has a vision of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">the end of the world</a>, followed by waking in a black void.</span>

</li><li> The two main endings are based on the player ignoring the wishmaker, finding the true ending section, and following that. The endings then become:
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Join the C-Consciousness hivemind controlling the area, and attempt to fix the zone.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Destroy the equipment, and you are shown a bright, grassy field. It is implied that the zone was repaired and you have succeeded.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat</em> has an ending consisting of 20 segments explaining the fate of important places, characters, and factions. Most of them have two variants, some have three.

In the good ending, the boss dies, humanity is saved, and the mission control chick "rewards" you. In the bad ending, it turns out that she was the boss all along. You still defeat her, but the war still rages on, and humanity's chances of survival are slim. In the worst ending (you die on the final boss fight), humanity becomes extinct.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Alabaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Alabaster">Alabaster</a></em> has no less than 18 unique endings, most of them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">bittersweet</a>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChoiceOfGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChoiceOfGames">Choice of Games</a> is often fairly stingy with these; their games have many and varied choices, but they're more about the journey than the destination, and their writing team considers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Railroading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Railroading">railroading</a> to be a best practice for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gamebooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gamebooks">Gamebook-style</a> game, due to the ridiculous amount of writing required otherwise.
<ul><li> <em>Choice of the Dragon</em> is perhaps most notable for averting this trope; at the end of the game, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you go into hibernation</span>.

However, the third installment fulfills this trope, with many variations on the ending depending on, among other things, who's left standing after the bloodshed has run its course.
</li><li> <em>The Fleet</em> has five different endings, depending on whether you defeated the alien invasion, whether you sided with or against the Alliance, and whether you prevailed in the final conflict. All of them <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">offer you a chance to ally with the aliens you spent the game fighting</span>, but the circumstances will depend on how you handled the battle for your homeworld and the aftermath.

<ul><li> The normal ending, accessed when the player hasn't encountered all or any of the optional monsters, forces the player into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mon">Mon-style</a> battle with the Nightmare Queen (the proper way to end the fight is by first choosing the Rake to fight her, then Smiledog, then Slenderman, then Candle Cove, and then the previous three in any order). The Nightmare Queen ends up killing all of the monsters sent to attack her, but ends up sparing the player after finding out that they have Ecto-Cooler, after which she uses her powers to multiply the drink so that she and the other monsters in the house can enjoy it.
</li><li> An alternate ending is accessible if the player backtracks after visiting the Evil World and has Vulthrax in their party. Summoning him during the confrontation with the Nightmare Queen has him fall for the Nightmare Queen and ask the player for the proper things to say. Feeding Vulthrax the proper lines will result in the two monsters doing the nasty and the player escaping the house while they still can.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a> is accessible by encountering every monster in the game before the final battle and giving the completed Monster Album to the Nightmare Queen when she is confronted. The Nightmare Queen is impressed by how the player has managed to keep their cool after encountering all of the house's monsters, so she gives the player a proposal. Rejecting the proposal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust">restarts the encounter</a>, but accepting it results in the Nightmare Queen leaving the house for other worlds that need her while appointing the player as the house's new Nightmare Queen.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Galatea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Galatea">Galatea</a></em> has a variety of endings depending on how the player character interacts with the eponymous NPC. The PC can help Galatea become human, become lovers with her, provoke her into killing him, trade places with her&#133; and that's just a small selection of the endings.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Glass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Glass">Glass</a></em> has six endings, depending on which sister you suggest to the Prince, and whether you remain silent during their interaction or speak up about something.

<ul><li> Every <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HouseOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HouseOfTheDead">House of the Dead</a></em> game has multiple endings. Usually one or two non-canon ones, a canon good/acceptable ending, and an apparently canon ending that alludes to plot points that, as of now, are still yet to be revealed.
<ul><li> 1: Sophie is either dead, alive, or zombified. Obviously only one is possible, but since she's never mentioned again, we have no way of knowing (which probably was Sega's intention, though Sophie is implied to be alive by Lisa's presence in 3).
</li><li> 2: The normal ending is a plain 'ol group shot with the grateful citizens and your unhelpful allies. The "twist" ending has Goldman turned into a zombie (which we later learn really did happen). The "good" ending is just a little easter egg cameo from Thomas. No conflicts here.
</li><li> 3: One plot point, one "joke" ending (the only one in the series), and li'l Danny may or may not have joined the ranks of the undead. As this is the last game chronologically, it's hard to say what, if anything, is canon.
</li><li> 4: A plot point building off of the one in 3, an emotional eulogy from G, and two versions of Goldman's cryptic final message, one of which confirms the twist in 2; again, nothing contradicts any of the other endings or anything else we've seen.
</li><li> Parodied in the spin-off <em>Typing of the Dead</em>. The different endings just have the villain jumping off the building with slight variations (flying like Superman, attached to a bungee cord), and the only thing that decides which ending you get is the answers to completely random questions at the end of the game.

If you get the sand ending, this happens.
<div class="indent"><strong>Professor:</strong> Dirt! This...

<ul><li> If you sent for Empress Gravelyn, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she finishes Vordred off with the weapon that she had made from Noxus's skull. Upon learning that Artix is the Champion of Darkness, Gravelyn offers to make Artix the champion of her undead army, with her slaying Artix to become the Champion herself if he should refuse. Artix refuses, as he is a Paladin of Swordhaven even if he can't use the powers of one and servant of Good King Alteon. Gravelyn renews her vow to finish what her father started when Drakath falls before handing the Noxus Head Staff off to you</span>.
</li><li> If you sent for Lady Vayle, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she protects you from Vordred's final attack before challenging Artix in vengeance for her brother. Artix refuses to fight Vayle, but states that she needs to talk to someone first. A sad scene then ensues where the spirit orb of Vayle's long-lost brother, whom she became a necromancer to try to bring back, explains to her that what she did was wrong and that he thanks you and Artix for allowing him the chance to redeem himself. Vayle is moved to tears by this, but she's not forgiving Artix anytime soon &#151; her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifesWorkRuined" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifesWorkRuined">life's work was ruined</a> by him, and she angrily states that the next time they meet, they will be mortal enemies</span>.
</li><li> If you sent for Zorbak, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he stomps Vordred's form into the ground before claiming Vordred's skull for his collection of thrones (including Drakonnan's helmet from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonFable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonFable">DragonFable</a></em>). The three of you then speculate on who the Champion of Light would be</span>.
</li><li> If you sent for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Daimyo, he does much the same thing as Zorbak, minus the skull-claiming. Artix is confused about a lot of things, but when you try to give him the Shadowscythe Amulet, he tells you to hang on to it, as you are the person he trusts most in the world. We then cut to Sally, who is all alone again and hating every minute of it. Drakath, in one of his rare moments of kindness, shows up and gives Sally Vordred's skull. She vows to rebuild him more powerful than before and rebuild the original Necropolis</span>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is the True End, and we will be seeing these two again.</span>

<ul><li> The first is Temple of Ikov, which has you choose late into the quest whether to side with Lucien, who gave you the quest to get the Staff of Armadyl, or the Guardians of Armadyl, who guard the staff left behind by their god. If you side with Lucien, you just kill the Guardians and bring the staff to him to complete the quest. If you side with the Guardians, they give you a pendant to resist his mind manipulation and you kill him. Regardless of what you pick, he ultimately ends up being alive and with the staff.
</li><li> The second is Hazeel Cult, which has you either infiltrate the cult or join it for real. Infiltrating does basically nothing but get you the armour the quest giver, Ceril, asks you to return to him and gives a reward of five gold. Joining it has you learn about the cult's and Ceril's history (Ceril's ancestor was part of a group of Saradominists that invaded Ardogune, and he personally killed Hazeel and stole his mansion) and work to revive Hazeel using a scroll Ceril has. Your reward for reviving him is 2000 gold, Hazeel's personal thanks, an offer to join him while he waits to regain his power (which you refuse, to his dismay and understanding), and a mention that he will one day return. Unsurprisingly, aiding Ceril isn't considered "properly" completing the quest, despite the quest log saying it's finished, as the reward scroll says you "...kind of..." completed Hazeel Cult when he gives you your reward.

</li><li> <strong>The Good Ending</strong>: If you beat the game in 2 player mode and complete the secret road, you will rescue the girl and Bub and Bob will turn from their dragon form into human form. The ending credits are shown.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Eversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Eversion">Eversion</a></em>'s standard ending, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you find the Princess shortly before she turns into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> and devours you.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IrisuSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IrisuSyndrome">Irisu Syndrome!</a></em> has several endings. Which one you get depends on whether or not you get 20,000 points in normal mode, then what you do before/during Metsu mode.
<ul><li> The first ending occurs if you get less than 20,000 points before running out of lives. Irisu <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">murders the other three characters, then retreats back to her room to watch a news story covering their disappearance</span>.
</li><li> The second ending is earned by getting at least 20,000 points on one of your lives. The <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">murders</span> from the first end are implied to still happen, and we actually get to witness the lead-up to the final one... but upon re-opening the game, it's revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it was a joke played on the final "victim" to kick off her surprise birthday party, and everyone is actually alive</span>.
</li><li> Getting 100,000 points before unlocking Metsu mode and reading the files created in the game's folder as you play leads to a third ending, in which the second ending happened, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Irisu did originally want to murder the other three, but came to her senses and refrained. But after making an unfortunate discovery, she completely snaps and plans to kill everyone after all</span>.

Both missions have a main route, in which you follow the mission-giver's instructions, and a secret route, in which you go behind their back in some way. Due to the games' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">"Groundhog Day" Loop</a> mechanic, it's possible to get both endings in one playthrough, and, in the case of the second game, even necessary if you want <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>.
<ul><li> The first game has Cindy's mission. The main route has you helping her bully Lily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy">as revenge for her missing brother breaking up with Cindy</a>. In the secret route, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you help her finding out what happened to her missing dog Biscuit instead by grabbing the recipe for <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeWithRealGirlScouts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeWithRealGirlScouts">Biscuit Balls</a> in the janitor's closet instead of the bucket of blood</span>. It's possible to convince Cindy to go with this plan instead of her original plan at the start of the day with the right dialogue options, though whether you convince her or go behind her back doesn't affect the ending.
</li><li> The second game has <em>Cain's not Able</em>. The main route has you helping Felix with his plan to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel">kill off his twin brother Ted</a>, which goes off without a hitch.

The Star Trip mode has three variations, and each has its own unique endings (2, 7, and 3 respectively). One of the endings involves the antagonistic planet <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being cut up by a gigantic fork</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterLovesYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterLovesYou">Monster Loves You!</a></em> has 14 possible endings, which cover a wide range of possibile outcomes from brokering eternal peace between humans and monsters, to causing endless war between them.

</li></ul></li><li> The DLC <em>Road to Gehenna</em> has four endings, which depend on finding stars and how you interact with the message board throughout the game. The endings are broadly similar, the only differences being the voiceover you get from Elohim afterward and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">whether Uriel or Admin are ascended with the rest of the bots. The four endings are: Admin is still imprisoned, Admin allows Uriel to ascend, Uriel allows Admin to ascend, Admin is free but neither he nor Uriel ascend</span>.

However, if you reach level 500 in 3 minutes and 25 seconds or less, the game continues, you get the rank of M, and can go all the way to level 999. Surviving all the way to that level yields the true ending and the rank of Grand Master.
</li><li> <em>Tetris: The Grand Master 3</em>'s Master has something similar; if you take more than 7 minutes to reach level 500, the game ends prematurely &#151; a feature known among TGM fans as a <em>torikan</em>, and you get a message reading "EXCELLENT &#151; but...let's go better (sic) next time." Shirase mode, which has <em>1,300</em> levels, has a torikan at both level 500 and also level 1,000.

There's also an ending for when you have 3 lives remaining, and one where you have 2 lives remaining. If you view Orbulon's ending again via Options, you'll end up with the 4 lives ending, so the only way to view the three secret endings is to lose a life and make it to the end of the boss and win without getting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a>.

Regardless of which you choose, the death toll will number in the hundreds and global public opinion turns firmly against GDI, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a> having to testify in front of the US Senate about how GDI could let this happen.

</li><li> The expansion pack to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberianSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberianSun">Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun</a></em>, called <em>Firestorm</em>, is also unusual in that both the GDI and NOD campaigns are theoretically both canon, as both sides are fighting against a common enemy. In actuality, however, there are still a few discrepancies between the two endings, and the GDI one is considered definitive.
</li><li> In addition, it's commonly believed that the <em>Command And Conquer</em> universe as a whole branches out into either the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlertSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlertSeries">Red Alert</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberianSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberianSeries">Tiberium</a></em> games depending on who wins in the first <em>Red Alert</em> game. This comes from the fact that the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert">Red Alert</a></em> was meant as a prequel to the original series, and there are various hints in that direction in its cutscenes. However, due to later revelations, this no longer makes sense; for example, GDI couldn't come into existence if the Soviets won, as its precursor organization, NATO, wouldn't exist.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AfterBurner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AfterBurner">After Burner</a> Climax</em>'s endings, all of which are good to varying extents:
<ul><li> <strong>Ending C:</strong> Fail to unlock the final two stages. The terrorist group Z surrenders, but are on watch as they still pose a potential threat.
</li><li> <strong>Ending B:</strong> Unlock the final two stages, but fail to destroy the warheads in the final stage. Your carrier shoots them down and sustains light damage, but you otherwise emerge victorious and Z makes a full and unconditional surrender.
</li><li> <strong>Ending A:</strong> Nearly the same conditions and result as Ending B, the only differences being that this requires shooting the warheads down successfully, resulting in Ending B sans carrier damage.
</li></ul></li><li> The unreleased shooter <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChimeraBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChimeraBeast">Chimera Beast</a></em> has a <em>weird</em> twist on this trope. Completing the game properly will give you the staff roll and the "bad" ending, saying that because of you, Earth is doomed to be eaten by the eponymous Chimeras. Lose against the final boss and you get the "good" ending, but no staff roll.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CannonSpike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CannonSpike">Cannon Spike</a></em> has, besides the two characters, guest characters from games. The hidden ones are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic">Mega Man</a> from the series of the same name and BB Hood from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darkstalkers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darkstalkers">Darkstalkers</a> 3</em>. Each character has one ending, as does 2P mode.
<ul><li> BB Hood's endings in 2P mode are somewhat different; beat the game with one of the two players playing as BB Hood, and BB Hood will beat up the other character and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">boot him/her down the Life Saving tube</span>, and the ending plays as if it was 1P mode. If Mega Man is selected, then BB Hood, BB Hood does not beat up Mega Man.
</li><li> One of the 2P endings has Simone and Cammy getting attacked by Kabuki, and Simone is instructed by Cammy to get out of the base, but Simone wants to fight Kabuki and instructs Cammy to get out of the base, and Simone and Cammy argue while Kabuki attacks.
</li><li> Another 2P ending does away with the base completely, and only shows Shiba and Cammy on an open street. Cammy wants to go shopping, and Shiba protests that his board is not a shopping cart, but says, "Oh well... Never mind..."
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darius">Darius</a></em> games generally have branching paths, leading to a different ending for each final stage.
<ul><li> <em>Syvalion</em> has over one hundred different endings based on various factors as you play.
</li><li> <em>Darius Twin</em> has only one final stage, but you get a better ending the longer you can play through the game without dying.

<ul><li> <strong>Shotia</strong> interfaces with the machine army's data network and shuts it down, but suffers data corruption that destroys her mind. As her pilot embraces her, she slowly dies as her memories are deleted, her final thoughts being of her life as a human before becoming a Doll.
</li><li> <strong>Leinyan</strong> falls in love with her pilot and rebels against her masters to protect them, but is captured, shut down, and dissected. Thankfully, she manages to upload her consciousness into cyberspace so she can reunite with her pilot.
</li><li> <strong>EXY</strong>, similar to Shotia, interfaces with the machine army's data network and shuts it down. Unfortunately, the sheer amount of information she is bombarded with (which is suggested to include Colonel Schwarlitz Longhener's mad schemes from <em>DoDonPachi</em>) drives her insane and causes her to murder her pilot as she comes to the conclusion that humanity is her enemy. This ending is considered canon and leads into the events of <em>DoDonPachi DaiFukkatsu</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Galaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Galaga">Galaga</a> '88</em> has four endings, depending on the dimension you reached when you beat the game:
<ul><li> Ending 1: The Galaga Force has been defeated. However, the possibility remains that they may yet return.
</li><li> Ending 2: Planet Galaga has been destroyed. Unfortunately, that means having destroyed the home of some lowly Galaga private.
</li><li> Ending 3: Planet Galaga has been destroyed. Many in the Galaga Force died in its defense, but their death is a mercy: fighting in a war meant crappy food and no girls.
</li><li> Ending 4: The female pilot of one of the ships you rescued thanks you and asks you to come over to her place, so you can be with each other "as a man and a woman".
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GigaWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GigaWing">Giga Wing</a></em>, completing the first 6 stages normally nets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a> in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">your character(s) sacrifice themselves to destroy the Medallion</span>. If, on the other hand, you complete the first 6 stages on a single credit, you proceed to a 7th stage, which consists entirely of the final battle between you and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectRunFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectRunFinalBoss">Perfect Run Final Boss</a>; defeating him will net you a better ending, regardless of how many continues you use on this stage.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hellsinker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hellsinker">Hellsinker</a></em> features many endings. To elaborate...
<ul><li> <strong>Bad Endings</strong>:
<ul><li> The spirit overload ending in Segment 7: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rex Cavalier transfers his spirit to the protagonists, driving them mad and turning them into Prayers.

But they come to realise that the island Paradise had captured their hearts and turned them blind to humanity's own strength. Soon humanity starts to rebuild the world without the help of the Garland system. However, questions regarding the Prayers are still lingering in people's hearts.</span>
</li><li> Satisfaction Lvl 2:

<ul><li> Satisfaction Lvl 3: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The protagonists find Lost Property 771, a missing <em>cat</em>, and face off against it.

<ul><li> One player, continue at least once: DAS's world conquest plot is destroyed. The sub surfaces and parades past a cheering crowd.
</li><li> One player, no continues: DAS's plot is destroyed, but the sub is caught in the blast that destroys the base. Scrolling shot of the demolished base, ending with the now-disabled sub nose-down in a wrecked battleship.
</li><li> Two players: After destroying the last boss, the two subs turn on each other, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingYourFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingYourFriend">they duke it out in a special arena</a>. If one of them wins, it surfaces and takes over the world, travelling through deep sea before joining up with several other subs. If time runs out before either sub wins, they're both caught in the blast that destroyed the base, go out of control, and sink to the bottom.
</li></ul></li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalSlug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalSlug">Metal Slug</a></em> game ends with Donald Morden's presumed death after his aircraft is destroyed. After the results screen, one of Morden's men throws a paper airplane as it goes through all of the levels before it flies off into the starry sky as "FIN" appears... at least for the 1P run. But, if you manage to find someone who can help you and defeat the final boss with both players alive, the paper airplane thrown by one of Morden's men is identical, but the levels it goes through are different, and "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orBv-iKr4R8">Hold You Still<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>" plays in the background. At the very end of the credit roll, instead of flying off into the starry sky, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the paper airplane turns left and remains leaning left, as Morden is revealed to be still alive, grabbing onto a stick. Morden notices the paper airplane, and once the paper airplane makes contact with the stick, it breaks and Morden falls. He pulls himself up, takes the paper airplane and unfolds it (implying that the paper airplane has a message written on it and that even after his defeat, Morden's men are still loyal to him), and he glances up at the starry sky as "FIN" appears</span>.

However, you can also end your game on Stage 3 by allowing the missiles at the end of the stage to destroy the bridge your squad is on. However, the game tries to keep it positive with your squad coming out of the wreckage unharmed and acknowledging that they still completed their mission (which was to assassinate the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> in Stage 3-1).

Should you manage to defeat her, you'll see the real ending, and how much of it you see depends on what percentage of the area's enemies you destroyed. To get the full ending, you need to defeat her while still in the Final Form (which means taking no damage at all during Stage 5).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFoxCommand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFoxCommand">Star Fox Command</a></em> features nine different endings, most of which revolve around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">the relationship status between Fox and Krystal</a>. Fox breaks up with Krystal before the game starts, causing her to join Star Wolf.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TinStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TinStar">Tin Star</a></em> has three different endings, depending on the amount of money you have at the end of the game.

Anything less than a million has Maria marrying Mo instead, and less than $750,000 has Maria reject Tin Star outright for being too poor.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> is swimming in this trope. Every shot-type (between one and three for each character, and between two and four characters depending on the game) has its own good and bad (generally achieved by beating the final boss after continuing) endings. <em>Imperishable Night</em> added normal endings as well.

<ul><li> The first game has three endings: In the good ending, Olimar manages to escape the planet with the three Pikmin Onions in tow, but the Pikmin are left on their own. In the best ending, not only do a number of differently-colored Onions join the mix, but the Pikmin have now learned to fend for themselves, and in the somewhat disturbing but strangely cute bad ending, Olimar dies and the Pikmin bring him back as one of their own. Which ending you get is determined by the ship parts you've obtained by the end of the 30th day: If you've obtained all parts, you get the best ending.

</li><li> <em>Pikmin 3</em> has three endings that depend on how much fruit you collected before defeating the final boss, though all of them are simply changes in the ending narration. The low ending, obtained by collecting a low amount of fruit, doubts that what the explorers gathered was enough to save their planet. The medium ending, obtained by collecting more fruit than the requirements for the low ending but not enough for the perfect ending, is more ambiguous, as the explorers could save their planet but must be careful with their resources to prevent history from repeating.

</li><li> The second ending occurs if you choose to fight the Princess's handmaiden Rachel.

The third ending occurs if you lose to Malphas. Malphas will possess her, and Jais will accompany her, blissfully unaware that "she" is now Malphas.
</li><li> The fourth ending occurs if you win against Malphas. Malphas will apparently die, and the Princess and Jais go back to the castle. The Princess sits on her throne, now a Queen, while Jais goes to find survivors. He finds out that he and Allura/Alicia are apparently the only survivors, and a group of zombie warriors (who evidently were not affected by Malphus's death) prepare to attack him from behind.

When she wakes up, Yosafire discovers that her friends have been mutilated and reduced to piles of bloody meat, with Poemi approaching...

Deciding to make a hasty retreat, Ivlis manages to push Kcalb off the cliff before disappearing, and Yosafire rescues him. After a speech about his past misdeeds, Kcalb laments that dying would have been better, but Yosafire restores his will to live by declaring that the past doesn't matter.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ParadoxBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ParadoxBlue">Paradox Blue</a></em> employs the trappings of video games to tell its story, including multiple endings, usually framed like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver">Non Standard Game Over</a>. The first chapter of a story sets up a "paradox", a puzzle posed to the main characters by an angel, which they must solve for a boon or else they're likely to be killed. At the end of the chapter, the story then tells the reader to skip to various pages depending on whether they choose to solve the paradox themselves, let the characters do it, or give up. Giving up always leads to an apocalyptic bad ending where one of the characters is the only person left alive on Earth, while solving the paradox or letting the characters solve it (in the next chapter) allows the story to carry on toward the true ending.

In order to satisfy people who couldn't watch the longer version of the show, the last 3 episodes of the series all ended up being different types of ending stories.

</li></ul></li><li> <em>Medical Center</em> produced the 1971 episode "Countdown" with three different endings, as part of a controversial social experiment conducted by psychologist Stanley Milgram. The experiment would attempt to determine whether or not a person would be more likely to commit a crime after viewing it on television. The episode centers around an aggressive hospital orderly who, beset with serious financial troubles, is tempted to steal money from charity boxes placed throughout the city. The ending would be one of three scenarios: he steals money and gets punished, he steals money and does not get punished, or he does not steal money at all, and also drops some change into the box. Audience members would come across a similar "charity box" directly after the episode's showing, and would be monitored as to if the ending they saw would inspire them to imitate the character's actions. The results were inconclusive. The full details of Milgram's experiment are published in the book <em>Television and Antisocial Behavior: Field Experiments</em>. <br><br>Different endings were shown depending on your television market (though Warner Bros. states that most markets viewed the "punished" ending in its original run). Warner Archive Collection's DVD release of <em>Medical Center: the Complete Second Season</em> includes all three endings of "Countdown".

The evac ships are left to fend for themselves. And Rimmer still ends up shot with a can by the vending machine.

The last two tracks on each volume are alternative endings with each boy.

<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a> role-playing game <em>Abnormal</em>, there are three end game scenarios dependent on the number and position of shards (tokens) in play:
<ul><li> Utterly Consumed: If there are seven or more shards on the four Stage cards, the Witness is consumed by the horrors that haunt them; it might involve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationHorror">turning into a horrible monster</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">Demonic Possession</a>, or simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">being driven irreversibly mad</a>.
</li><li> Permanently Intertwined: If there are two or more shards on the Normalize stage, the Witness avoids being overcome by the Horror, but is unable to completely remove it. Reluctantly or otherwise, they must somehow learn to live with the Horror, whether trying to disguise a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PartialTransformation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PartialTransformation">Partial Transformation</a> or find a harmless way to appease a lingering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHunger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHunger">Horror Hunger</a>.
</li><li> Life Reclaimed: If the Witness manages to remove and reclaim four or more shards from the Stage cards, they successfully drive off the Horror and get their life back... for now.
</li></ul></li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em> adventures had six different possible win conditions; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonMaster">Dungeon Master</a> chooses one in secret before running the final module. One of them was used as the canon ending in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization">novelization</a> (the <em>Dragonlance Chronicles</em> trilogy), but woe could come to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metagame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metagame">Metagamers</a> who play the adventures after reading the books, as in one of the other endings, performing the action that seals the gate in the novels actually makes the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">unwinnable</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft">Ravenloft</a></em> boxed set adventure "Bleak House" provided for four different possible endings, as determined by players' choices throughout the last portion of the campaign arc. While many RPG adventures provide two or more concluding text-blocks to read, depending on whether the heroes win or lose, "Bleak House" went much farther, arranging for a prolonged buildup to whichever climax was selected to occur.
</li><li> As one of the few <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ChroniclesOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ChroniclesOfDarkness">Chronicles Of Darkness</a></em> works to feature a definite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleplayingEndgame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleplayingEndgame">Roleplaying Endgame</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated">Promethean: The Created</a></em> has a continuity of different endings depending on how many Refinements the character has mastered. If the Promethean has mastered only four Refinements (the miniumum required to approach the New Dawn), then after the New Dawn he will awaken with near-total amnesia, but with his human life encoded into the world, complete with all appropriate documentation and his existenc ret-conned into the memories of those with whom he should have been interacting. As he masters more Refinements, he can choose either to retain memories of his Promethean existence, or to gain false memories of the human life he created for himself, until at nine Refinements he has full recall of whichever life he chose. With all ten Refinements mastered, he gains a single opportunity to rethink that choice: when he first hits a breaking point after the New Dawn he will briefly recall both lives, and can choose again which he wishes to keep.
