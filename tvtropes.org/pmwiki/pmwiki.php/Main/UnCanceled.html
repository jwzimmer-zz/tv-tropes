</p><p>The biggest causes are either a campaign by fans (along with a compliant creator), or high sales in other media, such as DVD. If the show is not popular enough to warrant a whole new series but an ending is in demand by fans, then a TV movie, miniseries, or a new season may be ordered to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrapItUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrapItUp">Wrap It Up</a>.

A Twitter feed for viewers was added for viewers to express their interest in a possible return and the fandom proceeded to <em>flood the feed</em> with pleas to revive the block. Rumors the return was a hoax were dispelled when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveBlum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveBlum">Steve Blum</a>, voice of Toonami host TOM himself, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KyleHebert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KyleHebert">Kyle Hebert</a>, a fellow voice actor with equal stature got involved.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em> anime was canceled in 2004 after four years on the air when it was beginning to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheManga">overtake the manga</a>. Five years after, in 2009, a 26-episode follow-up series titled <em>Inuyasha: The Final Act</em>, was commissioned in order to adapt the remaining chapters now that the manga itself had concluded.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PantheonHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PantheonHigh">Pantheon High</a></em> was one of Tokyopop's Original English Language (OEL) manga series, and like most of their OEL, it was canceled when the US economy dipped and Tokyopop restructured. After about two years, the third and final volume was released on the Tokyopop website.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> lasted 3 seasons in its original run, ending in 1997. A fourth season was planned, but the main cast's other commitments, along with various production issues, kept it from happening...for 11 years. Season 4 finally aired in 2008, with a fifth season arriving the following year.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>'s original run in the US was cut short after only 65 episodes in its original syndicated run. After leaving syndication, it re-surfaced on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/USANetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/USANetwork">USA Network</a>, where it was once again, cancelled after failing to find an audience. However, once the show ended up on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami">Toonami</a>, it finally garnered itself an audience, which resulted in the show being continued with more episodes.
</li><li> This actually happened to the English dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> back in the late <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">1990s</a>. After two seasons worth of 67 episodes in its first run, the show was cancelled in 1998 due its failure of gaining a substantial audience. When the episodes started to air on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami">Toonami</a>, it got much more popularity, and Funimation started dubbing new episodes in 1999.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallKai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallKai">Dragon Ball Kai</a></em> received this treatment as well <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">thanks to the U.S. market</a>. Despite good ratings, the lack of revenue in the merchandise caused it to be cancelled at the end of Cell Saga, meaning the Buu arc was left unadapted. However, the series proved to be so popular on Nicktoons TV and Toonzai that it led to the Buu Saga being commissioned a year and a half later.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma &frac12;</a></em> was originally canceled in Japan after only 18 episodes due to its time slot being in competition with another, more popular show. It however, continued several months later with a different time slot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheMysteriousCitiesOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheMysteriousCitiesOfGold">The Mysterious Cities of Gold</a></em> aired its second season <em>30 years</em> after its first season finale.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX">Sonic X</a></em> ended its series after 52 episodes. But after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>, 26 more episodes were made for the North American audience. Interestingly, all 26 episodes would also have a Japanese Dub.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO">The Big O</a></em>'s original 13-episode run ended inconclusively. The series became so popular in America that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">[adult swim]</a> helped to produce another 13 episodes three years after the original run (that run also ended inconclusively, but Adult Swim lost interest).

</li><li> The anime adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em> had a fairly satisfying ending, but still had some unresolved plot threads, and only managed to adapt the first three novels of the series. After finishing in 2010, a second season was finally announced in 2014 that would be divided into three parts. The first part aired in January 2015, the second part aired in July 2015, and the third part aired in January 2016.
</li><li> Hiramoto Akira&#146;s popularity soared with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PrisonSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PrisonSchool">Prison School</a></em>, which was expected of a series rife with intelligent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">Fanservice</a> detailed by a great and arousing artstyle, it made publisher Kodansha revaluate Hiramoto&#146;s previous opposite (insightful, realistic and psychological) work&#146;s, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MeAndTheDevilBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MeAndTheDevilBlues">Me and the Devil Blues</a></em>, cancellation/indefinite hiatus.
</li><li> <em>The Flat Earth/Exchange</em> was originally serialized from 1991 to 1994 in <em>Patsy</em>, but the story abruptly halted when the magazine was discontinued. It was resumed in 2001 under Enterbrain.
</li><li> Throughout 2002-2006, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a></em> had three seasons and one OVA, but there was plenty of source material that had not been adapted in animated format. Over nine years later in October 2015, it was announced a new anime season was under production.
</li><li> Originally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation">Funimation</a>'s dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan">D.Gray-Man</a></em> only covered the first 51 episodes of the 2006 series. Between 2010 and 2016, the localization was cancelled due to licensing issues between Funimation and Dentsu (the Japanese licensor). However, in 2016, after getting the license to the 2016 follow-up, <em>D.Gray Man Hallow</em>, Funimation managed to secure the license to the second half of the 2006 series, and plans to release and dub it in the near future.
</li><li> <em>Otokozaka</em> ("A Man's Hill"), a martial arts manga by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasamiKurumada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasamiKurumada">Masami Kurumada</a> published from 1984 to 1985, was canceled after only six months in serialization, ending with an infamous cliffhanger of the main character running down a brick road and the kanji <em>mikan</em> (&#26410;&#23436;, "Not The End") displayed. It resumed serialization almost 30 years later in <em>Weekly Playboy</em> (no relation to the American <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Playboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Playboy">Playboy</a></em> magazine) in 2014.
</li><li> After several years of complete inactivity following what most people took to be a definitive conclusion, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> eventually got two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationMovie">Compilation Movies</a>, with minor changes to make way for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeassLelouchOfTheResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeassLelouchOfTheResurrection">a third movie</a> that continues the story.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaisonIkkoku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaisonIkkoku">Maison Ikkoku's</a></em> dub was canceled by Viz after 36 episodes due to poor VHS sales, and the subtitled version was similarly canceled after 64 episodes. Viz released the show to billingual DVD after <em>Inuyasha</em>'s success (both shows were created by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RumikoTakahashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RumikoTakahashi">Rumiko Takahashi</a>), continuing the dub/subtitles from where they left off, and miraculously finished all 96 episodes. However, most of the dub cast was replaced for the newer episodes, and the sales were still low, so the final DVD boxset was a RightStuf.com exclusive.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> anime originally ended in 2012, leaving the manga's final arc unanimated.

After those five, it was canceled again until fan demand convinced DC to give Manhunter another chance. Then it became a backup Feature for <em>Batman Streets of Gotham</em>. The backup feature was cancelled after only a year.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SonicTheComic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SonicTheComic">Sonic the Comic</a></em> (the UK one) had an uncanceling in the form of a "Head approved" fan revival.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen">X-Men</a></em>, the comic book series, was canceled after seven years of horrible sales and no popularity (it was revived nine months later, but only published reprints of earlier issues). It was basically seen as a poor-man's version of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a>. Then it was rebooted with all new characters like Nightcrawler, Storm, and Colossus, along with minor Hulk villain Wolverine. Under the skilled writing of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont">Chris Claremont</a>, it became Marvel's flagship title throughout the '80s and '90s.
</li><li> Marvel's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em> was intended to be just a 4-issue mini-series but after it got positive feedback, it was made into a series, which ended with issue #80.

However, a combination of fan support on social media, critical acclaim, and Tom King's rising profile has convinced DC to restore its 12-issue run, with the door open for additional issues.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperSons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperSons">Super Sons</a></em> was suddenly announced to be cancelled in the February 2018 despite strong sales and a loyal readerbase, with the final issue being published in May 2018. Cue mass backlash on all forms of social media. Three months later, a monthly twelve-issue maxi-series titled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AdventuresOfTheSuperSons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AdventuresOfTheSuperSons">Adventures of the Super Sons</a></em> was announced with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterTomasi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterTomasi">Peter Tomasi</a> and Carlos Barberi as the writer and artist again.

Both titles were created with the main drive of essentially trying to pander to minorities or those who didn't really read comics (Iceman had been revealed as gay and Nadia Pym was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">Legacy Character</a> seemingly replacing a perfectly good character). While the titles themselves seemed to not find any readers, strong trade paperback sales saw Marvel decide to resurrect both titles &mdash; <em>Iceman</em> as a mini-series this time &mdash; and see them both a lot more beloved.

<ul><li> Incredibly, this happened in its early days on NBC daytime. NBC president and CEO Fred Silverman made two attempts to cancel the show in 1980. The first was to make room for a failed talk show hosted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLetterman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLetterman">David Letterman</a>, but was never followed through; the second was to make room for a spinoff of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AnotherWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AnotherWorld">Another World</a></em> called <em>Texas</em> and was actually followed through to the point that several staff members (including announcer Charlie O'Donnell) left and a series finale was taped. Thankfully however, Silverman was later ousted due to green lighting one too many programming failures on NBC's prime time lineup (and for almost bankrupting the network after spending a ton of money to produce a whopping 150 hours of coverage for the 1980 Moscow Summer Olympics, only to end up cancelling said programming after President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JimmyCarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JimmyCarter">Jimmy Carter</a> pulled the U.S. team out of the event in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkToTheRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkToTheRescue">His replacement, Grant Tinker, reversed the cancellation decision, cutting Letterman's show to an hour, and the show managed to progress unharmed.</a> Amusingly, Tinker previously worked at NBC as a network assistant during the mid-1960's, and, in fact, had convinced Mort Werner, NBC's then senior vice president for programming and talent, to green light <em>Wheel</em> creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MervGriffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MervGriffin">Merv Griffin</a>'s other most well known creation, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy">Jeopardy!</a></em> <em>Wheel</em> would only gain in popularity come the 1980s, especially once Pat Sajak and Vanna White took over and the (still running) nighttime syndicated version began in 1983.
</li><li> And then it struck daytime again. Pat Sajak left daytime in January 1989 to host a talk show for CBS, and while the out-of-his-element Rolf Benirschke did the last six months of that run, NBC and Griffin simply could not come to a license agreement due to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight">The Price Is Right</a></em> adding viewers while <em>Wheel</em> remained steady. NBC announced the show's end in mid-May, only for CBS to renew it the next day. After NBC's last show on June 30, the show took a two week hiatus before premiering on CBS July 17; Bob Goen was chosen as the new host on July 7. The show's subsequent ratings never approached that of the NBC era, even after hopping back there in January 1991, and it was cancelled September of that year.

However, a few years later he was working on a collection of previously published short stories set in the series' universe, and found he missed writing for the characters so much he decided to revive it with a new entry, <em>Never Say Die</em>, which was released in 2017. Another new book, <em>Nightshade</em>, is scheduled for 2020, with Horowitz expecting there to be at least one more after that.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChildrenOfTheRedKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChildrenOfTheRedKing">Children of the Red King</a></em> series originally was to end at volume five after Charlie got his father back, but many fans begged for more and so three more books came out.

In 2008 Stine brought the series back as <em>Goosebumps Horrorland</em>, recapturing much of the original series' success and lasting until 2012. The franchise has since evolved into <em>Goosebumps Most Wanted</em>, which as of this writing is still going strong.

Dan repeatedly insisted that he was satisfied with John's story being over after the first trilogy, but eventually realized that there was more to tell and pitched <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrilogyCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrilogyCreep">The Devil's Only Friend</a></em> to his publisher.

Disappointed, the authors got day jobs and went on with their lives for the next several years while, unbeknownst to them, a significant Liad fandom was growing on the Internet (to the point where "When will the next Liaden book come out?" was a question in the SF fandom newsgroup's FAQ). <br><br>When the Internet arrived in Lee &amp; Miller's neck of Maine, they were startled to find that not only were fans clamoring for the next book, but the title of it, <em>Plan B</em>, had already been decided for them. With this fandom behind them, Lee &amp; Miller were able to find a publisher to continue the series, and cranked out seven more books (as well as two collections of the short stories they continue to self-publish in chapbook form every year). <br><br>Then the series was uncanceled <em>again</em> when Baen picked it up after that other publisher, Meisha Merlin, went out of business. Four more books were added to the series (though two of them had already been written as fan-funded draft manuscripts), then other sequels and prequels were contracted. To the fans' delight, the series now shows no signs of stopping.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em> was cancelled in 2010 with the expectations that a film adaptation would follow up the few lingering plotlines left. With the movie in development hell and the cancellation of Kiefer Sutherland's show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Touch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Touch">Touch</a></em>, it was announced the show would be revived as a mini-series entitled <em>24: Live Another Day</em>.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeventhHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeventhHeaven">7th Heaven</a></em> was canceled after 10 seasons, its final episode got such unexpectedly stellar ratings the CW network decided to revive it for one more season, unfortunately it wasn't too well-received by most and the ratings plummeted.
</li><li> FOX cancelled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol">American Idol</a></em> after 15 seasons. Following a brief hiatus, ABC revived the series in 2018.
</li><li> One of the shortest uncancellation cycles on record belongs to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericasMostWanted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericasMostWanted">America's Most Wanted</a></em>. In 1996, Fox canceled the series even though it was still one of the fledgling network's highest-rated shows, as Fox attempted to establish a Saturday night comedy block to take advantage of NBC's dwindling dominance of the evening. After then-FBI director Louis Freeh, police departments across the country, the governors of 37 states and more than 200,000 letter-writers complained about the decision, Fox hastily reinstated the series, and it suffered only a six-week hiatus. It also kind of helped that the new sitcoms bombed badly and that Fox realized <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren">Married... with Children</a></em> and <em>Martin</em> should have never been moved to Saturday night in the first place. In 2011, the show was reduced to a series of quarterly specials on Fox, as well as regular showings on Lifetime TV, but it chugged along until 2013.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/APBio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/APBio">A.P. Bio</a></em> was cancelled after its second season by NBC, only to be revived for a third season by NBCUniversal's upcoming streaming service a couple of months later.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AreYouAfraidOfTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AreYouAfraidOfTheDark">Are You Afraid of the Dark?</a></em> was cancelled in 1996, then renewed for one more season in 1999 with an all-new cast.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment">Arrested Development</a></em> was canceled in 2006 after three seasons, ending on a massive cliffhanger. For the next few years a movie was reported to be in development but never came to pass, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix">Netflix</a> picked up the series for a fourth season which debuted in 2013. A fifth season aired in 2018 and 2019. No news about a sixth season has come up, however, with the cast being a little too busy, Portia di Rossi's retirement from acting, and Jeffrey Tambor's... er... you know, it seems very unlikely.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em> was canceled by PTEN one year short of its 5 year arc. They wrapped it up as best they could by the end of Season 4, but then had to create a whole new story arc when they were picked up for a final season by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TNT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TNT">TNT</a>.
</li><li> A few years after the British version of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChannelFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChannelFour">Channel Four</a> comedy show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BallsOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BallsOfSteel">Balls of Steel</a></em> was canned, an Australian version premiered in 2011 for The Comedy Channel. While one could consider it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignRemake">Foreign Remake</a> (as it does add some localized acts to the mix), a few of the more prominent recurring acts from the British version (particularly Olivia Lee and Neg Dupree) participated as well, meaning that it could considered to be a de facto continuation of the British version.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattleBots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattleBots">BattleBots</a></em> was canceled in 2002 after five seasons on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ComedyCentral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ComedyCentral">Comedy Central</a>, but got brought back by CBS College Sports in December of 2009. It then ended up getting uncanceled again, getting a six episode revival series on ABC, beginning on June 1st 2015.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966">Batman (1966)</a></em> technically subverts the trope. The series was cancelled in 1968 by ABC and picked up by NBC a few days later for the fall. Unfortunately someone destroyed all the sets (over 200K in 1968 money) and NBC voided the deal.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Baywatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Baywatch">Baywatch</a></em> was originally an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC">NBC</a> TV (or should we say <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JiggleShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JiggleShow">T&amp;A</a>) series which was canceled. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidHasselhoff">David Hasselhoff</a>, the show's star, arranged to buy the rights to the show and have it continue as a syndicated TV show, where it was very successful.
</li><li> CBS ended <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeakmansWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeakmansWorld">Beakman's World</a></em> after getting 65 episodes in the can (the standard number of episodes needed before a series could go into syndication back then). An outpouring of fan support convinced them to give it one more season. The comeback was so late it resulted in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">assistant change</a>.
</li><li> The Australian version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother">Big Brother</a></em> ran from 2001-2008 before it was suddenly cancelled. Four years later, it was just as suddenly given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revival">revival</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop">on a rival network</a>. The same thing happened with the British version.
</li><li> Apparently the first anyone working on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven">Blake's 7</a></em> knew of the fourth series was when it was announced at the end of the last episode of the third. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a>'s Director of Television, Bill Cotton, was enjoying the episode so much he phoned the transmission staff mid-episode and told them to announce that the show was returning.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingIn">Breaking In</a></em> was initially cancelled by FOX in 2011, then it was unexpectedly un-cancelled and re-tooled in 2012, only to end up cancelled once again.
</li><li> FOX cancelled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BrooklynNineNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BrooklynNineNine">Brooklyn Nine-Nine</a></em> after five seasons, then got revived by NBC near-immediately. The show was cancelled on May 10, 2018 to <em>massive</em> fan outcry, including many celebrities with no affiliation with the show such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LinManuelMiranda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LinManuelMiranda">Lin-Manuel</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel/status/994682340319391744">Miranda<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GuillermoDelToro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GuillermoDelToro">Guillermo</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/RealGDT/status/995039920656920583">Del Toro<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/MJMcKean/status/994711394678272009">Michael McKean<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkHamill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkHamill">Mark</a></em> <em><a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/HamillHimself/status/994708302226378752">Hamill<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>. After Netflix and Hulu turned the show down, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC">NBC</a> (the network that produces <em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em> and that aired all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOffice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOffice">the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParksAndRecreation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParksAndRecreation">other</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodPlace">shows</a> created by Mike Schur at the time) announced the day after that it had picked up the show for a sixth season.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CagneyAndLacey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CagneyAndLacey">Cagney &amp; Lacey</a></em> was canceled by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS">CBS</a> in 1983, after two seasons. A letter-writing campaign persuaded the network to bring the show back; four more full seasons aired, plus four (!) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeForTVMovie">Made For TV Movies</a> in the mid-1990s. Thus, unlike many of the shows on this list, its post-uncancelation run was much longer than its pre-cancellation run.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CharlesInCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CharlesInCharge">Charles in Charge</a></em> was brought back in syndication in 1987 after it was dropped by CBS after only one season in 1985.
</li><li> In 1989, as part of its attempt to revive NBC's old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNBCMysteryMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNBCMysteryMovie">Mystery Movie lineup</a> ABC had new seasons of both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Columbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Columbo">Columbo</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Kojak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Kojak">Kojak</a></em> commissioned 11 years after they both ended in 1978. Although <em>Kojak</em> would only last one season, <em>Columbo's</em> revival managed to be successful enough to last a few more seasons and even after that continue with a near-yearly series of television movies all the way to 2003.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheComeback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheComeback">The Comeback</a></em> was canceled by HBO after its only season in 2005, only to be brought back for a six-episode second season nearly a decade later in 2014.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em>. a series that spent its life constantly on the bubble, was finally cancelled by NBC after its fifth season. However, at the eleventh hour, <a class="urllink" href="http://time.com/2945298/community-gets-a-6th-season-and-the-cast-rejoices-on-twitter/">literally<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> on the final day the cast's contracts were due to expire, Yahoo! Screen picked up the show for a sixth season, which premiered online in 2015, fulfilling the series' ''SixSeasons'' part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanHarmon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanHarmon">WordOfGod</a>'s <em>SixSeasonsAndAMovie</em> hashtag.
</li><li> ABC cancelled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CougarTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CougarTown">Cougar Town</a></em> during its 3rd season. Shortly afterwards, TBS picked up the series.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CNN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CNN">CNN</a> had the show <em>Crossfire</em>, which was a "nuanced debate show" where two pundits would sit apart from a guest and go off on them near-relentlessly. Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDailyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDailyShow">Jon Stewart</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFQFB5YpDZE">was on<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Awesome/TheDailyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Awesome/TheDailyShow">and left the show a smoldering ruin, utterly broken down for the vapidness that it was</a>.

And it was announced it was coming back in late 2013...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo">much to Jon's chagrin</a>. Luckily for him however the revival didn't take off, and the show was cancelled again less than a year later.
</li><li> After an incredible 10 years, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC">ABC</a> greenlighted the return of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cupid">Cupid</a></em>. It was described as a reimagining, suffered the same fate as the original, and quickly faded away.
</li><li> F/X canceled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Damages" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Damages">Damages</a></em> during its third season. The show's producers took the show over to DirecTV, who picked it up for two more seasons.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC">ABC</a> cancelled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DesignatedSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DesignatedSurvivor">Designated Survivor</a></em> after two seasons, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix">Netflix</a> later picked up the series for a shortened third season to air in 2019. It was cancelled again afterward.
</li><li> By 1985, British sci-fi institution <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> had weathered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a>, inflation, and lackluster scripts... but when a new BBC controller <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">who had never liked the show</a> came in, its number was up, with the series being cancelled at the end of its 22nd season in 1985. The resultant outcry made the newspapers and talk shows (and even spawned a "We Are the World"-style charity record that has become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a> for all involved), and 18 months later, it returned; unfortunately, the ratings started to slip after it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">put in a time slot against popular</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera">Soap Opera</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet">Coronation Street</a></em>, and in 1989, it was cancelled once again. A failed pilot TV movie in 1996 notwithstanding, it wouldn't return <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revival">as an ongoing TV series</a> until 2005. It has since become one of the most successful works of fiction on British television.
</li><li> A&amp;E suspended <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DogTheBountyHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DogTheBountyHunter">Dog the Bounty Hunter</a></em> several times due to incidents involving the Chapmans, but always mad it back on the air with new seasons due to fan outcry and closed-door negotiations. It finally ended its run in 2012, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CMT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CMT">CMT</a> then picked up a new version for 2013 in which Dog travels around fixing up failing bail bond agencies in a style similar to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KitchenNightmares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KitchenNightmares">Kitchen Nightmares</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DueSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DueSouth">Due South</a></em>, multiple times. The show was originally cancelled by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS">CBS</a> after its first season. It was then renewed, and "Letting Go" was filmed to keep the fans from wondering what happened after the finale. It was cancelled again at the end of Season 2, with the production company going as far as taking down the sets. A group of Canadian production companies banded together to fund the show, and it returned for two more seasons. Callum Keith Rennie also replaced David Marciano as Ray Vecchio (because Marciano had already moved his family after the apparent cancellation and didn't want to move back).
</li><li> Despite decent ratings and being one of the best reviewed science-fiction shows <em>of all time</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Syfy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Syfy">Syfy</a> ended up cancelling <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheExpanse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheExpanse">The Expanse</a></em> in May 2018 due to a contract dispute between the network and producer Alcon Entertainment. This led to SEVERE fan, media and celebrity backlash. After successfully mounting a fan campaign that was literally like no other (including but not limited to: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">130k+ petition signatures, an airplane banner, sending the ''Roci'' into space, creating boxes of Protomolecule jello, a "Miller's Low Life" beer, trending at the top of every social media platform, and upticking live ratings by a whole 100k</a>) to revive a series, Jeff Bezos (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/OneOfUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/OneOfUs">himself a fan of the books and series</a>) announced that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmazonStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmazonStudios">Amazon Studios</a> has purchased the series for all future seasons as a Prime exclusive.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fame">Fame</a></em> was brought back in syndication.

It's proven to be one of the most successful examples of this trope. Not only did the show's re-runs on BET get better ratings than the CW's first airings, the season 4 premier got 7.7 million viewers, which was a first for a serialized drama/comedy on cable. All the more impressive, considering what network The Game came from (CW) and where it went (BET).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC">NBC</a> dropped <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GetSmart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GetSmart">Get Smart</a></em> after four seasons, only to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS">CBS</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop">pick it up</a> for a fifth.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV">MTV</a>'s <em>Headbanger's Ball</em> was finally brought back in 2003 after the original show was cancelled almost a decade earlier.

This led to major outrage, especially as the third season finale left off on a cliffhanger created specifically to get a renewal. Much rallying on social media by fans as well as some of the cast and crew to <em>#SaveLucifer</em> led to Netflix deciding to resurrect the show.

Fans lobbied to other networks to bring the show back, even to the extent of buying a full-page ad in <em>Variety</em> bemoaning the loss. It was eventually picked up by the Sci-Fi Channel. Three years later, it was canceled again, though it has two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successors</a>: Cinematic Titanic and Rifftrax. In 2015, a successful Kickstarter campaign raised $5.7 million (far more than the $2 million goal) to bring back the series for an eleventh season, which premiered in April 2016.

But it <em>is</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FOX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FOX">FOX</a>, so they rendered the show gone just the same.

Strong ratings for repeats that aired over the summer of 1970 convinced them to bring the show back, and it lasted for a further four seasons.

The threat of cancellation still loomed over its early second season, until viewership spiked after a surprise upset Golden Globe win for best drama in 1995, beating out then-primetime favorites like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER">ER</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NYPDBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NYPDBlue">NYPD Blue</a></em>.

Then in 2009, the producers announced a new season and even released a trailer for it.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ReadingRainbow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ReadingRainbow">Reading Rainbow</a></em> is a triumphant example of this trope, up there with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a>. Commissions for new episodes of the show stopped in 2006, and in 2009 PBS pulled the funding and broadcast completely, and a day just before the Emmy for which the show won no less. Showrunner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeVarBurton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeVarBurton">LeVar Burton</a>, however, won't take no for an answer and immediately sought to buy the rights to the name and past episodes, and seeing the potential of tablet computers, started a project to put videos and books featured on the show on the iPad. The project was met with critical acclaim when it launched in 2012, and requests started pouring in for the app to be ported to other platforms, resulting in a Kickstarter campaign to fund the project further and hitting an astonishing record of US$6.5 million, the highest funded project at the time, at the end of the campaign. The app has now been ported to Android and its derivatives, and there is also a version accessible from web browsers, with support for more platforms coming soon. And the additional money is used to fund access to the app for underfunded classrooms in the US. Additionally, new segments are now being shot for the app and for the youtube channel. It's a glorious comeback for the franchise, and for LeVar.
</li><li> In 1999, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> ended on a cliffhanger. Co-creator and head writer Doug Naylor attempted for some time to get a movie off the ground, but in 2001 approached the BBC about to make a new series and the BBC replied with the comment "we are no longer interested in the audience <em>Red Dwarf</em> used to provide". The show eventually returned on cable channel Dave in 2009 with a 3-part adventure and was a massive ratings success for the channel, even beating the original channel that <em>Red Dwarf</em> used to air on in the rating (BBC2), a bout of hilarious irony on the BBC. A new series was been announced and aired in Autumn 2012.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RipperStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RipperStreet">Ripper Street</a></em> was cancelled after two series, a lot in part because it was so expensive to make. Then Amazon stepped in with extra funding, and its third season debuted on Amazon Prime in the UK in 2014. Amazon then announced in May of 2015 that is going to produce two additional seasons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne">Roseanne</a></em> was cancelled by ABC in the middle of its 2018 revival despite sky-high ratings after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoseanneBarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoseanneBarr">Roseanne Barr</a> was fired for making a racist joke in one of her tweets.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roswell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roswell">Roswell</a></em> has both cases. It was -apparently- first canceled by the WB on the first season, which promoted the fans to launch a "Tabasco" campaign, in which they managed to send 6,000 bottles of Tabasco to the executives. On the second season, the show was canceled again, even if the fans did send 12,000 Tabasco bottles. UPN picked it up for a third season, after which it was canceled for good.
</li><li> The 2007-2008 season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs">Scrubs</a></em> was supposed to be the last but, due to the Writer's Strike, the show didn't exactly end in a satisfying fashion. It <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop">moved</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC">ABC</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SledgeHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SledgeHammer">Sledge Hammer!</a></em> was canceled after the 1st season, only to be renewed for a second season after the last episode got higher than expected ratings, which created something of a dilemma for the writers. Expecting to be cancelled after the first season, the season finale featured Los Angeles as well as the titular character being vaporized by an nuclear bomb. They got around this by claiming at the start of the second season that the first-season finale was five years in the future, giving themselves room to run the series for another five seasons. Naturally, the show was canceled soon thereafter.
</li><li> NBC canceled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Southland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Southland">Southland</a></em> to make room for Jay Leno's prime time show, but was saved by TNT.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em> is perhaps the most famous example of this trope, even though technically it was not actually cancelled. The story goes that, as the end of the second season approached, the producers caught wind that NBC was considering cancelling the series and reached out to the sci-fi fan community, generating hundreds of thousands (Wikipedia says a million) pieces of mail in support, leading to NBC announcing on-air the show's renewal for one final season.
</li><li> Showtime canceled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> after the fifth season, and was then picked up by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFi">Sci-Fi</a>. And was canceled <em>again</em> after the tenth season, with the fanbase split between those who wanted it to continue and those who wanted it to happen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason">two seasons earlier</a>. MGM decided to just go direct-to-DVD this time around.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC">ABC</a> axed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Taxi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Taxi">Taxi</a></em>, but it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop">jumped to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC">NBC</a> and lasted for another season, before dwindling ratings finally took it down.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC">NBC</a> announced the cancellation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Timeless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Timeless">Timeless</a></em> on May 10, 2017, despite massive popularity and positive reviews among the fans. Due to massive fan outrage which resulted in the show even trending on twitter after news of its cancellation broke, as well as some quick negotiating between Sony (the company that owns the series) and NBC, the show was quickly renewed three days later, in what was possibly the quickest turnaround for a cancelled show in recent history.
<ul><li> And then it was cancelled <em>again</em> in June 2018, leading to more fan outcry. A month later, NBC caved again, but only partly &mdash; while the show wasn't given another season, it <em>was</em> given a two-hour TV movie to serve as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>, thereby keeping the series from ending on a massive cliffhanger.

The show meant to replace it in the CBS lineup didn't last, and the show was brought back for a shorter season of hour-long episodes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RodSerling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RodSerling">Rod Serling</a> had taken a college teaching position by this time, which is why he doesn't appear on the same set as the actors during season four. Ratings were good enough to justify a fifth season, which brought the running time back to half an hour.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Unforgettable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Unforgettable">Unforgettable</a></em> is the rare example of a show that did well in the ratings, but not well enough for CBS's ratings standards. It was killed at the end of its first season, but was renewed for a summer run on CBS for its second season because of TNT and Lifetime looking to snap it up. It did well enough as a summer show that it was renewed for a third season. After the third season, it was canceled again, only to be revived by A&amp;E for a fourth season.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars">Veronica Mars</a></em> was canceled by The WB after its third season. It was revived in a 2014 crowd-funded film and a fourth season produced by Hulu in 2019.

The American version was revived by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCW">The CW</a> in 2013 after six years off the air.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YoungDracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YoungDracula">Young Dracula</a></em> was canceled in 2008, therefore leaving it at a cliffhanger at the end of Season 2. Three years later (thanks to fan-led petitions and general interest), the third season ended up premiering on the 31st of October, and the show went on to have a fourth and a fifth.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> was uncancelled in 2016 for two more seasons after being initially cancelled in 2002.

This also had something of a longer-term effect, where several veteran designers and writers at Games Workshop left the company in the late oughts, only to contribute to Fantasy Flight Games, who currently publish all of the Games Workshop-licensed Tabletop RPGs. This then happened again in 2017, when Fantasy Flight lost the license; the books were simply re-listed under the new publisher and put back on sale in digital format.

Originally one game split in two (released in 2001 and 2003, respectively) due to length, it received acclaim and developed quite the following, and even though the second game technically wrapped the story up, many believed there was enough loose threads to make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunDarkDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunDarkDawn">a sequel</a>.

Then plans for bringing the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIV">Dragon Quest IV</a></em> remake to the U.S. were scrapped when the original development studio shut down. It took seven years and the Square-Enix merger before the U.S. finally saw the PS1 version's bonus content on the DS.
</li><li> <em>Metal Gear Solid: Rising</em> wound up being cancelled in 2010 when development ground to a halt. Thankfully, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PlatinumGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PlatinumGames">PlatinumGames</a> stepped in to help get the game finished, which they succeeded in doing, releasing the game in 2013 as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearRisingRevengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearRisingRevengeance">Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</a></em>.

The series then gained a 5th chapter in 2008 (2010 to western markets, and also the only one localized outside of Japan). One advantage of the series is that the games are largely self-contained, with minimal continuity spanning the various games.

It was quietly cancelled. In 2012, the American version was surprisingly uncanceled and released that June - just over three years after the Australian re-release hit store shelves (and even then, it was released under the Nintendo Selects label... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">which is usually only used for budget re-releases</a>).

</li><li> <em>MOTHER</em> was stated to be released in North America, but due to the NES being at the end of its life cycle, and the SNES taking off in popularity, Nintendo canceled the English release after it was finished. Nearly 30 years later, the game was finally released on the Wii U's Virtual Console as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBoundBeginnings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBoundBeginnings">EarthBound Beginnings</a></em> in order to differentiate itself from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelFirst">which was released first</a>.

On December 9 of the same year, it was announced as no longer being cancelled and then was released.
</li><li> The bankruptcy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TelltaleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TelltaleGames">Telltale Games</a> led to all of their upcoming games being cancelled, including the final two episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWalkingDeadSeasonFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWalkingDeadSeasonFour">The Walking Dead Season Four</a></em>. However a month later it was announced that Skybound Entertainment would work with the original team to finish the game.

At any time, new episodes can just abruptly stop for no reason whatsoever, with no new episodes airing for weeks, even months at a time. In some cases, there will even be a new show airing in that same timeslot, with no indication of reruns in other timeslots (although airing a show in a "death slot" means that a show has been virtually cancelled, even if it isn't exactly official).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4iwlc');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4iwlc" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4iwlc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There have even been cases where international versions of both networks finish a show's run before the American versions do.</span> As a result, cancellations and uncancellations <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">are much more likely to happen</a> on these networks.

</li><li> A variant. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> was abruptly cancelled halfway during the production of the final season, as the production staff was expecting the series to be renewed for an additional one. As such, many plans were scrapped, and the staff was forced to quickly wrap things up sooner than planned in a one-hour <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>. However, the development of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBOMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBOMax">HBO Max</a> streaming service and the need for various production arms of the then newly-formed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerMedia">WarnerMedia</a> led to create original content for it resulted in Cartoon Network greenlighting the ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTimeDistantLands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTimeDistantLands">Adventure Time: Distant Lands</a>" miniseries just a month after the show ended.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em> announced that after its tenth season, the show would end so the channel could renovate its Sunday night line-up.

Then, it disappeared again. And now it was recently revealed to be revived again with two more seasons and even a spin-off.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BubbleGuppies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BubbleGuppies">Bubble Guppies</a></em> initially ended after its fourth season in October 2016, but due to its extreme popularity and merchandising (and even a live tour held shortly after), it was revived in June 2019.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CelebrityDeathmatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CelebrityDeathmatch">Celebrity Deathmatch</a></em>. The first revival just lasted two seasons, though, and the episodes that aired weren't very good. A second revival was announced some years later, this time with original creator Eric Fogel back on the production team.
</li><li> After ending in 2007, a new season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko">Code Lyoko</a></em> was announced for release in 2013 under a different title, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">shown only in France.</a>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory">Dexter's Laboratory</a></em> lasted two seasons until 1998, and three years later returned. But <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">the two seasons that followed are often hated</a> because they lacked input from series creator Genndy Tartakovsky (who was busy with <em>Samurai Jack</em> and <em>Star Wars: Clone Wars</em>), had a change in artwork, had different writers, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">had replacement voice actors</a> (especially with Dexter. Christine Cavanaugh retired from voice acting after a custody battle with her husband and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CandiMilo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CandiMilo">Candi Milo</a> was called in as her replacement).
</li><li> After three seasons, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a> abruptly canceled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug">Doug</a></em> in 1994 due to contractual issues, despite having originally ordered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixtyFiveEpisodeCartoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixtyFiveEpisodeCartoon">sixty-five episodes</a>. Creators Jim Jinkins and Joe Aaron were furious at their actions and refused to work with them ever again. Soon after, Jinkins and Aaron were approached by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a>, who had then just purchased <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC">ABC</a>, and that gave the series another chance, running for three seasons before it was canceled again when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats">said network got into a similar contractual dispute</a>.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy">Ed, Edd n Eddy</a></em> was originally going to end after 52 episodes, with the episode <em>Take This Ed and Shove It</em>. Its continued popularity led to Cartoon Network ordering three holiday specials and two addition seasons, before the creator decided to scrap that final season early in production in lieu of a television movie. As such, the season five finale "Fistful of Ed" was marketed as the final episode, while the two Season 6 episodes that were too far along to scrap aired as "lost episodes" the following year. The series ended a year after that with the airing of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddysBigPictureShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddysBigPictureShow">Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em> was cancelled and renewed <strong>four</strong> times over the course of its ten season run, as a result of it not getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdoredByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdoredByTheNetwork">ratings as high as</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants">a certain sponge</a>, yet still performing better than every <em>other</em> animated show on the network. Creator Butch Hartman joked that the network would reliably take him aside and renew the show for another season or two as soon as he'd leave each wrap party.

Brought back by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FOX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FOX">FOX</a> after a long hiatus once DVD sales took off and reruns on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">[adult swim]</a> brought in better ratings than what it had on FOX, who realized exactly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">how much money they stood to make</a> off the most popular cartoon since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>. What's especially notable here is how in the returning series premiere, Peter recited <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLongList" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLongList">an excruciatingly long list</a> of FOX shows that <em>Family Guy</em> was canceled to make room for but were themselves inevitably, if not always abruptly and swiftly, canned (see the page quote for all the shows that tried and failed at replacing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>). Ironically, since its uncancellation, FOX has absolutely <em>refused</em> to cancel it again, despite fans saying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonalRot">the show has suffered greatly from lackluster writing and too much reliance conventions such as cut-away gags, cultural references, and throw-away jokes</a> in the following years; even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SethMacFarlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SethMacFarlane">Seth MacFarlane</a> himself has said he <em>wants Family Guy</em> to end already, but FOX won't let him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series not only got four made-for-DVD movies years after its original Fox run was over (which were made possible in part by the impressive ratings the reruns pulled in on Adult Swim), but got renewed in 2009 on Comedy Central &mdash; then it ended in 2013. While the final episode (in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fry and Leela finally get married</span>) has the feel that the show's over and it's never coming back (save for some cheap mentions on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, which doesn't seem like it will end anytime soon), Matt Groening is trying to shop it around to other networks. It's then played for hilarity in the opener of "Bender's Big Score".

</div><ul><li> And even before all 26 episodes had aired, the show was renewed for <em>another</em> new season. The tagline from the first DVD movie fits the series in more ways than one. The opening Subtitle even lampshades it by saying <strong>IT JUST WON'T STAY DEAD!</strong> (As pictured above)
</li></ul></li><li> Very poor ratings on its series premiere caused UPN to axe <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HomeMovies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HomeMovies">Home Movies</a></em> before it was able to even finish its first season. In 2001, one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">[adult swim]</a> executive said he liked <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HomeMovies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HomeMovies">Home Movies</a></em>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">[adult swim]</a> later revived the series, airing the unaired UPN episodes and ordering three more seasons.
</li><li> For several years, the idea of bringing back <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a></em> was thrown around at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a> due to its continued popularity in reruns, but never fully stuck because no agreement could be made on how to budget the project (the high financial cost of the show was a major reason for its original cancellation). The property would eventually see a comic book continuation that started in 2015, followed by a television movie a few years later.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheJetsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheJetsons">The Jetsons</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JonnyQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JonnyQuest">Jonny Quest</a></em>, two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera">Hanna-Barbera</a> shows that ran for one season each in the 1960s, were both revived with new episodes produced for syndication in the 1980s. Boomerang does not show these episodes as often; the consensus is that they are of much lower quality than the original runs.
<ul><li> Teletoon Retro in Canada <em>does</em> air the 1980s <em>Jetsons</em> (as well as the originals), and the difference in quality is very evident.
</li><li> H-B did the same with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YogiBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YogiBear">Yogi Bear</a> in 1988, using the background music from the original 1961 shorts and introducing a new character, Ranger Rubideux.

Then it was uncanceled again in 2004, with Van Partible back at the helm.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyTest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyTest">Johnny Test</a></em> After posting surprisingly good numbers on the Streaming Service, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix">Netflix</a> has Revived "Johnny Test" for 2 More Seasons the first of which will premiere in 2021.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KaBlam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KaBlam">KaBlam!</a></em> was going to end with three seasons, wrapping season three up with June giving Henry a kiss, and them becoming an official couple. Fans made noise, and a fourth season was created (to the annoyance of some fans, Henry and June's relationship was set back to being "just friends" (for a little while)). A fifth season was on the way, but Nick cancelled it before it began.

A second season was suddenly announced, but it was postponed for the longest time until February 2018, when the show came back with 52 episodes (which the first season only had half of). There doesn't seem to be any sign of a third season, possibly leading to the show's re-cancellation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em> was going to be cancelled after Season 11. That season's finale, "Lucky's Wedding Suit" was explicitly written as a series finale with cameos by various recurring characters. However, fan outcry led Fox to renew it at the last second, and the show ran for another two seasons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MaxAndRuby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MaxAndRuby">Max and Ruby</a></em> stopped making episodes in 2007 and got cancelled that same year, but the show later returned to making new episodes starting in 2009 and with a few new voice actors.

But even that wasn't enough to fufill the demand, as there were 25 episodes in <em>Noddy Shop</em>'s second season, resulting in 11 earlier <em>Toyland Adventures</em> episodes being reused and one episode to not feature such a segment.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pingu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pingu">Pingu</a></em> was originally canceled after Season 4 in 2000, due to the declining popularity of the series. Three years after HIT Entertainment bought the rights to the series, it was revived for two additional seasons before being canceled again in 2006. 11 years later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Mattel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Mattel">Mattel</a> (current owners of HIT Entertainment) contracted Japan-based Polygon Pictures to produce another revival, <em>Pingu in the City</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot">ReBoot</a></em> aired two seasons between 1994-1996 and was canceled by ABC because of the Disney buyout. They even had a sly dig at them in the final episode of the second season by calling the enemy vehicles Armored Binome Carriers (ABC's). "The ABC's, they turned on us!" "Treacherous dogs!" But the show was co-financed by YTV in Canada so they managed a decent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Syndication" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Syndication">Syndication</a> deal and eventually produced a third season in 1998 that wrapped up the major plots and gave a happy ending to the characters (although left hints towards a new story arc). After being picked up by Cartoon Network and doing well in the ratings, they helped finance a fourth season in 2001 that resolved prior issues and ended on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger">Cliffhanger</a> which had to be resolved in comic book form.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RescueHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RescueHeroes">Rescue Heroes</a></em> aired for one season on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS">CBS</a> then was unceremoniously canceled when CBS opted not to renew their programming deal with studio <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nelvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nelvana">Nelvana</a>. It was much more successful on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Teletoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Teletoon">Teletoon</a>, the show's Canadian channel (and technically the home network for the series), and Teletoon wanted another season. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KidsWB" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KidsWB">Kids' WB!</a> picked the series up a year later for two more seasons, and gave the show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReTool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReTool">major changes</a>, such as delving into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> situations and some character redesigns.
</li><li> After 11 years off the air, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em>, one of Cartoon Network's most famous shows and a staple of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami">Toonami</a> during its days on Cartoon Network, was renewed for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack2017">a fifth season</a>, announced in late 2015 and aired in 2017, this time on the revived Toonami block on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">[adult swim]</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a></em> did a sketch where the show was supposedly canceled and then uncanceled after creators Seth Green (yes, him <em>again</em>) and Matt Senreich repented to Cartoon Network's execs; in reality, the show was hugely popular and there was no question that it was green-lit for another season.
<ul><li> It's since become a running joke that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a> gets "canceled" at the end of every season and "renewed" at the beginning of the next. Even if it means they have to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SethMacFarlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SethMacFarlane">Seth MacFarlane</a> to help them.
<div class="indent"><em>"Wow, Seth MacFarlane, you can do anything!"</em>
</div></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>. Both Comedy Central and creators <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TreyParkerAndMattStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TreyParkerAndMattStone">Trey Parker and Matt Stone</a> were uncertain that the show would even draw mediocre ratings, let alone become a massive cultural phenomenon, so only six episodes were ordered. Parker and Stone put the bulk of their attention elsewhere with films such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BASEketball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BASEketball">BASEketball</a></em>, but once South Park unexpectedly became Comedy Central's highest rated show and a hit among pretty much everybody from high schoolers to big name celebrities like Jerry Seinfeld, everyone scrambled to quickly create four holiday-themed episodes ("Pink Eye", "Starvin' Marvin", "Damien"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note759dx');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note759dx" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note759dx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which was originally supposed to be the show's Christmas episode</span> and "Mr. Hankey, The Christmas Poo") to tide fans over, followed by three more episodes to round out Season 1 and establish <em>South Park</em> as a full-fledged series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em> was cancelled in 2013 after Season 5, with the remaining episodes airing in 2014 as Season 6 under the label "The Lost Missions". It was later brought back in 2018 for a proper conclusion, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWarsSeasonSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWarsSeasonSeven">Season 7</a> debuting on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyPlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyPlus">Disney+</a> in February 2020.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies">Totally Spies!</a></em> ended with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> in 2008 after five seasons. It was renewed for a sixth season in 2013.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em> was canceled after its second season ended in early 2013, with the final tag blatantly confirming the oft-hinted-at alliance between Darkseid and The Light. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8x6r5');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note8x6r5" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8x6r5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">While fans called this a cliffhanger, it wasn't; it simply confirmed a common theory, but no fates were left hanging and the plot was resolved.</span> Despite a passionate campaign from fans, Cartoon Network wasn't swayed. On November 7th, 2016, it has officially been resurrected and a third season began airing on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCUniverse">DC Universe</a> in January 2019, with a fourth season confirmed to be in production.
