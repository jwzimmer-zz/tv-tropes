Executives generally want each episode to potentially bring in a new audience. Creators generally want to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanderingToTheBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanderingToTheBase">entertain the audience they have</a>. Granted, these aren't necessarily mutually exclusive, but doing one does make it harder to do the other. And in a rare case of this wiki taking the side of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">executive meddlers</a>, we have to admit that continuity lock-out is never caused by the execs. It has to be written.
</p><p>The standard answer to this issue is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn">Previously On&#133;</a> segment: each episode opens with a short capsule summary of prior events. Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn">Previously Ons</a> have their own drawbacks, such as inadvertently providing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spoiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spoiler">spoilers</a> or flat-out not working (the longer a show goes on, the more impossible it is to cover all the relevant bits in 60 seconds or less). Another answer, often used for less serialized programs that make use of more staggered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">story arcs</a>, is to create a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOnPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOnPoint">Jumping On Points</a> wherein any current plotlines are wrapped up or put on pause in order to have a few standalone stories (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em> literally labels its episodes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">"stand alone" and "complex" for this exact reason</a>). And, of course, there's nothing stopping the use of both.

If pulled off correctly, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">intricate series-spanning plot</a> gives audiences an additional reason to keep coming back beyond just finding the work entertaining, as they theorize what new plot developments may occur or how their favourite characters will continue to develop and interact with each other.

</p><p>Continuity Lock-Out is the most common reason why you'll often see some say they can't get into American superhero comic book series, more so than they would any television or film series. Because while even the most popular scripted TV shows (not counting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera">Soap Operas</a>) will rarely see more than 300 episodes, and any non-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThematicSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThematicSeries">thematic</a> film series that surpasses eight films without a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot">Continuity Reboot</a> of any kind is rare, most popular comic book and manga series run for much, much longer. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> has consistently been in print since the <em>1930s</em>, and you'll find that most popular characters you can name have been in circulation for several decades as well. This ensures that most new readers are just going to either give up or ignore most continuity, going for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes">Broad Strokes</a> approach in memorizing any pertinent information... that being said, most writers will as well, with only the most popular story arcs getting anything more than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nod</a>. In fact, in the past, it wasn't uncommon for long-running comic series to actually recycle storylines with little variation, in keeping with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FleetingDemographicRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FleetingDemographicRule">Fleeting Demographic Rule</a>.
</p><p>A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedAdaptation">Compressed Adaptation</a> might cause this. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebComics">Web Comics</a>, this can be the impetus for an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchiveBinge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchiveBinge">Archive Binge</a> or a justification for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchivePanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchivePanic">Archive Panic</a>.
</p><p>The rise of digital services like on-demand video, streaming, and e-books since the start of the 2010s have done wonders to reduce the impact of this trope. The entire runs for long-running works can be made easily available with a few clicks or taps, as opposed to audiences having to go out and dig for a VHS or DVD copy of the latest season, or desperately hoping that today's rerun will be the one to explain the plot point seen in a different rerun. As for newer works, programming created specifically for streaming services tend to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishBrevity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishBrevity">fewer episodes per season</a> and/or dump all of them at once for quick and easy viewing, so trying to remember all the minutia is less of a hassle. Finally, as the years have gone on, the internet has also allowed for easy access to fan-made sources of information (see: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWikiRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWikiRule">The Wiki Rule</a>). Of course, none of this completely negates any of the problems brought up. With the final point especially, relying too much on your fanbase having access to an encyclopedic database is seen as poor practice, since you're effectively putting the onus of keeping all the continuity of your work organized on the audience.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>.

</li><li> This is cited as a major problem with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTheMovie">Digimon: The Movie</a></em>. Unless you're already familiar with the franchise, the overall plot will be all but incomprehensible, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubInducedPlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubInducedPlotHole">plotholes induced by the dubs edits</a>, resulting from decisions such as cutting down the Hurricane Touchdown segment to a third of its original running time and shoehorning it in with the other two segments of the film (albiet that was at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">executive insistence</a>), despite barely relating to their events at all and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy">having a whole new set of characters dropped on the audience</a>, aren't helping.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>, mostly due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">Gambit Pileup</a> nature of the series. It's possible to jump in within the first ten episodes or so, but after Light and L actually meet each other, forget <em>that</em>.
</li><li> Given that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> has been running since 1997, Eiichiro Oda understandably tries to avoid locking out his readers, which can be difficult given the fact that almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">everything</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman">everyone</a> in the series is of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot">some importance</a> even if you don't follow the series from the start. Given that collecting every volume of the story released so far will set you back a few hundred dollars, he understandably puts short flash-backs into the story as well as summaries of the various arcs. To offset this, volume 50 is clearly labelled as a good "starting point", complete with recaps, backgrounds and a new direction for the story.
</li><li> Would you believe a simple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">fanservice-laden</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem">Unwanted Harem</a> series like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu">To Love-Ru</a></em> has this?

Or, until the second anime season, where did <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteGhostGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteGhostGirl">Oshizu</a> get herself a new body. Also, the sequel manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu">To Love-Ru</a> Darkness</em> makes no effort of helping newcomers on telling who's everyone.

Reading <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Chobits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Chobits">Chobits</a></em> also doesn't hurt.
<ul><li> Though reading them all doesn't guarantee full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">understanding</a>. Not even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CLAMP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CLAMP">CLAMP</a> (the creators, mind you) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments">understand it fully.</a>
</li><li> The OVAs of both <em>Tsubasa</em> and <em>xxxHolic</em> went straightforward with several arcs, skipping out several important details that would make anime-only viewers very confused. In <em>Tsubasa Shunraiki</em>, it adapted the Nihon arc but skipped the Infinity and Celes arcs, meaning anime-only viewers missed out Fai's backstory. In <em>xxxHolic: Rou</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it starts with Yuko dying and Watanuki inheriting the shop</span>. However, the circumstances behind it were vaguely explained in the anime and everything tied to Yuko and Watanuki's backstories were in the <em>Tsubasa</em> manga, particularly the Clow arc which was never adapted.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures">Pok&eacute;mon Adventures</a></em> has its instances of this, with current, important plot points coming from previous-generation chapters.
</li><li> Just about all the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em> movies are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie">completely separate from the series and themselves</a>, so one needn't see them to understand something in the series. That said, they assume you're already familiar with the series itself, as they make little effort to establish who the main cast are or what they're even doing. The first few movies, particularly <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheFirstMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheFirstMovie">Pok&eacute;mon: The First Movie</a></em>, are even worse &mdash; that one expects you to know what Pok&eacute;mon are, who Giovanni is, why he's so important, and many other aspects someone unfamiliar with the franchise would be totally lost at.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>: So many things happen in each episode, especially in the super-fast pace of R2, just skipping one episode would result in no understanding of the current plot. And it's difficult to understand the plot even while watching normally.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em> can fall into this due to the episodic nature of its episodes.
<ul><li> The first season isn't so bad. Its episodes are cleanly split between "Stand Alone" and "Complex" episodes. Stand Alone episodes are entirely self-contained storylines that are wrapped up by the end of each episode. They're not filler episodes (as they reveal background info for the characters, among other things) but they're not related to the main plotline that gets told in the Complex episodes.
</li><li> The 2nd season gets a little more complicated. Episodes are divided into "Dividual", "Individual", and "Dual" episodes. Dividual episodes seem to be like Stand Alone episodes, except all of them have some minor detail that becomes more important later on. All three episode types cover three different angles to an overarching storyline that eventually unfolds.
</li><li> Following along with the story can be quite confusing if you don't watch either season from the very start, or even if you end up missing even one episode, as the series doesn't use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn">Previously On&#133;</a>, and don't use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecapEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecapEpisode">Recap Episodes</a> in the same obvious way that most series do.
<ul><li> <em>And all of this headache isn't even including how the original manga and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MamoruOshii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MamoruOshii">Mamoru Oshii</a> films are by themselves separate continuities that have nothing in common with each other.</em> Anyone who's just starting into the series will inevitably ask what the correlation is between the manga, the movies, and the anime series.
</li><li> This also proved to be one of the many problems with the 2017 live-action remake. The story ended up confusing fans with the changes made to the source material and also gave more casual audiences questions about references to the original story they didn't understand.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Anybody introduced to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DotHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DotHack">.hack</a></em> series as an anime can potentially run into a giant wall of Lock-Out. The two main anime series, <em>Sign</em> and <em>Roots</em>, are actually <em>prequels</em> to the main stories of their respective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> which are told in two sets of PS2 games, and thus (although the former does resolve its main story) don't resolve many of the major story-arc significant plot-points of the respective eras. Made worse with the second anime "Legend of the Twilight Bracelet" being the non-canon version of its respective manga, and <em>Roots</em> having been rendered non-canon, with most of its depicted story (though not its myth-arc) events suffering from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">Canon Discontinuity</a> to the point it's recommended to just skip those two entries entirely. The effect is even worse if you read the novels or manga, which are generally side stories (or for the novelizations/adaptations of the video games <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity">Alternate Continuity</a>), with huge references to the main plotlines that aren't well-explained in that form. The games leave some things unexplained (the system restart during the climax of <em>Quarantine</em> comes off as an enormous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a>... unless you watch <em>Liminality</em>, which explains why that happened), but left ambiguous enough that that section of the story such doesn't seem necessary. And that's not even getting into .Hack//Link which has its story tied to revisiting the stories of the past parts of the franchise, only for them to get many if not all of the details wrong. While the franchise DOES explain some events in brief that are expanded more on in other material so as to not leave a newer inductee completely lost (you can pretty much just pick up each of the two PS2 game series stories and still get a complete story out of it), you may not fully appreciate this series unless you're prepared to read/watch/play <em>all</em> of it.
</li><li> Three words: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HajimeNoIppo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HajimeNoIppo">Hajime no Ippo</a>.</em> The series has been running for decades and has already clocked in at over 1,000 chapters with no real end in sight. Sure, you COULD jump in later since it's about boxing and thus all you'd need to know is "this character won/lost some previous matches," but without knowledge of who certain characters are or how/why they box a certain way would make it difficult to follow.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VisionOfEscaflowne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VisionOfEscaflowne">Vision of Escaflowne</a></em> is guilty of this, mostly due to focusing ONLY on its story and characters. It's carefully plotted and compressed, the content in the episodes always leads up to something, and there's absolutely NO filler in it (this would have been rectified had the producers had the necessary budget and amount of episodes they wanted), not that this prevented fans from loving it to death.
</li><li> The third <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion">Rebuild of Evangelion</a></em> movie is next to impossible to follow if you haven't seen the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">original series</a>. For one thing, the vast majority of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nods</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag">Mythology Gags</a> make no sense otherwise, and the revelation that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kaworu is the final Angel</span> comes out of nowhere.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em> averts this by splitting itself into parts (eight so far, the latest two happening in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity">Alternate Continuity</a>), each one with a different setting and main character (though characters from previous parts may make appearances, Jotaro and Joesph being the biggest). Each time it reintroduces the concept of Stands and sometimes offers some cliff notes from previous parts when they become relevant to the story (though some continuity bits just get a vague explanation, like how Joesph got his prosthetic hand in Part 2). Thus, it's pretty easy to just pick a part and start from there (which worked for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VizMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VizMedia">Viz Media</a> initially licensed Part 3 before licensing the previous two parts). If you ask any established fan of the series, "where should I start?", they will usually say "Start from the beginning, and don't skip any parts" in order to discourage continuity lockout as much as possible.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveActionAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveActionAdaptation">Live-Action Adaptation</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureDiamondIsUnbreakable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureDiamondIsUnbreakable">Part 4</a> does its best to prevent this by downplaying the connections to the previous parts of the stories. This does hit a bit of a snag with the Nijimuras' father, since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he was mutated into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">an immortal frog-creature</a> because of the defeat of DIO, Part 3's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Surprisingly averted by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UQHolder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UQHolder">UQ Holder!</a></em>. Despite being a sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>, a lot of the plots and characters are new and stand apart from the series. When knowledge of <em>Negima</em> is required, concepts and relationship from the series are well-explained.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> isn't strictly <em>required</em> for watching <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> (as any viewer of Toonami can attest), it does explain a great deal of things that are brought up in the early episodes and beyond. Why can't Krillin be brought back with the Dragon Balls? Where'd Goku get that yellow cloud? Why is it important that Bulma broke up with Yamcha? Why is everyone afraid of Piccolo? Who are the Red Ribbon Army? Why is it crazy that Goku has a kid? And so on. Fortunately, the story was well-written enough (and had enough recurring flashbacks) that this Trope was averted for the most part, at the cost of understanding most of the characters on a deeper level.
</li><li> With <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>, Toonami made sure to avert this by constantly rerunning past episodes and storylines in order when they ran out of new episodes to run. At one point they ran the show 15 times a week, with 2 episodes every weekday: one new episode, and one rerun, both from different parts of the story, and then marathoning the 5 new episodes again on Saturday. The show was also made widely available on VHS and DVD in "saga" sets diving the show's almost-300 episodes into 14 chunks, making things a bit easier to follow. It apparently worked, because the show was a huge success in the US, despite very few American fans watching the show from the very beginning.
</li><li> Opposite to the <em>Dragon Ball</em> anime, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">Dragon Ball GT</a></em> is almost incomprehensible without prior knowledge of <em>DBZ</em>'s storyline, particularly since it didn't refer back to DBZ that often like DBZ did to Dragon Ball.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> has a minor case of this since the show starts on the assumption that the viewer is aware of the events of the Buu Saga. This has caused much confusion for many newer English fans who grew up watching <em>Dragon Ball Z Kai</em> which only went up to the Cell Games and <em>Buu Kai</em> didn't get an English premiere until <em>Super</em> was airing at the same time on Toonami. Also, since the show runs on nostalgia, all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nods</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Backs</a> can be hard to follow, especially the Future Trunks Saga that mixed important plot points from both the Cell and Buu Sagas. The show also assumes the viewer read or at least have passing knowledge of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JacoTheGalacticPatrolman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JacoTheGalacticPatrolman">Jaco the Galactic Patrolman</a></em>, since it doesn't bother to explain where Jaco came from, how he knows the Briefs, when did Bulma get a sister, or who are the Galactic Patrol. Toei attempted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">avert</a> some of this by retelling the movies written by Toriyama, so people didn't have to go out and buy the DVDs to catch up with the latest events. You can even skipped the retellings and jumped to Episode 28, the start of the Champa Saga, since Episode 30 is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecapEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecapEpisode">Recap Episode</a> of everything that has happened up to the point. And though the Resurrection 'F' Saga draws a lot of parallels and plot points from the Namek/Frieza Saga, it's easy enough to follow since it is a basic revenge story.
</li></ul></li><li> Being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> of the Hope's Peak Saga, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DanganRonpa3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DanganRonpa3">Danganronpa 3</a></em> is <em>full</em> of this.

Having read <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DanganRonpaZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DanganRonpaZero">Danganronpa Zero</a></em>, which was never officially released in English, also helps.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HugttoPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HugttoPrettyCure">Hugtto! Pretty Cure</a></em> is possibly the only <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PrettyCure">Pretty Cure</a></em> season to suffer from this trope. Being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration">15th Anniversary season</a>, <em>Hugtto</em> makes many call backs to older seasons that can fly over a newcomer's head at first-viewing, and to make it even worse, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> they had straight up crossovers with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCure">Max Heart</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MahoGirlsPrecure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MahoGirlsPrecure">Maho</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KiraKiraPrecureALaMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KiraKiraPrecureALaMode">Kira Kira</a> teams, as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YesPrettyCure5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YesPrettyCure5">Cure Dream</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FreshPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FreshPrettyCure">Cure Peach</a>. The show assumes that viewers has seen these seasons already and thus never bothers to introduce these characters for the sake of moving the plot forward, which can make these guest characters come off a bit on the bland side. It then goes full throttle with the crossovers and has an episode where EVERY PREVIOUS CURE crosses over.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HyperdimensionNeptunia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HyperdimensionNeptunia">The Hyperdimension Neptunia anime</a> seems to have been made with the assumption that the viewer has already played the games, and thus does little in terms of world building or establishing characters and their relationships. It's not <em>impossible</em> to follow along without having played the games, but important plot points, such as the alternate dimension Plutia and Peashy are from, as well as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">Rei's backstory and motivation</a></span>, recieve less of an explanation than one might expect.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KingOfPrism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KingOfPrism">King of Prism</a></em> is a spin-off of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettyRhythmRainbowLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettyRhythmRainbowLive">Pretty Rhythm Rainbow Live</a></em> that focuses on the male characters, and watching <em>Rainbow Live</em> is pretty much a given if you want to understand the lore. While the first movie, <em>King of Prism by Pretty Rhythm</em>, explains Over the Rainbow's story, the second movie, <em>King of Prism: Pride the Hero</em>, does <em>not</em> play around and immediately throws in things that reference Hijiri, Jin, and June's backstories without any primer. Even worse, you <em>have</em> to watch <em>Rainbow Live</em> to be able to understand one of the biggest spoilers in the series, as it provides context. For Western viewers, this is a lot worse, since <em>Rainbow Live</em> was not licensed for Western distribution, and the <em>King of Prism</em> movies only screened at the Los Angeles Film Festival; Avex themselves have made the series difficult to obtain legally since their export ban on home releases.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatch">Yo-Kai Watch</a></em> movies have this issue. They tend to heavily involve King Enma. Enma, however, isn't a character in the main anime, so unless you've seen previous films it can be confusing just who he is and what's going on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em> has this by way of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityCreep">Continuity Creep</a>, to the point that people who are coming into the manga after seeing the anime are often told to at the very least go back and read all 10 chapters that were skipped in the adaptation so they don't miss anything that could potentially become important later on. This is taken even further with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Off</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yonkoma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yonkoma">Yonkoma</a> <em>We Want to Talk About Kaguya</em>, whose very premise as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentBystanderSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentBystanderSeries">Innocent Bystander Series</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony">brand of humor</a> pretty much requires the reader to be familiar with specific chapters of the main series.

The problem is that Oboro's only appearance in the manga proper are brief cameos that never even give him a name, the character's relevance and backstory, and why that revelation is important to the characters involved, is only apparent if the reader was also accompanying the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Off</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel">Prequel</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VigilanteMyHeroAcademiaIllegals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VigilanteMyHeroAcademiaIllegals">Vigilante: My Hero Academia Illegals</a></em>, which has an arc dedicated to Aizawa's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginsEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginsEpisode">high school life and his origins as a hero.</a>

Perhaps the worst offender is the Forge / Hex story arc: The trilogy of "Protect and Survive", "Black and White" and "Gods and Monsters" requires you to have heard the preceding trilogy of "Project: Destiny", "A Death in the Family" and "Lurkers at Sunlight's Edge", <em>and</em> that also needs the previous two "Project" stories ("Twilight" and "Lazarus") plus "The Angel of Scutari", "Arrangements for War" and "Thicker than Water" <em>at the very least</em> (you would ideally have also heard as many of Hex and Evelyn's previous stories as possible).

</li><li> When that failed to solve anything, DC wrote its second <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">Cosmic Retcon</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ZeroHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ZeroHour">Zero Hour</a></em>. And when <em>that</em> failed to solve anything, DC wrote its third <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">Cosmic Retcon</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis">Infinite Crisis</a></em>. And that <strong>also</strong> failed to solve anything.
</li><li> <em>Infinite Crisis</em> was a particularly good example of this trope. To fully understand what was going on, one had to have read at least almost every comic event DC had put out in the past twenty years, <em>Crisis on Infinite Earths</em>, the five mini-series lead-ins to <em>Infinite Crisis</em>, the comics that introduced elements of those mini-series, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueInternational" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueInternational">Justice League International</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont">Chris Claremont</a> took this to eleven with his out-of-continuity miniseries <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a>: The End</em>, which tries to bring <em>every subplot of 30 years</em> to a satisfactory conclusion.
<ul><li> During his run on <em>X-Men</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a> stated that he wanted to make the book more accessible to new readers by avoiding mentioning past storylines beyond <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes">vague summaries</a>. Once he left the book, the subsequent writers went right back to the older, continuity-heavy storytelling style.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMen1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMen1">The first movie</a> did far better business than expected. A number observed that not only were the comics mired in their own complicated storylines and prominently featuring non-movie characters instead, but that Marvel didn't even try to tie-in to the movie - which is understandable, since film adaptations of comic books are generally considered to be aimed at a distinct audience and exist within their own continuity anyway. Consequently, the comics saw no boost in readership as the movie raked in millions, so the trope was cited. Crossover traffic may not have happened regardless and this next part may not be true, but the trope is widely believed to be the reason why Bob Harras was fired from Marvel.
</li></ul></li><li> Fred Perry's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GoldDigger">Gold Digger</a></em> has a degree of Continuity Lockout nearing that of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a>, despite having only existed since the early '90s and consisting only of one main title, a short-lived spinoff, and a few early crossovers with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NinjaHighSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NinjaHighSchool">Ninja High School</a></em>. Miss a few issues and you're likely to be met with a <em>completely different set of cast members some of whom haven't shown up for a few years</em>, sometimes not even mentioning the main characters.

</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GailSimone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GailSimone">Gail Simone</a> run on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a></em> was pretty continuity-heavy and sales fell sharply during it, with the writer herself later lamenting that her run might have been confusing to new readers. DC hired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski">J. Michael Straczynski</a> to replace Simone and bring in new readers with a highly-publicized storyline that took place in a more accessible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity">Alternate Continuity</a>. Then the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/New52">New 52</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot">Continuity Reboot</a> happened, which le to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianAzzarello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianAzzarello">Brian Azzarello</a> being given a complete blank slate for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/WonderWoman2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/WonderWoman2011">run</a>. In interviews, Azzarello even stated that he deliberately avoided bringing up too much of the past continuity to avoid confusing potential new readers.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate Marvel</a> was created starting with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderman">Ultimate Spiderman</a></em> in 2000 to avert this very trope offering a clean slate for new readers who otherwise couldn't be bothered to dig through decades of continuity in the regular universe to get the gist of certain characters and stories. Nonetheless however, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateUniverse">Ultimate Universe</a> eventually fell victim to this trope despite a few efforts to relaunch it in its later years following the much reviled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ultimatum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ultimatum">Ultimatum</a></em> (which curiously was its own attempt to provide a clean slate for the Ultimate Universe). Namely why certain characters were dead and why <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Reed Richards of this universe went crazy and became an outright villain known as "The Maker"</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UntoldTalesOfSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UntoldTalesOfSpiderMan">Untold Tales of Spider-Man</a></em> came about in particular, because at the time (1995) the Spider-Man books were in a state of continuity lock with the Spider-Clone Saga and Marvel wanted a book for fans who wanted a Spider-Man book that did not require buying EVERY Spider-Man book being published, in order to understand what was going on.
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JephLoeb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JephLoeb">Jeph Loeb</a>, this is the major reason why Linda Danvers, the 90's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a>, was benched so that DC could bring back the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">Silver Age</a> Supergirl. His argument was that Linda's origin was far too confusing and tenuously-tied to the Superman mythos to make sense to casual fans, which is hard to argue. After all, "Kara Zor-El is Superman's teenage cousin who survived the destruction of Krypton while in stasis" is a far more coherent origin story than "Linda Danvers is a teenage Earth-born Angel of fire who merged with a protoplasmic creature from another dimension to become the new Supergirl".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UncannyAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UncannyAvengers">Uncanny Avengers</a></em> has been said to have this. Unless you have read <em>Uncanny X-Force</em>, don't expect to know what's happening beyond the introductory arc. The villains themselves are the result of a story arc from <em>Uncanny X-Force</em> and Wolverine's son is reintroduced with no explanation for who he is or his history for new readers, as are his associates. Unsurprisingly both <em>Uncanny Avengers</em> and <em>Uncanny X-Force</em> have the same writer.
</li><li> <em>The New 52</em> had this happen to many of the writers, who have talked in interviews about the lack of consistency on the editorial staff while it started up, with no creator able to learn about other books' upcoming plotlines, yet still having to work interactions between them in each month's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover">Crisis Crossover</a>. It happened in record time, too, and it's a particularly bad example because the stated purpose of the New 52 relaunch was to <em><strong>prevent</strong></em> <strong>Continuity Lockout</strong>.
</li><li> Archie Comics was forced to do this to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers">Screwed by the Lawyers</a> that lead to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">Cosmic Retcon</a>. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Ian Flynn</a> has said that while the first 251 issues have happened (and issues 248-251, part of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheHedgehogMegaManWorldsCollide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheHedgehogMegaManWorldsCollide">Sonic the Hedgehog/Mega Man: Worlds Collide</a></em>, will happen as it's part of the future) they have no bearing on the comic after #252. Just a few years later, the comic went into indefinite hiatus and was ultimately canceled entirely.
</li><li> The Boom Kids comics based on the old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDisneyAfternoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDisneyAfternoon">Disney Afternoon</a> shows.

If you're under <em>20</em>, chances are you'll be confused from Issue One.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCRebirth">DC Rebirth</a></em>: Knowledge of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Flashpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Flashpoint">Flashpoint</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em>, the Jamie Reyes "Reach invasion" arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlueBeetle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlueBeetle">Blue Beetle</a></em>, and so on are required for anything to make sense.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em> has long been prevented from experiencing a proper revival due to its format being such that it's very hard to explain the team's history in only a few sentences, especially when its members include the descendant of an ancient clan of dark wizards, the half-human son of Ultron, and a possible demigoddess from 19th-century Switzerland.

Nearly every comic strip in existence is written under the belief that not everybody either gets the newspaper every day or reads the comic section, so most of them are of a Gag-a-Day format to avoid this. However...
<ul><li> Modern newspaper strips with running plots generally get around this by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecompressedComic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecompressedComic">decompressing</a> the plot so much that every minor detail happens over at least 3 days. This also means you have to read several months' worth of strips to get anything meaningful out of it.
<ul><li> However you were on your own with regards to older-style serialized stories that offered little by way of recaps or "previously ons". If you didn't follow a story from its beginning, you often had a hard time figuring out the plot. This was intentional as the purpose of the comic strip serial format was to <em>sell newspapers.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> Both Floyd Gottfredson's Mickey Mouse daily strips and Ward Greene's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Scamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Scamp">Scamp</a></em> daily strips began as essentially one continuous story, but both eventually shifted to gag a day formats.
<ul><li> That also makes them particularly tricky to separate into individual stories for reprinting in comic book form (besides the obvious fact that they have to make up a meaningful name for the story arcs), for example, Gottfredson's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse">Mickey Mouse</a> as the Monarch of Medioka</em> (printed in WDC #593-599) starts off with a conversation referring to the immediately preceding adventure, and the plot is set in motion by spending of the money they made off of said adventure. The preceding story, <em>In Search of Jungle Treasure</em> was printed in issues <em>4 and 5</em>, so unless you have a complete collection, you have to take their word for it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Fleep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Fleep">Fleep</a></em> was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OntologicalMystery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OntologicalMystery">Ontological Mystery</a>, so the entire story was progressed through clues slowly gained over the various strips.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BackToTheFuture">Back to the Future</a></em> sequels get into this.
<ul><li> If you haven't seen the first movie, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartII">Back to the Future Part II</a></em> is easy enough to get into in the first couple of acts (barring the occasional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a> to events in the first movie), but the 1955 events in the third act are entirely dependent on the viewer's knowledge of events in the first movie.

</li></ul></li><li> A major criticism of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanVSupermanDawnOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanVSupermanDawnOfJustice">Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</a></em> is that certain parts of the movie make no sense to people who haven't read the comics, and were likely to be expanded upon in future installments (until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> changed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JusticeLeague2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JusticeLeague2017">Justice League</a></em> and rendered it all an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc">Aborted Arc</a>). Most notably, the "Nightmare Sequence" is virtually incomprehensible to anyone who isn't familiar with Darkseid, Darkseid's symbol, Parademons, and the New Gods (which were to be explained in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZackSnyder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZackSnyder">Zack Snyder</a> version of <em>Justice League</em> and got axed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHardWithAVengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHardWithAVengeance">Die Hard with a Vengeance</a></em> (1995) has a memorable allusion to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak">"that thing in the building in L.A."</a>, which knowledgeable viewers will recognize as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nod</a> to the attempt by Hans Gruber and his gang of thieves to rob the Nakatomi Plaza tower in the original 1988 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard">Die Hard</a></em> movie. Even though there's a brief flashback to the climax of the 1988 film within the 1995 sequel, it can be difficult for first-time viewers to understand why Simon Gruber (Hans's brother) is so consumed with the desire to exact revenge on John McClane, the series' hero. The 1995 film even has an offscreen conversation between John and his ex-wife Holly, who was a major character in the first <em>Die Hard</em> (and is mentioned again in the fourth movie, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LiveFreeOrDieHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LiveFreeOrDieHard">Live Free or Die Hard</a></em>, in 2008) and is the subject of the '95 film's closing punchline, which seems to come out of nowhere and make for a somewhat confused ending if you are new to the franchise.
<ul><li> Although McClane does briefly explain to Zeus that he dropped Simon's brother off a building not long after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a>.

Especially bad is the scene where Paul decides he needs to ride a sandworm to properly lead his new army, despite the fact that the Fremen ride the worms never having been referenced. In 1984 audiences were even handed <em>playbills</em> before entering the film to explain the plot they were missing. The extended cut DVD release restored several missing scenes and pieces of exposition and is considerably easier to follow.
</li><li> One of the many reasons why <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfatherPartIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfatherPartIII">The Godfather Part III</a></em> is polarizing was because of its complete inaccessibility to audience members who had not seen the previous two movies. Wrote <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert">Roger Ebert</a> at the time "It is, I suspect, not even possible to understand this film without knowing the first two." However, Ebert still enjoyed the movie and rated it higher than he did <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfatherPartII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfatherPartII">The Godfather Part II</a></em>.
<ul><li> In what is something of an irony, the producers and executives were a little wary of applying ''Part II" to the second movie partly because they were concerned that people might get the impression they needed to see the first movie in order to understand the second one, which might turn off new audiences. The second movie, however, is generally more accessible, and in general started the trend of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberedSequels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberedSequels">Numbered Sequels</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> films have had this problem in an unusual way. Not only was it pretty much necessary to watch them in order (which is reasonable enough for a series), it got to the point where the movies would be exceptionally difficult to follow unless the viewer had read the books as well.

The fact that he was responsible for the death of his sister because of this relationship is never actually explained in the movies but he talks about her death to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Leta Lestrange</span> in an attempt to empathize with her about accidentally causing her brother drown when when she was a little girl. So someone who hasn't read the books wouldn't fully understand the attempt at empathy. He tells the ministry guys that he and Grindelwald "were closer than brothers" and what happened between the two of them is a clear source of angst but someone who hasn't read the books or isn't familiar with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGay">Word of Gay</a> statement would probably just see them as (literal) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodBrothers">Blood Brothers</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The M. Night Shyamalan film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastAirbender">The Last Airbender</a></em>, based off the TV series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>, takes most of the key plot points of the series and represents them in a movie format. This trope happens because of the compressed timeframe to tell the story. You never really understand how Aang is trapped in an iceberg, why Katara decides to leave with Aang dragging Sokka along and the nature of why Aang "glows up" in stressful moments is never explained (admittedly, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Avatar State</a> isn't fully explained until the second season, but it happened enough times in the first season to understand its purpose). If you're familiar with the series most everything fits into place (though very poorly, due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationInducedPlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationInducedPlotHole">plot holes caused by the changes in the story</a>).
</li><li> Peter Greenaway's Luperverse movies, <em>The Falls</em>, <em>The Tulse Luper Suitcases</em>, <em>Drowning by Numbers</em> and several short films, are a deliberate appeal to this trope. His main character, Tulse Luper, generates so much writing and ancillary material about himself (both in canon, and, via Greenaway, In Real Life as well) that no one can write his definitive biography. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> in his very first appearance in <em>Vertical Features Remake</em>, where a team of academics utterly fails to recreate a lost film Luper made while relying on vague notes and the memories of his collaborators.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> did a fairly good job averting this at first, throwing in Easter eggs for comic readers without making it confusing for others. However as the franchise expanded and plot lines intersected, it's become its own tangle:
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://whatculture.com/film/marvel-cinematic-universe-10-things-that-could-prematurely-end-it.php/6">This article<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> warns that this trope might happen to the franchise if it expands itself too much too quickly.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hawkeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hawkeye">Hawkeye</a>'s appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thor">Thor</a></em>. Non-comic fans are left clueless why the movie spent five minutes bringing in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeremyRenner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeremyRenner">big name actor</a> to play a random wisecracking guy with a bow and arrow, who never appears in the film again, though this made sense when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers</a></em> came out.
</li><li> It's possible to enjoy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers</a></em> if you haven't seen all the individual movies beforehand, as long as you've got a rough idea of who everyone is (e.g. Steve is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfTemporalWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfTemporalWater">Fish out of Temporal Water</a>, Thor is a Norse god with an almighty hammer, etc.), but if you want the backstory of each character you'll have to watch five other movies.
</li><li> During production on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersAgeOfUltron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersAgeOfUltron">Avengers: Age of Ultron</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a> said that he wanted to make sure it was accessible enough that it could be understood even if you'd only ever seen the previous <em>Avengers</em> movie. This proved to not be the case, as there are cameos (some of which are very relevant to the plot) from characters that had previously only ever appeared in non-<em>Avengers</em> films, and a key plot point <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">involving the Infinity Stones</span> really only makes sense if you've seen <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorTheDarkWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorTheDarkWorld">Thor: The Dark World</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy">Guardians of the Galaxy</a></em>.
</li><li> Prior to the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar">Captain America: Civil War</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheRussoBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheRussoBrothers">The Russo Brothers</a> stated that they'd made the film on the assumption that most of the audience had already seen the previous Marvel movies. It shows. The movie is virtually incomprehensible unless you've not only seen the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheFirstAvenger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheFirstAvenger">previous</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier">two</a> <em>Captain America</em> movies (though that should be obvious since they're in the same series), but the previously mentioned <em>Age of Ultron</em> as well. Certain key scenes also rely on the audience having knowledge of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan3">Iron Man 3</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AntMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AntMan1">Ant-Man</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers</a></em>. In an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad">Tropes Are Not Bad</a>, many critics and fans praised the way the film applied this trope to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>. The movie doesn't explain his origin or reveal too much about his backstory, as there was an unspoken assumption that most of the audience already knew the character from any of his previous five movies or numerous TV shows.
</li><li> Quite a number of things in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorRagnarok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorRagnarok">Thor: Ragnarok</a></em> will make more sense if you've watched the previous <em>Thor</em> movies and <em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em> beforehand. Otherwise, you won't really understand why Thor and Loki's relationship unfolds as it does in the movie and Bruce Banner's own subplot in the movie.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar">Avengers: Infinity War</a></em> broadly assumes that the viewer has seen <em>all</em> of the previous MCU films, as it's chockful of nods and references to prior incidents in the timeline. However, it most specifically requires that the viewer has seen the previous <em>Avengers</em> films (to know that Thanos is involved as the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>), the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy">Guardians of the Galaxy</a></em> (as the main team and the Collector are present), <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar">Captain America: Civil War</a></em> (as <em>Infinity War</em> begins with several team members on the lam after being broken out of The Raft at the of the previous film, and heavily involves Spiderman and Black Panther who were introduced in that movie), <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorRagnarok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorRagnarok">Thor: Ragnarok</a></em> (which explains why Thor, Loki and Hulk are on the Asgardian ship) and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther2018">Black Panther</a></em> (which sets up Wakanda, the setting for the film's climax).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame">Avengers: Endgame</a></em> takes this even further, as it requires that the viewer is familiar with the two films that came out in between it and <em>Infinity War</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AntManAndTheWasp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AntManAndTheWasp">Ant-Man and the Wasp</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel2019">Captain Marvel (2019)</a></em>, on top of having to know about every other film that came before both, especially because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the film has the characters time-travelling to various points in their history, such as to the climatic battle of <em>The Avengers</em> and the beginning of <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, and the final battle at the end has every surviving ally and supporting cast of the Avengers show up to help them fight Thanos and his forces (which also include within their ranks the several different races shown in prior films)</span>. And as demonstrated when <a class="urllink" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/avengers-endgame-explained-by-first-time-marvel-viewer-1205734">someone who hadn't seen any of the past movies writes his impressions<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, characters are rarely even called by their names\codenames, so it's pretty clear the movie expects you to know everyone who shows up on screen.
</li><li> Happens in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">trailer</a></em> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel2019">Captain Marvel (2019)</a></em>, which features a scene of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDickery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDickery">Carol punching an old woman on a bus</a> with absolutely zero context. Comic book fans and people who've been following the movie automatically assumed the woman was a Skrull (an evil race of aliens capable of shape-shifting) despite the fact that the trailer doesn't even mention them. It took until the second trailer for the Skrulls to show up and the woman to be shown fighting back against Carol.
</li><li> This is the general explanation for why none of the characters from the present day TV shows (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD">Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015">Daredevil (2015)</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JessicaJones2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JessicaJones2015">Jessica Jones (2015)</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LukeCage2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LukeCage2016">Luke Cage (2016)</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronFist2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronFist2017">Iron Fist (2017)</a></em>) appear in the movies, even the ones involving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover">Crisis Crossovers</a>. The movies generally have a wider audience than the TV shows (and are released in certain countries where the shows don't even air), and the creators don't want to have to spend time explaining who the hell these people are for the benefit of audience members who might not be familiar with them. Though Edwin Jarvis from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentCarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentCarter">Agent Carter</a></em> appears in <em>Endgame</em>, if only because there's a past justification (Tony's virtual butler in the other movies had to be named after someone!) and a production one (that series was created by the ones who wrote the <em>Captain America</em> movies and then the third and fourth <em>Avengers</em>, so it's their character in a way).
</li></ul></li><li> This is definitely one of the reasons why the second and third chapters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMatrix">The Matrix</a> Trilogy</em> are so polarizing. It is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">better</a> to watch <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterOnDVD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterOnDVD">all three movies on consecutive nights</a> rather than four years between the first and second movie.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MortalKombatAnnihilation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MortalKombatAnnihilation">Mortal Kombat: Annihilation</a></em> has a huge number of plotholes unless the viewer knows the mythology of the video games. Sub-Zero and Scorpion both die in the first movie and they're back alive here. What the film doesn't explain is that Sub-Zero is merely a title, and the Sub-Zero from the first film was the brother of the one in the second film. Scorpion is, in fact, undead. Fans of the games on the other hand would most likely know all of this.
<ul><li> The film does have a (throw away) line about being the brother of Sub-Zero, and being that the first movie showed Scorpion removing his mask to show a <em>fire-breathing skull</em> him coming back to life isn't sharp leap. Watching the second movie and not the first, however, would still count as a lockout, but that can be said for any time someone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">watches a sequel without seeing the previous works</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/QuantumOfSolace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/QuantumOfSolace">Quantum of Solace</a></em> presumes that the viewer has a very strong understanding of the previous film in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond">James Bond</a> reboot continuity, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CasinoRoyale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CasinoRoyale">Casino Royale</a></em>, to such an extent that it barely pauses to explain who or <em>what</em> the titular organization is. Likewise, it only refers to events that happened in the previous film, including Bond's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenMinuteRetirement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenMinuteRetirement">10-Minute Retirement</a>, former flame Vesper Lynd's actions, Mr. White's importance and Bond's connection to Mathis in vague, unexplained terms. The final scene of the film is a quiet, introspective affair that resolves the two lingering plot threads from the previous film (Vesper's missing boyfriend and Bond's uncertainty over whether to retire from MI6). That may be why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skyfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skyfall">the following</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre">films</a> better explained QUANTUM as a suborganization of the titular SPECTRE, and gave greater background on their actions, history and influence.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rambo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rambo">Rambo</a></em> (2008), the fourth film of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylvesterStallone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylvesterStallone">Sylvester Stallone</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Rambo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Rambo">eponymous franchise</a> dating back to 1982, opens with John Rambo working in the Southeast Asian country of Thailand as a trapper of poisonous snakes. It's soon mentioned in the dialogue of the movie that Rambo is an ex-Green Beret who fought in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VietnamWar">Vietnam War</a>, but that dialogue skips over the events of the three previous movies (with which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShouldKnowThisAlready" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShouldKnowThisAlready">longtime viewers should be familiar</a>) during which Rambo returned to the United States and later went to Afghanistan to fight the Soviets, with no reference point except for a brief montage during which Rambo flashes back to the events of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FirstBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FirstBlood">First Blood</a></em> (1982) and imagines himself screaming "Nothing is over!" The na&iuml;ve viewer will be forgiven for assuming at first that Rambo has remained in Southeast Asia for the past 40 years. This is lampshaded in a conversation he has with one of a group of missionaries who have come to enlist him in a rescue mission.

</div></li><li> The M. Night Shyamalan film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Split" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Split">Split</a></em>, released in 2016, has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistEnding">Twist Ending</a> that's <em>only</em> a twist to the viewer if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> they've seen <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unbreakable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unbreakable">Unbreakable</a></em>, a movie of his that came out in 2000. Otherwise, the viewer might not know the significance of David Dunn (Bruce Willis) showing up. The sequel to both, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Glass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Glass">Glass</a></em>, is even worse in that regard, as it rarely makes a point to reintroduce events from either movie</span>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> movies (to a large extent) avoided this, save for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekFirstContact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekFirstContact">Star Trek: First Contact</a></em> (which assumed the viewer had some knowledge of the "Best Of Both Worlds" two-parter and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> for Worf's location during the cube battle). However, the latter really isn't <em>that</em> important and only requires a single line by Picard to establish Worf wasn't with the crew anymore, and Lily is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceSurrogate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceSurrogate">Audience Surrogate</a> who becomes a sounding board for Picard's frustration. Several other examples are peppered throughout the films:
<ul><li> Data's emotion chip is an interesting example. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekGenerations">Star Trek: Generations</a></em> and <em>First Contact</em> both have Data mulling over whether to use the chip or not. New viewers to these films won't understand much of what Data's talking about unless they've seen the earlier seasons of <em>TNG</em> (specifically the fourth- and fifth-season episodes regarding Data, Lore and Dr. Soong). Not that viewers of the show are much better off, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">since the end of "Descent Pt.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekInsurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekInsurrection">Star Trek: Insurrection</a></em> averted this trope. According to Michael Piller's unreleased book, <em>Fade In: The Making of Star Trek Insurrection</em>, at least one plan was to have Picard and his crew look for a Federation traitor (a la Heart of Darkness) against the backdrop of the Dominion War (during the point when the Federation was losing ground against the Jem'Hadar). This plan was scrapped due to concerns that theatregoers wouldn't understand the references (which didn't stop them from referencing the aforementioned Deep Space Nine and "Best of Both Worlds").
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009">Star Trek (2009)</a></em> also largely averted this - seeing as it specifically sets itself as an origin story in a clear alternate continuity (if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWaved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWaved">Hand Waved</a> connected to the original through use of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">Timey-Wimey Ball</a>). However, the tie-in comic, <em>Countdown</em>, is the canonical last appearance for many of the <em>TNG</em> characters, as well as the only way you'll get to find out the backstory for Nero and his ship (which, in turn, references past elements of the franchise, all the way back to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture">V'Ger</a>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</a></em> can be a little confusing for viewers not familiar with the episode "Space Seed," which introduced Khan and established his rivalry with Kirk. The movie does give a basic overview of their history, but it's in tiny chunks scattered throughout several different scenes, so a first-time viewer would be excused for not totally grasping why they hate each other.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> might be the quintessential example of this. Even on its own terms, the original 1977 film (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em>) has a fairly convoluted, confusing plot until Obi-Wan Kenobi shows up about a half-hour or so into the picture <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrExposition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrExposition">to explain everything you need to know</a>, and even then there is much that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">(necessarily)</a> remains inaccessible to the viewer. The iconic character of Boba Fett, who is "officially" introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em> (1980) but had actually appeared earlier in (now almost impossible-to-find) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheStarWarsHolidaySpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheStarWarsHolidaySpecial">The Star Wars Holiday Special</a></em>, is never even named on screen (except for a brief scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em>, and that is in the middle of a firefight where it's all but impossible to hear anything); therefore, when we meet that character's father, Jango Fett, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones">Attack of the Clones</a></em> (2002), we have no way of knowing, outside of the immediate context, why this character and his son are so important, and must rely on the franchise's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">large amount of supplementary material</a>. In fact, you don't even learn the name of "The Emperor", the entire series' primary antagonist, until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace">The Phantom Menace</a></em> (1999), with the result that many first-time viewers had no inkling &#151; until it was revealed at the climax &#151; that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled">"Senator Palpatine" is also Darth Sidious, let alone that he would become the head of the Galactic Empire</a>.
<ul><li> As of 2014, resulting from Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm and the edict therein, the lock-out has been broken due to moving nearly every piece of media ever released for <em>Star Wars</em> including the Special Editions into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity">Alternate Continuity</a>. The Expanded Universe is being rebuilt under The Lucasfilm Story Group's lead with new works and information that will align with the sequel trilogy, associated works, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em> and the original six films.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Solo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Solo">Solo</a></em> features an example tying with Expanded Universe material that came before it.

</li></ul></li><li> <em>The Two Jakes</em> was a sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Chinatown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Chinatown">Chinatown</a></em> that almost required viewers to know everything from the first film, such as why Katherine Mulray was so dang important. Despite arguably being just as good as the first time (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectedByCastMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectedByCastMember">Directed by Cast Member</a>), it left theaters quickly. It caught on when it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByCable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByCable">Vindicated by Cable</a>.
</li><li> There is so much omitted from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Watchmen">movie adaptation of</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em> that even the character motivations and progression of plot from one to the next are removed, not to mention the total removal of <em>Tales of the Black Freighter</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">comic book within a comic book</a> that explains Ozymandias's state of mind. In order to enjoy the movie to its fullest extent, the viewer must already be aware of the events of the comic book. Although the 3 1/2 hour 'Ultimate Cut' fixes most of this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFilmSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFilmSeries">X-Men Film Series</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenOriginsWolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenOriginsWolverine">X-Men Origins: Wolverine</a></em> could have used footnotes to explain the significance of its story elements. Since the Weapon X scene was so brief, it could have said "To learn more, please read <em>Weapon X</em> by Barry Windsor-Smith." One benefit is that you get to spend more time with your non-comic-savvy friends explaining the plot. Whether they'll care or not is another story...
</li><li> Very few would argue that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenDaysOfFuturePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenDaysOfFuturePast">X-Men: Days of Future Past</a></em> strikes with full impact if one has skipped some or all of the other X-Men films.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a> said much the same in the introduction to the first edition of <em>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a> Companion</em>. Although he did still make the effort; if necessary consulting with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNameFan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNameFan">Big Name Fans</a> who actually knew more about the Discworld than he did, such as the <em>Companion</em> co-author Stephen Briggs.
<ul><li> Pratchett wrote his way out of having to be consistent; all errors are blamed on the fact that even the History Monks can't quite always get time back exactly the way it should be after the magical disruptions that occur.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> As the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a> series progresses, and both the cast and pagecount swell, individual characters get less and less face time. It's sometimes several hundred pages between a character's appearances, even for <em>main characters</em>. Two of the main characters, Mat and Perrin, have even been left out of a book at one point or another. Worse, the characters have often been active in that time, leaving the reader to infer what happened since they were last seen. Not that we're bitter. In fact, it is quite clear that till the 4th book or so, each book provided info from previous books, including character development history and some important pieces of lore. However, by the 5th book, no more "backward compatibility" is provided and the writer assumes that readers have read the previous books. To the point of removing anyone 3 books or older from the glossary. Readers may have trouble remembering which of the 20 A-named female channelers was Aes Sedai, Rebel Sedai, Aeil, Seachan, or Dark-aligned. They tend to blur together after 10,000 pages or so.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FoundationSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FoundationSeries">Foundation Series</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a> put his series on a decades-long hiatus in the 1950s partly because <em>he</em> was exhausted from having to reread the material to keep it consistent and to write an engaging synopsis of previous events to prevent new readers from feeling locked out of the current story. A fan later handed him a long list of inconsistencies within the <em>Foundation</em> stories.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> has fallen more and more into this as a the series progresses. There are 15 books currently published covering about 14-15 years in universe. Plots are foreshadowed over the course of several books, recurring allies and enemies often don't appear for several books at a time, an overarching war is happening in the background despite not being discussed until several books in, and even short stories get passing references in the main series.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Changes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Changes">Changes</a></em> is probably the worst, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">the very first sentence</a> requires a bunch of context and is delivered by a character who last appeared in book 5 (<em>Changes</em> is <em>book 12</em>).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>: If you start reading anywhere from books 1-3, then you'll be fine, since character backstories, running plot devices, past major events and such are usually given a short explanation, treated as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">Noodle Incident</a> or just aren't relevant to the actual conflict (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">for now</a>). However, after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a> from Goblet Of Fire, books 5 onwards have problems keeping the continuity intact, since it's very difficult NOT to talk about the events of the fourth/fifth book. It got to the point where the last book in the series became impossible to read because of the spoilerrific nature of the story and continuity becoming prevalent.
<ul><li> JK Rowling herself stated she was invoking the trope from about book 4 onwards, remarking that anyone starting a 7-book series halfway through shouldn't really be surprised when they find themselves confused by the continuity.
</li></ul></li><li> Trying to get into George R.R. Martin's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em> involves going through five (eventually, seven) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorStopper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorStopper">Door Stopper</a> novels, each with so much continuity that it's no wonder the man is taking ages to continue the series. If he creates a plot hole, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">someone's going to try to call him on it before the book gets to the editor.</a>
<ul><li> Interestingly, the author later wrote two prequel novellas (with a third on its way), starting with <em>The Hedge Knight</em> which essentially reproduced the Ice and Fire themes about power and politics down to a much smaller and far easier-to-digest form, and radically less intimidating to newcomers, particularly the graphic novel adaptations.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a> hired author Robin Furth to be his archivist and continuity editor to assist him in writing the final books of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDarkTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDarkTower">The Dark Tower</a></em>. She compiled an encyclopedia that King referred to during writing that was published itself as Stephen King's The Dark Tower: The Complete Concordance. He says in the foreword to that book that there was no way he could have completed the series without such a document. And sadly, it shows. Many of the books most important plot points are mentioned only in passing, which can result in a whole mess of confusion even for those who have read all the books in order.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PerryRhodan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PerryRhodan">Perry Rhodan</a> has a real problem with this. With a backstory of over 2500 issues in the main series alone that might become relevant for the current plot at any time and story arcs that last for 50 to 100 issues it can be quite hard for new readers to break into the series. Nowadays they take some pains to make the round numbers a good place to start, without too much pre-knowledge. Also, in each issue there is a small glossar explaining plot-relevant background that a new reader might not know (or an old reader might not remember).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a></em>: It is possible, if not a bit difficult, to start reading the second series without reading the first series. However, by the third series, things apparently get nigh incomprehensible for people who haven't read all of the previous books. The fifth series is a prequel, which could be read without reading the other books, but the prologue and first chapter or so of <em>The Sun Trail</em> would be kind of baffling (and very spoilery) for a newcomer.
</li><li> Katherine Kerr's 15-book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deverry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deverry">Deverry</a></em> series is divided into four parts; starting at the beginning of any one of the three latter will cause you to only miss <strong>half</strong> of the significance of what's happening... The Dragon Mage (3rd series) is probably the worst offender, since it tells about the end of the civil war, which has been earlier covered in three other books.
</li><li> To keep up with all the various plots and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWeber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWeber">David Weber</a>, you not only need to read the mainline titles, but the sub-series and short story collections, which are <em>themselves</em> not in chronological order. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorverse#Stories_listed_by_internal_chronology">Go here for a reading order<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1iws4');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1iws4" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1iws4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">You <em>could</em> skip the first book, <em>On Basilisk Station</em>, and start the second, <em>The Honor of the Queen</em>, and still <strong>mostly</strong> understand the plot &#151; but after that, you haven't got a chance.</span> The books are mostly free, so it won't set you back much. That said, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStarKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStarKingdom">Star Kingdom</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Off</a> series generally averts this, thanks to a time shift of several hundred years into the past, before Manticore became enthralled in transgalactic political espionage and warfare. It's also written for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungAdult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungAdult">Young Adult</a> audience, so its action is pretty much confined to Sphinx.

In other words, any fan of the series can write their own contributions to it and have them entered into canon if they pass muster with a review board for the series. Flint and his co-writers then tend to take characters introduced in these stories and work them into the main series. Thankfully, the short stories that have the most impact on the main story have been collected into their own "Ring of Fire" anthologies.
</li><li> Various <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a></em> works assume the reader has at least basic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes">Broad Strokes</a> knowledge of important EU events and don't even try to make sense otherwise. Amazingly, other works still manage to remain accessible, though the knowledge of the movies is still required.
</li><li> The <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Babylon5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Babylon5">Babylon 5</a></em> novels are plagued by this, because while some of them are noted as taking place after the events of specific episodes, they aren't necessarily sequential, and are all written by different authors.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThursdayNext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThursdayNext">Thursday Next</a></em> books by Jasper Fforde do a brilliant job of constantly inventing new concepts, settings and characters whilst referencing and being consistent with previous books. But if you read them out of order they'll make almost no sense at all.
</li><li> L. Frank Baum's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LandOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LandOfOz">Land of Oz</a> books could get like this. Not only did he assume a lot of memory of Ozian geography and politics, any time he liked a character, he'd just keep them hanging around the Emerald City for later use. In the last few books in the series, there were entire chapters devoted to choosing which of the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a> would be going on the novel's adventure. There was Button-Bright, Ojo, Cap'n Bill, Uncle Henry, Tik-Tok, The Patchwork Girl, the Frogman, The Woggle-Bug, the Hungry Tiger... The Lion, Scarecrow, and Tin Man would almost always be there, and the Wizard usually put in an appearance, but anyone who knew the movie and wanted to give the books a shot could easily become very lost.
<ul><li> Baum himself could get lost in the character mess. In one novel, he has The Shaggy Man and Polychrome meeting for the first time, apparently having forgotten that he introduced them in the same book.
</li></ul></li><li> Both the series of post-TV-show prose <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> spin-offs from the "wilderness years", the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctorWhoNewAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctorWhoNewAdventures">Doctor Who New Adventures</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EighthDoctorAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EighthDoctorAdventures">Eighth Doctor Adventures</a>, suffered badly from this, with many novels from both series being <strong>completely</strong> incomprehensible if you hadn't read earlier books in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a>. And preferably watched some of the less-regarded episodes of the series, possibly while taking notes of every throwaway line that mentions an alien race.

(Example: You would have to be a regular listener since 2013 to know what "The Dudebros" is all about). Though Rod and Karen will occasionally re-explain some things (Like what "Bulletball" is).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/TheMagnusArchives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/TheMagnusArchives">The Magnus Archives</a></em> embodies this in its later seasons. Seasons 1 and 2 are, for the most part, episodic, with each episode consisting of a standalone horror story and a few minutes of commentary at the end. But starting with season 3, the show begins to embrace an intricate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> and focus more on a recurring cast of characters, and by season 4 it's nigh-impossible to know what's going on in any given episode if you haven't listened to all of the previous ones. (Each episode still includes a standalone horror story, but it's usually a backdrop to whatever the main characters are doing that episode, and will probably reference characters and events first introduced tens or even hundreds of episodes before.)

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle">BIONICLE</a></em> eventually got this way, especially after the introduction of the on-line serials. The main story arcs tended to avoid this, but when former main characters that had been cast aside for years got back on stage, even that went messy. The whole storyline balanced on a thin line between trying to please the older fans and bring in fresh blood. This was probably one of the main reasons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LEGO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LEGO">LEGO</a> decided to put the line on hiatus and bring in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/HeroFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/HeroFactory">Hero Factory</a></em>, which was much lighter on the story and had little to no continuity; and when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle2015">it was brought back</a> it was given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot">Continuity Reboot</a> to help clear things up.
<ul><li> An additional problem was that much of Bionicle's story was told in online media, from games to animation to web serials (written or read as audio files), and so much of the media just did not exist anymore or was no longer up for new readers to catch up on.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KagerouProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KagerouProject">Kagerou Project</a></em>: The franchise's beginnings as a series of character-driven (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperlinkStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperlinkStory">and seemingly unrelated</a>) songs - with only minimal information released by the project's creator - has led to a lot of new fans feeling alienated due to the complexity of the whole plot (made worse by the fact that the songs don't have an official order), and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a> contained therein. Even the series' other adaptations provide issues, as the manga is still incomplete and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MekakucityActors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MekakucityActors">anime</a> (while complete and comprehensive) leaves significant gaps and relies on viewers knowing at least a little about the project and its characters before viewing. The late-game revelation that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">all 3 branches of media are actually time loops,</span> and that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KagerouDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KagerouDays">light novels</a> utilize this plot point from 2014 on, end up retroactively making the rest of the franchise required reading to understand how the books end.
</li><li> This can be a problem with online roleplays that have gone on for years. When a new member wants to join up they have to verse themselves in everything that's happened before.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/Glowfic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/Glowfic">Glowfic</a> likes to make its characters explain their own backstory and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse">universe</a> to other characters who they meet for the first time, as well as playing with this trope in-universe because new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateSelf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateSelf">characters</a> constantly join an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllianceOfAlternates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllianceOfAlternates">organisation/group/collective</a> and have to be caught up, and (sometimes) they are caught up onscreen, via some old character explaining it to them in conversation.
</li></ul></li><li> Depending on the extent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">Fanon</a>, this can happen - a lot of fandom members tend to assume everybody is on board with their fandom lore, the running gags, the personalities invented (and accepted) by them or have read all the popular fanfiction recommendations. This can lead to some new fans wondering where on earth this is coming from.
</li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">films based on a TV series</a> fall into this trap, as they continue from events in the TV series and assume viewers are already familiar with them. How severe this trope can be depends on its connection to those events, as well as the setup of their respective series: a film with a self-contained story can easily be enjoyed by unfamiliar viewers as a standalone work, whereas one with a complex mythos and already-established characters will leave them completely lost.

<ul><li> Usually avoided in pro wrestling, since most of wrestlers and such (at least if they fall between the two extremes of "irrelevant" and "universally popular") will switch from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel">Heel</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face">Face</a> and back again (or vice versa) quite a few times over the course of their part in an angle, with their contemporaries <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeMonthRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeMonthRule">all but forgetting</a> about the bad deeds they committed as Heels or the good deeds they committed as Faces (unless a wrestler is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberWhenYouBlewUpASun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberWhenYouBlewUpASun">explicitly confronted with his/her past</a>). However, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">World Wrestling Entertainment</a> has a video archive going back to the <em>1960s</em> and everything (or almost everything) that occurred since 1983 is regarded as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon">canon</a>, it often becomes helpful to play vintage video clips in the montages in order to bring everyone up to speed. (Anything that happened in the 1950s or earlier is, for the most part, written off as being the province of the wrestling "territories", ultimately embodied by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance">National Wrestling Alliance</a>, which has an ongoing history dating back to the late 1940s &mdash; and yes, all of those 60-plus years are NWA canon &mdash; but from which WWE's original incarnation, Capitol Wrestling Corporation, broke away as early as 1953.)
<ul><li> Incredibly, there was at least one WWE personality whose exploits stretch back all the way to the outbreak of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, well before the beginning of WWE <em>or</em> NWA: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MaeYoung" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MaeYoung">Mae Young</a> (1923-2014), the former United States Women's Champion (a now-defunct title) who appeared on <em>Monday Night Raw</em> as late as March 2013. With an in-ring career spanning literally six decades, Young was generally referred to in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes">Broad Strokes</a> whenever WWE programming discussed her incredible history, usually being hailed as the first nationally prominent female wrestler (not true, although she was alive when first nationally prominent generation was active) and a morale-booster for Americans on the home front during the war in the 1940s (true this time). Attempts have been made to construct a title archive for Young, but so many of her victories happened so long ago and were so spottily recorded that this task has proved frustrating; indeed, it's doubtful if Young herself could remember everything.
</li><li> WWE fired their continuity editor for pointing out the millions of continuity errors. His job was specifically to point out and edit "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">storylines</a>" to make sure the continuity worked.
</li><li> This has increasingly become an issue in the 2010s, when WWE started signing more wrestlers who first achieved popularity in the independent/international scene. The rivalry between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamiZayn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamiZayn">Sami Zayn</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinOwens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinOwens">Kevin Owens</a>, for example, takes on greater depth when one is also familiar with their previous backgrounds in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">Ring of Honor</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ProWrestlingGuerilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ProWrestlingGuerilla">Pro Wrestling Guerilla</a>. And while WWE has done a good job so far establishing the relationship between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles">AJ Styles</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KarlAnderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KarlAnderson">Karl Anderson</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DrewHankinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DrewHankinson">Luke Gallows</a>, to casual viewers the connection between the three men and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FinnBalor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FinnBalor">Finn B&aacute;lor</a> is not readily apparent unless they also looked into the history of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BulletClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BulletClub">Bullet Club</a>, a heel stable that was created in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling">a completely different promotion on the other side of the Pacific</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> WWE onscreen commentators both past and present (Matt Striker, to give one noteworthy example) can boast an encyclopedic knowledge of 20th-century wrestling lore, being able to cite references to things that happened long before they were born - and since there isn't time in the middle of a match to bring everyone up to date on what all these references mean, anyone who happens to be casually tuning in to WWE programming is certain to be all but lost, even when it comes to references to events that happened as recently as a few months ago.
</li><li> This was a problem for IWA Puerto Rico's English feed on Fox Sports Net. While cutting out all the promos and video packages and going straight to the matches was refreshing in a way, it was hard for someone casually tuning in to know exactly who everyone was or appreciate their motivations, which was a problem because IWA's big angles at the time revolved around abuse of power, attempted corporate takeovers and their rivalry with WWC, which anyone not up to speed with IWA would know even less about. Competing directly for viewership with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling">TNA</a> Impact</em>, who happened to be signing names already known to the English speaking audience such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamoaJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamoaJoe">Samoa Joe</a> while similar such names like Bison were leaving IWA gave people even less incentive to sit around and figure out what IWA was all about.

<ul><li> This is a general property of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TableTopRolePlayingGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TableTopRolePlayingGames">Table Top Role Playing Games</a>. Most have highly detailed universes which are contained in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorStopper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorStopper">Door Stopper</a> books. A good <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">Game Master</a> and group of players will help a new player considerably. Put succinctly, a new player has to learn the mechanics of most games (crunch) as well as the setting (fluff). Despite the name, learning the "fluff" is not always easier - some games have really simple rules and terribly complex ideas behind them. Smart companies design their products around this problem.
</li><li> Additionally, a new player joining a game that has been in progress for months or years can find themselves not only lost in terms of the core game, but in the no doubt hundreds of clashes, allies, enemies and in jokes a group will have created over the years.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> and by extension <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a> get a bit of a break, as D&amp;D has fertilized so many video games and other fantasy works that some of the material comes off as a cliche within the genre. Despite this, there are literally hundreds of books for the various D&amp;D settings, optional guides, and so forth, spread through so many editions, that without a patient group it can be very overwhelming for a new player.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a> alone published dozens of books and boxed sets with every edition.
</li><li> Paizo's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a> Adventure Paths try to get around this by offering free books which brief the players on the adventure to come and what to expect. They're "only" roughly 15-30 full-size pages, and they still require a decent knowledge of the rather complex Pathfinder setting.
</li><li> D&amp;D and Pathfinder have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityLockOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityLockOut">Continuity Lock-Out</a> problem in their crunch as well. As they constantly release new books with new mechanics, a new player can have five to ten rulebooks of material to sort through. For example, Pathfinder initially had one Core Rulebook, but by mid-2013 now has expanded to include dozens of minor splat books and at least seven that could be considered "options for players." The Core book is about five hundred pages, and each other major book is about two-hundred and fifty.
</li><li> Wizards of the Coast tried to avert this with 5th Edition, by sharply limiting how many books are published each year and making most of them game modules.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WorldOfDarkness">World of Darkness</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness">Old</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New</a>, were prone to this. The typical rulebook was 250 pages of fluff, 50 of mechanics, so a new player would have an immense buy-in in terms of learning the game's feel. Additionally, there were multi-year long metaplots, constant expansions, and a splat book for everything. And the lines all overlapped at least a bit. Fortunately, playing someone brand new to the supernatural world was pretty much the norm, so the <em>characters</em> would be unlikely to know much about the setting.
<ul><li> The New World of Darkness shies heavily away from the dense metaplot of the Old World of Darkness, where sourcebooks were like comic book issues: collect them all to have a hope in hell of understanding anything that was going on. While the New World of Darkness does have some metaplot elements, they are dramatically toned down from previous iteration.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em> requires a pretty good grounding in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanFantasy">Urban Fantasy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberPunk">Cyberpunk</a>, plus is full of its own quirkiness.

<ul><li> This is a problem of many games which license another setting, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a>. Presumably, someone wanting to play these games wants to enjoy settings from other media they like. If they invite other friends who aren't familiar with the setting, the new player has to adapt to all the new rules, mindset, and the setting.
</li><li> Star Wars games often use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a>. Given how much of it there is, that can really be overwhelming if all you know are the movies.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> are fairly approachable as straight war games without any over-arching fluff, but their various role playing incarnations like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkHeresy">Dark Heresy</a></em> require a massive amount of detail about their settings. The war games do a fairly good job of giving a feel for their worlds, however, with rule-books that are about a hundred pages of rules and three hundred pages of fluff and model galleries.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia">Paranoia</a></em> subverts this. You're neither expected to know the rules nor the setting going in. If you are caught knowing the rules or setting, it's treason. Friend Computer assures you that knowing the rules or setting are not vital to your success in this mission. Report immediately to Brain-Scrub Room Zeta 462 to have this treasonous information purged from your brain or be executed for treason. Have a pleasant daycycle.
</li></ul></li><li> All the above problems apply doubly-so for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">Game Master</a>, who has to know (or fake) the setting to the satisfaction of the players.
</li><li> Many games release a "beginner's version" to try to compensate for this problem, allowing new players to sample the game at a minimal layout before deciding whether they want put down their hard-earned money and then spend time working through the game at all. Sample adventures which hold the players' and GM's hands a great deal are also used to this effect.
<ul><li> Making many new characters naive about the setting is another effective tool to combat this problem, since the player and their character learn together. This is very effective in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/UnknownArmies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/UnknownArmies">Unknown Armies</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WorldOfDarkness">World of Darkness</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CallOfCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CallOfCthulhu">Call of Cthulhu</a>, and other settings where there really isn't a good reason for the character to know much about the setting. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade">The Masquerade</a> means new characters are naive, the player can be almost as surprised as their character when they discover something new.
</li></ul></li><li> Averting this trope is why Catalyst Game Labs released a new introductory box set for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> that took things back to the Succession Wars (where the game originally started) following by a kickstarter for more box sets focusing on the Clan Invasion.

In fact, the developers make it a point players <em>must play the previous games</em> occurring in main <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Continuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Continuity">Continuity</a> to know what's remotely going on if they decide to start somewhere in the middle.
<ul><li> <em>Original Generation</em> as a whole has this problem going forward so long as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sequel">Sequels</a> are rolled out: the on-going narrative expects players to know of what has already occurred, since pre-existing characters don't bother giving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Exposition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Exposition">Exposition</a> to newcomers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> (if there <em>are</em> any, chances are it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Downplayed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Downplayed">Downplayed</a> to avoid the plot going off-rails). While <em>The Moon Dwellers</em> attempted to mitigate this for the audience with an "Archives" section by detailing major events that have happened, it doesn't fully explain the entire picture when there exists tie-ins to overall <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Continuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Continuity">Continuity</a>, such as obscure Banpresto video games like <em>Hero Senki: Project Olympus</em> and <em>The Great Battle</em> series, some of which are crucial when it comes to knowing the overall <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a>. That <em>Original Generation</em> has become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateUniverse">Ultimate Universe</a> of former-Banpresto's, current-B.B. Studio's, video games by attempting to tie in their narrative elements is a reason why this trope exists only for this series (unlike the licensed-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em> installments that are mostly self-contained).
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> series goes out of its way to avoid this, to the point of characters avoiding references to other games even when it would make sense to do so. See: Miles Edgeworth in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigations">Ace Attorney Investigations</a></em> constantly mentioning that he no longer follows the Von Karma way without mentioning the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Von Karma murdered his father and raised him that way as revenge for a small courtroom slight... at least until the second <em>Investigations</em> game, which features Gregory Edgeworth's last case as a playable segment, but that was only released in Japanese and many Western fans haven't played it.</span> He also refuses to ever refer to Phoenix Wright (who doesn't appear in the spin-offs outside of two hidden cameos) by name, which gets pretty hilarious after a while.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamOrigins">Batman: Arkham Origins</a></em> suffers quite a bit from this, as there are a lot of references to old Batman stories (most notably, when Joker flashes back to his Red Hood costume from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke">The Killing Joke</a></em>) that are pure fanservice to old hands make no sense whatsoever to new players. Though The Killing Joke segment takes place <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThroughTheEyesOfMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThroughTheEyesOfMadness">entirely in Joker's head</a>, so it doesn't have to make much sense.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/BioShockInfinite/BurialAtSea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/BioShockInfinite/BurialAtSea">Burial at Sea</a></em>, Episode 1 will, right up to the ending, actually make <em>more</em> sense to someone who's only played <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1">BioShock 1</a></em> than it will to someone who's only played <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShockInfinite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShockInfinite">BioShock Infinite</a></em>. Booker and Elizabeth's connection has no real importance until the end, and this is an alternate Booker, so the only real connection to <em>Infinite</em> is Elizabeth's ability to open Tears, and the basic gameplay controls. In a storyline sense, it's more like a DLC to the original Bioshock series. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Which the <em>second</em> episode of Burial at Sea capitalizes on.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BlazBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BlazBlue">BlazBlue</a></em> takes the cake. Let's try and break down the storyline: no matter which character you play through the arcade mode with, each of them all end up having the same ending in which they just simply cannot stop the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> from unleashing his ultimate creation and getting one step closer to destroying all existence. But the thing is, each of these character endings all happened at the same time, because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is manipulating the laws of space and time to reset time over and over again, each time creating a new dimension in which he hopes the parameters will be just right where he can carry out his ultimate goal. Confused yet? It gets worse. On top of all those endings all happening at the same time, an overarching storyline continues to unfold in which each character has their own goals that they want to achieve. Some characters are just trying to live peaceful lives, some have become bounty hunters while trying to hunt down the most notorious criminal in the world, while he himself is just looking for someone's ass to kick, namely the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. One girl is trying to figure out who she is, and eventually finds herself as the very center of all the crap that is happening. Meanwhile, the bad guy is trolling each and every last one of them, manipulating many of them and corrupting their ideals, making friends distrust each other, betray each other, and pull everyone's strings to the extent that everyone is about to just go straight up crazy. Somehow the main characters figure out the plot, band together, and defeat the big bad, but this was all part of his plan to make what is a computer equivalent of GOD overlooking the entire universe to divert its attention long enough for the big bad to take it over and advance his plan yet again. <br><br>All of that was the outcome of just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueCalamityTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueCalamityTrigger">the first</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueContinuumShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueContinuumShift">two games</a> <strong>alone</strong>. Read the character pages for the game and just see how many spoilers there are. It'll take a long while before you can start to make sense of it. It's not like playing the first game will help better explain anything either. You'll be just as confused if you just bypass the first game altogether and start with the second. This isn't even counting the numerous spin-off games for multiple portable platforms like the PSP and DS, assuming that the game even gets exported over from Japan in the first place! <br><br>Worse still, there is an exorbitant amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">side materials</a> which all manage to tie into the main plot. Whereas you could largely get by in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear">Guilty Gear</a></em>, <em>BlazBlue</em>'s predecessor, without these, they are <em>crucial</em> to understanding the <em>BlazBlue</em> universe. For starters, if you want to know why Hakumen is the man he is today and how <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hazama is able to prey on Tsubaki's jealousy of Noel</span>, that's where <em>The Wheel of Fortune</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudioAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudioAdaptation">drama CD</a> comes in. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BlazBluePhaseShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BlazBluePhaseShift">Phase Shift</a></em> light novels build up the underlying story of the Six Heroes and details the exploits of the Dark War's unsung hero, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a time-displaced Ragna the</span> Bloodedge, not to mention that the fifth novel throws in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">a hook</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueChronoPhantasma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueChronoPhantasma">the third game</a> (namely that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Celica playable in <em>Chronophantasma</em> is a time-displaced clone of the original brought to the present by her niece Kokonoe, created when Celica touched the Cauldron in Ishana</span>). Even the overly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">fanservicey</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlazBlueRemixHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlazBlueRemixHeart">Remix Heart</a></em> manga might end up influencing things down the road given the main character's friendship with three of the games' more prominent females, her status as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">one of the Duodecim (the twelve families Jin, Tsubaki, and <em>CP</em> newcomer Kagura belong to)</span>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">some rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a>-laden visions of the future</span> in later chapters, and Mai's eventual connection to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a powerful grimoire created by Nine of the Six Heroes</span>. Luckily, members of the fandom have managed to translate and give synopses of these works, but if you don't bother doing your homework, you're going to have a hard time making sense of some of the more cryptic allusions. <br><br><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueCentralFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueCentralFiction">Central Fiction</a></em> adds Naoto Kurogane, who was in the <em>Bloodedge Experience</em> light novels, Es from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/XBlaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/XBlaze">XBlaze</a></em> games, and Mai Natsume from the aforementioned <em>Remix Heart</em> manga (with her appearance based on the then-concurrent <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlazBlueVariableHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlazBlueVariableHeart">Variable Heart</a></em> manga, which is a midquel set between <em>Remix Heart</em> and <em>Calamity Trigger</em>). If you haven't read Naoto or Mai's stories (most likely not, as they were Japan-only) or played both of the <em>XBlaze</em> light novel games, you won't realize why they're in the game, or even realize that Naoto and Es hail from separate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universes</a>&mdash;connected to the main <em>BlazBlue</em> world via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation">the Boundary</a>&mdash;yet have direct ties to other members of the main roster (as versions/analogues of certain characters existed in their realities) and/or the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenVillain">real</a></em></span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s plot.

However, there are still a few gaps here and there &mdash; for example, the summary neglects to mention why Catie is able to magically unlock prison bars, despite that skill being a fairly major plot point in the first game. Still, it's a helpful resource to have, given that the prequel itself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">has long since been taken down</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Deltarune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Deltarune">Deltarune</a></em> more or less takes this to its logical conclusion, making it absolutely a necessity to have played <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em> first. Not only are you expected to recognize the characters, since most of the demo's "hook" comes from seeing familiar characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elseworlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elseworlds">in a very different setting</a>, but the fact that you, personally, have played <em>Undertale</em> <strong>is a plot point</strong>; you can make references to the previous game that the character you're controlling has no reason to know about, and this is even noticed in-universe. Further, the final scene, while startling enough on its own, is <em>truly</em> disturbing to players who recognize just what's going on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExMankindDivided" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExMankindDivided">Deus Ex: Mankind Divided</a></em> has a significant amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallForward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallForward">Call-Forward</a> moments that presume the player has played most of (if not <em>all</em>) the other installments, as well as seen tie-in works that were written between the release of <em>MD</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a></em>:
<ul><li> The reason why Adam Jensen is working with the Juggernaut Collective, why he's familiar and on good terms with Alexandra Vega and why he's investigating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepCoverAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepCoverAgent">double agents</a> within Task Force 29 is explained by a number of works that take place between games, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeusExBlackLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeusExBlackLight">Deus Ex: Black Light</a></em>, the <em>Dawning Darkness</em> and <em>Children's Crusade</em> comic series and a DLC from <em>Human Revolution</em> that introduced the Juggernaut Collective, to begin with.
</li><li> In fact, the sudden introduction of Alexandra Vega and her prominence in the plot appears to have been a way to restore her character after she was featured in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExTheFall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExTheFall">Deus Ex: The Fall</a></em> (an installment that was only released on mobile, and later, PC) and the novella detailing her actions between the games.
</li><li> Conversely, the player's enjoyment of the "System Rift" DLC relies on their understanding of Jensen's dealings with Frank Pritchard (former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mission Control</a> in the previous game) during the <em>Black Light</em> novel, as well as the presence of a key character from the original game.
</li></ul></li><li> Continuity in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em> games works in a similar way to avert lockout. For example, you don't NEED to know about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIDaggerfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIDaggerfall">Warp in the West</a> to play and enjoy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind">Morrowind</a></em> &mdash; but if you'd LIKE to know how the previous game's multiple endings were resolved, just read the in-game book about it!

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em>:
<ul><li> A comparatively minor example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em>, but the Courier will have a hard time answering the questions to prove you're an NCR citizen without having played <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1">Fallout</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em>. The only question you can answer based on what's in <em>New Vegas</em> is the one that asks what's on the NCR's flag. The answers to the other two questions, which ask what the NCR's original capital city and its most popular president are, are not found in game.
</li><li> The villainous nature of the Enclave in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> can seem odd without having played the previous game, <em>Fallout 2</em>. To a new player, the Enclave is simply the remnants of the American government who provides patriotic music and occasional radio broadcasts on their radio station (at least until they <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kill your father and take control of Project Purity</span>). However, <em>Fallout 2</em> revealed that the Enclave is the descendants of an elite billionaire class secretly running the American government, incredibly human-supremacist, and wants to eradicate all radioactively mutated beings from the Wasteland, which in <em>Fallout 2</em> includes most of the people living in the Wastes, but is relegated to just Super Mutants and Ghouls in <em>Fallout 3</em>. (Knowing this also explains the psychopathic experiments of the Vaults - Vault-Tec was run by members of the Enclave, and was intended as a proof of concept that humans could survive under various, often torturous conditions (including isolation, radiation, artificially created caste systems, and so on) to later be used for space flight. Without this knowledge, however, most Vaults and their experiments will seem more like mad science run rampant than for an actual, if not completely justified, cause.) However, this backfires, as it's never really explained how the Enclave could exist in D.C. if they'd all been evacuated to an oil rig off the coast of California soon before the bombs fell.
</li><li> The sudden appearance of the Prydwen and the Brotherhood of Steel in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> can appear as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> without having played <em>Fallout 3</em>. They're only mentioned in the game before this if you manage to listen to the easy-to-miss military signal and rescue Danse and his squadron at the Cambridge Police Station, and the Power Armor helmet on the front is implied to be the player's Power Armor, not belonging to the Brotherhood like on the covers of <em>Fallout</em> and <em>Fallout 3</em>. Then, after completing Act 1's boss battle, the Sole Survivor emerges from Fort Hagen to see a giant airship and several Vertibirds flying around, announcing the Brotherhood of Steel's presence to the Commonwealth. While most companions are at least familiar with the Brotherhood (Danse and MacCready the most), Codsworth, the Sole Survivor, and any new player will be thoroughly confused.
<ul><li> Similarly, Madison Li's side quest to rejoin the Brotherhood of Steel is rather nonsensical without playing <em>Fallout 3</em>. In <em>Fallout 3</em>, she works with the Brotherhood of Steel to finish Project Purity. However, in the 10 years between games, she makes her way to the Commonwealth and eventually joins the Institute, which is where the Sole Survivor finds her. The Brotherhood's motivations for wanting her back hinges on the player's knowledge of this - otherwise, it seems like they threw a dart at a board of Institute scientists and chose her.

This includes <em>Before Crisis</em> (a mobile game that never got a release outside Japan), <em>The Kids Are Alright</em> (a novella released in the runup to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FinalFantasyVIIAdventChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FinalFantasyVIIAdventChildren">Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children</a></em>) and other associated tie-in games. Moments and characters from the aforementioned titles and others are mentioned liberally in the remake, with a scene in the final chapter that is contingent on the player being aware of the protagonist and climactic final fight from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCoreFinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCoreFinalFantasyVII">Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII</a></em>. And that's not even getting into the main antagonist, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sephiroth, who is implied to be from an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a>, post-<em>Advent Children</em> timeline, who manipulates the main characters by showing visions of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> that are actually some of the key story moments from the original game</span>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> series. Starting from any game from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsChainOfMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsChainOfMemories">Chain of Memories</a></em> and onward will get confusing. And no, despite what the marketing says, the series is a devout adherent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddlyNamedSequel2ElectricBoogaloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddlyNamedSequel2ElectricBoogaloo">Oddly Named Sequel 2: Electric Boogaloo</a>. <em>No</em> game in the series is unimportant, as the player is supposed to play the games in chronological order; playing just the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI">three</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">numbered</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII">games</a> will get them absolutely <em>nowhere</em>. For example, <em>Chain of Memories</em> is actually a direct sequel of <em>I</em> and serves as the stepping stone between it and <em>II</em>; without it, the player will not catch even 10% of the latter game's plot (case in point: <em>II</em> opens with a set of characters the player doesn't know about, living in a place they don't know about and talking about things they don't know about but are probably related to <em>I</em> because there are flashbacks...or something). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsBirthBySleep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsBirthBySleep">Birth by Sleep</a></em>, by virtue of being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel">prequel</a>, is probably the only sequel that newbies can pick up relatively mindfuck-free, but it contains many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallForward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallForward">Call-Forward</a> references that will fly over their collective heads unless they have played the preceding games. What's worse, the series is spread over 8 different consoles, including handheld ones<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15s9ez');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note15s9ez" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15s9ez');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">PS2, GBA, DS, PSP, 3DS, PS3, PS4, and Xbox One</span>, mobile phones, and web browsers. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper">Crack Is Cheaper</a> than playing the entire series.
<ul><li> It also doesn't help that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Final Mixes</a> in the series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">are unavailable outside Japan</a>, despite containing critical plot points. This makes it difficult to follow the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KudzuPlot">already complex plot</a> of the series, unless you look up fan translations.
</li><li> Luckily, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SquareEnix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SquareEnix">Square Enix</a> released <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationRerelease">1.5</a></em> worldwide for the PS3, containing <em>KHI Final Mix</em>, <em>Re:Chain of Memories</em>, and an abridged, cutscene-only version of <em>358/2 Days</em>. Then they released <em>2.5</em>, containing <em>KHII Final Mix+</em>, <em>Birth by Sleep Final Mix</em>, and an abridged version of <em>Re:coded</em>. Eventually, they released PS4 versions of both collections, after a third collection containing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts3DDreamDropDistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts3DDreamDropDistance">Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance</a></em> along with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts02BirthBySleepAFragmentaryPassage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts02BirthBySleepAFragmentaryPassage">Kingdom Hearts 0.2: Birth by Sleep - A Fragmentary Passage</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsX">Kingdom Hearts &chi;</a></em> as a movie, before the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII">Kingdom Hearts III</a></em> on PS4, ensuring that the entire series, absent playable versions of the DS games, is playable on one console.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts3DDreamDropDistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts3DDreamDropDistance">Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance</a></em> had a recap-like <a class="urllink" href="http://kh13.com/forum/topic/30377-memoirs-feature-in-kingdom-hearts-3d-explained/">"Memoirs" feature<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. The generally bare-bones entries and hyper-complicated plot make the memoirs more useful for fans needing a refresher, though.
</li><li> The Disney worlds are supposed to be played on the assumption that fans have watched the movies they reference, because the worlds are abridged, modified, or start <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMediasRes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMediasRes">In Medias Res</a> to fit the series narrative. The worst example in recent memory is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013">Arendelle</a> from <em>III</em>, which significantly cuts Hans' role, yet his Heartless still attacks you at the end for no apparent reason.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain">Legacy of Kain</a></em> series is hard enough to follow even if you play them all. If you missed one, you have no chance. Well, you'll probably be alright if you miss <em>Blood Omen 2</em>: it gives some back story for the Hylden, but nothing terribly important that can't be gleaned from <em>Soul Reaver 2</em>.
</li><li> Playing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LEGOAdaptationGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LEGOAdaptationGame">LEGO Adaptation Game</a>, apart from the <em>Lego Batman</em> games (which are original stories) and the <em>Lego Marvel Super Heroes</em> game (also original), make very little sense if you haven't seen/read the source material they are based on, <a class="urllink" href="http://archive.li/nXSGG">as this blog demonstrates.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>:
<ul><li> Happened with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> when it was ported to the PlayStation 3. Because of licensing issues, the first game couldn't come to that console, until the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationRerelease">Mass Effect Trilogy</a></em> arrived five years after the first game's release. People were worried that new players wouldn't get the whole story, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare">BioWare</a> created an interactive comic that, admittedly, tells the story from a somewhat awkward perspective. It glosses over Feros completely, leaving some players in the dark about Shiala, the Feros colony, et. al. Even worse, as Admiral Hackett doesn't appear in the sequel outside of passing mentions and a letter, his significance in the <em>Arrival</em> DLC is completely lost on players who didn't experience the first game.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> with the DLC plots from <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, as the game has alternate scenarios in place if the player didn't do the DLC missions. For example, Shepard is incarcerated at the start of the game for working with Cerberus rather than <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">causing hundreds of thousands of batarian deaths</span>, as the situation in <em>Arrival</em> is handled instead by Alliance soldiers and Liara defeats the Shadow Broker with a ton of hired mercenaries.
</li><li> There are two small cases in the second and third games. Unless you've played <em>Mass Effect: Galaxy</em>, you won't know how Jacob knows Ish on Omega. People who haven't read the novels also won't know where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Kai Leng</a> came from.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MeltyBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MeltyBlood">Melty Blood</a></em> assumes you already know all the characters and their relationships to each other. If you're completely unfamiliar with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime">Tsukihime</a></em>, it feels like a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InJoke">In-Joke</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em> slowly rose from humble origins, into the self-sequels <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty">Metal Gear Solid 2</a></em>, had a brief blip for the stand-alone <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater">Metal Gear Solid 3</a></em>, and then gunned the canon whole-heartedly into the massive continuity snarl-ups of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidPortableOps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidPortableOps">Portable Ops</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots">Metal Gear Solid 4</a></em>, both of which only a very serious and dedicated fan would be able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityPorn">understand</a>.
<ul><li> As a sort of alternative, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearAcid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearAcid">Ac!d</a></em> games happened in an alternate universe, but they still expected a familiarity with the main phase series with its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spoiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spoiler">spoilerrific</a> character cards. In the first game's story, a lot of hints about Snake's identity and motivations require some knowledge of his main phase <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon">canon</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">Backstory</a>, such as his sterility.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidGroundZeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidGroundZeroes">Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes</a></em> is not only based on the PSP game (with a PS3/X360 HD rerelease) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidPeaceWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidPeaceWalker">Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker</a></em>, but on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue">Playable Epilogue</a> ending that many people missed. Few people seem to care.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM">Metroid: Other M</a></em> is frequently accused of this. While most of the references make sense to a casual fan, the use of this trope single-handedly turned the Ridley scene into one of the most despised scenes in the series history. This plot point came from an obscure manga that was never released outside of Japan, where Samus has already feared Ridley since he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather">killed her mother</a> and led a massacre of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown">her home planet K2L</a>. About the only indication people get is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext">nonsensical shot of Samus turning into her child self</a>, rather than actually showing the ravaging of K2L for context.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">Zig-zagged</a> with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Neptunia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Neptunia">Neptunia</a></em> series. The canon games (the ones that further the storyline) open with both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narration">Narration</a> and one of the main characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">Breaking the Fourth Wall</a> to explain how the world works, who the main characters are, important plot points from previous games, etc. The non-canon spin-off games, on the other hand, seem to expect you to have played the canon games and know who the characters are, since they liberally use concepts and terminology from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse">The 'Verse</a> with little explanation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowIV">Saints Row IV</a></em> has many missions and jokes that refer back to the previous games, especially <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow2">Saints Row 2</a></em>. If you haven't played those earlier games, the significance of certain events is decidedly lost (especially since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/SaintsRow1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/SaintsRow1">Saints Row</a></em> was exclusive to the Xbox 360, meaning a large section of the fanbase hasn't played it). Amusingly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowTheThird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowTheThird">Saints Row: The Third</a></em> was supposed to be an aversion, barely bringing up the Stilwater adventures so as to not alienate new players.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SouthParkTheStickOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SouthParkTheStickOfTruth">South Park: The Stick of Truth</a></em> generally averts this; despite being full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityPorn">Continuity Porn</a>, most references to the show are more or less used as one-off gags that don't impact the plot to a significant degree. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SouthParkTheFracturedButWhole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SouthParkTheFracturedButWhole">South Park: The Fractured but Whole</a></em>, on the other hand, has its plot so closely integrated with the show (<em>especially</em> Seasons 19-21, the most recent three at the time of the game's release) that the vast majority of the jokes and references that the plot relies on will end up completely lost on those who haven't been following the show religiously.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft">StarCraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII">StarCraft II</a></em> is a slight example of this. There are summaries on the website and the installiation process shows off a recap of what went down in the original games, but otherwise you have to read the novels to know anything about Valerian, Tychus, Matt Horner.
</li><li> Plot advances going unexplained in-game during the 4-year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftBroodWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftBroodWar">Brood War</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftIIWingsOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftIIWingsOfLiberty">Wings of Liberty</a></em> caused a disconnect for people as well. If you were hoping for a continuation of where <em>Brood War</em> left loose ends off, prepare to be extremely disappointed.
</li><li> You'd have to dig into the franchise's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> to understand why Raynor is all of a sudden longing to be with Kerrigan again at the start of <em>Wings of Liberty</em> despite his last appearance in <em>Brood War</em> having his classic character defining moment of vowing to kill Kerrigan someday. We're suppose to believe that he got over his ploy for revenge during the 4-year intermission, but how he got over it went completely unexplained in the game; leaving many players confused as to why Raynor's suddenly in a different emotional state.
</li><li> You'd have to read the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> to understand how the Dominion are all-of-a-sudden the top dogs again despite being on the recieving end of many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb Stomp Battles</a> in <em>Brood War</em>. The player's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionofDisbelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionofDisbelief">Willing Suspensionof Disbelief</a> really comes to question here as to how the Dominion achieved such a miraculous recovery; including how Korhal instantly turns into a planetwide megapolis come <em>Wings Of Liberty</em> despite being a desert wasteland 4 years prior in <em>Brood War</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> It is possible to understand and enjoy the plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenIII">Suikoden III</a></em> without playing the first two games in the series, but the reveal of the Masked Bishop's identity (a pivotal moment in the story) will not make any sense.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em>, this wasn't much of a problem during the PC-98 era and the first few games of the Windows era, since the plots of those games were largely self-contained. However, after <em>Mountain of Faith</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityCreep">Continuity Creep</a> starts to take place, and now it's much more difficult for newcomers to understand what's going on since each game builds upon the previous one. Comments by ZUN suggest that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator">he feels a certain level of inaccessibility</a> is core to the <em>Touhou</em> experience. The various manga and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniverseCompendium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniverseCompendium">Universe Compendiums</a> don't really help either, since all the manga series assume that one is already familiar with the games and their lore and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniverseCompendium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniverseCompendium">Universe Compendiums</a> have some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narration</a> at work. That said, since <em>Touhou</em> is at its core a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootEmUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootEmUp">Shoot 'em Up</a> series and the shmup genre is known for its heavy focus on gameplay over lore, if you just want a series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">Bullet Hell</a> games, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayTheGameSkipTheStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayTheGameSkipTheStory">you don't need to understand the plots to have a good time</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrailsSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrailsSeries">Trails Series</a></em> can easily fall into this trope. While each series has a more or less self-contained plot taking place in different countries across Zemuria, there are many, many side characters from other parts of the franchise that make extensive cameos and references to other events. Each of these games is a 60-100 hour RPG with <em>tons</em> of dialogue, making catching up a daunting task. The games set in Crossbell are an enforced example thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">not being localized yet</a>, it doesn't help that several characters from Zero/Azure are referenced, and the protagonists from those games are even briefly playable, not to mention some other Crossbell casts making their appearances in the third <em>Cold Steel</em> game, making players wonder who the hell these people are.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIX">Ultima IX</a></em>, being the ninth game in the main series and all, attempted to avert this... "Attempted" being the key word here. As the game was rushed to hell and back, it was simply opted to have the Avatar be able to ask about pretty much every single detail about the world, as well as a museum dedicated to the Avatar's adventures in the first town which references past games. Which would be fine if not for A: the way they went about it (hint: not the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsYouKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsYouKnow">As You Know</a> way) and B: the fact they got so many longstanding details wrong anyway. So newer players were <em>still</em> lost... and older players were <strong>infuriated</strong> at how the Avatar had turned into a complete ditz that forgot stuff that was not only basic knowledge but also deeply personal to him. Say it with us, folks; "What's a Paladin?"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWarriors">The Warriors</a></em> tries to avoid this - and mostly succeeds - both by recreating the opening scenes of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWarriors">1979 film</a> at the very beginning (although some crucial dialogue is edited out) and by making the game a prequel of sorts, beginning about a year (1978) before the events of the film and firmly establishing the personalities of the nine major characters long before the actual content of the movie becomes playable. The numerous cutscenes, heavy chunks of dialogue and constant updates on the radio (the gang has one in their training studio) by the famous lady DJ about what's happening throughout the city help a great deal.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheWitcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheWitcher">The Witcher</a></em> games zig-zag this trope on account of serving as a continuation for a series of books that were virtually unknown outside of Poland for the longest time. The first game manages to avert through the process of making Geralt an amnesiac who doesn't remember what happened in the books. This has the effect of turning him into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceSurrogate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceSurrogate">Audience Surrogate</a> who's as familiar with the world, characters, and backstory as the player is. The sequels, however, play it more straight. On top of building upon the games' ever-growing narrative, characters and story elements from the books become even more prominent, making it all the more imposing for newcomers to jump in.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> is like this at times.

Why is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Cairne</span> dead in Cataclysm? Op, better <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">read the expanded universe material</a> to find out! To be fair, the games never leave you completely out of the loop, but you might have to dig for those tidbits. It's just the basics, not the complete story.
<ul><li> Blackwing Descent, one of the tier 11 raids, is home to Deathwing's son Nefarian, who is running experiments on different kinds of dragons. Except Nefarian was already killed several years prior to the <em>Cataclysm</em> expansion. Playing through the game alone, you'll never find out how Nefarian came <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>, what the purpose of his experiments was, or how they tied into Deathwing's plan since the raid doesn't address it and neither Nefarian nor his experiments ever appear or are mentioned outside of Blackwing Descent. Were it not for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WarcraftExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WarcraftExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a>, the entire raid would be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment">Big-Lipped Alligator Moment</a>.
</li><li> Nozdormu, Aspect of Time and leader of the Bronze Dragonflight, was missing in action during classic WoW and the first two expansions. It was a bit of a plot point that the rest of his flight didn't know where he was or what he was doing. Then, in Patch 4.2, he shows up during the Elemental Bonds questline. No mention of him having been gone, where he was, or when he got back was made, and everyone just acts like there's no reason he wouldn't be there. Turns out his return was covered in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> novel <em>Thrall: Twilight of the Aspects</em>...

Akihiro Hino has acknowledged this, and plans to localize the films alongside the upcoming localization of the game so as not to confuse audiences who haven't seen them.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ZeroEscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ZeroEscape">Zero Escape</a></em> franchise has an up-and-down relationship with this. The first sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/VirtuesLastReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/VirtuesLastReward">Virtue's Last Reward</a></em>, more or less tells its own coherent story, although a couple of characters will only be fully understandable with having played the first game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/NineHoursNinePersonsNineDoors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/NineHoursNinePersonsNineDoors">Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors</a></em>.

Diving in with current stories means you may not get the in-jokes, or the references to prior stories, or what's going on with recurring characters, or some of the ongoing plotlines, like Ayla's blackmailer or Jade's quest, or the people who may be after Toni.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfKidDanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfKidDanger">The Adventures of Kid Danger</a></em> expects viewers to be familiar with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HenryDanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HenryDanger">parent show</a>. As such, it doesn't do much to introduce shows to new viewers.
</li><li> This happens to a certain degree in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em>. From season 3 onward, the show starts to do more world building, character arcs, and building up a continuity with very deep lore. One could still watch any given episode up until Season 7 with little to no context, but any far as episodes in the final few seasons are concerned, you better have a good knowledge of the lore of the Land of Ooo, or watch the whole series from the beginning (which, given that the show was on the air for 8 years and has almost 300 episodes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchivePanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchivePanic">could take a while</a>).

It also gently deconstructs this a bit, pointing out that if you're jumping in this late and skipping all the previous episodes, you really have no one to blame but yourself for being confused.
<div class="indent">"Do not explain the plot! If you don't understand, then you should not be here!"
</div></li><li> An interesting case with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer">Archer</a></em>. While the over all plots of most later episodes can be viewed and understood without having seen earlier episodes, much of the show's <em>jokes</em> are call backs and references to previous running jokes (such as Archer asking "why aren't we doing "phrasing" anymore?") or require long-time understanding of each character's foibles to get the full humor (such as Pam's history as an underground pit fighter/drag race champion). So while someone jumping in late in the show will have a basic understanding of what's going on, they may wonder what the joke is supposed to be when Archer keeps saying "danger zone".
</li><li> While not important to the overall continuity, viewers of later episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur">Arthur</a></em> may be thrown off by witnessing Pal and Kate talking all of a sudden unless they familiarize themselves with season 6's "The Secret Life of Dogs and Babies".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em> suffer this problem due to having detailed storylines in a complicated universe, with every episode either moving the plot forward or developing its increasingly complex main characters. This is especially true for <em>Korra</em>, which unlike its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a>-driven predecessor, is heavily serialized, with each season-long story arc directly leading into the next and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn">Previously On&#133;</a> segments only explaining what happened on the prior episode alone. People who watch the show casually or missed early episodes may be lost later on, when things get heavy and the characters are well-established. <em>Korra</em> has almost no filler to speak of because it only consists of 52, 22 minute long episodes across four seasons so every single episode must be watched. The original show had 61 episodes across one fewer season so a few episodes filler here or there could be missed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes">The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes!</a></em> has subplots that span several episodes, or start off one week and get picked up again much later. The second half of season 2 was mostly changed to stand-alone episodes, as Marvel TV head <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JephLoeb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JephLoeb">Jeph Loeb</a> claimed that the show's mediocre ratings might have been the result of the series being inaccessible to new viewers. Even then, viewers jumping in at this point would probably still feel confused.
<ul><li> This was then used as part of the justification behind ending <em>Earth's Mightiest Heroes</em> and launching <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvengersAssemble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvengersAssemble">Avengers, Assemble!</a></em> as a replacement.
</li></ul></li><li> As the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Ben10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Ben10">Ben 10</a></em> franchise went on, it became harder for audiences to become invested in the arcs and growing cast of characters. The fact that the films and crossovers that the franchise have spawned are <em>all canon</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16cmob');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note16cmob" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16cmob');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Even <em>Race Against Time</em> is acknowledged by one dimension traveling character as being an alternate continuity</span>, meaning that those disinterested may have to watch them anyway. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10Omniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10Omniverse">Ben 10: Omniverse</a></em> promised to be a good starting point, though it still required a good deal of understanding of the three previous shows to understand jokes, characters, and even certain story arcs. <em>Omniverse</em>'s poor ratings led to the franchise being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot">rebooted with a new continuity</a> a few years later.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BojackHorseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BojackHorseman">Bojack Horseman</a></em> aggressively defies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity">Negative Continuity</a>, and so can become difficult to follow if you drop in on a random episode, since characters will frequently reference past events and actions with very few details. A good example of this is in Season 6, where one episode begins with Bojack, Princess Carolyn, Todd and Diane all working through every bad thing Bojack has ever done, writing them on various whiteboards. A random viewer would assume the majority are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">Noodle Incidents</a>, but not only are the vast majority all actual events that happened at some point during the show's run, but most of what's written are simply brief references (such as "Stole Daniel Radcliffe's fruit basket" and "Ruined Integrity of Booty Academy") that will fly over the heads of anyone who hasn't watched every single prior episode.
</li><li> There's are no fewer than six episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor">Codename: Kids Next Door</a></em> that start off with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero">KND</a> trying to steal the birthday cake of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain">Delightful Children From Down The Lane</a> with no explanation for a new viewer as to why exactly the DCFDTL are supposed to deserve this. Included in the six are the first episode, and the final episode.
<ul><li> Aside from this episode, there are many episodes that continue off of each other, numerous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arcs</a>, newly introduced KND members, and other organizations or subfactions of the KND themselves.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em> had a bit of lock-out in its second and third seasons, particularly in regards to Danny receiving new powers (such as his ghostly wail and cryokinesis), the introduction of new characters (like Dani Phantom and Frostbite), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">references to previous episodes</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Valerie Grey</a>'s story arc, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Vlad Masters</a> becoming the mayor of Amity Park (much of the confusion in the third season, however, could at least partially be blamed on Nickelodeon's airing staff, as the episodes wound up premiering out of order with no regard to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a>).
</li><li> With each episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Detentionaire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Detentionaire">Detentionaire</a></em>, the plot becomes more and more intricate as either new characters are introduced, old characters change, or some important plot point is revealed. As a result, jumping into the series without starting from the beginning, or missing one episode entirely, could result in a lot of confusion as to what is occurring, even with the recap at the beginning of each episode.
</li><li> When making the move from Cartoon Network to Netflix, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DragonsRidersOfBerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DragonsRidersOfBerk">Dragons: Riders of Berk</a></em> had to leave behind its Cartoon Network seasons and start fresh as <em>Race to the Edge</em>. Even though the setup deliberately tries to be fairly self-contained, it is still a continuation of the previous show and references to past events may go over the heads of fans who only started watching from Netflix.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em> was pretty tightly packed with continuity, especially during its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome">second</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">season</a>. The series had long-running plot arcs concerning mystery objects, major changes that tend to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">avert</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a>, and important call-backs that could be confusing for new viewers. Although season one was largely stand-alone, it still had episodes that introduced characters or certain plot-elements that would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">reappear or</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman">become important later on</a>. It's not so bad that some of the show's younger audience may not be entertained just by the jokes and the action elements of the plot, but the show's older <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a> is unlikely to include anyone who hasn't watched it from the first episode, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> is completely inaccessible for anyone not familiar with the show.
</li><li> For that matter, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GreenLanternTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GreenLanternTheAnimatedSeries">Green Lantern: The Animated Series</a></em> falls under this starting with the Manhunter and Anti-Monitor arc in the second half. That's pretty impressive for a series that only lasted 26 episodes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnoldTheJungleMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnoldTheJungleMovie">Hey Arnold! The Jungle Movie</a></em> is <em>very</em> heavy on continuity, even picking up from where the intended finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em>, "The Journal", left off (granted in a dream but still). As well as containing callbacks to several previous episodes of the series. Older fans will likely love it, but those just joining in without proper knowledge might be a bit confused considering the real life 13 year gap between this and the series. Especially considering the show only airs on TeenNick now, which not everyone would have access too and if they do, it airs during hours in which most people would be asleep. Some reviews have stated it was probably a good thing <em>The Jungle Movie</em> didn't go to theaters for this reason (ironically enough) as the movie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnoldTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnoldTheMovie">that did</a> was more a standalone adventure.
</li><li> Amusingly lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeagueAction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeagueAction">Justice League Action</a></em>; a major plot twist towards the end of season one reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the show is actually set in the same universe as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GreenLanternTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GreenLanternTheAnimatedSeries">Green Lantern: The Animated Series</a></em> and the Space Cabbie&#146;s AI assistant is really an amnesiac but still alive Aya, unconsciously searching for Razer</span>. The significance of the scene where this is revealed will probably go completely over your head if you haven&#146;t watched <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>Green Lantern</em></span>, so the show has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PattonOswalt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PattonOswalt">the Space Cabbie</a> say <em>exactly</em> what such viewers are probably thinking (&#147;Well, that was weird&#148;), with an implicit assurance that it will be explained later.
</li><li> With each passing season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LittlestPetShop2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LittlestPetShop2012">Littlest Pet Shop (2012)</a></em>, protagonist Blythe Baxter continues to move up in the fashion world and becomes increasingly famous, and those seasons' episodes that focus on that aspect of her are written with her then-current status in mind. There are also a handful of episodes that have the Biskit Twins as the antagonist with no explanation given as to why they are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain">Designated Villain</a>; knowledge of their repeated attempts to sabotage Blythe is required.
<ul><li> There is an episode in Season 2, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/LittlestPetShop2012S2E11BlythesBigIdea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/LittlestPetShop2012S2E11BlythesBigIdea">Blythe's Big Idea</a>", which exists solely to set up the rest of the season. This includes the introduction of the Pet Jet (which allows Blythe to travel to other countries, which would become a recurring theme from then on), Blythe acquiring her kiosk store, and details about the Pet Fashion Expo to be used in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/LittlestPetShop2012S2E25TheExpoFactorPart1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/LittlestPetShop2012S2E25TheExpoFactorPart1">season</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/LittlestPetShop2012S2E26TheExpoFactorPart2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/LittlestPetShop2012S2E26TheExpoFactorPart2">finale</a>.

It turns out that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a> had Fran&ccedil;ois re-hired to serve the family, but this episode was pushed back to, unsurprisingly, the holiday season and was skipped during the season's initial run. Hence, every viewer who saw him suddenly back were confused as to what happened.
</li></ul></li><li> People watching <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse">The Loud House</a></em> who missed the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasSpecial">Christmas Special</a> might be wondering why Mr. and Mrs. Loud are no longer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFaceless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFaceless">The Faceless</a> in later episodes.
</li><li> It was once rumoured that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenFaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenFaust">Lauren Faust</a> wanted a season-long story arc about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarterVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarterVillain">Nightmare Moon</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>, which the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">higher ups vetoed</a> specifically to avert this trope. This was later proven untrue (Lauren always planned on the show being episodic), but either way, the series eventually did delve into tighter story arcs and continuity in later seasons. Trying to watch any given episode from the last three seasons if your last experience viewing the cartoon was the first three will result in some confusion, as you wonder why some characters have changed appearance, why certain locations no longer exist, etc.
<ul><li> "The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000" wasn't aired in the UK, due to cider more commonly meaning hard cider there, causing some confusion for viewers who only watch the show on TV when Flim and Flam reappear in later episodes.
</li></ul></li><li> Some later episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OKKOLetsBeHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OKKOLetsBeHeroes">OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes</a></em> have a few examples, as some of which can affect the plot of the show. Such as concerning <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the identity of KO's father</span>, as well as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Enid going to P.O.I.N.T at season 2</span>, and it can leave new viewers left out.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReadyJetGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReadyJetGo">Ready Jet Go!</a></em> is not a heavy story arc-driven series like <em>Beast Wars</em> or <em>Steven Universe</em>, it does have continuity. If you stumble upon a random episode, you may think that the Propulsions are a weird, stupid human family when they are really aliens. And if you do discover that they are aliens, you may wonder why they need to keep their identity a secret, or why a little kid in nerd glasses is spying on them.
<ul><li> Face 9000 gets an upgrade in "Face on the Fritz", so new viewers who see a post-FOTF episode, and then see a pre-FOTF episode might be confused.
</li><li> Mindy turns 5 in season 2 and is also to go into space with the others. A viewer can find themselves catching one of those episodes, only to watch an earlier one wherein she's explicitly denied the opportunity.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow">Regular Show</a></em> fell into this in the latter half of its run. Seasons 1-3 were pretty much stand-alone, but the premiere of Season 4, "Exit 9-B", involved almost every character who appeared in the show to that point. It continued with seasons 5 onward, with many episodes involving characters returning, and the introduction of ongoing story arcs. There are still enough stand-alone episodes so it's not that bad, but to get the full experience (wait, why is the final season <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpace">IN SPACE!</a></span>?) you'd have to watch the earlier seasons, or at least the relevant episodes.
<ul><li> It got really bad with the UK airings of "Merry Christmas Mordecai" and "Sad Sax". The UK gets the episodes a few months after they first air, but since Cartoon Network UK will only air Christmas episodes around Christmas, when they got to that point in the season, they skipped over MCM and went right to Sad Sax, despite the fact that Sad Sax is a direct sequel to MCM, likely confusing some viewers.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em> is a unique example; given the nature of the series. While it is still possible to enjoy most of the jokes on their own; each season so far has stories that connect in some way or another, despite its episodic story structure. Notably, the season 3 premiere does make a fairly entertaining episode on its own; though humor does require knowledge of the character dynamic and how subtle details from previous seasons become key to the story. This can largely be attributed to how many events and lines, no matter how insignificant they may seem at first glance; play a part in the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a>.
</li><li> Later episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> suffer from a mild case of this condition at times (though it's understandable for a series that is currently in its 31st season). One particular gag in the ninteenth season's "E. Pluribus Wiggum" involved Homer (accurately) daydreaming about a "think-tank", a joke which is probably funnier to longtime viewers than new ones unaware of his bizarre <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">Imagine Spots</a>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Homer:</strong> <em>(noticing the rest of the family staring at him)</em> What, I'm not allowed to get one right?
</div><ul><li> Many of <em>The Simpsons</em>' minor characters are completely bizarre without context, yet the show takes it for granted that the audience can recognize and appreciate most of them without any sort of perfunctory introduction or explanation. Examples would include Bumblebee Man, Sideshow Mel, Duffman, the Sea Captain, or Disco Stu, or even Krusty, all of whom are long-running continuations of one-off gags from many, many years past. One gag even relies on the viewer recognizing Duffman's voice, when he himself neither appears nor even gets mentioned in the episode.
<ul><li> This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> when Marge gets amnesia in the seventeenth season's "Regarding Margie". She finds all the side characters confusing and creepy and is incredibly disturbed when Homer says they're his and Marge's close friends.
<div class="indent"><strong>Marge:</strong> <em>(off Otto Mann)</em> Why is that drug addict driving a school bus?
</div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> for the most part, was very light in continuity, with at least one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfArcSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfArcSeason">Half-Arc Season</a>. Then along came Seasons 18 and 19, which have ongoing season-specific storylines yet still maintaining episodic plots, with Season 18 having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarroEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarroEpisode">Bizarro Episode</a> with an ending that has no bearing on the rest of the series. Season 20, however, is all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourLinesAllWaiting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourLinesAllWaiting">Four Lines, All Waiting</a>, with every episode dealing with continuous subplots spanning across multiple episodes like a gender war, a regular character becoming a notorious Internet troll, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceArc">Romance Arc</a>, and the 2016 presidential election. Season 21 tones this back down reasonable levels, as the episodes stand alone for the most part, and Mr. Garrison more closely resembles <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> and isn't referred to by name, likely to minimize confusion to new viewers.
</li><li> Understanding the plots of some episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarTrekTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarTrekTheAnimatedSeries">Star Trek: The Animated Series</a></em> requires having seen at least the majority of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em>, as several of them allude to the events of the original live-action series, such as Cyrano Jones' first encounter with the crew of the Starship Enterprise and Harry Mudd being asked how he escaped from his imprisonment at the end of the original series episode "I, Mudd".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em> was often comprised of episode arcs rather than a typical serial. For casual viewers, missing a new episode could lead to getting confused if they don't recover and instead choose to continue to the next episode without context. This actually ended up being a problem for the show's ratings over time in combination with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome">Cerebus Syndrome</a> (meaning it turned away younger viewers, who are the target audience since the show aired on Cartoon Network), which eventually led to the show's (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled">initial</a>) cancellation before the Disney buyout. This is why its sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels">Star Wars Rebels</a></em>, tended to avoid arcs and sought a balanced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome">Cerebus Syndrome</a> that wouldn't turn away the younger audience as time went on.
<ul><li> You may still be locked out of <em>Rebels</em>, however, especially if you've never watched <em>The Clone Wars</em> due to continuing off of characters and plots from it, such as Ahsoka Tano, clone troopers Rex, Gregor and Wolffe, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a very alive <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace">Darth Maul</a></em></span>. Also, <em>Rebels</em> is also similar to its predecessor in that <em>every</em> episode counts towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">something later on</a>, no matter how big or small the impact is.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>, with only eleven minutes per episode, tells an increasingly dense narrative by having small details that later get referenced and expanded upon with the expectation that the viewer will recognize and connect previous foreshadowing in a show that just doesn't have the time to recap them. The first half of season one is episodic enough that <a class="urllink" href="https://katsuricata.com/floodorder/">you can skip most of it without much trouble<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Everything after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS1E25MirrorGem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS1E25MirrorGem">"Mirror Gem"</a>) however, and you're going to need a working knowledge of the show's mythology to grasp the significance of characters' actions.
<ul><li> After season one, if you've not seen every episode by this point, you're going to be lost as the show expects viewers to recognize locations and plot points that might have only appeared once, dozens of episodes previously. For example, season three spends its premiere reintroducing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Watermelon Stevens, the Malachite fusion of Lapis Lazuli and Jasper fully formed and emerging from the ocean, Steven's empathetic powers and mental contact, the Alexandrite fusion of all three of the Crystal Gems, and the threat of the Cluster hatching in the Earth's core</span>. With the exception of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Cluster</span>, all of this is payoff for situations and events that hadn't even been mentioned since early Season 2 at best and <em>the middle of Season 1</em> at worst.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseTheMovie">movie</a> attempts to mitigate this by providing a brief recap of major plot events up until that point and having the four main characters reintroduce themselves (five seasons worth of character development and all) via song, but there are still plenty of details that people who haven't seen the show will miss.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats2011">Thunder Cats 2011</a></em> is heavy on its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicFantasy">Heroic Fantasy</a> plot, but this makes it fairly difficult to leap in halfway and know what's going on. Some episodes don't really <em>end</em> as much as they just <em>stop</em>, only to pick up right where they left off the next week, which lends to the show being more accessible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterOnDVD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterOnDVD">in large chunks</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em> has been getting less and less elaborate on its past as the series goes on. The latest season, <em>All Stars</em>, begins with no real recap of any of the show up to that point (aside from the characters quickly bringing up certain moments), so anyone who hasn't seen the episodes beforehand would be much more confused than those who had, which makes sense because PSN does not have the <em>Island</em> special, all of <em>Action</em>, and all of <em>World Tour</em>, creating weirdness concerning Sierra's crush on Cody, and Alejandro being in a robot suit among others.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em>:
<ul><li> One of the many complaints people had about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em> is that when it aired, it had the strongest continuity ever seen in a cartoon on American or Canadian TV. As a result, a new viewer jumping in partway through is going to be quite perplexed by what's all going on. Then its sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastMachines">Beast Machines</a></em> one-upped it.
</li><li> Ironic with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastMachines">Beast Machines</a></em>, since they were originally trying to <em>avert</em> this trope by ignoring most of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em>, only to end up with a stronger version of the trope in its own series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em> ran into similar issues. There's one episode fairly late in the series' run that references nearly every episode that had come before it in some way, ranging from what an item in the background is to why one of the characters is a zombie now; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TFWikiDotNet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TFWikiDotNet">TFWiki.net</a> continuity notes begin by saying that this would be a tough episode to start watching the series. This may be why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersRobotsInDisguise2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersRobotsInDisguise2015">its sequel</a> is using more of an episodic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> approach. However, some knowledge of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> of Prime is required <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to explain why Bumblebee is speaking to the spirit of Optimus Prime in the early episodes of the series. While it is possible to follow coming in cold, this holds more significance for those who have seen the later episodes of Prime before this series; which connects the two</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series creators, Doc Hammer and Jackson Publick, actually discuss this trope when they hosted the season four finale <em>Operation PROM</em> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">[adult swim]</a>. They appeared in a series of videos leading into and coming back from commercial breaks during the initial airing of the episode, and in one of them, discussed how self-referential this episode in particular was. The series in general, at least after the first season, can have this effect as well, as the episodes are packed with references to things that happened previously, not to mention that it gets weirder and <em>weirder</em> with each passing season.
</li><li> The cause of Dean's emo phase through the fifth season was explained in the Halloween special which aired before it. Not helped by the fact that the special is included on the season box set as a bonus feature, meaning a lot of people will watch the main season first.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em> also falls into this and gets more so with each season. The first season is a fairly typical superhero cartoon that doesn't expect you to know too much about the universe, The second season added a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">much larger cast</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoLinesNoWaiting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoLinesNoWaiting">regularly jumping around to accommodate them</a> without explaining who they are. The third season moved to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCUniverse">streaming platform</a> marketed solely at existing comics fans (and currently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">unavailable outside the United States</a>) and is more or less incomprehensible unless you really know the universe. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewGods">New Gods</a> are introduced with aplomb. The franchise has always been popular with critics and comics fans but they're a pretty casebook text of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainstreamObscurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainstreamObscurity">Mainstream Obscurity</a> as they've never had an adaptation to themselves. The show doesn't take the time to really explain the concepts of the mythos like the fourth wall or mother boxes that are involved either.
