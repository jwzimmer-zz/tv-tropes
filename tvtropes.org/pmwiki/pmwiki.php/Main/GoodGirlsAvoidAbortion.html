<p>When a female character has an unexpected and/or unwanted pregnancy, someone may allude to the possibility of abortion (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie">usually without saying the 'A' word</a>). However, she will most likely <em>not</em> have an abortion for one of three reasons:
</p><ol><li> She dismisses it immediately because of her religious/spiritual/moral beliefs or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedCatholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedCatholic">upbringing</a>, or because she distrusts the procedure (especially if it would involve a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackAlleyDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackAlleyDoctor">Back-Alley Doctor</a>).
</li><li> She thinks it over for a while, then decides to keep the baby. Sometimes the plot will twist the knife by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientMiscarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientMiscarriage">having her pregnancy end in a miscarriage</a> just when she's decided to carry to term.
</li><li> She actually decides to have it done, but somehow things don't turn out as she expects, and her attempted abortion is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">aborted</a>.
</li></ol><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>If she actually goes through with the abortion, and doesn't suffer gruesome complications from the procedure or a certain amount of moral guilt and uncertainty afterwards, it's usually to show that she's a deeply damaged, screwed-up individual. If this happens, but it is played for laughs, it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a>. If the male character who got her pregnant voices support for the abortion option, it's played as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Kick the Dog</a> moment to show what a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a> the guy is.
</p><p>Part of the reason for this is to both avoid the wrath of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a>, and as well as avoid polarizing/alienating a big chunk of the audience (though this can happen anyway if her decision not to abort is made in a hamfisted manner)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0c2qr');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0c2qr" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0c2qr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Only 50% of Americans support abortion on demand, with the other 50% either only approving of abortion under severe circumstances or never approving at all. </span>, but it's mostly because if the character had an abortion and everyone went home happy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama">it would make for an uninteresting and/or short story</a>, or worse, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardTruthAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardTruthAesop">imply that abortion is nothing special</a>. Writing a character who has an abortion and feels ambivalent or uneasy about her choice is generally verboten. However, if the character decides to keep the child, a large avenue of potential plot lines opens up for the writer to exploit. For example, new Characters, all manner of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeddingAndEngagementTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeddingAndEngagementTropes">Wedding and Engagement Tropes</a>, etc.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The other 'a' word (adoption) hardly ever enters into consideration even if abortion itself is ruled out. There are several reasons for this. In serial media such as television and comic books, a baby given up for adoption can be seen as a dangling plot thread that the audience will expect to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">picked up some day</a>. Also, adoption requires carrying the baby to term. If the woman merely needs to figure out what to do with the baby, this is irrelevant, but if she wants to conceal the fact that she was ever pregnant to begin with, it may not suffice. And abortion can be counted on to get a stronger reaction from the audience than adoption. Similar story logic applies to why we rarely see women <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialServicesDoesNotExist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialServicesDoesNotExist">taking advantage of the</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe-haven_law">safe-haven laws<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that exist in all 50 states and simply allow them to "surrender" a child to the state without even contacting an adoption agency.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>This trope's usage can be executed poorly by writers suffering of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">Critical Research Failure</a>, mostly in the field of medicine, where they would show archaic methods used by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackAlleyDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackAlleyDoctor">Back-Alley Doctor</a> (mostly the use of a hook-like object) as being the norm of respectable clinics, as well as showing a fully formed fetus (8 months old or so) instead of a tiny mostly amorphous embryo when it comes to what resides inside the pregnant woman's womb early-on, when nearly all abortions take place.
</p><p>The Trope can often contrast with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliverUsFromEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliverUsFromEvil">Deliver Us from Evil</a>, which shows that a <em>bad</em> girl would likely feel the same way.
</p><p>Most importantly, however, is that this trope turns upon the false <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeggingTheQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeggingTheQuestion">Begging the Question</a> choice between responsibility and personal freedom. From a narrative standpoint, adoption is a kind of a cheat since it allows the woman to have both, thus allowing the author to resolve the conflict <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DebateAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DebateAndSwitch">without answering the underlying question</a>. If adoption <em>is</em> mentioned, it will usually be ruled out with some justification or other.

In general, anime &amp; manga will play with this trope a <em>lot</em> more than Western media will. In Japanese culture, abortion is neither as culturally polarizing a topic (most Japanese accept it, and it is not taboo in either Buddhism nor Shinto, the dominant religions) nor as strictly legally restricted, and has been effectively available when required for centuries. Ironically, <em>birth control</em> is far more polarizing and legally restricted in Japan, which leads to the Japanese typically aborting unwanted pregnancies instead of using contraceptives to manage family sizes.
<hr><ul><li> A <em>fourth</em> reason was used to justify Hinako giving birth to her second pregnancy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BitterVirgin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BitterVirgin">Bitter Virgin</a></em> (her first was miscarried before she even realized she was pregnant)- the doctor told her that if Hinako went through with an abortion, her body wouldn't be able to take it and she might never be able to bear children again in the future. As a result she was made to carry the baby to term and gave it up for adoption.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CeresCelestialLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CeresCelestialLegend">Ceres, Celestial Legend</a></em>, Aya eventually learns that she's pregnant. Nothing is discussed for some time <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">because the deaths of Chidori and Touya, who is the father of Aya's child, is in the foreground</span>, until Aya returns to her home. She's still processing the news herself until her doctor friend asks her what she's thinking of doing. Aya quickly decides that she wants to have the baby, despite the circumstances being very difficult, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">since the baby is 'part Touya', she doesn't want to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeoneToRememberHimBy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeoneToRememberHimBy">get rid of it</a></span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Karin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Karin">Karin</a></em>:
<ul><li> Fumio went with reason 2, and carried the baby (Kenta) to term against her family's wishes.
</li><li> Later we see Kenta's father with another woman, who is pregnant and demands him to pay for an abortion. He gets a <em>little</em> pissed off by that.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nana">Nana</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nana K</span> becomes pregnant with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Takumi's</span> child and thinks about getting an abortion because she and her boyfriend <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nobu</span> aren't able to support a child. However she decided against it when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Takumi offers to marry her and help raise the child if she goes through with the pregnancy</span>. Though <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nana K admits that if her current boyfriend Nobu</span> had asked her to get an abortion she would have gone through with it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KodomoNoKodomo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KodomoNoKodomo">Kodomo no Kodomo</a></em>:
<ul><li> Averted by Tomoko. When she realized that she was pregnant, other options are never discussed and abortion is what she plans on doing, and eventually does a few chapters later.
</li><li> Abortion is discussed in Haruna's case. When Mika finds out, she researches things and tells Haruna that an abortion can only be done up to the 23rd week and that she should abort. But Haruna eventually realizes that the baby needs her, so she doesn't.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NowAndThenHereAndThere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NowAndThenHereAndThere">Now and Then, Here and There</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sara becomes pregnant as a result of a rape and tries to induce an abortion, but Sis convinces her to not take out her hatred of the man who hurt her on the baby.</span> This one's a particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> case of this trope considering that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sara is a psychologically traumatized young girl living in a war-torn dystopian hellhole who has limited access to health care and has no family or parents to help her raise the child or support her financially. Her only parental figure is Sis, who dies shortly after talking Sara out of the abortion. In addition, the doctor who gave the option of abortion, and the only real doctor we actually see in the series, was shot dead a few episodes ago, so it may actually be a non-option without putting Sara's life at risk as well</span>.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WildAdapter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WildAdapter">Wild Adapter</a></em>. Pregnant teenager Saori runs away from home and befriends series leads Kubota and Tokitoh. They're investigating the mysterious drug W&#149;A; she's looking for her missing boyfriend. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Turns out W&#149;A killed him.</span> In love with her boyfriend but ambivalent about her pregnancy, Saori is strongly implied to have had an abortion by the end of the story. Kubota offers sympathetic acknowledgment: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PositiveDiscrimination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PositiveDiscrimination">women are strong, aren't they? Look at us men, we're hopeless.</a>"
</li><li> Late in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SchoolDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SchoolDays">School Days</a></em> anime, Makoto gets Sekai pregnant, and alternates between claiming the baby can't possibly be his and pressuring her to get an abortion. This is used to drive home that Makoto's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>, as his main concern is that nobody else is willing to sleep with him after how he publicly rejected Sekai. However, it's also left up in the air whether <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBabyTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBabyTrap">Sekai was actually pregnant or not</a>. Being <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot">School Days</a></em>, it didn't end well.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/EternalSabbath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/EternalSabbath">Eternal Sabbath</a></em> &mdash; when Yuri's mother finds out she's pregnant just as she's starting to rebuild her relationship with her daughter, she opts to abort, out of equal parts a desire to concentrate on Yuri and out of fear she'll love the new child to the point where she'll be unable to accept the one she has. The story is entirely on her side. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When Isaac kills her &mdash; abortion is his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> for <em>very</em> valid reasons: it's not presented as karma, but as a tragedy, and is the crucial mistake that seals his fate.</span>
</li><li> This seems to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Madam Red's</span> opinion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She</span> actually kills and mutilates <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> prostitutes</span> who had an abortion and doesn't feel remotely bad about it. This is explained by the fact <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she can no longer have children</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AkkanBaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AkkanBaby">Akkan Baby</a></em>, just about everybody suggests that Shigeru and Yuki may want to give up their child (as in, for adoption). "I don't want to kill the baby!" are practically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords">Arc Words</a>. However, this is played with a side character, Mika, as she initially intended to get an abortion after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Shigeo, Puni's father, left</span>, but she was too far along.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket">Fruits Basket</a></em>, this is used to show the differences in morality between Kyoko and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ren</span>, though neither woman gets an abortion and they're portrayed in different lights because of their reasons for considering them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ren</span> threatens to get one <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to emotionally manipulate her husband into raising their future child as a boy, regardless of the baby's actual gender, because she's such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a> that she hates the idea of <em>any</em> woman, even a daughter, taking Akira's attention away from her</span>. Kyoko, meanwhile, considers an abortion because she thinks it's better to not have a baby at all than to have one and possibly condemn it to a childhood as abusive and neglectful as her own was.

</li></ul></li><li> "Aur&eacute;lie" by Colonel Reyel is about a sixteen year-old girl who gets pregnant, then decides to keep the baby against the will of her friends and parents.

The act itself is referred to obliquely; it is made very clear that she feels both depressed and guilty (one of the verses goes: "That thing seemed to be usual/And now it seems to be a sin"). The whole song is very pessimistic and the music video shows a little girl dancing on a field while the singer walks sadly around a park.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15522');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note15522" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15522');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Given that the music industry in Czechoslovakia during Communism was tightly controlled, one possible explanation for this song is that it might have been written as a piece of propaganda to guilt people into keeping their pregnancies and breeding future citizens.</span>

<ul><li> The different denominations of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Christianity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Christianity">Christianity</a> have a variety of different views on abortion, ranging from condemnation to acceptance of it, many of which have changed drastically over time.
<ul><li> The Roman Catholic Church views human life as beginning at conception, and as such considers willful abortion to be a mortal sin in all circumstances and punishable by both automatic excommunication and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DraggedOffToHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DraggedOffToHell">eternal damnation</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note20ci6');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note20ci6" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note20ci6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Of course, like all sins in Catholic Theology, this sin can be forgiven if the one who commits it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastSecondChance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastSecondChance">repents before death</a>.</span> Even before reaching the conclusion that life begins at conception (which in their view makes termination of pregnancy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring">an act of murder</a>), the Catholic Church has considered abortion to be a mortal sin as early as the 1st century AD when it was condemned by <a class="urllink" href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0714.htm">the Didache<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3hp6d');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3hp6d" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3hp6d');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Didache is traditionally held to have been written by the twelve apostles of Jesus.</span> and by other Church Fathers. As a result, the Catholic Church and many Catholic individuals tend to be active in the anti-abortion movement. Having said all this, medical procedures to save the mother's life are acceptable even if the side effect is the child's death (such as when a cancerous womb is removed).
</li><li> The Eastern Orthodox Church, like it's Western Catholic counterpart, forbids abortion in all circumstances and considers it to be a mortal sin. But while still expected to repent, a woman who gets an abortion because of potential threat to her life doesn't get excommunicated.
</li><li> The Church of England considers abortion to be a Great Moral Evil, and only permits abortion when there is a clear threat to the life of the mother.
</li><li> The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints considers abortion to be contrary to the will of God, and punishes it with excommunication. However exceptions are made in cases of rape, incest, or when a pregnancy threatens the mother's life.
</li><li> The Episcopal Church only condones abortion in cases of rape, incest, when the fetus has abnormalities, or when the mother's health is at risk. It forbids abortion as a means of birth control, as a means of family planning, as a means of sex selection (i.e. aborting all female fetuses because a couple only wants a son), or convenience.
</li><li> The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America supports legal abortion prior to fetal viability, and allow it after fetal viability when the life of the mother or the fetus is threatened by the pregnancy.
</li><li> The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod teaches that abortion should only be allowed when the pregnancy endangers the mother's life.
</li><li> The Presbyterian Church USA disapproves of abortion for convenience, but does not outright forbid it.
</li><li> The Southern Baptist Convention opposes abortion in all circumstances.
</li><li> The United Church of Christ allows abortion on demand.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Judaism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Judaism">Judaism</a> also has a variety of different stances depending upon denomination.
<ul><li> Orthodox Judaism considers abortion an act of murder and only allows it when the mother's life is endangered by pregnancy.
</li><li> Conservative Judaism allows abortion when the pregnancy might cause mental or physical harm to the mother, or when the fetus is deformed or disabled.
</li><li> Reformed Judaism allows abortion in more circumstances, including rape, incest, and when the pregnancy is inconvenient. Additionally it states that the pregnant woman should be the one to make the decision.
</li><li> There is a ritual in the Torah (or Old Testament) describing how a woman accused of adultery by her husband should drink "bitter water", an odd concoction which will according to one interpretation cause abortion if she's guilty and pregnant from her lover. Other interpretations are the potion causing her premature birth or a prolapsed uterus.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam">Islam</a>, the fetus is believed to gain a soul after four months so past that point abortion is impermissible. Whether or not it's permissible before four months differs from scholar to scholar with stances ranging from forbidden to completely permissible. Muslims universally agree that the mother's life takes precedence over the fetus' regardless of term though.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Hinduism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, abortion is generally only permitted to prevent a woman from dying in childbirth. As with Buddhism and Catholic Christianity, in Hinduism a human life begins at conception. The classical Hindu texts even went so far as to claim that getting an abortion was a worse sin than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan">killing one's own parents</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Buddhism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Buddhism">Buddhists</a> generally regard abortion negatively; it is believed that life begins at conception and that the act of killing (either directly or through neglect) always generates negative karma for all involved (even the unborn child, as they return to the cycle of death and rebirth without an opportunity to generate good karma). Of course there are different schools of thought within the religion.
</li><li> Greco-Roman religion for the most part allowed abortion and practiced it regularly. While there were exceptions (one example being Pythagoreanism), they were very rare. The original Hippocratic oath forbade physicians from inducing abortion by use of a pessary. It seems this was not over opposition to abortion overall, though, but a dangerous procedure. Hippocrates advised other methods in his writings. Some followers of his later were adamant it forbade <em>all</em> abortion however.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/MAD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/MAD">MAD</a> Magazine had one article about telling the difference between a Drama, a Comedy, and a Reality Show (which was useful with shows like <em>Laguna Beach: The Real OC</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHills">The Hills</a></em>, when you couldn't tell <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot">what was scripted and what wasn't</a>).

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ARaisinInTheSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ARaisinInTheSun">A Raisin in the Sun</a></em>, the first thing the wife does when she finds out she's pregnant again is put a down payment on an abortion, even though it's clear that she really does not want to do it but feels she has no choice. Her husband is devastated to hear this, and it's not the abortion itself that troubles him so much as the circumstances that lead to them considering it, which underlines the desperation they feel throughout the entire story. They don't go through with it since they wind up with a bigger house and money to raise the child. Note that the play was written in 1959, before Roe v. Wade.
</li><li> In the musical <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SpringAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SpringAwakening">Spring Awakening</a></em>, Wendla gets an abortion though it's implied she does not want to; her mother takes her to get one by force, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and then Wendla dies</span>. This is even sadder in the original play on which the musical is based because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her child is the product of rape.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Cabaret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Cabaret">Cabaret</a></em>, Sally brings up abortion immediately after announcing her pregnancy, but Cliff (who may or may not be the father) convinces her not to do it. In act two she changes her mind and has an abortion, which is played as a sign of her character's downward spiral.

As she wonders what to do about it, Joe suggests one possible course of action, but she rejects it out of hand: "Them kind of doctors is no good... I'm too far gone anyway... I know... and anyway... doing that... It's worse than the other." It all works out, because her husband wants children, and forgives her.
</li><li> <em>The Girl Who Never Was</em> is a play about a woman who aborted a baby she wanted to keep (her boyfriend convinced her to) and is driven insane by guilt/ the ghost of the baby girl. Although the message is more "don't be persuaded to do anything you don't want to" than "good girls avoid abortion."
</li><li> Most (though not all) versions of "The Tango Ballad" from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheThreepennyOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheThreepennyOpera">The Threepenny Opera</a> make reference to Low-Dive Jenny having become pregnant by Macheath, who then forces her to abort the child. Interestingly, the song suggests that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">this was the thing that ultimately convinced Jenny to break off her engagement to Mac</a>, even though she reminisces fondly elsewhere in the song about Mac having pimped, stolen from and beaten her repeatedly.
</li><li> In Eugene Brieux's play <em>Maternity</em>, an eighteen-year-old girl is pregnant by a boyfriend who abandoned her. The last act of the play has an abortionist on trial for her murder, and the counsel for the defense takes the position that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyIsToBlame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyIsToBlame">Society Is to Blame</a> for not respecting motherhood, but "abortion is a crime, because it deprives of life a creature already living; and to condone it would lead to condoning infanticide also." (Yes, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anvilicious</a>, but Brieux was never known for subtlety in drama.)
</li><li> The Irish play <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AnTriail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AnTriail">An Triail</a></em> deals with a young woman who gets pregnant after being seduced by a married man.

Barenziah wanted to keep the child but, as a bastard child from a Dunmer mistress would be <em>very</em> inconvenient for the Emperor (illegitimate heirs to the throne tend to do that), he basically forced his healer to magically abort it against her will. This became a plot point later in the story as the story implied she also had trouble conceiving later in life due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalProcreationClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalProcreationClause">limited fertility</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">Dunmer</a> and the trauma of the event.

The girl in question was going to carry the baby to term, but her parents were going to make her give it up.

<ul><li> Lindsay herself got pregnant while she was still in college, and her decision was based around not being able to afford to raise a child. She says that she would have carried the baby to term if one of her friends or relatives had been willing to adopt it.
</li><li> Her mother reveals that she was the victim of a date rape in the 70s and got pregnant as a result of that. She alludes to the doctor that performed it saying he had many other rape victims get it done too.
</li><li> A woman who got pregnant very young and later regretted her decision. She became a pro-life campaigner.
</li><li> One woman was 26 with three children and had inherited three more after her brother passed. So with six children, she couldn't afford another and got the abortion even if it was "completely against my morals".

</li><li> Peter's mother tried to get an abortion before she had Peter because it was from an affair. Because it was in Mexico, the abortion process involved hanging from a bar and being beaten like a pinata by a bunch of kids.
