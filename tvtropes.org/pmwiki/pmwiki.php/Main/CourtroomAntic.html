However, his attempts to have a fair trial keep going <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails">Off the Rails</a>, as none of the smurfs want to testify against her, Brainy's attempts to take his job seriously keep getting undermined, and Jokey ultimately accuses <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>Papa</em></span> of being the one <em>really</em> responsible for what happened.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewWarriors">New Warriors</a></em>: In the trial of Vance Astrovik for killing his abusive father, the prosecutor takes out what turns out to be a cap gun and fires it at Vance in court, to make the point that if he can freeze a gun he has more than enough control to have stopped his father without killing him.
</li><li> In one issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, Homer and Comic Book Guy are on trial for indecency, because Homer used horror comics he bought from the Android's Dungeon as the basis for a report Bart was making. Things look bad for the men, until Bart happens on an idea; in court, he moves that Homer and Comic Book Guy are not being tried by a jury of their peers because the jury does not have any comic geeks. Judging from Bart's reaction to the judge's response, he was probably moving for a mistrial.
<div class="indent"><strong>Judge Snyder:</strong> In accordance to the Springfield "Play it by ear" Act...okay, we'll give it a shot with the geeks.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Bart:</strong> Buh?
</div><ul><li> Of course, this has mixed results; the geeks get Homer and Comic Book Guy off the indecency charge, but convict the two of charges the geeks themselves cooked up- namely, price-gouging and giving the jury wedgies. The men are sentenced to a public hanging...which amounts to holding up a sign for a comic book convention while being suspended in the air alive.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a></em>, Matter-Eater Lad gets assigned as the lawyer for former teammate Polar Boy's trial on Earth. Polar Boy was held in jail for two years after inciting a small rally in a pizza parlor against the corrupt Earthgov. ME Lad tries all kinds of antics to get the charges dropped, from calling in witnesses to assert Polar Boy is such a wuss he'd be more of a danger to his own friends than to Earthgov to dressing him up in a stupid costume and claiming he has identity issues. The judge finally gets pissed off with these attempts at stalling and declares any attempt to disprove Polar Boy's competency or sanity is a self-evident mistrial. This backfires <em>badly</em> when ME Lad then correctly points out Polar Boy was in jail for years waiting for his trial because they were determining his competency, which of course leaves the judge stammering and the prosecutor happily dropping all charges.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstroCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstroCity">Astro City</a></em>, when Vince Oleck starts to make his case, that equally damning evidence has been found wrong in superhero cases by such tropes as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">Evil Twin</a>, the prosecutor tries to object on these grounds. The judge looks grave but does allow it.
<ul><li> Oleck (in his role as narrator, adressing a law school lecture hall some decades later) states that the only reason this defense ever flew at all was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">that the differing standards of evidence between cases involving meta-humans and those involving muggles only had not yet been codified</a>, but were only a matter of legal praxis. In the comic's modern day, it is up to the prosecutor and defender to present relevant evidence concerning meta-human involvement, and the judge decides which standards apply.

Since Caesar will most likely be there, the two actually <em>want</em> to be sentenced to the circus. Thus, they make no attempt to defend themselves, and when their lawyer asks for the trial to be postphoned, <em>Asterix himself</em> stands up and holds an impassioned plea to get himself and Obelix sentenced to the circus. His speech moves the entire courtroom to tears, and both their lawyer and the delator congratulate the Gauls afterwards.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Chicago">Chicago</a></em>: This is Billy Flynn's entire law practice. Courtroom antics, press conference antics, and probably an example on every sub-page of this index.

Cases in point: offering the witness bets on whether there's a conviction, objecting on the grounds of "I couldn't think of anything else to say", sustaining objections on the grounds of "I couldn't think of anything else to say either", and a pun or two.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight">The Dark Knight</a></em>:
<ul><li> Not expected or intended, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExploitedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExploitedTrope">deliberately played on</a>: a gangster witness tries to shoot Harvey Dent in the middle of the trial. Dent promptly delivers a cross to his face and disarms him, stunning the entire court. When the judge calls for a recess, Dent hams it up: "Your honor, I'm not done yet".
</li><li> A straight version happens later in the movie, when Dent intends to try most of the Mafia roll call (549 criminals) in one sitting. There's a hilarious scene where the judge reads off the list of transgressions, then asks "How do the defendants plead?" Change to the courtroom, packed with mobsters and their attorneys, and all of the attorneys jostle above each other trying to be heard while the stenographer drops his hands, confused.

The defendant was accused of drowning his fiancee, so the prosecutor brought in the boat they had been in, stood in it, and proceeded to loudly and violently break an oar against the side to demonstrate how the defendant supposedly hit the victim in the head before drowning her (the film leaves it up in the air whether or not the drowning was intentional, but he never hit her).

</li><li> "His Suit Is Hirsute" brings us the character of Frank Pastorini, whose egregious antics (such as singing his objections and tap-dancing his way to a sidebar) would, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, result in a jail sentence. Michael Kuzak turns the tables on him by doing his closing argument in the gorilla suit with which he interrupted Grace's wedding.
</li><li> Michael himself is occasionally guilty of antics (he's jailed for it more than once). In his passionate defense of Earl Williams throughout Season 4, he bends and sometimes breaks just about every rule of courtroom procedure. In his defense of Brian Chisholm, a white cop accused of murdering a black teenager, he tries to cause a mistrial by calling the politically skewed judge a "big chicken bastard." When the judge orders Michael's co-counsel, Jonathan Rollins, to take up where Michael left off before being hauled off to a holding cell, Jonathan says, "I believe Mr. Kuzak left off by calling you a big chicken bastard worried about reelection.

Worf is charged with a war crime for destroying a Klingon civilian transport that had entered a battle zone and decloaked in front of the Defiant, and the Klingon prosecutor's whole case was based on the idea that Worf was acting like a bloodthirsty Klingon warrior instead of a Starfleet officer at the time and therefore should be deported to the Klingon Empire. He questions all the other officers present on the Defiant with a hypothetical "what would you do?" situation to "prove" that only a Klingon would have taken the shot, intentionally provokes Worf into a physical alteration in the courtroom. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sisko and Odo eventually find out that the whole thing was a Klingon plot and the transport was a fake that they'd used to make it look like a war crime was committed</span>, which gets Worf off the hook, but the question of why and how the judge didn't throw the prosecution's case out well before it got to that point remains.
<ul><li> In the episode "Tribunal", O'Brien is put on trial by the Cardassians. Cardassian trials, which are intended more as propagandistic primetime entertainment than a serious form of jurisprudence, are built around the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">Kangaroo Court</a> model, with O'Brien already found guilty before the trial even begins. Odo, serving as his advocate, opts to stall and raise points of procedure until it's the longest trial in Cardassian history (including demanding to know why a crime allegedly committed by a Federation citizen aboard a Bajoran station is being tried in neither jurisdiction), and thus buys time for Sisko &amp; Co to figure out what's actually going on.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em>, during Tali's treason trial, one of the options Shepard has to exonerate her is to <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCQM4TFgDMo&amp;feature=related">rally the courtroom crowd<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> against the Admiralty Board, exposing their political maneuvering and bringing both Veetor and Kal'Reegar to her support, culminating in loudly denouncing the Admirals, Kal'Reegar declaring that "you assholes" will have to exile <em>him</em> too, and the crowd getting noisy enough that they're about to start an enviro-suited riot. Normally this <em>wouldn't</em> work in a more formal courtroom for any species other than quarians, but the close-knit nature of quarian society means that the trial is not only fairly informal to start with<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3vmvd');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3vmvd" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3vmvd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Tali says that quarian trials are just the worst kind of family meeting</span>, but that the generally loud and flagrant disapproval of so many people has a much greater effect on the quarian Admirals than it would in any other courtroom.
<ul><li> In that trial, the only two 'legal' responses appear to be giving the evidence and breaking Tali's heart, or withholding it, allowing her to be exiled but at least with the knowledge that they won't know what her father did. Shepard actually has as many as three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">third options</a>, and they're <em>all</em> antics - rather, one antic. Rallying the crowd is above, but Shepard can also personally shout down the Admiralty Board, leaning more towards <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/xlDAFCf-jFY">viciously berating them<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> or <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/K_mPddetb3k">extolling Tali's heroism<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Either way, they initially protest the antic, but as the crowd starts shouting they are shamed into dropping the charges.
</li><li> This behavior is actually subverted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">the first game</a>. In a desperate attempt to expose Saren's crimes, Captain Anderson tries to submit a <em>dream</em> into evidence. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">This makes some sense in context</a>, since the dream is a prophetic vision. However, Anderson has no way of proving this, and if he could, the dream's content has nothing that can implicate Saren, as it's just a series of rapid images showing organic mutilation. Anderson is immediately ridiculed and punished for this behavior by being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs">Kicked Upstairs</a> (in Anderson's defense, he has a very bad history with Saren, and it's clear he was desperate and wasn't thinking straight at the time). When Saren is exposed, it's done with proper evidence, a voice recording that clearly proves that he was heavily involved. ("Eden Prime was a major victory.")

The procecutor of the trial is Igland of the Swift Sword, who upon introducing himself loudly declares that he's <em>never</em> lost a case. Which is kind of hard to believe, because he's absolutely obnoxious - constantly speaks out of turn, makes spurious accusations in order to sway the jury (which unfortunately works), and repeatedly interrupts your questioning of the witnesses to put his own spin on the statements. He's repeatedly ordered by the judge to stop his disruptive behavior, but ignores it (and the judge doesn't back up his warnings). If you manage to win the case (mainly by sticking to the facts and avoiding questions that gives Igland something to twist) he'll throw a massive tantrum over the fact that he lost, acting like you cheated somehow, and leaves in a huff.

As he points out, the hearing is for his sentencing after he's been convicted of <em>300</em> murders; being held in contempt of court isn't much of a threat for someone who's getting an automatic death sentence.

<ul><li> The point and appeal of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> series is probably best summed up by this trope. The first game alone has the protagonist cross-examining a parrot and waving a metal detector around the courtroom, and by the final case of the <em>Trials and Tribulations</em> you're <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">cross-examining a dead person channeled by your assistant</span>. <br><br>There's a twist in that Phoenix himself (a defense attorney) maintains a level of professionalism, but many of the prosecutors do not. In the first game, Manfred von Karma practically intimidates the judge into letting him run the courtroom; in the second game, von Karma's younger daughter Franziska (also a prosecutor) tries to cow the judge, the witnesses, and the defense by smacking them with her whip, even going so far as to whip poor Phoenix <em>unconscious</em> after losing case 2 (See <a class="urllink" href="http://www.awkwardzombie.com/comic1-100107.php">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for an excellent example of Franziska's whipping-ness); in the third game, prosecutor Godot throws his scalding hot coffee across the room in a fit of pique several times and talks in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxlosophicNarration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxlosophicNarration">bizarre philosophical tangents</a>, most of them about coffee; in the fourth game, prosecutor Klavier Gavin is a literal rock star who plays <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirGuitar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirGuitar">Air Guitars</a> during trials; and in the fifth game, prosecutor Blackquill sends his pet hawk to attack you in the middle of a trial, not to mention showing off his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RazorSharpHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RazorSharpHand">sword-hand skills with that feather that was just two inches from Wright's face</a>... despite the fact that he's a <em>convicted murderer who no sane human being would ever allow that kind of freedom of arm movement if they knew he could do that</em>. Sure, he was shackled to prevent that, but he continuously manages to break out of them and <em>nobody does anything about it until much later</em>. Ironically enough, Phoenix himself often gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNothing">berated by the judge for much less</a>. <br><br>The witnesses and defendants join in on the party, too.

The disciplinary action against him was dismissed when he promised not to do it again, but he was later disbarred on a number of misconduct charges.

He said to the judge that he did it to "prove his client's fear of the victim's 'incredible speed' of gunfire". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">He then successfully argued for a mistrial, as the jury wasn't sequestered.</a>
</li><li> The above example in the Scopes trial (prosecutor called to the witness stand by defense) is not unique. It happened to prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi in the Manson trial (this was deemed justified by Bugliosi having also been very involved in the investigation of the case).
</li><li> A lot of courtroom tropes from before the 1980s originated in the trial of Bruno Hauptman who was accused of kidnapping and murdering Charles Lindbergh, Jr. The defense was paid by William Randolph Hearst in exchange for working half-heartedly and betraying his client's confidences (the lawyer also received nightly visits of NYC showgirls with champagne, courtesy of Mr. Hearst), a whole string of surprise witnesses who tended to contradict their own testimony and their statements to police, women fainting after pointing to Hauptman, and a judge who did absolutely nothing to rein in the prosecutor's (who was also the Attorney General of New Jersey) excesses and violations of procedure (both wanted to use the case to advance their political careers).
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Seven">The Trial of the Chicago Seven<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Several scenes from the transcripts from that infamous trial, including the defendants wearing judges' robes (with Chicago police uniforms underneath) to mock what they believed was a biased court, were dramatized in the film <em>Steal This Movie</em>, among other works. The defense also called various countercultural icons of the time as witnesses, including Phil Ochs, Arlow Guthrie, Judy Collins, Norman Mailer, Timothy Leary, and Jesse Jackson.
</li><li> A big part of the reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaddamHussein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaddamHussein">Saddam Hussein</a>'s trial went on for as long as it did was because he would always delay the proceedings with rants and the like. Since he was already a lock for either life in prison or death (the trial was basically to decide which he would get), what's the worst the judge could do? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlreadyTheCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlreadyTheCase">Throw him in prison?</a>
</li><li> John Allen Muhammad, one half of the infamous <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beltway_sniper">Beltway Sniper duo<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, attempted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFoolForAClient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFoolForAClient">represent himself</a> during his first trial. Immediately after delivering his opening argument, during which he did such things as attempt to call former President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton">Bill Clinton</a> to the stand, he decided to avail himself of his court-appointed counsel instead, not that it helped. Whether Muhammad was engaging in this trope as part of some larger gambit, or was just batshit insane, is open for debate.
</li><li> <em>Attempted</em> during former Governor Rod Blagojevich's corruption trial for attempting to sell <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a>'s Senate seat when he became President. Despite the judge already having ruled that the minutiae of the FBI wiretaps was irrelevant, the defense attorney asked the very first witness several times how many hours of wiretap footage they'd collected, trying to plant the suggestion to the jury that what they were allowed to hear was heavily edited to cast his client in the worst possible light. After the third or fourth time, the judge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisregardThatStatement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisregardThatStatement">dismissed the jury for a while</a> and lambasted the defense for trying to play a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewbaccaDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewbaccaDefense">Chewbacca Defense</a>.
</li><li> The trial of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesManson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesManson">Charles Manson</a> and his accomplices for seven counts of murder and one count of conspiracy is one of the most notorious examples. To begin with, Family members not named as defendants loitered outside the courthouse with plainly visible hunting knives plainly visible in sheaths, simply to intimidate passersby. On one day of the proceedings, Manson himself was able to smuggle in a copy of <em>The Los Angeles Times</em> with the front page headline "Manson Guilty, Nixon Declares", and flash it in front of the jury (requiring Judge Older to issue a <em>voir dire</em> to the jury before they could proceed). The next day, the female defendants stood up and said in unison that, in light of Nixon's remark, there was no point in going on with the trial. (Older naturally didn't buy it.) Two months later, after Manson's request to question a prosecution witness (who had already been cross-examined by the defense) was denied, he actually tried to attack the judge; he had to be removed after being wrestled to the ground by the bailiffs, as the female defendants rose to their feet and started chanting in Latin. Thereafter, Older kept a loaded revolver under his robe remainder of the trial. Besides the Family themselves, defense attorney Irving Kanarek kept objecting over every little thing, often racking up a hundred in a single day, and was so notorious for having trials extended beyond belief that another attorney had once quit rather than face him again. He was held in contempt of court numerous times but never quit objecting.
</li><li> O. J. Simpson's murder trial may as well be called <em>Courtroom Antics <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsYourPremiseOnDrugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsYourPremiseOnDrugs">On Drugs</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> has <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson_murder_case">an exhaustive summary<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Be dazzled by tropes inverted, invoked, subverted and played straight, with a surprise appearance by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodwinsLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodwinsLaw">Godwin's Law</a> in the final moments. Jurors, prosecutors, detectives, defence attorneys, and witnesses quickly put out memoirs in the wake of the case, and in 2012, the prosecution accused the defence of falsifying evidence (the same charge the defence made against the prosecution at trial), so the fight is still active. Cochran's closing statement is perhaps the most egregious example of this trope and something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a>.
</li><li> One <a class="urllink" href="http://kevinunderhill.typepad.com/Documents/Opinions/Washington_v_Alaimo.pdf">Matthew Washington<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was so infamous for filing dilatory motions and frivolous appeals, culminating in a "Motion to Kiss My Ass," that there was actually a court order issued forbidding him from filing any more motions unless he first posted a $1500 contempt bond in case the court decided to fine him for wasting their time. Part of the reason why this continued for so long was that, as a veteran, he received a fairly substantial disability check each month that he dipped into to directly pay the filing fees rather than seek indigent status, as litigants who regularly use the latter to file frivolous and abusive complaints, motions, and petitions can and often will be barred from using it as a quick-and-clean way of keeping them from being able to continue to waste the court's time without great difficulty. Because Washington <em>didn't</em> do this, they didn't have a quick, easy way to stop him and had to resort to drastic measures that were more difficult to get the court to sign off on.
</li><li> In a more positive example, defense attorney David Sotomayor pulled a fast one when the prosecutor was running a case relying on in-court ID. He brought someone who looked like the defendant to his table while the defendant sat in the back of the courtroom, and when asked to identify the perp, the police officer pointed to the ringer. The judge immediately dismissed the case, but gave Sotomayor a wrist-slap fine for contempt because he didn't let the judge in on the switch beforehand.
</li><li> <em>State of Georgia v. Denver Fenton Allen</em> (seen in this <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/7vN_PEmeKb0">animated reenactment<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> by the creators and voice actors of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em>) started off as relatively mundane (a defendant in a murder trial started out by expressing dissatisfaction with his court-appointed attorney) but quickly took a turn for the bizarre after he started accusing his attorney of trying to force him into allowing him (the attorney) to perform fellatio upon him (the defendant) in exchange for requested documents; from there, the defendant eventually began showering the judge with verbal abuse before then asking the judge to fellate him, followed by a declaration that he "[doesn't] fuck girls" and instead preferred "white boys" with "big butts", which eventually turned into a shouting match between the judge and the defendant before the defendant eventually graphically threatened to murder the judge's entire family (to which the judge responded that he doesn't even <em>have</em> a family), followed by threatening to masturbate and ejaculate upon the judge <em>and the judge daring him to do just that</em>. The judge gave as good as he got, however, telling the defendant looks "like a queer" and that he has "the constitutional right to be a dumbass." Note that <em>none</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">of this is exaggerated or embellished in any way;</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://coosavalleynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Transcript-Denver-Allen.pdf">the transcript<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> indicates that this is a <em>verbatim</em> retelling of what actually happened that day.
</li><li> Some defendants will claim that the court has no jurisdiction over them, due to some ostensible peculiarity of law. In one such case, judge John Hurley took the loophole the defendant was using and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7h7uevwxt8">turned it around on him,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> resulting in a sentence being leveled against him, his advocate, his physical body and his person.
<div class="indent"> <strong>John Hurley</strong>: If you see David Hall, let him know he's also under arrest.
</div></li><li> A man named Dan Marino <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note44upe');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note44upe" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note44upe');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">No; Not the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame">famous former</a> Miami Dolphins quarterback.</span> sued <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Usher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Usher">Usher</a> and related parties for stealing the song "Bad Girl", which Marino had allegedly written. <a class="urllink" href="http://abovethelaw.com/2014/05/lawyer-suing-usher-gets-benchslapped-into-the-stone-age/">He retained the services of Francis Malofiy<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for the purposes of this and it did not go quite as planned. For one thing, Malofiy's wildly uncivil, impertinent, and frequently belligerent behavior both in and out of depositions was enough to give <em>17 out of 20</em> of the defendants reason to push for sanctions to be imposed against Malofiy. That, however, wasn't the problem; while Malofiy was a massive dick, the judge abstained from imposing sanctions just for being an asshole. He did, however, find something much more actionable. You see, Malofiy had lied to William Guice (one of the defendants, who was going <em>pro se</em>) about being just a witness (knowing full well that Guice had virtually no knowledge of the legal process), got a bunch of information out of him, and, after Guice failed to respond to the amended complaint because he had no idea that he was supposed to, moved to have a default judgment entered against him. It was this (not the rudeness) flagrant violation of Rule 4.3 (regulating conduct with unrepresented parties) that got the court to enter summary judgment in favor of the defendants and sanction Malofiy for all the costs that he had incurred as a result of his conduct in a sanctions memorandum that can be best described as Malofiy being skinned alive; one of the attorneys representing a rightsholder for a portion of Usher's song catalog even stated that he had literally <em>never</em> seen a judge deliver the kind of smackdown that he had laid upon Malofiy. The judge furthermore concluded that while Marino did have a legitimate cause of action and really was wronged, only one of the defendants was to blame, and while he could have had a favorable determination with a better attorney, the shithead he retained ruined it for him, and additionally took the time to state that had anyone else had to deal with Malofiy in this situation, he very well could have found himself facing disbarment proceedings.

He argued with his attorneys, shouted vulgar insults at the jury, solicited legal advice from random spectators, tried to get a pardon from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChesterAArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChesterAArthur">Chester A.

His attempt at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsanityDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsanityDefense">Insanity Defense</a> failed as the court psychiatrist stated that he wasn't legally insane during the assassination, but that "he was insane his whole life, and was never anything else". Guiteau also violently rejected the idea of his being insane, despite his attorneys using this defense, as this would detract from the divine mandate he thought underlay his action. He got his wish, was found guilty and hanged.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>: The Roman Republic had a very detailed legal system, but unfortunately many of the lictors, assessors and praetors were so corrupt or hungry for patronage (or popularity, since these guys were almost all politicians and needed <em>votes</em>) that the system could often be bent. Thus, Roman trials often <em>were</em> the thrilling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosSpeedChess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosSpeedChess">Xanatos Speed Chess</a> portrayed by Hollywood. The famous trial of Gaius Licinius Verres by Marcus Tullius <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Cicero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Cicero">Cicero</a> is a brilliant example:
<ul><li> To begin with, the people of Sicily moved to have Verres tried for extortion (his tyrannical misrule of Sicily was notorious). Verres, putting his stolen money to good use, contracted Quintus Hortensius Hortalus to represent him, widely known as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">finest lawyer in Rome.</a> The citizens, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">feeling rather apprehensive about this</a>, spoke to an unorthodox but rising star of the Roman bar, Marcus Tullius Cicero.
</li><li> Verres and Hortensius used all sorts of procedural tricks in order to delay the trial. These delaying tactics gave Cicero only nine days (nowhere near enough time) until the trial would be adjourned for the upcoming holidays and games of Pompey the Great. After that, the current judge, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief">honest Marcus Acilius Glabrio</a>, would be replaced by an ally of Hortensius', who would be sure to throw the case out. Furthermore, Hortensius and Verres had the support of the <em>optimates</em>, the patrician wing of the Senate. Just to make doubly sure, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">they also bribed the entire jury to find in Verres' favor.</a>
</li><li> However, Cicero was also capable of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil">using this trope to his advantage</a>. He journeyed to Sicily, and with the help of a mob of angry Sicilians, totally illegally stole and copied all of Verres' records. He used his own money to bring over a hundred witnesses, and, on the day of the trial, brought every single one of them into the courtroom (again, illegally) to intimidate the patrician jury and impress the praetor. Before the trial began, he had them go into the winesinks and bathhouses of Rome and spread stories of Verres's sliminess before the plebeians.
</li><li> It was the form in those days to make incredibly lengthy opening and closing speeches. Hortensius was infamous for using the "Asiatic style", a long thrilling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Large Ham</a> performance lasting several days, complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilkingTheGiantCow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilkingTheGiantCow">florid hand gestures</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears">Manly Tears</a>. Cicero would be expected to do the same in his opening speech, thus using up a large chunk of his available time. Thus, Verres and Hortensius had pulled off a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit">Xanatos Gambit</a>: either Cicero tried to fight the case, ran out of time and humiliated himself, or bowed out and let Verres off. Fortunately, Cicero was better at the whole <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">intrigue game</a>. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">took a third option</a>: he made <em>no speech at all.</em>
</li><li> Cicero, again bending the rules, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleCountryLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleCountryLawyer">simply presented his case without any introduction</a>. He ruthlessly cross-examined Verres, who, not the sharpest tool in the box, ended up incriminating himself. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Verrem">Cicero's legal beat-down<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was so severe that at one point the plebeians stormed the courtroom in fury, and the bribed jury was so shamed by this and so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">appalled by Verres' corruption</a> that Verres was forced to flee to Gaul before the trial had even ended. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">Tropes Are Not Bad</a> indeed.
