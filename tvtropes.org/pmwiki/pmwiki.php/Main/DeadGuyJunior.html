</p><p>The concept of naming the next generation to honour the originals has a number of enticing benefits for writers. Firstly, it saves them the effort of thinking up a whole new name. Secondly, it pays lip service to dead characters, and thus has the valuable effect not only of creating a walking plot reminder but of making audiences go, "Awwwwww!

In another case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, some people did and still do simply have a custom of naming new children after beloved deceased friends or relatives.

"Neji" translates to "screw", which is synonymous with "bolt."

When a street urchin named Solo dies, his best friend gives himself the name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">Duo</a> to show that even in death, they'd always be a team.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiHime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiHime">Mai Hime</a></em>, Duran is the name of Natsuki's dog, who was killed in the same car accident as her mother.

He does this because it's an easy name to remember as Zanoba is famous for having torn off said brother's head.
</li><li> In a flashback to the past of Eren Yeager's father, Grisha, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>, we learn that that the man who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">gave Grisha the power of Titan Shifting</span> was named Eren Kruger.

When he gets back, both his parents are alive and he's told he is disappointing his namesake - their clown family friend who went missing after saving the mother's life.

<ul><li> In an alternate universe where Tomas survived and Sinclair Strong died, Tomas suggests that he and Susan name their son Sinclair. Susan, however, insists the boy be named Tomas.
</li><li> Tom himself named his pet thunderbird Pneuman after a robot his father built, which he thought destroyed in an earthquake. Interestingly, Pneuman the bird would die not long after Tom salvaged the remains of and rebuilt Pneuman the robot &mdash; the original Pneuman went on to serve Tom for over a century.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlazeOfGlory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlazeOfGlory">Blaze Of Glory</a></em> has <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Gunhawks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Gunhawks">Reno Jones'</a> son, Cass, after Kid Cassidy. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ultimately subverted.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGirl">Spider-Girl</a></em> has May "Mayday" Parker, an alternate future daughter of Spider-Man, named for her deceased great aunt. She later gets a baby brother named Ben, though it's not clear whether he's named after his great-uncle or his dad's "brother through cloning" Ben Riley (possibly both).
<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RenewYourVows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RenewYourVows">Renew Your Vows</a></em> universe gives us Annie-May Parker, named for both Mary Jane's Aunt Anna and Peter's Aunt May.
</li></ul></li><li> It doesn't stand out because they both go by nicknames, but Bartholomew Allen &mdash; a.k.a. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">Impulse/Kid Flash</a> &mdash; was named after his grandfather, the second Flash.

</li><li> In stories set in the alternate future of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KingdomCome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KingdomCome">Kingdom Come</a></em>, several of the Titans do this; Tempest's daughter is named Tula after his former lover, Nightwing's daughter is Mar'i after his mother Mary (but with Tamaranean spelling), and Flash's twins are Iris and Barry after his aunt and uncle.
</li><li> In the main DCU, Wally West's daughter is still named Iris, but his son is named after the Golden-Age Flash (although its Jai not Jay) presumably because there was already a Dead Guy Junior for Barry. Funnily enough, neither Jay nor Barry is dead at the moment.

Most notable is the son of Aenys I who Maegor killed, as the only one to have been born when the Conqueror was still alive, although Aegon IV may have been named after his uncle Aegon III. It is unlikely Aegon III was named for his uncle Aegon II, as his mother and uncle were at odds, or that Aegon V was named for his great-grandfather Aegon IV, as he proved to be a horrible king. Viserys II was named after his maternal grandfather/paternal uncle, Aegon II's daughter Jaehaera and Aegon V's son Jaehaerys were named for Jaeherys the Conciliator (The first's great-great-grandfather and the second's great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather), Daeron II for his father's cousin Daeron I, and Maester Aemon was named by his grandfather after his own uncle, the Dragonkight, who may have been his father.

</li><li> Ever wondered why there have been so many kings named Louis in France and George or Edward in Great Britain? (among others...)
<ul><li> Henry is also popular for English/British monarchs. For the record, the most recent kings with these names were Henry VIII, Edward VIII, and George VI. There were also two Edwards and one Henry that apparently don't count in the numbering (Edward the Martyr, Edward the Confessor, and Henry the Young King). There have also been two Edmunds and two Edgars, making "Ed" the clear favorite.
<ul><li> Then there is Edward the Elder, the first of the name (ruled 899-924). (The Kings of Wessex, although ruling a smaller area, are the direct predecessors of the Kings of England.) He was also the cognatic ancestor of all future King Edwards.
</li><li> The unnumbered Eds were all Saxon kings before William I "The Conqueror". The pre-Norman Kings of England are never numbered. Henry the Young King isn't numbered because he was never truly king, being crowned as an associate king to his father, Henry II, but dying before him (he's known as "The Young King" because he wasn't even 30 when he died).
</li><li> It may be worth mentioning that George VI was actually named Albert Frederick Arthur George and was <em>called</em> (by the family) Bertie. He deliberately chose George as his regnal name to emphasize continuity with the reign of his father George V. He was named after his grandfather, though, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, best known as the dead husband of Queen Victoria. George VI was actually born on the anniversary of Prince Albert's death, and his birth is what finally brought Victoria out of mourning, making him a double version, with a dash of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish">Replacement Goldfish</a> to boot.
</li><li> Queen Victoria actually insisted to all nine of her children that <em>every grandchild</em> had to have either Albert (for boys) or Victoria (for girls) as one of their middle names. Since the majority of her grandchildren were born after the death of her husband, all of them who had a middle name of Albert fit this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> A more extreme example is Denmark, which for over five centuries alternated Fredericks and Christians, each named after their grandfathers. Five centuries and counting. They keep naming them that.
</li><li> In The Netherlands, all kings and most Stadtholders were named Willem until the current king, who averts this slightly by being Willem-Alexander instead of Willem IV. The first king (Willem I) was Willem VI before being crowned. There even was a Wilhelmina somewhere down the line, and technically a French guy named, of course, Louis.
</li><li> Taken to its logical extreme by the German princes of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reu%C3%9F">Reu&szlig;<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Since about 1200 every male member of the family has been named <em>Heinrich</em>.
</li><li> How about Hellenistic Egypt, where almost every royal boy was named Ptolemy and every girl was Cleopatra? The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CleopatraVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CleopatraVII">most famous Cleopatra</a> had a mother, sister, and daughter who shared her name, and her father, two brothers, and two sons had the name Ptolemy. Her third son was named Alexander, after Alexander the Great.
</li><li> The Ptolemy princesses who were not named Cleopatra were all named either Berenice or Arsinoe.
</li></ul></li><li> The Romans were wonderfully uncreative in naming their children. Upper-class Roman families had about 2 dozen first names to choose from. To give just one example, the famous Julius Caesar's <em>praenomen</em> (given name, more or less) was Gaius, which he shared with his father and grandfather. And an adopted great-great-grandson better known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">Caligula</a>. This feature can make Roman history just a little confusing.
<ul><li> There's also the interesting little quirk about female naming in Roman society. A daughter's praenomen was the feminine of her father's last name. If the father was named Cornelius, for example, his firstborn daughter would be named Cornelia. If he had a string of daughters they would also be named Cornelia but would receive a second qualifying praenomen of "Secunda" "the second." and so on. This got really complicated when several men named Cornelius all had daughters, so they all got nicknames, like Cornelia Africana, Julia Caesaris or Caecilia Merula.
</li></ul></li><li> Needless to say, this happens in a lot of families. More confusingly, it's not uncommon for children to be named after people who are alive and well, often resulting in six generations in a row of boys called John.
<ul><li> This is something that can often drive genealogists to distraction. But, given our interest in family history, we often do it ourselves. Oops.
</li><li> Mix-and-match variations on the same first and middle names cut down on the confusion somewhat. However, having a Christopher, a Christian, a Kristina, and a Crystal (for example) who are all first cousins, all respond to "Chris", and are about the same age is confusing for everyone.
</li><li> Years ago when infant mortality was high, it was common for parents to name a child after that child's deceased brother or sister. If a girl named Anne died as a baby, then the next daughter born after her death would probably be called Anne. More oddly, some parents gave the same first name to all their sons or daughters, even if the older children were still alive. In the nineteenth century it wasn't unheard of for two or more sisters to all be called Margaret, and to go by nicknames or middle names to distinguish them. This can cause endless confusion when researching one's ancestors and discovering that one's great-great-great-great-grandparents had, for example, four sons named John...
</li></ul></li><li> A tragic case in the documentary <em>Boy Interrupted</em>: The director's fifteen-year-old son Evan Scott Perry was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a> by mental illness. Evan was apparently named in honor of the director's brother Scott, who was also driven to suicide by mental illness about 10 years earlier. In a heart-wrenching scene, Evan is buried with his namesake uncle while the elderly mother of the director wonders why her <em>son</em> is dead.
</li><li> In some Italian families, family tradition indicates that the reason Italian families were so big was that they had to have at least two sons - one to be named for each of the parents' fathers. This meant that they had to have at least three sons to be able to introduce a new name.
<ul><li> This is the case for Irish families as well, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">That Other Wiki</a> - "the first son is named after the father's father, the second son after the mother's father, the third son after the father, the first daughter after the mother's mother, the second daughter after the father's mother, the third daughter after the mother."
</li><li> Still very much true among large families in Ireland where it's not uncommon to have several grandchildren sharing their grandfathers and grandmothers name. In fact, due to most Irish names having both a masculine and feminine version this isn't limited by the children's gender. With families tending to be smaller nowadays it's also not uncommon for sons to simply gain their father's name.
<ul><li> This is often invoked with the Confirmation names taken by every Catholic child in Ireland when they are confirmed. Usually, you'll take the name of a saint, or somebody close to you who has died. However, because a lot of Irish people are named after saints, especially the older generation, it often ends up being both.

</li><li> It's a common practice among Ashkenazi Jews to name babies after deceased relatives (while Sephardi Jews prefer living relatives). This honors the memory of the deceased, provides them a spiritual connection with the new child and &mdash; one hopes &mdash; inspires the kid with the relatives' virtues. Historically, it was actually considered bad luck to name a baby after a still-living relative, <em>especially</em> an elderly one, under the belief that it might confuse the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">Angel of Death</a> and get the child taken instead. Some also believe that it's unlucky to use the name of someone who died young (often defined as before sixty), though this is not universal.

</li><li> It's also a common tradition among old Southern families in America, especially give girls their female relatives' maiden names so the family names won't be lost.
<ul><li> Seems to be a not uncommon tradition among old New Englander families in America to give boys their mothers' maiden names for a middle name, especially if their mothers had no brothers.
</li></ul></li><li> Many, many pet owners do this, naming a new pet after one that has just died/become lost.
</li><li> Inuit society used to (and some possibly still do) do this; names were not gender-specific and it was believed the dead were reincarnated in the next birth, so the new baby was named after the last relative to have died.
</li><li> In many Central/Eastern European cultures that don't use patronymics (polish, hungarian, romanian), it's common to name the firstborn, either after a dead grandparent, or directly after the parent. So a firstborn son is likely to be named after his paternal grandfather or father, a firstborn daughter is named after her maternal grandmother or mother, second and later children though, usualy have new names given.
