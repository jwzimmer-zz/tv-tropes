It also managed to more than double its original sales with re-releases. After being rescued by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Funimation">Funimation</a>, its <em>sub-only</em> release was a rather big hit &mdash; enough that its rerelease included an English dub.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Fractale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Fractale">Fractale</a></em>, despite it getting decent to good reviews all around (at least at first), had the misfortune of sharing the same timeslot as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em>. <em>Fractale</em> never stood a chance. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">Creator Breakdown</a> happened partway through production when the creator found out <em>Madoka</em> was trouncing his show, and the quality slipped dramatically from that point onwards.
</li><li> Any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RumikoTakahashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RumikoTakahashi">Rumiko Takahashi</a> series in the West that's not <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma &frac12;</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaisonIkkoku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaisonIkkoku">Maison Ikkoku</a></em>. Often considered to be Takahashi's masterpiece, it received critical acclaim when it was imported, and maintains a devoted fanbase to this day, with a surprising number even still calling it their favorite anime series of all time. However, the series itself, being more of a slice of life coming-of-age comedy, and more realistic than Takahashi's mega hits <em>InuYasha</em> and <em>Ranma &frac12;</em>, failed to find much of an audience in the U.S. Its original VHS releases were cancelled after a handful of volumes, and was only released on DVD when <em>InuYasha</em> took off, where it also bombed (although the whole series was released, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VizMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VizMedia">Viz Media</a> was forced to do very small print runs of later volumes). The series is now out-of-print and very difficult to find. There are some fans campaigning Viz to release the series on Blu-ray after they've successfully released <em>Ranma &frac12;</em> in the format, and Viz hasn't ruled the idea out, but says it will only likely have a chance if <em>Ranma</em>'s sales are very strong. Other industry insiders (such as Justin Servakis) have strong doubt that the series will see the light of day in the U.S. again, despite its critical acclaim and devoted fan following. The manga has it a little bit better. The entire series was re-released in English un-flipped beginning in 2001, a solid 12 years before <em>Ranma</em> was. The series is now out-of-print, but still fairly easy to find on the used book circuit.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UruseiYatsura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UruseiYatsura">Urusei Yatsura</a></em> manga was this for a long time, being a huge bomb for Viz. They only released a handful of issues, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnimEigo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnimEigo">AnimEigo</a> managed to at least release the entire anime TV series subtitled-only, and the movies with dubs. The series has always been well-received (especially the second movie, <em>Beautiful Dreamer</em>), but was, for years, considered too old and long to be considered marketable here. By 2019 (likely coinciding with Takahashi's induction into the Eisner Hall of Fame), Viz had decided to bring back the original manga, with availability in digital and paperback omnibus form.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RumikoTakahashiAnthology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RumikoTakahashiAnthology">Rumiko Takahashi Anthology</a></em> has the dubious distinction of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Geneon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Geneon">Geneon</a>'s worst selling anime ever. <em>Vol. 1</em> sold 300 units on DVD, while <em>Vol. 2</em> sold a mere 80. In comparison, the first 28 <em>InuYasha</em> DVDs sold a <em>million</em> units combined. Nonetheless, hardcore Takahashi fans adore <em>Anthology</em>, and it received very positive reviews from the few non-fans that saw it.
</li></ul></li><li> Slower-paced, non-action anime series like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Kikaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Kikaider">Kikaider</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ParanoiaAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ParanoiaAgent">Paranoia Agent</a></em> have rarely done well in the ratings on American television, regardless of how liked they are by those who watch them. This is because the anime-watching audience in North America is mostly made of teenagers and young adults who come in expecting wild, heart-pounding action. When it turns out to be something else, they often walk away uninterested.
</li><li> Despite having a massive following among those who are already fans of shows like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> has traditionally had a tough time gaining a foothold in English-speaking countries. The manga has become a tentpole for Viz, though not without several years of struggling before it caught up with the Japanese releases and got promoted at conventions. The anime had not found its ground until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami">Toonami</a> run, though it experienced diminishing returns and could only pull in about half the numbers <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceDandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceDandy">Space Dandy</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> received. The reason why <em>One Piece</em> always has to earn its success is simple: The kids, teenagers, and young adults who get into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> do so because they are incredibly Japanese in their premises, art styles, and storytelling (in other words, they look and act like anime, or at least their definition of it<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1agjl');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1agjl" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1agjl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Keep in mind, despite the cultural differences, what we consider "anime" in the West is considered no different from regular Western cartoons in in Japan.</span>), whereas the Western-influenced visual design of <em>One Piece</em> is itself an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceAlienatingPremise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceAlienatingPremise">Audience-Alienating Premise</a> for a lot of anime fans despite having an equally unique premise. In other words, hardcore anime fans find it too "Western and cartoon-y", ironically enough. It didn't help that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macekre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macekre">the original dub</a>, which was produced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment">4Kids Entertainment</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceColoringAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceColoringAdaptation">is the most well known version by far</a>, especially at a critical time when dubs for <em>Naruto</em> and <em>Bleach</em> were gaining ground with Western audiences in prime-time slots. It has gotten better as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation">Funimation</a> dub has gotten more attention, with their uncut DVDs often topping bestselling anime charts, while it has gotten steady recognition on Toonami on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdultSwim">[adult swim]</a>. Unfortunately, <em>One Piece</em> was not able to keep up in the ratings with the other series on Toonami, and in April 2017, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul">Tokyo Ghoul</a></em> took its place.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LupinIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LupinIII">Lupin III</a></em>, once again, in the West. It has a very devoted fanbase, and many attempts have been made to market it in the U.S. However, its success has always been modest at best. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StreamlinePictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StreamlinePictures">Streamline Pictures</a> tried it, AnimEigo tried it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MangaEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MangaEntertainment">Manga Entertainment</a> tried it, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation">Funimation</a> tried it, all unsuccessful. Most notably, Pioneer/Geneon attempted to market the classic Red Jacket TV series from '70s, but it was pulled from Adult Swim after 26 episodes due to poor ratings and the DVD releases stopped at episode 79 (out of 155) due to poor sales. In 2013, FUNimation once again gave it another shot by licensing the TV series, which focused heavily on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Fujiko Mine</a>, with lots of fanservice (which usually sells very well for them). Unfortunately, the sales were still somewhat disappointing. The only company that's been able to make <em>Lupin</em> work has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiscotekMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiscotekMedia">Discotek Media</a>, who has released many <em>Lupin</em> properties to DVD to a small niche audience.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>. FUNimation licensed the series as one of their earliest non-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> shows, and went all out with a big marketing campaign for the series' premiere on Adult Swim. Unfortunately, only about 50 episodes were shown (most of which were in the graveyard time slot) before the plug was pulled. FUNimation made many attempts to resume the series on home video, but only got to episode 130 before calling it quits. They did release six of the theatrical films, which they said sold better than the TV series, and were considering picking up more. However, the series has remained dead in the U.S. despite having a very loyal following and good critical reception from those who have seen the show. However, Viz has continued to publish the manga, though many of the earlier volumes have fallen out of print. Its own popularity in Japan makes it more difficult than most anime to make money overseas because of the higher licensing fees. There's also its questionable target audience. The show is seen as too dark, wordy, and boring for kids, while being too childish and silly for adult audiences, making it very difficult to market in the U.S.

In 2020, the series returned to Disney XD, but with a catch, it only aired on weekend mornings, and the return got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">little to no promotion or fanfare</a>. Eventually, the reruns were dropped in August 2020.
</li><li> The animated adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FromTheNewWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FromTheNewWorld">From the New World</a></em> sold extremely poorly, mainly due to the yuri/yaoi themes, and the fact that it aired shortly before <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheUnlimitedHyoubuKyousuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheUnlimitedHyoubuKyousuke">The Unlimited Hyoubu Kyousuke</a></em> which initially portrayed a similarly bleak atmosphere, but much more action-focused. However, when reading online reviews, one finds that the anime is extremely well liked, and there have even been several signed requests for the original novel to be translated.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimagureOrangeRoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimagureOrangeRoad">Kimagure Orange Road</a></em> is yet another classic manga and anime series (one that had a heavy influence on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a> genre) that has failed to find an audience in the West. While AnimEigo was able to make it work in the U.S. by selling sub only discs to a niche audience, the series is the worst selling anime of all time in the UK. The manga wasn't translated into English until 2014, and was released digital only. However, Digital Manga Publishing <a class="urllink" href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-05-11/digital-manga-kimagure-orange-road-kickstarter-campaign-ends/.101983">launched a successful Kickstarter campaign<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> to re-localize and republish the manga in both digital and paperback formats, giving the series a second chance.

In the U.S., it might be due to the age of these respective shows and American aversion to older anime. There is also the fact that <em>Mobile Suit Gundam</em> didn't get to finish its run on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> due to being pulled from the air immediately after 9/11, although some feel that this was just a convenient excuse for CN to pull a "low ratings" show. <em>Zeta Gundam</em>, although planned for TV airing, instead went straight to DVD. Most seem to chalk it up to the fact that they compared unfavorably to other series such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></em>, which was actually the first <em>Gundam</em> series to air in the U.S. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam">Mobile Fighter G Gundam</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeed">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</a></em> would also be popular in North America and have successful runs. Despite the word of mouth by old-school Western anime fans through early anime fandom efforts, the mainstream viewers were simply unaware of the significance of the original or its sequel and could not look past the age of these two shows.
</li><li> Most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Leijiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Leijiverse">Leijiverse</a> in the United States. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CaptainHarlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CaptainHarlock">Captain Harlock</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GalaxyExpress999" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GalaxyExpress999">Galaxy Express 999</a></em> have had a long history of not being treated with respect by local American dubbers. When the chance came to see these anime uncut for the first time, only longtime anime fans really took notice. For everyone else, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeijiMatsumoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeijiMatsumoto">Leiji Matsumoto</a>'s style is just too old school.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon">Disney Animated Canon</a> has a number of examples.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pinocchio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pinocchio">Pinocchio</a></em> (1940), <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fantasia">Fantasia</a></em> (1940), <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bambi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bambi">Bambi</a></em> (1942), and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SleepingBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SleepingBeauty">Sleeping Beauty</a></em> (1959) are all highly acclaimed classics which failed disastrously at the box office upon their original release (though they did better in re-releases), although partly due to overblown budgets (<em>Sleeping Beauty</em> nearly bankrupted the studio) as much as audience lack of interest. In addition, the first three were released during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, a time when Americans were too busy supporting the war effort to go to the movies (in addition, the entire European cinema market was cut off by the war). The production cost of <em>Sleeping Beauty</em> (an estimated $6 million) reportedly was more than twice as expensive as the production costs of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AliceInWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AliceInWonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a></em> (1951), <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPan">Peter Pan</a></em> (1953) and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LadyAndTheTramp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LadyAndTheTramp">Lady and the Tramp</a></em> (1955). Disney invested in a new film format, the then-innovative Super Technirama 70, and some of the film prints included six-track stereophonic sound (rare for this time). Which only added to the cost. Disney also hired additional staff to work on this film, at a time when the rest of the American animation studios were laying off personnel or considering shutting down operations (due to a drop in profits and competition from television). Also controversial was the part of the budget that went to developing background animation (the film's scenery), which Walt wanted to be fully detailed in a style reminiscent of Italian Renaissance paintings. As Clyde Geronimi (the film's supervising director) complained: "All that beautiful detail in the trees, the bark, and all that, that's all well and good, but who the hell's going to look at that?"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheEmperorsNewGroove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheEmperorsNewGroove">The Emperor's New Groove</a></em> (2000) was very well received but performed at a subpar level at the box office, generally because of Disney's poor marketing efforts. In retrospect, it did not perform too badly, earning $169.3 million at the box office ($89.3m from the United States, and $80m internationally). It turned out a profit. But Disney still considered it disappointing, as it performed worse at the box office that most of their animated films from the 1990s. By comparison, Disney's previous animated feature, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tarzan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tarzan">Tarzan</a></em>, had earned $448.2m worldwide.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TreasurePlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TreasurePlanet">Treasure Planet</a></em> (2002) is another film that had mostly positive reviews from critics, yet it became a major flop at the box office, and merchandise is scarce. Since its release in 2002, however, it has become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic">Cult Classic</a>. In this case, the film actually failed to earn as much as its own budget. It earned a total of $109.6 million from its worldwide box office, and the estimated budget was about $140 million. Part of the film's box-office failure was due to Disney choosing to release it during a particularly "competitive holiday season" (their words prior to the release) where the film would compete against other intended blockbusters. It was overshadowed during its debut weekend by three other films: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieAnotherDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieAnotherDay">Die Another Day</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSantaClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSantaClause">The Santa Clause 2</a></em>. Apparently Harry Potter, James Bond, and Santa Claus had more box-office appeal than Long John Silver.
</li><li> Disney's sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheManyAdventuresOfWinnieThePooh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheManyAdventuresOfWinnieThePooh">The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh</a></em>, simply titled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinnieThePooh2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinnieThePooh2011">Winnie the Pooh</a></em> (2011) is a strange case of this in the Canon. Released to thunderous acclaim (including a 90% <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/RottenTomatoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/RottenTomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> score, which was, at the time, the highest score for any Disney Canon entry since 1994), it only made $50 million worldwide against a $30 million budget. This was most likely a result of the dubious decision to release the film simultaneously with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a> Part II</em>. It actually performed much worse than <em>Treasure Planet</em> (earning about $70 million less). Some of the elements which the critics praised may explain why the audience was not interested. The film was praised (summarizing critics' quotes from Wikipedia): because it was mostly hand-drawn (at a time when hand-drawn animation was considered a relic of the past), because it felt as a nostalgic throwback to an earlier era of animation, because of its lack of "3-D animation and special effects", and because it provided "a nightmare-proof experience for even the youngest viewers" (unlike other Disney films it lacks memorable drama or horror elements). It may appeal to younger audiences, like most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WinnieThePooh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WinnieThePooh">Winnie-the-Pooh</a>, but it lacks elements that would draw in older kids, teenagers, and adults.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeachersPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeachersPet">Teacher's Pet</a></em> (the film) from 2004. Despite poor marketing, critics loved it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSecretOfNIMH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSecretOfNIMH">The Secret of NIMH</a></em> suffered from poor marketing and competition with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ETTheExtraTerrestrial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ETTheExtraTerrestrial">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</a></em>, but was widely acclaimed for its vibrant animation and moving storyline.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CatsDontDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CatsDontDance">Cats Don't Dance</a></em>. Critics loved it, and it even won an Annie Award for Best Animated Film of 1997, but box office numbers were very poor. This is because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a> acquired Turner after production was completed, and worried that the film was going to overshadow other releases they had, put it in a small number of theaters and gave it no promotion outside of toys from Subway and a few children's storybooks. The movie would later go on to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByCable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByCable">Vindicated by Cable</a>, thanks to airing several times during the early 2000s on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIronGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIronGiant">The Iron Giant</a></em> was a financial disaster due to a horrible marketing campaign on Warner Bros' part. However, it picked up a new life on DVD and has become well-known and respected, in part due to Cartoon Network <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByCable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByCable">running 24-hour blocks of it every Thanksgiving</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frankenweenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frankenweenie">Frankenweenie</a></em> has been acclaimed by critics and was a strong contender to win Best Animated Feature at the Oscars (it got the strongest reviews of that year's five contenders), but opened to a disappointing $11 million despite positive reception and a huge marketing campaign. The financial disappointment owes to several factors: an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceAlienatingPremise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceAlienatingPremise">Audience-Alienating Premise</a>, the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids">it's not nearly as kid-friendly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedMarketing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedMarketing">as its marketing suggested</a> and the fact that it opened only <em>a week</em> after the more accessible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelingMovies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelingMovies">Dueling Movie</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HotelTransylvania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HotelTransylvania">Hotel Transylvania</a></em>.

However, due to the decision to make it a theatrical release being rather last-minute, it didn't get much promotion and turned out to be a box-office bomb. It was much more profitable on home media later on and is still highly regarded, with some fans still considering it the best <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> film.

Perhaps it had to do with the fact that though the film was targeted as a PG children's film, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids">much of the humor and storylines were more adult</a> and perhaps also the film's unusual visual style and introspective nature. It is also a stop-motion film, which, despite a growing number of them, have typically had a harder time with families than 2D animation or 3D CGI.

Despite having passed $100 million in the US, it cost double that to make, and it faced competition from the likes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHungerGamesMockingjayPart2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHungerGamesMockingjayPart2">The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Creed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Creed">Creed</a></em> and Disney's own <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens">The Force Awakens</a></em>, which had the (at the time) biggest opening weekend ever.

The total worldwide gross was $306.9 million, but it's considered a box-office failure for DreamWorks since the total gross did not meet the cost of production and advertisement. They ultimately lost $83 million on it. In fact, the losses forced DreamWorks to lay off over three hundred workers.
</li><li> Almost any film from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Laika" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Laika">Laika</a> can be included.

It had no competition with new family films. Its final domestic gross was $16.6 million, with an additional $9.3 million overseas, for a worldwide total of $25.9 million. The film cost <strong>$100 million</strong>, Laika's highest budgeted film thus far. The film then went on to win the 2020 Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature and got nominated for the Academy Awards, as the highlight of a laundry list of critical awards.

Given its inflated budget - $2.5 million, enough to build a naval cruiser at the time - it went down in history as Hollywood's first big failure.

It didn't win "Best Picture" that year, but it was nominated, and it won for "Best Screenplay". A lot of its early misfortune is due to the powerful media mogul William Randolph Hearst, whom the film was partly based on, refusing to give publicity and actively suppressing it, actually preventing cinemas from showing it.

It was well-received by critics and those who saw it. It even snagged a few Oscar nominations (winning for Best Original Song and Best Original Score). However, it lost money in its initial release and didn't begin to recoup its large budget until it was reissued a decade later. It wasn't until the 1950s, when it became a staple of television showings, that it became the classic it is today.

</li><li> PJ Hogan's live-action <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PeterPan">Peter Pan</a></em> did poorly, likely due to opening only a week after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheReturnOfTheKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheReturnOfTheKing">The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</a></em> and on the same day as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CheaperByTheDozen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CheaperByTheDozen">Cheaper by the Dozen</a></em>.

But, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert">Roger Ebert</a> admitted in his review, kids were hyped up for flashier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummerBlockbuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummerBlockbuster">Summer Blockbuster</a> fare like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanForever">Batman Forever</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MightyMorphinPowerRangersTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MightyMorphinPowerRangersTheMovie">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: The Movie</a></em>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Casper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Casper">Casper</a></em> and Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pocahontas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pocahontas">Pocahontas</a></em> were getting a lot of hype too, and with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlShowGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlShowGhetto">Girl-Show Ghetto</a> working against it on top of all that, the film died at the box office. Warner Bros. was encouraged by the positive responses from those who saw the film, to the point that they brought it back to theaters later that summer (look at the poster at its <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Little_Princess_(1995_film)">Wikipedia page<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>) in hopes that families would respond to the raves, but that proved completely futile. This was because <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Babe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Babe">Babe</a></em>, another hit with critics, had become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit">Sleeper Hit</a> with those families by that point.
<ul><li> Cuar&oacute;n later had another one with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChildrenOfMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChildrenOfMen">Children of Men</a></em>, also adapting a book, but this time a very bleak science fiction. Deeming it a possible awards contender (and indeed it was, scoring three Oscar noms, including Adapted Screenplay), Universal pushed it from September, when it opened internationally and also failed to perform, to December, when it was blown by more family-friendly fare such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightAtTheMuseum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightAtTheMuseum">Night at the Museum</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePursuitOfHappyness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePursuitOfHappyness">The Pursuit of Happyness</a></em>. <a class="urllink" href="https://bombreport.com/yearly-breakdowns/2006-3/children-of-men/">Analysts added<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that the studio didn't have a clear marketing strategy and thus audience awareness was really low.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlmostFamous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlmostFamous">Almost Famous</a></em> was one of the best-reviewed films of 2000 (Roger Ebert called it the best film of that year), its script won the Oscar, and even today is considered a benchmark of making films about rock music. Financially, the film barely made half its $60 million budget (even after foreign totals, it still failed to break even), due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSells">misleading print campaign</a> that put <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KateHudson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KateHudson">Kate Hudson</a>'s supporting character front and center and possibly due to handing director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CameronCrowe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CameronCrowe">Cameron Crowe</a> such a large budget for a niche-appealed premise.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DonnieDarko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DonnieDarko">Donnie Darko</a></em> was well-received, but did poorly in cinemas. This was in part due to it receiving a limited theatrical run owing to its subject matter, coming out almost immediately after 9/11. It's a definite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic">Cult Classic</a> these days.

Limiting initial release to only 7 cities and capping out at 130 theaters hurt.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rogue">Rogue</a></em>, starring a then-unknown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamWorthington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamWorthington">Sam Worthington</a>, was said by the few critics that saw it to be surprisingly good for a film about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever">a giant crocodile</a> and a fine horror/adventure flick in its own right.

It flopped and made a measly $15m, about half of its budget, and only received nominations for Best Supporting Actor and Cinematography, winning neither.

The release of two blockbusters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier">Captain America: The Winter Soldier</a></em> (also produced under the Disney family) and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Noah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Noah">Noah</a></em> in the two weeks following also hurt.

The film was not helped by a very abstract and symbolic plot that may have driven potential viewers away &minus; and also the fact that the trailers sold the film as a classic home-invasion thriller, or that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferLawrence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferLawrence">Jennifer Lawrence</a> had made some controversial statements that hurt her popularity with conservatives.

Regardless, the film retains a high critical approval rating, received an "A-" CinemaScore despite its "challenging" nature (which many box office pundits cited as a reason for its failure), and was nominated for five Oscars, winning two (in technical categories). It did not do particularly well internationally either, notably bombing in China when it opened against <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Geostorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Geostorm">Geostorm</a></em>. In an odd case, though it earned more on its opening weekend, it actually <em>lost</em> its first weekend in Japan to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KiraKiraPrecureALaMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KiraKiraPrecureALaMode">Kirakira&#9733;PreCure a la Mode</a></em> film. <em>2049</em> eventually grossed $259.2 million worldwide, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/blade-runner-2049-losses-could-hit-80-million-producer-alcon-1055855">making an estimated $80 million loss<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thoroughbreds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thoroughbreds">Thoroughbreds</a></em> was a cheap indie that cost less than $6 million, but it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheShelfOfMovieLanguishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheShelfOfMovieLanguishment">took almost two years to finally come out</a>, made obvious by the fact that one of its stars, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AntonYelchin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AntonYelchin">Anton Yelchin</a>, was killed in a tragic accident just two weeks after filming wrapped. The film received a positive response at Sundance but was largely overshadowed by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GetOut2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GetOut2017">Get Out</a></em>, another thriller that unexpectedly went onto win an Oscar. It was finally released to select theaters in March 2018 to very positive reviews, but it failed to expand outside limited release and didn't even cross $3 million at the box office. Fans harbor hope that it might find a cult audience through TV and video, much like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Heathers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Heathers">Heathers</a></em>.
</li><li> <em>The Hate U Give</em> received glowing reviews and an "A+" CinemaScore, with critics praising lead actress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmandlaStenberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmandlaStenberg">Amandla Stenberg</a>'s performance, and for being a rare YA novel adaptation without any fantastical or romantic elements. However, it only made $29.4 million out of a $23m budget.
</li><li> Back when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson">Dwayne Johnson</a> was not an established actor, his film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRundown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRundown">The Rundown</a></em> failed at making back its budget, but it gained a remarkably high 70% on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/RottenTomatoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/RottenTomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, infinitely better than anybody would have expected.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Suspiria2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Suspiria2018">Suspiria</a></em> received positive reviews from critics but its $20 million budget wasn't even made back halfway. Domestic: $2,483,472. Worldwide: $7,940,485. The film opened in the midst of a very competitive October; debuting at number 25 amid competition from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Halloween2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Halloween2018">Halloween (2018)</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Venom2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Venom2018">Venom (2018)</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AStarIsBorn2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AStarIsBorn2018">A Star Is Born (2018)</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Slither" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Slither">Slither</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesGunn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesGunn">James Gunn</a>'s first film as a director and writer, was heavily praised back in 2006 for its unique blend of horror, gore, and comedy (86% Tomatometer!), yet sadly only made $12.8 million on a $15 million dollar budget. It's since become a cult classic.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKidWhoWouldBeKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKidWhoWouldBeKing">The Kid Who Would Be King</a></em> had uninspiring advertisements, a release in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpMonths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpMonths">Dump Months</a>, and the terrible luck of following two bad attempts at modernizing old legends in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingArthurLegendOfTheSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingArthurLegendOfTheSword">King Arthur: Legend of the Sword</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RobinHood2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RobinHood2018">Robin Hood (2018)</a></em>. So what a surprise it was when upon release the film gathered widespread praise (its Rotten Tomatoes score stands at 89%) - but not that it made little over half of its moderate $59 million budget, the studio anticipating a $50 million loss on the movie.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikeFlanagan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikeFlanagan">Mike Flanagan</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoctorSleep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoctorSleep">Doctor Sleep</a></em>, a sequel to the legendary horror film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShining">The Shining</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanleyKubrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanleyKubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a>, was by and large seen as a worthy sequel to the original film as well as a faithful adaptation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctorSleep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctorSleep">original novel</a>, despite its changes from the source and managed please both camps of Kubrick and King. However, the film failed to recoup its 45-55 million dollar budget, making only 31 million domestically and 72 million worldwide. As to reasons why it failed, the cause is believed to be the unfamiliarity of younger moviegoers with the source material and the film's long running time. However, it managed to debut at a pretty healthy position in the DVD market, which even has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectorsCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectorsCut">Director's Cut</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackDynamite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackDynamite">Black Dynamite</a></em> did really well in the festival circuit, even winning the Seattle International Film Festival's best picture winner that year (which beat out fellow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcclaimedFlop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcclaimedFlop">Acclaimed Flop</a> and eventual Best Picture Oscar winner The Hurt Locker at the same festival), but due to a relatively new distributor picking it up, it flopped in theaters, closing just short of $300k on a $2.9 million budget and closed after two weeks. Luckily the film found its eventual cult following on DVD and eventually got a show on Adult Swim.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KillerJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KillerJoe">Killer Joe</a></em> was seen by many critics as a great dark comedy with a career redefining performance by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewMcConaughey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewMcConaughey">Matthew McConaughey</a>, but could only make $2 million on its $10 million dollar budget. The biggest factor in the film flopping was the film's NC-17 rating which meant most theaters refused to screen the film.

</li><li> The miniseries <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MartinLutherKingJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MartinLutherKingJr">King</a></em> was nominated for nine Emmy awards and won much acclaim for its star Paul Winfield but was a rating disaster when first aired.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3idwk');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3idwk" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3idwk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The first part finished dead last in the weekly ratings.</span>
</li><li> The Fox show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em> started this way at first, possibly because it came on so soon after 9/11 and no one really wanted to see a show like that in the wake of a real terrorist attack. However, word of mouth eventually made it a popular series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment">Arrested Development</a></em> consistently garnered just enough audience to keep it afloat, but barely managed to raise itself above the bottom of the rating ladder for three straight seasons. It was a critical darling from the word "Go", and its core fanbase is rabid. Seven years following cancellation, fan demand got a fourth season made for early 2016. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em> episode "With Friends Like Steve's" lampshaded this when Francine compares Steve's boredom with Stan to America's reaction to <em>Arrested Development</em>: "It's not bad, but it failed because it wasn't universally loved like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em> was virtually ignored on its first broadcast, but its reputation among television commentators as one of the best shows ever made has become something of a meme.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FreaksAndGeeks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FreaksAndGeeks">Freaks and Geeks</a></em> only lasted one season. It was beloved by those who saw it from the beginning. TV critics were so engaged with it they often ranked it highly in their "best of the 00s" lists, with only 12 of its 18 episodes airing in that decade.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheTick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheTick">The Tick</a></em> had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTick">somewhat successful Saturday morning cartoon</a> at FOX that inspired the network to attempt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTick2001" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTick2001">a live-action series</a> that aired in the early 2000s; critics loved it, but audiences didn't respond as well and it got canceled after the eighth episode of nine aired. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTick2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTick2016">The Amazon Prime revival a decade later</a> managed to avert it.

But between poor production choices, bad scheduling, and low ratings, the series never took off and was canceled halfway through its second season, with its last episodes being released solely on DVD and later on Netflix.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PoliceSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PoliceSquad">Police Squad!</a></em>: Its flop was because it couldn't be watched casually. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGoldfish">Viewers had to pay active attention to catch the jokes</a>. Keep in mind it aired in 1982 when the VCR was still a luxury item, so it was a yeoman's effort to get the references. In addition, the producers were actually grateful the network canceled them so soon: they felt they were running out of material as it was and weren't confident they could manage a full season.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Awake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Awake">Awake</a></em> suffered truly abysmal ratings, even for NBC, but was endlessly praised by TV critics, and unlike earlier shows with similar ratings in its time slot, aired its entire season.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em> is beloved by its fans, and was also perpetually on the verge of a cancellation throughout its entire run. Lack of promotion and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">scheduling shenanigans by the network</a> certainly didn't help, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">behind-the-scenes conflict</a> between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChevyChase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChevyChase">Chevy Chase</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanHarmon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanHarmon">Dan Harmon</a> (which resulted in an entire season <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheCreatorDoesItRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyTheCreatorDoesItRight">produced without Harmon</a> which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">most fans would prefer to forget</a>) didn't help either, but more than anything, the show is simply a niche product whose humor tended to be more challenging than lighter, more accessible fare.
</li><li> HBO's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Enlightened" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Enlightened">Enlightened</a></em> earned <em>terrible</em> ratings, averaging less than half a million viewers for each of its respective seasons. Despite this, its second season was universally praised as one of the greatest pieces of television in 2013 (with the AV Club even naming it the best show of the year, over the final season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad">Breaking Bad</a></em>).

<ul><li> The satirical news show <em>De Ideale wereld</em>. Critics have given it lots of awards, but it had very low rating numbers (around 200.000). The fact that the television network that airs it airs it late at night may have something to do with that, aside from the fact that it is not the traditional fare of that network. Over the years it however got increasing viewership and peaked at 400.000.
</li><li> <em>2013</em> is one of the lowest viewed and most obscure things the network put out, but it tied in with the above for the award. The people themselves were really glad to have the award because the show had a really low viewership.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PartyOfFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PartyOfFive">Party of Five</a></em> was never a rating hit, and was canceled after its first season, only to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled">Un-Canceled</a> when it was the surprise winner of the Golden Globe for Best Drama. It had its loyal fans, was a critical favorite, and it lasted a decent six seasons, but the show peaked at #56 in the ratings. In 1995, TV Guide named it "The best show you're not watching." It went on to have an unsuccessful spinoff and is currently best known for launching the careers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeveCampbell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeveCampbell">Neve Campbell</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaceyChabert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaceyChabert">Lacey Chabert</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferLoveHewitt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferLoveHewitt">Jennifer Love Hewitt</a>.

However, it was never a rating hit, was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">Screwed by the Network</a>, and was canceled after its third season, not resolving its story, with the last four episodes supposedly requiring product placement to even get produced. Fans organized a campaign to help change NBC's mind but to no avail. A 12-minute epilogue <em>was</em> quickly put together, but it wasn't screened until 2013.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HillStreetBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HillStreetBlues">Hill Street Blues</a></em> received plenty of critical acclaim and loads of awards during its original run, and today it is widely considered <em>the</em> best <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopShow">Cop Show</a> of its era, and a huge influence on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomicideLifeOnTheStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomicideLifeOnTheStreet">Homicide: Life on the Street</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em>. At the same time, it consistently received mediocre-to-poor overall ratings during its original run. It still ran for an impressive seven seasons, though not really due to the goodwill of network executives who were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt">Doing It for the Art</a>. The audience it <em>did</em> get consisted to a great extent of young, affluent professionals &mdash; i.e., <em>exactly</em> the type of people advertisers wanted to reach.
</li><li> Spanish crime drama <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ElCaso" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ElCaso">El Caso</a></em> was adored by critics and developed a relatively small but devoted fanbase. It got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">Screwed by the Network</a>, with TVE scheduling it on an overly competitive Tuesday night timeslot and refusing to move it despite its poor ratings performance. The series got shut down after one season, with right-wing TVE execs allegedly feeling uncomfortable about the show being set in the 1960s Spain.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrRobot">Mr. Robot</a></em>: You'd never know it from the critical acclaim, but the show had surprisingly low ratings. The ratings for Season 2 dipped substantially below one million viewers per episode, putting it well behind other USA Network shows as <em>Chrisley Knows Best</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CrazyExGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CrazyExGirlfriend">Crazy Ex-Girlfriend</a></em> received acclaim from both critics and audiences in addition to a large number of awards, but finished <em>dead last</em> in Network TV ratings for two years in a row. In fact, one of the reasons it managed to last for so long was because it kept winning award after award, and CW thought it would strengthen its own reputation by having such an acclaimed show in its schedule, though it couldn't keep at it forever, so when Season 4 was confirmed, it was also confirmed it'd be the show's last.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Girls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Girls">Girls</a></em> was beloved by critics but got abysmally low ratings for much of its run (averaging less than a million viewers per episode).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PushingDaisies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PushingDaisies">Pushing Daisies</a></em> was praised by critics from the moment it first aired, with its pilot episode singled out as one of the best of the 2007-08 television season. Despite the acclaim, the ratings for its first season never really stabilized before it ended abruptly as a result of the 2007 writers' strike. When the show came back for its second season 10 months later, the critics still loved the show, but the ratings for the premiere were very low; They never recovered, resulting in the show's cancellation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a></em> generally has two metrics that measure a season's success: The ratings and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">toy sales</a>. So a season that does well in the former, but not the latter will generally be considered this.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MiraiSentaiTimeranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MiraiSentaiTimeranger">Mirai Sentai Timeranger</a></em> is commonly regarded as a classic among older fans. But among the target demographic of children, the show didn't do quite as well, owing to things from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">incredibly dark story</a> to the theme song difficult to sing along to. As a result, the toy sales for the show were among the worst in the series' 40+ year run, despite the ratings being generally good. Strangely, the series immediately after <em>Timeranger</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HyakujuuSentaiGaoranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HyakujuuSentaiGaoranger">Hyakujuu Sentai Gaoranger</a></em>, ended up being the exact opposite, with its toy sales being so huge it practically influenced the series' direction for the next ten years.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KaitouSentaiLupinrangerVsKeisatsuSentaiPatranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KaitouSentaiLupinrangerVsKeisatsuSentaiPatranger">Kaitou Sentai Lupinranger VS Keisatsu Sentai Patranger</a></em> ended up generating a lot of ratings and social media buzz during its run and far better received than its predecessor, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UchuSentaiKyuranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UchuSentaiKyuranger">Uchu Sentai Kyuranger</a></em>. It was even nominated for a Galaxy Award. But merch-wise, the show was a complete and utter bomb, generating sales figures that weren't far away from the above mentioned <em>Timeranger</em>, and caused some panic about the future of the brand itself.
</li><li> Another bizarre occurrence is that typically less well-received seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a></em> tend to get the best praise when adapted into American's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em>. The counterpart series for Timeranger, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTimeForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTimeForce">Power Rangers Time Force</a></em> is a perpetual fan favorite, while the following season <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersWildForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersWildForce">Power Rangers Wild Force</a></em> took a step back... <em>Time Force</em> followed a largely similar story but had a much better final villain and one of the catchiest theme songs outside of "Go Go Power Rangers" and the season's Pink Ranger is normally considered one of the staple characters to see a return in crossover media that isn't Tommy Oliver. On the other side, <em>Wild Force</em> wasn't seen as an impressive show largely due to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> tones as well as a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughActToFollow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughActToFollow">Tough Act to Follow</a>.

And yet, thus far, the only album they've released that has achieved Platinum certification is 1999's <em>Things Fall Apart</em>, and even that took nearly <em>fourteen years</em> after release to reach that milestone. Meanwhile, except for 2002's <em>Phrenology</em>, none of their other albums have even reached Gold certification yet.
</li><li> Singer/songwriter <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NicoleAtkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NicoleAtkins">Nicole Atkins</a>. Her 2007 debut <em>Neptune City</em> was heavily acclaimed by music critics, with some even predicting she would become the "next big thing" in pop. But <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">an unexpected delay in the album's release</a> along with its resulting underpromotion by her then-label Columbia Records quickly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">doomed</a> the album to low sales (it didn't even chart on the Billboard 200) and almost complete neglect by End of Year lists despite how well reviewed it was. The following years were equally unkind to Atkins: her backing band "The Black Sea" left her in 2009. She released two more studio albums that were well received by critics but performed poorly sales-wise. And in 2012, her home city of Neptune, New Jersey was hit by Hurricane Sandy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BigStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BigStar">Big Star</a>'s first two records, <em>#1 Record</em> and <em>Radio City</em>, were both acclaimed and respected by critics when they were released, but their label (Ardent Records, which was owned by Stax Records) having difficulties in marketing the band and distribution problems with Columbia Records in 1974 meant that their records did not sell well. Their catalog was later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">Vindicated by History</a> after being cited by several influential bands as one of the pioneers of both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPop">Power Pop</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeRock">Alternative Rock</a>.

Unfortunately, while the album is widely considered to be an underground classic among rap and hip hop fans (even being listed as one of <em>The Source</em>'s "100 Best Rap Albums" in 1998), it sold very poorly. It debuted at #179 on the Billboard 200 and then immediately dropped off the charts. Nonetheless, its influence on underground hip hop (most notably The Roots - who, coincidentally, are also listed on this page) is undeniable.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanMorrison">Van Morrison</a>'s <em>Astral Weeks</em> is widely regarded as his best, but sold a small number of copies when it came out. On the other hand, it has continued to sell steadily ever since its release, and it has never been out of print. One reviewer, Andrew Ford, commented, "<em>Astral Weeks</em> will sell as many copies this year as it did in 1968 and has every year in-between". It finally went gold in 2001.

As a result, <em>Paul's Boutique</em>, while getting good reviews, was a commercial failure when it was released. However, it set the tone for the group's later work, which enjoyed more success. Eventually, the album began to be regarded as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">a rap masterpiece</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmashingPumpkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmashingPumpkins">The Smashing Pumpkins</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Adore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Adore">Adore</a></em> was highly acclaimed by critics from the day of its release, but its sales were disappointing by the band's standards (as of May 2005, it had only sold 1.1 million copies in the U.S.). It seems to be a case of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">Vindicated by History</a> as Pitchfork has commented that the album is cited as "underrated" so often that this can no longer be the case.

Unfortunately, despite its positive reception, the album stalled out at #16 on the Billboard 200 and sold less than her debut album, which <a class="urllink" href="http://noisey.vice.com/blog/why-did-carly-rae-jepsens-emotion-flop-commercially">music outlets were quick to notice<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

Unfortunately, Capcom closed their pinball division before the game was released, and only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkToTheRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkToTheRescue">the intervention of Gene Cunningham and Illinois Pinball Inc.</a> saved it from total obscurity with a production run of 191 tables.
</li><li> Look at some top 50 lists for pinball, and you will see a number of them from the late '90s: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/MedievalMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/MedievalMadness">Medieval Madness</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/CactusCanyon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/CactusCanyon">Cactus Canyon</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/MonsterBash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/MonsterBash">Monster Bash</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/NoGoodGofers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/NoGoodGofers">No Good Gofers</a></em>, and sometimes <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/NBAFastbreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/NBAFastbreak">NBA Fastbreak</a></em>. These machines only had production runs of about 1,000 (compare to the 4,000 to 10,000 copies most other non-boutique releases get, with breakout successes reaching 15,000 or more). This is because pinball was on a nosedive in public popularity, with few people interested in playing pinball and even fewer operators, proportionally speaking, who wanted to buy these machines. Although pinball would receive a revival in the 2010s, pinball was largely seen as pass&eacute; during the late '90s, and with repeated financial failures of these highly-acclaimed machines, Williams and Bally would both stop making pinball machines in 1999.
</li><li> <em>Jolly Park</em> is the top-rated pinball machine designed in Spain, but its manufacturer, Spinball SA, was on its deathbed when production began due to a series of flops of less-well-received machines. Spinball did not have the resources to do anything other than manufacturing about 250 of these machines, then go bankrupt. This includes any sort of promotion, becoming a victim of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleAdvertising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleAdvertising">Invisible Advertising</a> by necessity. As a result, very few people had heard of it, even among pinball fans in Spain. It was rediscovered many years later when they started appearing at pinball shows in Europe and North America, and the presence of one creates lines to go play it due to its near-legendary status among some.

Far fewer can do the same about his previous work, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Infinity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Infinity">Infinity</a></em> series, which receives the same level of acclaim from the extremely low number of people who <em>know</em> about it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SleepingDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SleepingDogs">Sleeping Dogs</a></em> was met with lukewarm sales taking a year to reach one million only after the game was heavily discounted, but was hit among critics. Most who hadn't played it saw it as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em> set in Hong Kong. The game focuses more on martial arts rather than gunplay and features light free-running through the city. However, sales weren't so bad for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SquareEnix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SquareEnix">Square Enix</a> to rule out a potential sequel.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em>. It didn't catch on when it came out in America, but the cult following grew greatly since. Most dedicated fans have played the game on emulators, since official copies are both rare and expensive, and the game was never re-released outside of Japan until 2013 when it was announced it would be coming to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU">Wii U</a> Virtual Console.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MadWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MadWorld">MadWorld</a></em> was loved by critics, but had terrible sales.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Vanquish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Vanquish">Vanquish</a></em>.

However, it was beloved enough to get a port to PC/Mac/Linux.

For those who got it, it's a shame it's widely unknown. Doesn't help either that it ended on a cliffhanger.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Klonoa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Klonoa">Klonoa</a>: Door to Phantomile</em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> received glowing reviews from critics but bombed at retail for being mistaken as a kiddy.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JetSetRadio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JetSetRadio">Jet Set Radio</a></em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBusting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBusting">platform-rollerblading-graffiti</a> game for the Dreamcast, was extremely well-received and won several awards but didn't sell well even among games for the unsuccessful platform. <em>Jet Set Radio Future</em> for Xbox suffered the same fate, even when it was packaged with the system.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenII">Suikoden II</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBetterSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBetterSequel">Even Better Sequel</a> to the first <em>Suikoden</em>, was also a bomb, but certainly not for lack of quality; it is considered by many who have played it to be one of the best RPGs ever.

Speaking of the former, <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> had stylistically redefined the genre with its big-budget, cinematic 3D visuals just two years earlier, and <em>Suikoden II</em>, which stuck to the isometric 2D of its predecessor, looked extremely outdated by comparison, as practically every other major RPG was following the charge led by the new generation of <em>Final Fantasy</em>. The game did become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic">Cult Classic</a> within the next couple of years and would fetch massive sums on eBay.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile">Valkyrie Profile</a></em> was an initial stateside flop due to it being a late-era PlayStation release, receiving a meager marketing push from Enix, and just being too unique for its own good. It did gain a following, and similar to <em>Suikoden II</em> above, become valuable on the aftermarket, but thankfully it received a port on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationPortable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationPortable">PlayStation Portable</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile2Silmeria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile2Silmeria">two</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfileCovenantOfThePlume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfileCovenantOfThePlume">follow-ups</a>.

After being re-released by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GOGDotCom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GOGDotCom">GOG.com</a>, it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByCable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByCable">took the top position</a> in their bestselling list and doesn't tend to stray far from it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire">Jade Empire</a></em> sold far less than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic</a></em> and any of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare">BioWare</a>'s later original IPs, despite some heavy praise from reviews.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shantae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shantae">Shantae</a></em> sold poorly due to being one of the last games released on the Game Boy Color, but was well-received by both critics and players (though it would do much better when it was released on the 3DS Virtual Console). Its sequel, <em>Risky's Revenge</em>, suffered a similar fate and it wouldn't be until the third game that the series found financial success.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheNeverhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheNeverhood">The Neverhood</a></em>, an adventure game animated entirely in claymation, was released around the time adventure games were going out of style.

But it gained critical acclaim and a cult following among fans regardless. Since being put on the <em>Rare Replay</em> compilation, it has sold better on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxOne">Xbox One</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleKingsStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleKingsStory">Little King's Story</a></em> received critical acclaim, many reviewers considering it to be on the same level of quality as some of Nintendo's first-party titles, yet nearly no one brought it. The kiddy presentation hurt despite the game being quite dark in places. The developers seem to have realized this because the remake for Vita uses a typical RPG/anime art style.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleZone1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleZone1998">BattleZone</a></em> (the 1998 FPS/RTS version) was loved by videogame magazine critics, but failed to make an impression in the marketplace. The sequel, <em>Battlezone II: Combat Commander</em>, likewise failed to sell, though it was received less warmly partly because its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn">Scenery Porn</a> was the cause of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">poor performance</a> and partly because the gameplay was slowed down in favor of more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift">RTS elements</a>.
</li><li> <em>Cornerstone</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Infocom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Infocom">Infocom</a>'s attempt to enter the business-software market, generally got good reviews, but sold very poorly, in part because of a general economic-downturn at the time of release.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PanzerDragoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PanzerDragoon">Panzer Dragoon</a></em> series, especially its RPG outing, <em>Panzer Dragoon Saga</em>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BurningRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BurningRangers">Burning Rangers</a></em>, another Saturn exclusive. It was released when the console was nearing its end in America and Europe. While it was a success in Japan, it was a commercial failure in other countries. American or European copies usually go for $75-100 on eBay, while Japanese copies can be found for about $15-30.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfParadise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfParadise">Kingdom of Paradise</a></em>, despite gorgeous graphics and relatively high ratings by critics, faced underwhelming sales. It remains a hidden gem in the world of gaming.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SteelBattalion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SteelBattalion">Steel Battalion</a></em> was a game that was produced with skepticism and launched with little advertising. The game includes an extremely complex controller that puts the price tag at a ridiculous $200. It was also made for Japan but released on an American console (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox">Xbox</a>). However, the game was groundbreaking in terms of its simulation abilities, and easily well ahead of its time. So much so that a cult following still apparently maintains the multiplayer expansion even after Microsoft ended Xbox Live.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendaryStarfy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendaryStarfy">The Legendary Starfy</a></em> in America. It got very good reviews and has a dedicated following, but sold poorly. In Japan, it sold better, but not as well as the other 4 <em>Starfy</em> games, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">are Japan-exclusive</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalAnnihilationKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalAnnihilationKingdoms">Total Annihilation: Kingdoms</a></em> is considered as one of the best RTS games next to its predecessor <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalAnnihilation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalAnnihilation">Total Annihilation</a></em>, even though it didn't sell much.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpecOpsTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpecOpsTheLine">Spec Ops: The Line</a></em> was universally praised for its writing, but sold poorly due to advertisements <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTrustATrailer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTrustATrailer">portraying it as a generic modern warfare third-person shooter</a>.

It hurts that the message of the game is "stop playing", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">which fans sometimes mention when talking about the game</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gladius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gladius">Gladius</a></em> was universally praised at release; it was even called the best Xbox game nobody played.

This is mainly because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sega" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sega">Sega</a> released it as an Xbox exclusive outside of Japan and Europe since video game developers ended production on Dreamcast games in America at this time. Most Xbox owners only cared about shooters and sports games, and <em>Shenmue 2</em> was neither of those, thus the sequel suffered from horrible sales, and it ended on an unresolved cliffhanger that was never resolved due to Yu Suzuki leaving Sega, and Sega not having enough of a budget to make a third game due to losing so much money on both games. Suzuki had to rely on Kickstarter to get the third game off the ground.
</li><li> Most of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Suda51" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Suda51">Suda51</a>'s non-licensed games have dedicated followings and are admired for their audacity.

Preceding <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Madworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Madworld">Madworld</a></em>, it was an M-rated Wii exclusive and came under fire from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a>.

While it was one of the biggest <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em> games and received glowing reviews, it sold poorly overseas due to the fact that it was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationPortable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationPortable">PSP</a> exclusive. This was averted once it was a part of the <em>HD Collection</em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360">Xbox 360</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3">PlayStation 3</a>, where it sold much better.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario">Paper Mario</a></em> was not a good seller when it came out, despite abundant marketing, a lot of good reviews, and the established popularity of Mario as Nintendo's mascot. This is because it was released on the Nintendo 64's last days, when people were hyped about the GameCube and games like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosMelee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosMelee">Super Smash Bros.

It was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">Vindicated by History</a> several years later, thanks in part to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor">its sequel</a> managing to fill said shoes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">making fans much more appreciative of the series</a>, and until the Nintendo eShop re-released it digitally, copies of <em>Paper Mario</em> remained at their original selling price of US$50 or higher.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreeSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreeSpace">FreeSpace</a> 2</em>, to the point where it was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreKiller">Genre-Killer</a> &mdash; because if a game that well-received still couldn't sell <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceOpera">the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimulationGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimulationGame">genre</a>, what could?

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastExpress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastExpress">The Last Express</a></em> received high praise for its writing, character development, and intricate-yet-flexible storyline, but the game only sold 100,000 copies, 1 million short of breaking even.

Despite the praise the games received, none of them ever managed to crack even a million sales. Out of all the pre-<em>Awakening</em> games, the most blatant example was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThracia776" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThracia776">Fire Emblem: Thracia 776</a></em>.

Reviews on the other hand praised the game highly with all-around good scores.

It also released on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU">Wii U</a> relatively late in its life cycle when the little momentum the system managed to pick up had slowed down. Then it got exported to the West and suffered some <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjWqCHPZ0w/">heavy censorship in its localization,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> which worsened its already spotty reputation among gamers. Not helping matters was the lack of dub and the localized version having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleAdvertising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleAdvertising">Invisible Advertising</a> just like the Japanese version. It ended up selling even fewer copies. Both Japanese and Western critics, however, had very good things to say about it. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> for the successful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Nintendo Switch</a> aimed to breathe new life to the game, but it using the censored western version as its base killed off that possibility. It didn't help that the Switch version also wasn't dubbed for markets outside Japan.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Metroid</a></em> series is sometimes said to be one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo">Nintendo</a>'s "Big Three" alongside <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Mario</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">Zelda</a></em>, due to having similar high critical acclaim and influence as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a> (in <em>Metroid</em>'s case, for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metroidvania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metroidvania">Metroidvania</a> genre) in the gaming industry. However, despite being one of the company's longest-running franchises, it is also one of its weakest, with only a third of the games in the series surpassing one million copies sold. The installment that got hit the most with this was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime2Echoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime2Echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a></em>, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/01/14/prime-outperforms-echoes">whose launch sales got dwarfed by its predecessor<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> thanks to, among other reasons, being released the same month as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2">Halo 2</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DJHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DJHero">DJ Hero</a></em> was unsurprisingly unsuccessful, coming out at a time when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhythmGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhythmGame">Rhythm Game</a> fad was on the way out, right before the early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">New Tens</a> resurgence of electronic music (one has to wonder how well it would have sold if it had come out <em>after</em> said resurgence). Coupled with the game's difficulty curve, the general unpopularity of DJ music in general, and costing twice the price of a standard retail game due to the turntable controller, nobody was shocked when the game's sales weren't up to snuff. Despite this, the game was well-received by the people who did play it, praising the unique remixes the game incorporated and how original it was compared to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionPackSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionPackSequel">Mission Pack Sequels</a> music games.

However, between poor marketing and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationAgeGhetto">Animation Age Ghetto</a>, it tanked.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoneHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoneHome">Gone Home</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">went back and forth</a> on this after release. The game was a massive critical darling and enjoyed an early burst of strong sales when positive reviews came out, but once the heavy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalDissonance">Critical Dissonance</a> surrounding the game set in it rapidly vanished from charts and seemed destined to have mediocre lifetime sales. However, this appears to not have come to pass as it picked up momentum again during multiple rounds of Steam sales (the game's short runtime and relatively high price was one of the major factors fuelling the backlash).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AzraelsTear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AzraelsTear">Azrael's Tear</a></em>, a 3D adventure game with some action, had interesting characters and a good story that made you do some serious thinking, not just because of the puzzles, but also because it's increasingly apparent the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityInducer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityInducer">Immortality Inducer</a> that everyone is after has some very bad side effects, and not all of the characters are what they seem. It also had pretty good music. The critics liked it, too. But its graphics engine was a bit on the slow side, and it had the great misfortune of being released <em>the very same week</em> as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Quake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Quake">Quake</a></em>, which was much anticipated, had fantastic graphics performance, and was quite addictive.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YokaiWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YokaiWatch">Yo-Kai Watch</a></em> franchise may be the fastest contemporary example in Japan of how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise">monumental successes</a> can lead to terrible failures, especially when expanding internationally.
<ul><li> Despite near-universal praise from critics and those who played it; the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YokaiWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YokaiWatch">Yo-Kai Watch</a></em> game sold poorly in North America, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericansHateTingle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericansHateTingle">in stark contrast</a> to its sales in Japan.

Thankfully, though, the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">did much better in Europe</a>.

However, you'd be wrong. Despite launching at number 1 in Japan, and receiving critical praise for the graphics, gameplay, and story, the game had the worst sales in the series, selling 200,000 copies, not helped by releasing the game in the wake of the hype building up for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">Pok&eacute;mon Sword and Shield</a></em>, which would be released just five months later and sell eight times that in Japan and nearly 30 times that in the rest of the world. And to add fuel to the fire, it quickly fell after the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioMaker2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioMaker2">Super Mario Maker 2</a></em> the following week, which sold more copies in its first three days than <em>Yo-kai Watch 4</em> did in its first five months on sale. The game received an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> for the PlayStation 4 that ultimately shared the same fate.

What's the problem? Well, until its Wii U release, it was playable only in Japanese arcades. Skilled players could net an hour of play from a single token, making it very unprofitable for arcade owners. This was later subverted thanks to the Wii U version, which launched to great fanfare, and the subsequent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Nintendo Switch</a> in September 2017.

It combines the two into a surprisingly deep package with near-endless replayability. It hit it off very well with many critics and fans, but garnered little attention due to poor advertising from Nintendo, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidgetSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidgetSeries">being weird</a>, and being released during a news drought for Game Freak's own <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pok&eacute;mon Sun and Moon</a></em>, causing irritated <em>Pok&eacute;mon</em> fans to bash the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutShowsYouDontWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplainingAboutShowsYouDontWatch">despite having never played it</a> or even knowing both titles are from the same developers.

Kickstarted with $34,250, 4 years of development by indie software developers, and a score of 90 on Metacritic, it has... less than 100 reviews on Steam one week after release. Note that Steam is the main place to get <em>Tadpole Treble</em> for the PC &mdash; even the low-bass toad sung so! Unfortunately, a lot of people simply don't want to play a rhythm game starring a tadpole.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Oddworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Oddworld">Oddworld</a>: Stranger's Wrath</em> was acclaimed for its unique take on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter">First-Person Shooter</a> and story, and was considered the best <em>Oddworld</em> game in the series since <em>Abe's Exoddus</em>. However, the game sold incredibly poorly due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleAdvertising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleAdvertising">Invisible Advertising</a> and was even a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorKiller">Creator Killer</a> for a while until Oddworld Inhabitants bounced back in the 2010s. Since then, it's sold much better in its HD remaster on digital platforms.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Obsidian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Obsidian">Obsidian</a></em> was a unique, surreal spin on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myst">Myst</a></em> which launched with $2 million spent on advertising, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThomasDolby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThomasDolby">Thomas Dolby</a></em> was hired to write its soundtrack, and was lauded by many critics on release. But it sold only 80,000 units and eventually caused its creator, Rocket Science <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorKiller">to go bankrupt and fold not long after</a>. It's notable that the game's demo consisted of a very small area with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a> puzzle and a slideshow, nothing more, which may have been one cause of the game's failure. Despite all this, the game has gained a minor cult following in the adventure genre.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Titanfall2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Titanfall2">Titanfall 2</a></em> received near-unanimous critical acclaim, a warm reception from the series' fanbase after a coldly received beta, and a multiplatform launch after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Titanfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Titanfall">the first game's</a> Xbox console exclusivity. Despite this, it ultimately <a class="urllink" href="http://www.pcgamer.com/ea-share-price-dips-in-response-to-analyst-predicting-substantially-disappointing-titanfall-2-sales/">sold only a little over half of the sales of the first game.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Many believe that publisher EA's decision to launch the game only a week after their own highly hyped multiplayer shooter, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield1">Battlefield 1</a></em>, in a gambit to launch two shooters against Activison's next <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a></em>, only ended up causing the bigger <em>Battlefield 1</em> to dwarf the game's presence. The fact that <em>Titanfall 2</em> is an external project only published by EA while <em>Battlefield 1</em> is both published and developed by EA has led some of the more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">devout fans</a> to believe that EA <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheNetwork">purposely gimped</a> the success of <em>Titanfall 2</em> in order to ensure Respawn Entertainment's financial failure, thus allowing EA to buy the IP outright from amongst the wreckage.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Blur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Blur">Blur</a></em> was a game that received high marks for approaching <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VehicularCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VehicularCombat">Vehicular Combat</a> kart racing games with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> feeling and more skill-based style of gameplay. Unfortunately, it sold poorly thanks to a combination of factors, including an ad campaign that took aim at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart">Mario Kart</a></em> but only made itself look immature, as well as being released within the same week as rival games <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModNationRacers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModNationRacers">ModNation Racers</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplitSecond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplitSecond">Split Second</a></em>. Its low sales ended with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BizarreCreations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BizarreCreations">Bizarre Creations</a> being shut down: many of its employees migrated to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Forza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Forza">Forza Horizon</a></em> developer Playground Games, while lead designer Gareth Wilson went to work on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SegaSuperstars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SegaSuperstars">Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed</a></em> with Sumo Digital.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RhythmHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RhythmHeaven">Rhythm Heaven</a></em> series, the only one to sell well outside of Japan is <em>Rhythm Heaven</em> for the Nintendo DS, even though all of them pleased critics and the few who bought them for their charm. <em>Rhythm Heaven Fever</em> flopped despite being for the ever-popular Wii, while the English version of <em>Rhythm Heaven Megamix</em> was announced on the day of its release and was digital-only... and was also a poor seller. The most common explanation behind <em>Rhythm Heaven Fever</em>'s underwhelming sales is that its marketing and box art made it look like a minigame compilation on a system that was already totally overloaded with them, and the reduced price made it look like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Shovelware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Shovelware">shovelware</a>. Some parts of the game became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">memetic</a>, but memes do not sell a game. <em>Rhythm Heaven Megamix</em> did not succeed due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleAdvertising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleAdvertising">Invisible Advertising</a> and interest in rhythm games having mostly evaporated in North America and Europe. Averted in Japan, where it was made, however; the <em>Rhythm Heaven</em> titles sell well enough that pop musicians and their songwriters make songs just for this series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatZeroTheBelkanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatZeroTheBelkanWar">Ace Combat Zero: The Belkan War</a></em> is fondly remembered by fans as one of the most memorable titles in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat">Ace Combat</a></em> series, on par with the best-selling <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat04ShatteredSkies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat04ShatteredSkies">Ace Combat 04: Shattered Skies</a></em>. However, being released at the very end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a> life cycle and with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3">PlayStation 3</a> already replacing it, impacted the game's sales negatively, making it the lowest-selling title of the PS2 installments at under 1 million copies sold (in fact, under a third of <em>AC04</em>'s).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TelltaleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TelltaleGames">Telltale Games</a>' unique brand of storytelling put several episodic games that were, for the most part, praised for their stories and characters &mdash; such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWolfAmongUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWolfAmongUs">The Wolf Among Us</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanTheTelltaleSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanTheTelltaleSeries">Batman: The Telltale Series</a></em> &mdash; but aside from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWalkingDeadSeasonOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWalkingDeadSeasonOne">The Walking Dead Season One</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MinecraftStoryMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MinecraftStoryMode">Minecraft: Story Mode</a></em>, they failed to sell well, contributing to the company being shut down in September 2018.
</li><li> In 2002, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo">Nintendo</a>, in an attempt to boost the sales of the struggling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube">GameCube</a> console, came together with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom">Capcom</a> for the "Capcom Five", a set of five games &mdash; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ViewtifulJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ViewtifulJoe">Viewtiful Joe</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Killer7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Killer7">killer7</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PN03" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PN03">P.N.03</a></em>, and the ultimately canceled <em>Dead Phoenix</em> &mdash; that would be exclusive to Nintendo's console. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShinjiMikami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShinjiMikami">Shinji Mikami</a> even famously claimed that he would cut his own head off if <em>RE4</em> were ever ported to other consoles. Instead of saving the GameCube, the GameCube's woes merely dragged these games down, forcing them to languish in obscurity even as those who played them heaped praise upon them; of them, only <em>RE4</em> was a sales success, and even it saw its sales more than double after it was ported to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a>. <em>Viewtiful Joe</em> and <em>Killer7</em> wouldn't gain widespread recognition until after they were released on other consoles.
</li><li> The same problem as the above afflicted the remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil1">Resident Evil</a></em> and its prequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil0" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil0">Resident Evil 0</a></em>, both of which were also GameCube exclusives. The former was, and still is, widely praised as one of the best games in the series and one of the greatest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivalHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivalHorror">Survival Horror</a> games of all time, and while the latter was somewhat more divisive, it too met an overall positive reception. However, both games underperformed due to their exclusivity to the struggling GameCube. Together, their commercial disappointments led Capcom to take the series in a more action-heavy direction with <em>RE4</em>. Only with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> for the remake in 2015 and for <em>RE0</em> in 2016 did both games get the attention they deserved.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestX">Dragon Quest X</a></em> was well-received, but it has become the lowest selling <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest">Dragon Quest</a></em> game in Japan by a wide margin, taking three years to sell a million copies in a series normally so popular that its release days are practically national holidays. What also didn't help the game was that due to its implied failure in Japan, it never was considered for localization, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">was even saddled with an IP block and later had its offline trial removed.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DrMuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DrMuto">Dr. Muto</a></em> got generally favorable reception and is generally considered to be a fun platformer. Yet despite being on the three top sixth-generation consoles, the game failed to sell well due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MidwayGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MidwayGames">Midway Games</a> not doing much in terms of promotion. Not long after the game was released, Midway shut down its developer Midway Games West, formerly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Atari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Atari">Atari</a>'s arcade division, effectively putting the coffin in the ground for Atari.
</li><li> Here is another example of how not even Mario is immune to having a flop every now and then. While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiBowsersInsideStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiBowsersInsideStory">Mario &amp; Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">put out almost 4 million copies by its last report</a> and became the <em>Mario</em> RPG with the highest sales of them all, its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS">Nintendo 3DS</a> remake, <em>Bowser's Inside Story + Bowser Jr.'s Journey</em>, landed on the complete opposite side, selling barely over 20,000 copies total despite generally pulling in the same 8's, 9's, B's and A's on reviews as the original game. 9 months after the remake's release, Alpha Dream filed for bankruptcy on October 1st, 2019.
</li><li> Though <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioWare">WarioWare</a> D.I.Y</em> received very good reviews and developed a solid cult following among aspiring game designers, it was a commercial failure: in Japan, its sales were the lowest the series saw up to that point by a significant margin and it did even worse in western countries, becoming a perennial bargain-bin filler. This is usually blamed on it being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceAlienatingPremise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceAlienatingPremise">Audience-Alienating Premise</a>, as the complexity of the editor and low-quality prebuilt games made it difficult for it to appeal to the series' usual audience.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a></em> gained a massive and loyal fanbase for weirdness and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a> such as hadn't been seen on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a> since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow">The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show</a></em>. But ratings didn't justify the (very expensive) cost of the animation and it was axed after 1 and a half Seasons.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note721gi');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note721gi" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note721gi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Season 2 wasn't fully completed.</span> It was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByReruns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByReruns">Vindicated By DVD</a>, and merchandise still sells at a healthy rate to the Hot Topic set. The series was eventually continued in the form of comic books and a movie, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZimEnterTheFlorpus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZimEnterTheFlorpus">Invader Zim: Enter the Florpus</a></em>, which was released on Netflix.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Robotomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Robotomy">Robotomy</a></em> was well-loved by fans, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> couldn't justify the production costs due to <em>all of their overseas channels refusing to air it</em>. The channel decided to barely market it as a result, as they wouldn't be able to recoup costs even if it was a success.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DCNation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DCNation">DC Nation</a> block. The set-up of two anchor shows interspersed with various shorts and mini-specials about DC was highly praised for its immersion and uniqueness, but only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">one of the four featured shows</a> received any promotion, with the other three all axed because, despite strong fanbases, good writing, and the recognition of the DC name and roster of characters, their merchandising didn't turn a profit (or, in the case of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GreenLanternTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GreenLanternTheAnimatedSeries">Green Lantern: The Animated Series</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BewareTheBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BewareTheBatman">Beware the Batman</a></em>, exist at all).
</li><li> Despite having a large adult fanbase, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes">The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes!</a></em> did not sell enough merchandise or appeal to the target demographic enough to warrant more than two seasons. It was replaced by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvengersAssemble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvengersAssemble">Avengers, Assemble!</a></em> which allegedly sells tons of merchandise but is widely hated by fans of the previous series and fans of the movies that it so poorly mimics. Adding insult to injury, it's since been shown that at the time of its cancellation, <em>Earth's Mighties Heroes</em> was consistently one of the highest-rated shows on Disney XD.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats2011">Thunder Cats 2011</a></em> was hyped and received much acclaim for its animation, writing, voice acting and action. However, Cartoon Network didn't pay much attention to that, more to the toys by Bandai, which were not selling as well as they hoped. Although a move from Friday night to Saturday morning helped in ratings and Bandai was eager to continue with selling the toys, the series ended after 26 episodes, despite being planned to have 65 episodes, and it was taken over by a more marketable replacement, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LegendsOfChima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LegendsOfChima">Legends of Chima</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfTheGalaxyRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfTheGalaxyRangers">Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers</a></em> received some genuine praise for its darker, more mature stories but alas it appealed more to teens and 20-something college-age sci-fi fans than it did to the toy happy little boys who were the main target demographic and did much better overseas (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">especially Germany</a>) than in America, which is said to have doomed it to merely being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic">Cult Classic</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhantomInvestigators" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhantomInvestigators">Phantom Investigators</a></em> received critical praise and was the highest-rated Saturday morning cartoon in its 11:30 AM timeslot each time it aired. However, when ratings slipped with young boys but grew with young girls, Kids' WB canceled the show after only six of its thirteen episodes had aired as they didn't want to lose their status as the highest-rated Saturday morning block with young boys.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em> got positive reviews (minus the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SophomoreSlump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SophomoreSlump">Sophomore Slump</a>), it never managed to do well in traditional viewership numbers past its first season. Because of its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> nature, the second season was moved to Friday night from Saturday morning despite the show being targeted at teens/ young adults. Its ratings tanked after the move but it continued to do well on Nick's website and other digital platforms. Eventually, it was outright pulled from the live schedule and moved online but whether or not it was due to the ratings or the content (the second episode shown exclusively online had a brutal, unambiguous murder by asphyxiation on-screen) isn&#146;t definitively known even though Nick said they had always planned to do it.
