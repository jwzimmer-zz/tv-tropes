Episode 19 is essentially about noting that all four Chaos Gods are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tulpa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tulpa">the collective sum of</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tulpa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tulpa">all</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tulpa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tulpa">emotions, not just the negative ones</a>, even if they prefer showing off the latter.<ul><li> Tzeentch: A cruel, devious trickster, but he's also a force of progress, and a beacon of hope. Change is neither good nor evil, after all, and while without him there would be no malicious schemes, there would also be no-one clever enough to save people from those schemes.</li><li> Nurgle: An inevitable cycle of decay and renewal without change, yet also represents the resilience, resolve, and solidarity to face those same, unsettling inevitabilities. Without him there would be no consistency, safety, or comfort in living or dying; and he is essentially nature incarnate.</li><li> Khorne: A force of merciless might, mindless slaughter and hatred, but that's because he proscribes to "survival of the fittest": strength and skill are all that matter to him, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">he represents justice, vengeance and honor,</a> so unlike the others he would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">never try to trick or stab a person in the back.</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2avm2');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2avm2" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2avm2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He would just stab you in the face, over and over again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacialHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacialHorror">until your face stops resembling a face</a>.</span> Without him there would be no honesty or strength to fight against injustice.</li><li> Slaanesh: A horrifying, cruel, tortuous fiend that breaks the mind and inflicts untold suffering, but they also exude just as much joy, freedom, expression, and happiness; representing emotional extremes ranging from joyful freedom to crippling suffering. Without them, there would be no happiness, and no grief to make the happy times <em>mean</em> anything.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees">Aluminum Christmas Trees</a>: A lot of humor in the series comes from digging up obscure, ridiculous bits of canon material that have largely been forgotten about yet never actually contradicted by newer material. Fans are often surprised when they check the source material and find that <em>Text-to-Speech</em> did not make up that bit of silliness.<ul><li> Perhaps most famously, the Fab Custodes being based on 1st Edition material about the Adeptus Custodes that was only retconned well after this series began, and likely in part <em>because</em> of this series.</li><li> There is indeed an Ork Warboss who named himself "Big Green". He's only mentioned in a single line and not elaborated upon, but he is canon. This one is actually lampshaded in-universe, with the character mentioning him giving the book and page number.</li><li> One special talks about crotalids, enormous crocodilian predators that can, against all logic, somehow <em>travel through the Warp</em> despite being non-daemonic animals with no technology.

Far future aside, Hasbro <em>does</em> own the Ouija trademark, and has sold Ouija boards before.</li><li> In the Sixth special, Dorn questions the logic of Altdorf being able to have such dangerous beasts in a zoo despite the tech level being the equivalent of 16th century Germany. The truth is, the Imperial Zoo does in fact have all of those animals kept there, including an imperial dragon that was born and reared there.</li><li> The Jopall Indentured Squadrons, their ginormous debt contracted from birth and their ridiculous pajama-looking uniforms are just a creation from Alfabusa to go along how greedy and mercantile Jopall rulers are, right? <a class="urllink" href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Jopall_Indentured_Squadrons">Both the regiments and the pajamas are canon<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazingFreakingGrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazingFreakingGrace">Amazing Freaking Grace</a>: Plays for a second or two when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dominique</span> dies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown">Ambiguously Brown</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kitten</span>, as it turns out has dark skin under his armor but given that the Imperium exists in a far future post-racial society, he doesn't take note of this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Angst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Angst">Angst</a>: Ferrus Manus's ghost tries to invoke despair <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">on Vulkan</span> by droning "Flesh is WEEAAAKKK".

When they storm the palace to destroy the Adeptus Custodes and the High Lords of Terra to retrieve him, he has Magnus send the lot of them into the Warp, then re-instates those who actually followed his order. Before doing so he ensures their throne-bound, angry, incredibly hypocritical leader Fyodor Karamazov believes he is an aspect of the Emperor of Mankind. After joining with Leman Russ and Kaldor Draigo in the warp, Karamazov's insistence at being the Emperor reaches the point where the Emperor's Compassion, in the form of the Star Child, is able to possess him. This brings back the remaining Inquisition, Leman Russ, Kaldor Draigo, and the reborn Emperor from the warp into the Dark Eldar's twisted capital of Commoragh...

After all, which sounds more likely: that the Emperor, whom suddenly has the ability to speak and command again after ten thousand years of doing nothing, has suddenly decided to make a massive announcement across the imperium (keeping in mind that Karamazov, indeed, <em>most</em> of the Imperium that wasn't the Custodes, didn't know that there was a text-to-speech translator in the throne and that Big E was back), or that someone decided to send a falsified message that would shut down the two organizations that work hardest at keeping the Imperium safe from chaos, mutants, and xenos? Keeping in mind that the age of Apostasy happened already, and that (as Decius and Karamazov discussed) that a loyal servant of the Empire who appeared loyal had heretics and Cultists in his ranks, Karamazov was right to think poorly of the message, given what information he had at the time.</li><li> Karamazov accusing the Custodes of heresy as a kneejerk reaction and charging into the palace is going a bit far, but they're standing in the perfect position for a coup. They're the ones who allow visitors through Eternity Gate, so they can block all orders from the Emperor, leaving none the wiser. This legion of seemingly Chaos-proof guards can, and have, refused to take orders from the Inquisition, and have murdered Inquisitors before (some try to help the Emperor "ascend" by cutting life support). They'd be worthy of investigation, if Karamazov knew what the word "investigation" meant.</li><li> While the Emperor giving one last insult to Magnus in episode 22 appears to be the straw that breaks the camel's back regarding Magnus, who has proven up until that point that he could be trusted by the Emperor, Big E's insult- "Don't use your powers or you'll screw up everything again,"- <em>really</em> makes sense in context since Magnus <em>just</em> got done having a psychotic break where he turned into a demon and tried to kill everything within killing range. Mind you, Magnus didn't know that, but E being a little annoyed with his son's powers at that point in time is very understandable.</li><li> The second podcast has the Emperor bring in Uriah Olathaire, The Last Priest of Terra... who has turned to The Powers Undivided after his death.
