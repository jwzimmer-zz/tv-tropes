Both teams regularly employ kidnapping and screw over several side characters in pursuit of their destructive goals, which culminates in Team Aqua using espionage to release Kyogre for Archie, who has been made much more antagonistic and evil.</li><li> Team Galactic stole the Lustrous Orb and Adamant Orb by attacking the helicopter the latter was being transported in, and created an elaborate plan to filch the former that included strategic detonation and using Team Rocket as pawns. They also made the Steel-type Pok&eacute;mon on Iron Island go berserk in their drive to find Spear Pillar, and attempted to <em>blow it up with everyone still on it</em> when they were unsuccessful. Lastly, they commissioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightOfCerebus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightOfCerebus">Hunter J</a> to capture the Lake Trio, held Ash and co. hostage in case they managed to rebel, and almost destroyed the world with Dialga and Palkia.</li><li> Colress of Team Plasma went from "morally-gray scientist who'll do anything to unlock a Pok&eacute;mon's true potential" to "stock <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> who draws out Pok&eacute;mon power by simultaneously robbing them of their free will and turning them into rampaging destruction machines and taking delight in it."

This is welcome news to a lot of people.</li><li> A notable Bump occurred in the <em>XY</em> episode, "A Showcase Debut!", which had no battles take place in the episode. Before the episode ends, the animation had bumped up to near <em>Pok&eacute;mon</em> movie-like quality, with more frames and smoother animations given to the characters in particular.</li><li> One of the most noted things people said was that "Ash looks older" at first fans couldn't place it, but it turned out, he is now drawn with his sideburns overlapping his ears (before, his hair was tucked behind the ears), visible teeth and fingernails, and a less baggy outfit which makes him look thinner, sharper, and more mature than before.</li><li> Prior to that, the Johto seasons (starting from "Here's Looking At You, Elekid") introduced digital animation, while the start of the Diamond and Pearl seasons upgraded the animation frame rate to 30 frames instead of 24. In general, each era also becomes increasingly crisper and more detailed.</li><li> Sun and Moon switched to 2DCG style animation, causing a design change for Ash's character model but also increasing the quality of action scenes in the Japanese version, which were inexplicably slowed down in the English dub.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnimeOfTheGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnimeOfTheGame">The Anime of the Game</a>: Probably the most successful adaptation of a game to another media.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism">Animorphism</a>: A witch turns Ash into a Pikachu for a short time at the end of the episode "Hocus Pok&eacute;mon!".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anticlimax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anticlimax">Anticlimax</a>:<ul><li> The rivalry between Ash and Gary is set up in the show's very first episode and establishes that a victory over Gary is one of Ash's important long-term goals.

The later Johto League, however, ties up loose ends with Ash and Gary's Full Battle which ends in the victory of the former.</li><li> Team Aqua and Magma's two-part finale suffered from a rushed pace and horrid animation.</li><li> In <em>Diamond &amp; Pearl: Galactic Battles</em>, Team Galactic is thwarted by Cyrus disappearing into a portal after he nearly succeeds in his plans to remake the universe.

The 5th movie broke this trend by having the opening be another remix of "Mezasei Pokemon Master" instead of the 5th opening "Ready Go". The following 6th movie broke the trend further by having no opening theme song at all, and since then the opening themes have been more sporadic with the movies.</li><li> Due to Hoenn bringing an end to the "original" series, this region is where you start to notice the first notable breaks to certain trends.<ul><li> After wearing the same outfit for the Kanto, Orange Islands, and Johto arcs, Ash has a new outfit. It would be the default trend to switch up Ash's clothes for every new series.</li><li> In both Kanto and Johto, Ash caught the three regional starters. Starting with Hoenn, the starters were divided between him and his companions, and Ash wouldn't end up obtaining all three again until Unova.</li><li> Hoenn is the first series where the core cast is made up of more than three people by adding a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagalongKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagalongKid">Tagalong Kid</a>.</li><li> This is the first region where Ash only starts off with just Pikachu instead of bringing over his current team from previous arcs, as in the Orange Island and Johto arcs. Starting with the Unova arc, it would be the standard procedure from then on once a new generation of Pok&eacute;mon is launched.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4q0jl');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4q0jl" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4q0jl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For the Sinnoh arc, Ash only meant to take just Pikachu, but the Aipom he caught near the end of the Battle Frontier arc left Oak's lab to join Ash on the Sinnoh journey.</span></li><li> In Japan, the series would actually begin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSeasonNewName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSeasonNewName">to change titles for each generation</a> starting with Hoenn, after being just known as <em>Pocket Monsters</em> for the Kanto, Orange Islands, and Johto arcs.</li></ul></li><li> Streaks that were broken in Sinnoh.<ul><li> Ash finally catches a pseudo legendary Pok&eacute;mon, or at least a member of its line.</li><li> Sinnoh was also the first series where another Pok&eacute;mon shared the spotlight with Ash's Pikachu as the series mascot. This being Dawn's Piplup, who spent almost all of his time outside of his Pok&eacute;ball.</li><li> Previously, the Pok&eacute;mon League Conference were held in locations that existed in the game. For the Kanto and Hoenn Leagues, they were in the locations where the player fought the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteFour">Elite Four</a> and the Champion. For Johto, it was held on Mt. Silver, where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> battle against Red was. For Sinnoh however, it was an anime original location and no where near where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteFour">Elite Four</a> and Champion were fought in the games. In fact, future league tournaments never took place where the final battles of the game's main storyline took place.</li><li> Previous arc conclusions had Ash learn of another region and deciding to go there follwing his return to Pallet Town. The Sinnoh arc was the first arc to not mention anything of the next generation of games, with Ash just returning to Pallet Town.</li></ul></li><li> The Unova arc broke some notable trends. In particular:<ul><li> Ever since their introduction in the 2nd episode of Kanto, it was a given to have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldfishPoopGang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldfishPoopGang">Team Rocket trio</a> make an appearance in <em>every</em> episode, even if it's just a small 30-second cameo. This trend is finally broken in the 16th Unova episode where they don't make any appearances whatsoever.</li><li> Since Kanto Ash either had Misty or Brock traveling alongside him, with Johto being the only other region he had both. Unova was the first region where neither of them were among his companions.</li><li> With every League tournament Ash either improved or stayed on par in terms of performance. However, in the Unova League, he ended up Best of 8, vs Best of 4 in Sinnoh.</li><li> Unova was the first region where Ash doesn't encounter the regional villain team until after completing the league, where they got a short arc dedicated to them.</li><li> Usually there's a few breather episodes between major arcs/series. However, after finishing the Unova League and taking care of Team Plasma, there is twenty episodes long filler arc about Ash getting home from Unova and setting up his journey to Kalos.</li></ul></li><li> Kalos broke several streaks.<ul><li> First region where Ash doesn't catch the Grass-type starter. He doesn't even catch a Grass-type at all in Kalos.</li><li> First evolution of a Water-type starter, as well as a Water-type Pok&eacute;mon finally evolving ever since way back in Kanto when Krabby evolved.</li><li> First generation where Ash doesn't cross-dress.</li><li> Talonflame did not learn Flamethrower like all the rest of his Fire-types.</li><li> First region where all of Ash's Pok&eacute;mon (save for Pikachu, of course) fully evolve.</li><li> First region where Ash does not reunite with an old companion from the previous region's journey. Cilan did appear, but it was in a post-epilogue episode meaning he only met Clemont and Bonnie.</li><li> Kalos also broke a trend involving the villains, namely that they didn't target either one of the initial cover legendaries, but rather the third Legendary Pok&eacute;mon connected to them.</li><li> The trainer who beat Ash at the League, Alain, also broke some trends. He became the first rival Ash never beat in a battle and first rival who was not introduced during the League to beat Ash.</li></ul></li><li> Alola also broke several streaks.<ul><li> Alola changed up the overall series formula where instead of being an ongoing adventure around the region, it's now more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a> series where Ash goes to school. He still has adventures all over the region, but he only goes there as part of a school field trip. Ash still does take on a variant of the game's Island Challenge, but only faces off against the Island Kahunas.</li><li> The core cast that adventures around the region was usually made up of 3 or 4 human characters. Alola is the first series that goes beyond that by having up to 6 characters that the show focuses on, these being Ash, Lillie, Kiawe, Mallow, Lana, and Sophocles.</li><li> After six regions, Alola is the first where Ash doesn't catch the regional bird Pok&eacute;mon, or a Water-type Pok&eacute;mon.</li><li> Ash's outfit is different from all previous versions: shorter pants, no jacket/sweatshirt, and no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FingerlessGloves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FingerlessGloves">Fingerless Gloves</a>.</li><li> This is the first region where the main cast are given Mythical Pok&eacute;mon. Ash caught a Meltan, and at one point had a temporary Poipole in his party. In addition, Mallow is seen caring for a Shaymin.</li><li> With a few notable exceptions, such as the main cast using some of the special Kurt balls in the original series, the creators of the Alola series finally take advantage of the fact that there are a variety of Pok&eacute; Balls that the cast can use apart from the basic red-and-white ones. Some examples include Jessie catching Mimikyu with a Luxury Ball, Gladion using an Ultra Ball, Premier Ball, Heal Ball and Dusk Ball for his Lycanroc, Silvally, Umbreon, and Zoroark respectively, and Lana catching Eevee (Sandy) with a Dive Ball.</li><li> The Alola League breaks multiple trends that have been prevalent across all previous regional tournaments. Previously, the only important characters of note that enter are Ash and his rivals, with the standard 3-on-3 battles gradually building to full 6-on-6 as the tournament progresses. Here, all of Ash's companions, Team Rocket, Team Skull, and a Pok&eacute;mon Professor (Samson Oak) also participate, with a gradual shift from 1-on-1 at the start and 3-on-3 at the end.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The biggest shake-up of all: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowTheDogABone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowTheDogABone">Ash finally wins the league and becomes regional champion</a>, not to mention the first of that region, breaking his 22-year losing streak contested only by the anime-original Orange League sandwiched between the Kanto and Johto Leagues.</span></li><li> There are no guest appearance of any of Ash's companions from the immediate predecessor series, unlike before, though the long retired Brock and Misty from the original series do make a couple return appearances to continue shaking things up. Also not appearing are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo">Early-Bird Cameo</a> of Pok&eacute;mon from the next generation of games in either the TV series or any of the movies released during the time.</li></ul></li><li> The anime series that debuted alongside <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">Pok&eacute;mon Sword and Shield</a></em> has already broken a few trends.<ul><li> In Japan, it'll be referred as just <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledTitle">Pocket Monsters</a></em> instead of having a series subtitle.</li><li> Similarly, the English title is <em>Pok&eacute;mon Journeys</em> instead of sharing the names of the recent games, which it had done since the 4th generation games <em>Diamond</em> and <em>Pearl</em>.</li><li> The plot has Ash traveling on all of the known Pok&eacute;mon world, not just the Galar region, as a research assistant instead of getting involved with the Galar Pok&eacute;mon League. Although he does later get involved in something called the World Coronation Series in order to challenge Leon from <em>Sword</em> and <em>Shield</em>.</li><li> The primary supporting cast is made of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner">Canon Foreigners</a> instead of adaptations of existing game characters.</li><li> Ash's traveling companions have a least consisted of one guy and one girl. Here only Goh accompanies him on his travels. While Chloe fits the role as the token girl of the supporting cast, said role is less prominent compared to previous series.</li><li> Ash first captures for the series aren't any of the Generation VIII additions to the Pok&eacute;dex, but rather Pok&eacute;mon from previous generations.</li><li> Related to Ash's first capture, the Dragonite he catches breaks several traditions. 1) Breaks the tradition of the first catch in the new series being the regional bird, a Bug-type, or a starter Pok&eacute;mon. 2) First capture of a Pok&eacute;mon in their final stage since Noctowl all the way back in Johto. 3) First time Ash catches a Pok&eacute;mon that one of his companions (Iris) also owns.</li><li> Related to Ash's second capture, the Gengar he catches turned out to have been abandoned by its previous trainer, which breaks the tradition of Ash's abandoned Pok&eacute;mon catches all being Fire-type starters (Charmander, Chimchar, and Tepig).</li><li> Similar to Ash, Team Rocket doesn't get any Pok&eacute;mon from Galar to train personally. Instead, They use a gacha matchine loaded with Team Rocket-loyal Pok&eacute;mon, so the Pok&eacute;mon they use in their plans are randomized for each episode they appear in.</li><li> Voice acting wise, the English dub often used actors based mainly in New York.

There are a few exceptions that belong to minor human characters especially when they own more then one of the same species but the number that are owned by main or re-occurring characters can probably be counted on one hand:<ul><li> Ritchie has nicknames for his Pok&eacute;mon.

Insultingly, this was also the episode in which the normally belligerent and disobedient Primeape finally bonded with Ash and began to listen to commands. He also hasn't been seen much outside of cameos in future Japanese openings.</li><li> Ash's Pidgeotto evolved into Pidgeot and was left with a flock of other Pidgey and Pidgeotto in the very first episode of the Orange Islands arc. (Couldn't have Ash <em>flying</em> around the islands, now could we?) Despite his promise to return after he was done in the islands, Ash's writers haven't bothered with the bird in years.</li><li> Misty had some of this, too &mdash; when she returns to Cerulean City to briefly star in her sisters' underwater ballet, the episode ends with Misty's sisters relieving her of Starmie and Horsea.</li><li> When Ash was allowed to <em>keep</em> powerful Pok&eacute;mon, they would often have personality quirks, flaws, or foibles designed to prevent them from operating at maximum (or even remotely decent) efficiency. Most famously, Ash's Charizard was temperamental and often simply refused to lift a finger to help Ash in his battles. Late in the Orange Islands (EP105), Charizard is moved by Ash's devotion and finally decides to get its butt in gear. However, in the Johto arc, Ash is told that Charizard is too powerful and that he's been abusing its superiority, and the writers have him leave Charizard in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage">Charicific Valley</a> for training (EP134)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8uk58');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note8uk58" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8uk58');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The writers had apparently been planning this for a while, writing scenes to downplay Charizard's actual strength, such as when the Chikorita Ash would eventually catch managed to <em>slam it into a mountainside</em></span>. So, for the 89 episodes Ash had a Charizard (he first achieved the form in EP046), the lizard was loyal for less than 30 of them before the writers did away with him. This made room for Cyndaquil, a little badger cub with powerful fire attacks... hampered by serious ignition problems, though Ash actually worked with Cyndaquil to overcome this problem a few episodes later.</li><li> Ash's Sceptile is another good example &mdash; it evolved from Grovyle to protect a Meganium it had fallen for... only to learn Meganium loved another. Its heartbreak crippled it so completely it couldn't use any special moves, though it got over this problem after only a couple of episodes.</li><li> More recently, in XY, Ash's Goomy quickly evolved into a Sliggoo and then into a Goodra, a powerful pseudo-legendary Pok&eacute;mon, and it had no issues obeying Ash. Soon after it fully evolved, Ash released it so that it could be with its friends at its swamp home.</li><li> This eventually led to the writers utilizing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSpilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSpilling">Bag of Spilling</a> with the start of each new series, from <em>Advanced Generation</em> on &mdash; Ash leaves his entire team, sans Pikachu, at Oak's lab just before he enters a new region. The narrative justifies this (somewhat) by him <em>wanting</em> to start from scratch and learn new things, and can (usually) be counted on to find some new way to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DePower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DePower">De-Power</a> Pikachu accordingly. At least he brings back his old team members for tournaments....</li><li> Greninja's "Ash-Greninja" form is strong enough to defeat Champion Diantha. However, Ash doesn't have full understanding of the transformation or even how to activate it. Furthermore, during the transformation Ash shares Greninja's pain and fatigue and they'll both pass if they push the form too hard. This obstacle is finally overcome after his first battle at the Snowbelle Gym.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubInducedPlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubInducedPlotHole">Dub-Induced Plot Hole</a>: In one episode, Shiftry kidnaps Nurse Joy by hitting her with Sleep Powder.

Compare this saga, which only took around 80 episodes to complete, to later game-based League sagas. Another point is that the only Gym Leader of the Kanto League to dress <em>remotely</em> like his game counterpart was Koga, and even then his tunic was the wrong color (blue instead of black).</li><li> The first season made mention of real animals existing alongside Pok&eacute;mon multiple times: cows, mongooses, chickens, etc. The concept was dropped after Kanto.</li><li> There was also a reference to Christianity when Misty tried to ward away a talking Gastly with a cross. Keep in mind, this was before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Arceus</a> existed.</li><li> Other weirdness includes the occasional mention of real-world locations such as France, England, and most famously, Hollywood, which was the setting of an entire episode devoted to telling Meowth's backstory. That one in particular was actually just confined to the dub, since the original episode took place in a Kanto city that just happened to be <em>called</em> Hollywood.</li><li> A few early Gym Leaders gave Ash their badges for helping them out in different ways, even though he didn't officially defeat them (the Cerulean and Celadon Gym Battles were interrupted by Team Rocket and a fire respectively, sprinklers that gave Pikachu an edge, and the Haunter that Ash led back to the Saffron Gym snapped Sabrina out of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl">Emotionless Girl</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">Creepy Child</a> persona)&#151; starting with Lt. Surge, and later with Koga, no other leaders have made exceptions like these. The closest exception that was made was in Sinnoh when Ash and Maylene battled to a draw, where it was at the discretion of the Gym Leader as to whether the trainer deserved a badge.<ul><li> This was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">lampshaded</a> at the Cinnabar Gym, when Ash expects to receive his badge for helping solve a problem, but Blaine only intended to let him re-challenge him for it.</li><li> The Pewter Gym challenge itself is another example of this trope. Pikachu setting off the sprinkler was seen as cheating, but in later episodes when a Pok&eacute;mon would do something similar to that, such as destroying Maylene's roof or turning off the lights in the battle with Anabel, it was seen as using the field to their advantage and was perfectly legal. Somewhat lampshaded in the Chronicles episode "A Family That Battles Together, Stays Together!" when Brock mentions that Ash defeated Onix using a Pikachu when talking to his family about type advantages not being everything, then going ahead and doing something similar (having his Onix Dig a hole in the floor of the gym to remove the water).</li></ul></li><li> It also seemed that the Kanto Gym Leaders could freely substitute their own Pok&eacute;mon during a Gym battle. The rule that only a challenger could make substitutions was first introduced in Ash's Orange League Championship battle. This rule was carried over to the Johto gyms and has been a standard gym battle rule ever since, with the odd exception of Lenora at the Nacrene Gym.</li><li> Emphasis on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a> also led to some bizarre situations, like a talking Gastly which godmodded by conjuring up illusions (rather than using typical moves) to counter any Pok&eacute;mon attack.</li><li> The episode "Bad To The Bone" has Jessie try to catch Otoshi's Doduo with a Poke Ball despite the fact he already owns it. In later episodes, when a character tries to catch a Pok&eacute;mon under the ownership of someone else already, the Ball refuses to work, so Jessie should've known she's wasting her time. But the ball was knocked away by Marowak's bone club, so we don't know what would've happened. Interestingly, this is averted in the Japanese CD drama based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheFirstMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheFirstMovie">the first movie</a>, in which Giovanni steals a defeated trainer's Magmar.</li><li> There was also the Pok&eacute;dex, who is usually just a computer spouting off information about Pok&eacute;mon. In the first episode, it seemed to have a personality as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a>, acting like a dick toward Ash when he found a Rattata going through his bag.

More often than not these battles are zero-stakes, but occasionally he does have to battle a friend with a lot on the line, such as battling Misty for the Cascade Badge not long after she started traveling with him, or the various friends he makes during his League Tournament runs that he inevitably battles (to various results), such as Ritchie, Morrison, Alain, Stephan, and Cameron. In general, the very nature of Pok&eacute;mon battling in the series means that 99% of battles are between "good" people, battling for fun or for glory.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchEmAll">Gotta Catch 'Em All</a>:<ul><li> Despite this being the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">Catch Phrase</a>, actually completely averted in regards to the Pok&eacute;mon. Ash isn't interested in capturing every Pok&eacute;mon, he's just on a journey to explore his limits. He catches a few Pok&eacute;mon, enough to fill up a team, in each region but he doesn't just throw a pokeball at every new Pok&eacute;mon he comes across. The main reason for this is because Pok&eacute;mon are treated as characters in their own right and the cast size would be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">bloated</a></em> if Ash did attempt to catch them all.<ul><li> ...at least until <em>Journeys</em>, in which Ash's new companion Goh is specifically on a quest to catch as many different Pok&eacute;mon as possible.</li></ul></li><li> The series does have actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon">Plot Coupons</a> for Ash to actually quest for, namely he needs to acquire 8 gym badges from a region in order to compete in that region's Pok&eacute;mon League.

Beyond the obvious demonizing of poachers and animal abusers, it really just provides an example of humanity gone right. Animal rights are rarely an issue (especially because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">The Dog Bites Back</a> with a <em>vengeance</em> if you kick one too hard). It's rare that smog from vehicles is even seen despite the existence of personal automobiles and heavy air transport, the skies are perennially clear and blue even over the largest metropolises, and huge tracts of land go free of harm. Even when pollution is referenced (outside of the Koffing, Grimer, and Trubbish families), it's never actually seen, or else is promptly cleaned up. And no one says a word. <em>Because no one has to.</em><ul><li> One example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PollutedWasteland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PollutedWasteland">Gringy City</a> found in an early episode in the first season, whose air and water is so polluted from the extremely exaggerated number of factories most of which seem to exist only to pollute the air and water. The water is green and polluted with multiple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuckMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuckMonster">Grimer and Muk</a> (because of all the factories), the air is dark and filled with soot (because of all the factories), and there's no grassy area to speak of (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">because of all the factories</a>). Misty and Brock then end the episode by telling Nurse Joy and Officer Jenny that the Sludge Pok&eacute;mon are a good indication that they should probably clean the place up a little.</li><li> Another example is the early Diglett episode, in which Pok&eacute;mon even refuse to come out of their Poke Balls to stop the Diglett. It turns out they already knew that the Diglett would be harmed by the dam construction, so shouldn't be stopped. It is also shown that the Diglett created the valley forests, and implied that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintingTheFrostOnWindows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintingTheFrostOnWindows">create ALL the forests in the world</a> (even though we NEVER see any evidence of this outside this episode).</li><li> Most mentions of environmentalism are played for laughs when Team Rocket mentions how certain aspects of their schemes are good for the environment.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGreyMorality">Grey-and-Grey Morality</a>: This was the case in the Kanto arc in <em>Pokemon</em>. Ash was portrayed as a brash, arrogant, and immature trainer who would act like a jerk to others sometimes (and Misty who was a frequent target of his roasts, either provoked or not). On the other hand, when Ash <em>wasn't</em> being a jerk, the others would be unnecessarily cruel to him by not only insulting him, but insulting his training skills when Ash was just a rookie trainer.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GullibleLemmings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GullibleLemmings">Gullible Lemmings</a>: As often as the heroes outmatch Team Rocket, you can almost always expect them to fall hook, line and sinker for a booby trap or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise">Paper-Thin Disguise</a> beforehand.

However, Ash decided to taunt Pikachu into attacking him then had him destroyed the machine that was controlling him and the other Pok&eacute;mon, which worked.</li><li> In Gathering the Gang of Four!, Ash called out to his Charizard when it was under Brandon's Dusclops Confuse Ray as he was able to snap it out of its effects. Although, in the next episode, Ash's Bulbasaur went through the same thing and he successfully got though to it.</li><li> In A Conspiracy to Conquer!, Jessie, James, their Pok&eacute;mon, Ash's Pikachu, Bonnie, Clemont and Serena were hypnotized by a rouge Malamar. Although Mewoth tried to reach out to his friends but too no avail, Ash had more success in reaching out to Pikachu as he was able to hear his voice and tried to fight back through strong will power.</li><li> In the Aura Storm!: Korrina's Lucario had trouble controlling its Aura as it would go berserk whenever it Mega Evolved and it would ignore Korrina. However, in the next episode, during an attack from Team Rocket, Lucario heard Korrina calling out to it and was able to control its Aura long enough to finish them off before losing control again. After some training and hearing Korrina's voice in the following episode, Lucario overcame it and no longer loses control.</li><li> In A Slippery Encounter!, Ash's Pikachu and Talonflame, while it was a Fletchinder, got hit by James' Inkay Psybeam attack as it made them confused. Because they were confused, they attacked each other until Ash grabbed both of them as he tried to calm them down but it wasn't until the effects wore off that got them back to their senses.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceCrystals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceCrystals">Ice Crystals</a>: the Ice Stone as it appears is a completely polished translucent icy-blue stone with a snowflake contained within.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">Imagine Spot</a>: Meowth's "boss fantasies", where he outlines why Team Rocket should steal the Pok&eacute;mon of the day and give it to Giovanni.

To exemplify, the Team Flare arc demonstrated the ongoing threat level by having most of Ash's fully evolved Pok&eacute;mon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">quickly knocked out by Lysandre</a>.

Usually handwaved as being electric/whatever proof nets. The peak of this trope may be when Team Rocket captured Cresselia, a <em>Legendary Pokemon</em>, with an ordinary net. Granted, Cresselia's main power is to grant good dreams, which is useless for escaping from a net.</li><li> Notably averted in one <em>Advanced</em>' episode: Ash simply had Grovyle cut the net with Leaf Blade.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InexplicablyIdenticalIndividuals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InexplicablyIdenticalIndividuals">Inexplicably Identical Individuals</a>:<ul><li> Nurse Joy and Officer Jenny were the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> (under the name "Nurse Jenny").

Since Meowth can also speak English, he often serves as a translator for humans when the other Pok&eacute;mon are trying to communicate something.<ul><li> Also averted with most Legendaries who speak through telepathy. Oddly not averted with Victini in its two movies, though justified as a major part of the plot was Ash discovering Victini's tragic past, which if Victini just told him at the beginning the movie would be cut in half.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesFriendship">Interspecies Friendship</a>: Friendship, trust, and understanding between trainers and their Pok&eacute;mon are recurring themes on the show.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance">Interspecies Romance</a>: Tropius/Meganium, Golduck/Azumarill, Bulbasaur/Gloom etc. Breeding group is also not important (Lombre/Mawile; Lombre is in the Water 1 and Plant groups, while Mawile is in the Ground and Fairy.

There are also some Human/Pok&eacute;mon examples (Ash/Pikachu, Ash/Bayleef, Ash/Aipom, Ash/Latias, Cassandra/Meowth, Harley's Cacturn/Jessie). Most of the love is one sided and on the human/Pok&eacute;mon it's always on the Pok&eacute;mon's side, except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooKinkyToTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooKinkyToTorture">Gardenia and her fetish</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsleOfGiantHorrors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsleOfGiantHorrors">Isle of Giant Horrors</a>:<ul><li> After surviving the sinking of the St. Anne, Ash's party and Team Rocket end up stuck on an island made up of malfunctioning giant animatronic Pok&eacute;mon, separated from their Pok&eacute;mon.</li><li> Another episode during the OI season has Meowth and Pikachu <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainedHeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainedHeat">tied together</a> in the middle of Fairchild Island, an island containing giant Rhydon and Pidgeot who attack anyone that comes near.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassRealization">Jerkass Realization</a>:<ul><li> In The Path That Leads to Goodbye!, Ash and Iris at different times overacted for petty reason on one another.

After everyone was safe, Ash and Iris both apologized for their behavior.</li><li> In Seeing the Forest for the Trees!, after losing his Gym battle against Wulfric, Ash was depression about how he let fear get better off him as he went to the Winding Woods alone with both his confidences shatter and questioning himself. Although, Ash was visited by a very concerned Serena as she attempted to help him up but got a little carry away when she concluded that the loss was the caused of his depression. Hearing that Serena concluded his problems without a second thought and was about to remind him of her own loss, Ash gets frustrated with her as he tells her that she had no idea what he's going through. However, after an angry and hurt Serena pointed out that he wasn't himself and wanted the real him back, Ash realized that he really hurt her feelings. Also, Serena felt guilty for getting frustrated back at Ash as she believed to be the reason for making him leave further into the Winding Woods. After reuniting with one another, Serena attempted to apologizes first for getting upset but Ash stopped her from saying anything as he assured her that he understands her intentions were to help him then thanked her for that as she truly did help him get out of his depression, which was also an apology to her.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JourneyToTheCenterOfTheMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JourneyToTheCenterOfTheMind">Journey to the Center of the Mind</a>: In "Address Unown!", a Unown puts Ash and friends into Larvitar's mind to help it get past traumatic events.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpedAtTheCall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpedAtTheCall">Jumped at the Call</a>: Happens on occasion.

Another formula breaker of <em>Best Wishes</em> was Ash's capture of nine new Pok&eacute;mon, which he kept in regular rotation and stored at Professor Juniper's lab, rather than Professor Oak's, if they were off his active party. <em>Sun &amp; Moon</em> features the biggest departure from the standard formula; instead of traveling around Alola, Ash attends a Pok&eacute;mon School with Lillie and four of the Trial Captains (but they aren't Trial Captains as the job doesn't exist in the anime's canon) from the games.<ul><li> In an odd mix of Early <em>and</em> Later Installment Weirdness, Ash would usually have a full party of six by the later parts of his adventures. In Kanto, Ash NEVER had a full party for more than a few episodes at a time until the Orange Islands; they had a tendency to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">released/given away and given little to no mention ever again.</a> Kalos and Alola by contrast had Ash catch three Pok&eacute;mon (Pikachu making four) and have another one make Team Member #5, which he would later release. Ash would then catch another Pok&eacute;mon to fill the hole, and near the saga's end, Team Member #5 would return to Ash's party, making it a full six.</li><li> <em>Journeys</em> has much less to do with its corresponding games, though it does introduce elements, characters, and Pokemon from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordandShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordandShield">Pokemon Swordand Shield</a></em> games somewhat with a decent degree of frequency.

That said, the anime has had its moments of seriousness and darkness too, especially with some of the movies (notably Takeshi Shudo's early movies), and the <em>Mega Evolution</em> specials take a <em>hard</em> turn toward the much more serious.</li><li> <em>Sun and Moon</em> is an exaggerated trope.

Since Pok&eacute;mon themselves also need characterization, the cast usually ends up being much larger then you would expect:<ul><li> Ash catches the highest amount of Pok&eacute;mon within his group of friends, but the show has handled this trope not quite as good as it should be. Since Ash's team he has on hand will always be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">Spotlight-Stealing Squad</a> of the travel group, most of Ash's travel companions and his classmates don't catch too many Pok&eacute;mon, since there wouldn't be enough screetime left for all Pok&eacute;mon.<ul><li> The original series is especially guilty of this, since the Pok&eacute;mon he doesn't carry in his party (Krabby/Kingler, Primeape, Muk and Tauros) are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> and barely get any development or screen time. The 30 Tauros he has caught in the Safari Zone are a notorious victim of this trope, since it makes it difficult to determine whether he either uses one of different ones in battle and all of them seem to have the same personality. Furthermore, Brock's and Misty's Pok&eacute;mon, with the exception of Misty's Psyduck, are mostly put <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> and barely get development since the focus is on Ash's team. However, Misty's Starmie and Horsea are left behind later on to give her fewer options for her team while also giving her the opportunity to catch new Pok&eacute;mon in later seasons. Later seasons would cut supporting character's teams from six to three at most. Team Rocket's Pok&eacute;mon would also follow this restriction, with both Jessie and James having at most two each (apart from Wobbuffet, who is officially Jessie's Pok&eacute;mon but is mostly a permanent member like Meowth).</li><li> The Johto journey makes it clear that is a bad idea for the series to start a new regional journey if Ash has too many Pok&eacute;mon has on hand. Given the merchandise-driven nature of the series, Ash is required to catch new Pok&eacute;mon and raise a full team of them (minus Pikachu). This results to Charizard and Squirtle being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> in a way that makes it a bit difficult to bring them back, and the recently caught Heracross stays at the lab to give room for Ash's new regional bird Noctowl (and it keeps him from having a member that is too strong). But this also leads to Bulbasaur being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> for the majority of the journey since he's never replaced by his Johto counterpart, and when he does leave, not only doesn't Heracross come back, Ash gets a newly hatched Pok&eacute;mon (Phanpy) which doesn't get enough screentime in the end. This time however, he doesn't catch more than six new Pok&eacute;mon. When it comes to Misty's and Brock's Pok&eacute;mon, only a selective few of them get some development: Brock's Zubat (which was caught off screen in the 5th episode of the original series and was promptly forgotten about unless they needed a second flyer) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">gained more screentime</a> as it evolved into the new Crobat and Misty's Poliwag became her main battler (alongside the new addition Corsola) when it evolved into Poliwhirl and then Politoed.</li><li> Starting from <em>Advance Generation</em>, Ash starts every new regional journey with just Pikachu (except in Sinnoh, where Aipom tags along as well), which prevents him from having the same issues he had in Johto. While he doesn't catch too many Pok&eacute;mon, Torkoal and Glalie are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> in the Battle Frontier arc, giving enough room for the returning Phanpy who didn't get enough screentime last time and the new member Aipom, who is deliberately not given enough screentime since she would join Ash in his next journey and would receive her evolution introduced in that generation (albeit with another trainer). Meanwhile, Brock also starts to enter a new region with only one Pok&eacute;mon and he would always catch not more than three Pok&eacute;mon per series, but in turn they get more development than Pok&eacute;mon he has caught in the original series. May never travels with a full roster of six Pok&eacute;mon in <em>AG</em>, but as the series' deuteragonist, May and her team get more focus than Brock and his team, and the number of her team is small enough to give each of them enough characterization. However, a few of May's and Brock's Pok&eacute;mon are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> during the transition between the Hoenn League and the Battle Frontier to give more room for newer additions. In <em>Diamond &amp; Pearl</em>, Dawn's team would get a similar treatment like May's, although she does end up with a full team. Coincidentally, both of the girls end up having seven Pok&eacute;mon during their tenure &mdash; May rotates her team in her Johto journey, while Dawn's Ambipom is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> &aacute; la Primeape.</li><li> <em>Best Wishes</em> does a better job than what the original series did with his Kanto roster, but Ash's Unova roster however still suffers from the large number of rotating members, resulting that around half of them don't receive enough development to flesh them out or give them enough screentime to show off their glory. Charizard's late return doesn't make things better, with two of the six slots being occupied by two Kanto Pok&eacute;mon and the Unova Pok&eacute;mon having to share the remaining four slots while Unfeazant is effectively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a>. Charizard himself isn't a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">Spotlight-Stealing Squad</a> either, so he has to share his limited amount of screentime with his teammates as well. Cilan's team gets a similar treatment as Brock's, and Iris never gets a full team, though as of her post-series special she's just <em>one</em> short of having one.</li><li> Due to the very small number of brand new Pok&eacute;mon in <em>X and Y</em>, the cast size was not too big but not to small, averting this trope. Notably, Serena only ever obtains three Pok&eacute;mon, despite being based on a player character like May or Dawn.</li><li> With a set of <em>six</em> main characters on the good side, Ash's classmates have each a very small number of Pok&eacute;mon on hand (generally one or two), not counting their Ride Pok&eacute;mon (although Kiawe's Charizard is a borderline case as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity">it's a Charizard</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass">but an aged one who rarely battles</a>). And thanks to the school setting, Ash's classmates don't all need to appear in every episode the way his travel companions did.</li><li> Given that Goh's main goal is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchEmAll">catch as many Pok&eacute;mon as he can</a> - and he demonstrates this immediately by catching every single Kanto Bug-type in the same episode - <em>Journeys</em> puts this into full swing, even if this means some of his Pok&eacute;mon remain mostly out of focus at the Cerise Institute. Team Rocket's formula is also adjusted, as they use a Gacha system that selects random Pokemon rented from the rest of the team. As with the previous series though, Ash's Alola-specific team gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">left with Professor Kukui</a>.</li></ul></li><li> In regards to human characters, there are so many of them that the fans, and probably the writers themselves, have a hard time judging who is going to be important to the plot in the long run.<ul><li> Characters who are also important in the main games are generally well-regarded, even if they only appear in a single episode.

This arc not only progressed through many episodes but also through four "The Strongest Mega Evolution" side-story specials starring Alain (who would later become Ash's friend and rival in the actual anime), and concluded at the very end of the series.</li><li> In Alola, the Myth Arc is based around the region's ancient mysteries and how they affect Ash and his friends in the present day: mysteries such as Z Crystals, the "Tapu" Guardian Pok&eacute;mon, the legendary Solgaleo and Lunala, and the Ultra Beasts that come from Ultra Space.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag">Mythology Gag</a>:<ul><li> A lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner">Canon Foreigners</a> in the early show are actually obviously derived from trainers in the games &mdash; Samurai is a riff on the Bug Catcher class<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12c475');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note12c475" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12c475');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">His samurai stylings appear to be an exaggeration of the common Japanese <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun">Visual Pun</a> on the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabuto">Kabuto<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> helmet (cf. the <em>kabutomushi</em>, the Rhinoceros Beetle</span>, AJ is a Cooltrainer, Giselle is based on the Lass, Duplica is based on Saffron City's Copycat, <em>etc.</em></li><li> A minor, easy-to-miss one, but when Misty's Staryu is knocked out, it sometimes makes a sound similar to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalAnnoyance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalAnnoyance">low health beep</a> from the games.</li><li> In DP094, "Doc Brock", a Zapdos makes a quick cameo.

Team Plasma was supposed to have a greater role than they did but due to the Tohoku earthquake and release of <em>Black 2 and White 2</em>, those plans were shelved. Team Flare do have a more consistent presence in <em>XY&amp;Z</em>, the third year of the <em>XY</em> series, but were totally absent from it in the two years prior.

This is probably one of the best-known examples in fiction, especially with Pikachu.

The Island Trials are being included, though.</li><li> Over the course of the anime's lifespan, the anime has been retooled more subtly. For example, Gen III changed the formula by having the female companion to be based on the female protagonist and the anime be about their growth as a trainer in addition to Ash's Gym battle quest, Gen IV added a series-running <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a>, and Gen V introduced story arcs that ran for well over 10 episodes within the larger saga (the Meloetta arc and the Team Plasma arc).

Naturally, this means that Ash will never have the chance to actually capture and own them in the same way player characters can in the games. He can befriend them (and has done so many times, especially in the movies), and has beaten a few that do belong to other trainers, but actually capturing them would not only be disastrous for the world, but it would also make Ash almost invincible.</li><li> Many of Ash's Pok&eacute;mon from previous regions such as Charizard, or Sceptile. He could have easily won most of his gym battles in the new regions, and might give him a higher chance of winning in the Pok&eacute;mon Leagues. But that would remove the need to catch and train newer Pok&eacute;mon (which is kind of bad for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">Merchandise-Driven</a> Show).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Mega Evolution</a>. In the games, Mega Evolution is powerful, but only a select few Pok&eacute;mon benefit enough from it to be a <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>. The mechanic as a whole is balanced out by the fact all Mega Evolved Pok&eacute;mon (except Rayquaza, who was so powerful, Smogon had to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">ban it from their banlist</a>) have to give up their held item to hold a Mega Stone. In the anime, where held items are nonexistent, Mega Evolutions are a free powerup, and the only Pok&eacute;mon qualified to fight them are other Mega Evolved Pok&eacute;mon, the above-mentoined Legendaries, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Ash's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAsTheyNeedToBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAsTheyNeedToBe">Pikachu.</a></li><li> Ash-Greninja, the unique Mega Evolution-like transformation exclusive to Ash's Greninja. It provides a power boost on par with a Mega Evolution, perhaps even stronger, and allows Ash to see the battle from Greninja's POV, which is an immense tactical advantage. At first, Ash and Greninja still had some trouble with it and tended to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerStrainBlackout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerStrainBlackout">pass out</a> from fighting too hard. However, as their proficiency with the form improved, they were able to challenge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsBestWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsBestWarrior">Diantha</a> to a close fight, and upon completing the forme, not even Wulfric's Mega Abomasnow, which had a <em>massive</em> Type Advantage, had much of a chance. The only real drawback is that Ash <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Synchronization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Synchronization">shares Greninja's pain</a>, but even this becomes manageable after mastering the form. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> By the very end of the XY anime series Ash <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">releases Greninja</a> so it can protect Kalos alongside Squishy and Z2. Thus Greninja isn't likely to be recalled for future League battles.</span></li><li> In a similar vein to Mega Evolutions, Z-moves are extremely powerful techniques that a Pok&eacute;mon can perform if its trainer has the appropriate Z-crystal. Z-moves can very easily turn the tide of a battle if performed correctly, but using the powered-up move leaves the Pok&eacute;mon exhausted. Like Mega Evolution, the limits in the anime aren't the same as the game - The only limit on Z-moves appears to be how much energy the Pok&eacute;mon has, while in the games Z-moves can only be used once per battle and require it to be holding a Z-Crystal.</li><li> Woah!

Other early episodes showed other darker issues like Pok&eacute;mon abandonment, disobedience, the existence of a crime syndicate.

Their boss Giovanni has a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy">Adaptational Villainy</a> as he is more violent than in the games.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolenceIsNotAnOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolenceIsNotAnOption">Violence Is Not an Option</a>: This is a recurring situation with the Ultra Guardian missions in the <em>Sun and Moon</em> series of the anime. Most of the Ultra Beasts are too powerful to be taken out by the heroes through battling, their attacks usually only causing a distraction at best, so more often methods resort to trickery or, in the cases of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonMaliciousMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonMaliciousMonster">less antagonistic ones</a>, even appealing to the personalities of the beasts so they'll willingly be captured and sent back to their world.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth">Walking the Earth</a>: Except when returning to Pallet Town, most series of the anime follows this. The <em>Sun and Moon</em> anime is the main exception as Ash and most of his friends stay in Hau'oli City and attend the Pok&eacute;mon School on Melemele Island. They occasionally visit other locations such as the other Islands of Alola and even Kanto.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasntThatFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasntThatFun">Wasn't That Fun?</a>: Pretty much every Pok&eacute;mon movie. Characters arrive at destination, all happy and sunshine for a good 10 minutes, figures out the threat or central plot, danger happens, barely survives the threat, then, live happily ever after for another year.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a>:<ul><li> Ash frequently makes several friendly rivals and leaves several Pok&eacute;mon behind, claiming he'll see them again someday. Sometimes he does, usually he doesn't.</li><li> When Ash and Gary return to Pallet Town to prepare for their first tournament, Professor Oak mentions that there were two other trainers who collected the other two starters (later revealed to be Charmander and Bulbasaur since Gary was later revealed to have Blastoise in the Johto Conference), who failed to collect eight gym badges in time for the Indigo Pok&eacute;mon League. These two trainers are never seen and are never mentioned again.</li><li> The GS Ball was a ball that cannot be opened that was discovered in the Orange Islands and was given to Ash to take to Johto. It was left with Kurt to study its contents but nothing came from it and was promptly forgotten about.</li><li> When the 2011 Tohoku earthquake occurred and the network pulled the conclusion of the Meteonite arc from the <em>Best Wishes</em> saga. While people know what happened to the Meteonite due to a pre-existing trailer that shows Pikachu destroying it, it had the unintended side effect of leaving Castelia City overrun with Venipede that were driven from the desert due to Team Rocket activating the Meteonite. Nothing is mentioned of whether the Venipede were returned.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonCute">What Measure Is a Non-Cute?</a>: In general, most remotely sinister-looking Pok&eacute;mon, like Arbok and Murkrow, play antagonistic roles in the series, whereas all the "cute" ones are usually on the good side. This has been subverted on occasion, however, especially with James' Pok&eacute;mon in later seasons.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatsUpKingDude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatsUpKingDude">What's Up, King Dude?</a>: Over the course of his adventures, Ash and his friends have met with dozens of characters who have royal titles. Just like other characters of the day, they're helped out or antagonize the cast but don't have much lasting impact on the series.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes">Why Did It Have to Be Snakes?</a>: A few of Ash's friends throughout the series started off as being scared or just disliking certain Pok&eacute;mon:<ul><li> Misty was famous for being scared of Bug Type Pok&eacute;mon, although she's willing to make exceptions for cute ones like Butterfree, Venonat or Ledyba. She also used to have a dislike of Gyarados before she obtained one for herself.</li><li> Iris had a dislike of Ice Types due to being a Dragon Type trainer. It was noted In-universe for being unfounded as Dragon Types are also weak to other Dragon Types. She eventually got over her fear when she had to work with her rival's Vannilluxe to deal with a dangerous moss outbreak.</li><li> Cilan had a dislike for Purrloin and all he mentioned was that he had a bad experience with one.</li><li> Poor Lillie is afraid of touching or being close to <em>any</em> Pok&eacute;mon. She is getting better after receiving a Pok&eacute;mon egg and hatching it into an Alolan Vulpix, but she's still spooked by other ones. The reason why has partially to do with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaInducedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaInducedAmnesia">Trauma-Induced Amnesia</a>, and she eventually gets over her fear completely.</li><li> It's revealed that Sophocles is afraid of the dark (possibly a reference to his fight in the games which takes place during a blackout). He is forced to confront his fear later on for the sake of both his Vikavolt and his dream of being an astronaut.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim">Why Don't You Just Shoot Him?</a>: Team Rocket would frequently try to surprise their targets in early episodes by ganging up on them with multiple Pok&eacute;mon (which at the time was against the rules, which were limited to 1v1). This often backfired when their target returned the favor.<ul><li> In the third episode, Ash attempts this by trying to attack James in a normal fist fight after all his Pok&eacute;mon (save for Caterpie) were knocked out. James effortlessly restrains him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildChild">Wild Child</a>: Tommy in the anime, and twice in the manga.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingdingEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingdingEyes">Wingding Eyes</a>: Heart eyes showed up a lot when Brock saw a beautiful girl.<ul><li> And heart eyes have shown up on Pok&eacute;mon at least a couple times, in the episodes "A Better Pill To Swallow!", and "Claydol, Big And Tall".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser">Women Are Wiser</a>: To a subtle extent with most female companions. While they still have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll">profound moments of humility or hypocrisy</a>, they usually have at least a small cut of clarity over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">Ash</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherMentor">Brock</a> initially balanced this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">until,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert">well...</a><ul><li> Clemont mostly subverts this - besides his inventions going haywire, he's probably the sanest and most straightforward member of the <em>XY</em> crew (more than even Serena, much of the time).</li><li> Jessie tends to subvert this. While maybe more focused as a villain than James and Meowth, she is still a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll">Know-Nothing Know-It-All</a> compared to them. <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry. It should be moved to the TRIVIA tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that Misty was supposed to be similar for the hero side. She's not <em>totally</em> incompetent however, just not smarter than Ash as often as she believes.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorfBarrage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorfBarrage">Worf Barrage</a>: In the Alola saga, Z-Moves that fail to defeat their target are very often this. Kiawe and Turtonator&#146;s Inferno Overdrive became one in their battles against Brock and Gladion, and Guzma&#146;s Golisopod easily withstood Ash and Pikachu&#146;s Corkscrew Crash as well as Lana and Primarina&#146;s Oceanic Operetta.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorfEffect">Worf Effect</a>: Whenever a powerful Trainer is introduced to the show (either heroic or villainous), Ash and/or Team Rocket are frequently victims of this trope in order to demonstrate their strength. Examples include Drake of the Hoenn Elite Four, Pok&eacute;mon Hunter J, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> most of Ash's League rivals</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstWhateverEver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstWhateverEver">Worst. Whatever. Ever!</a>: The Japanese title for one episode translates to "The Worst Togepi Ever!" The English dub changed it to "Where No Togepi Has Gone Before".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongContextMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongContextMagic">Wrong Context Magic</a>:<ul><li> Ash's Greninja is capable of attaining a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a> that is as strong as Mega Evolution, but the exact mechanics (apart from involving a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Synchronization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Synchronization">Synchronization</a> between Ash and Greninja) are unexplained. It's an alien concept that didn't exist in the games (save a unique Greninja that comes with the <em>Sun and Moon</em> demo, meant to emulate the anime) and many people In-universe wonder if it counts as a Mega Evolution or not.</li><li> Back in the Johto saga, Ash and his friends came across a magician named Lily (who may or may not be a reference to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>) who after gathering a bunch of magic ingredients, accidentally turned Ash into a Pikachu. While a few Pok&eacute;mon (like Ditto) can transform into other Pok&eacute;mon, there aren't any that are capable of turning another individual into one. It's not referenced again, but it flies in the face of what's established before or since.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheXOfY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheXOfY">The X of Y</a>: There have been at least 16 instances of this: Challenge of the Samurai, Island of the Giant Pok&eacute;mon, Attack of the Prehistoric Pok&eacute;mon, The Case of the K-9 Caper, The Battle of the Badge, Tricks of the Trade...</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSizeMayVary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSizeMayVary">Your Size May Vary</a>: Just like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em>, scale in <em>Pok&eacute;mon</em> is often more of a suggestion than a fact. Many times, a Pok&eacute;mon will be smaller than their actual height (the 4'11"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16svq');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note16svq" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16svq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">1.5m</span> Dunsparce is sometimes shown as being smaller than the 1'00"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note271kp');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note271kp" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note271kp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">30cm</span> Pidgey), and just as frequently a Pok&eacute;mon will be even larger (Charizard is 5'7"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3q783');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3q783" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3q783');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">1.7m</span>, yet is usually larger than Ash). Not even humans are exempt; sometimes Misty's taller than Ash, other times they're around the same height.</li></ul></div><hr><em>Minna no Pok&eacute;mon, getto da ze!</em> <br><em>Gotta Catch 'Em All!
