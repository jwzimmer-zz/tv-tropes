Directed by Tadayoshi Yamamuro and released on April 18, 2015, it is a direct sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZBattleOfGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZBattleOfGods">Battle of Gods</a></em> and draws upon many elements from that film.</p><p>Some time after Goku's fight with Beerus (and Goku becoming a Super Saiyan God), the last remnants of Frieza's army find and use the Earth's Dragon Balls to wish Frieza back to life. Shenron grants their wish, but they get Frieza's body returned to them just as it was before Trunks blasted it into oblivion: partially mechanized... and cut into many, many pieces. After some time in an advanced healing chamber, Frieza emerges fully restored and more powerful than ever after training for the first time in his life &mdash; leaving the tyrant ready for both a fight with the Saiyans and an invasion of Earth to enact his revenge. And while Goku has a surprise in store for his old foe, Frieza didn't come looking for a fight without a surprise of his own to share.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>For its release in the U.S., <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation">Funimation</a> gave it a dubbed limited theatrical release (as they did with <em>Battle of Gods</em>), lasting from August 4th to August 12th of 2015.

Averted with his Japanese voice; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TakeshiKusao" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TakeshiKusao">Takeshi Kusao</a> briefly voices Future Trunks for a flashback scene in the extended TV version, even if Present Trunks doesn't appear.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionizedSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionizedSequel">Actionized Sequel</a>: While <em>Battle of Gods</em> had its fight scenes, it was much more focused on slapstick and comedy. <em>Resurrection &#145;F&#146;</em> goes all-out with Frieza's return and a whole alien invasion, with many more action scenes than the previous film.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion">Actor Allusion</a>: Krillin's ringtone is <em>We Are</em> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>. His Japanese voice actress, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MayumiTanaka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MayumiTanaka">Mayumi Tanaka</a>, voices Luffy and his English VA, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonnyStrait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonnyStrait">Sonny Strait</a>, plays Usopp.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvertisedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvertisedExtra">Advertised Extra</a>: Tagoma. Early on, he suggests that Frieza should avoid the Saiyans and go back to running his empire; Frieza kills him for making the suggestion.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">Aesop Amnesia</a>: After losing to Goku and being killed by Trunks, Frieza realizes that being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">Brilliant, but Lazy</a> was the catalyst of his downfall. So, he decides to finally train and bring out all of his latent power. However, he still didn't completely learn his lesson from Namek. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Part of the reason why he lost was because he never learned to control his full power, had no endurance for a prolonged fight, and couldn't respond once raw strength proved to be ineffective. His golden form has the exact same problems to an even <em>greater</em> extent. After taking so much damage, he loses his ultimate transformation and is reduced to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit">rage quitting</a></span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion">Alien Invasion</a>: Frieza; this time with a much larger army.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPowerfulBystander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPowerfulBystander">All-Powerful Bystander</a>: Beerus and especially Whis. Either one of them could easily kill Frieza, but they don't get involved in the fight at all. In fact, they're really only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSnackIsMoreInteresting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSnackIsMoreInteresting">there for the food</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Subverted later on when after Frieza destroys the Earth, Whis protects everyone who was standing around him at the time and does Goku a solid by reversing time so he can kill Frieza before he gets a chance</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">And I Must Scream</a>:<ul><li> After being sent to Hell in <em>Z</em>, Frieza gets trapped inside a cherry tree's pod in an endless flower field, unable to move and stripped of his powers while angels and toy-like creatures sing and dance around him. It happens to him again <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">towards the end of the film</span>. Quite a grim end for a villainous character.</li><li> The result of Frieza's resurrection is this, being conscious while in pieces. He gets better eventually.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBump">Animation Bump</a>: The battle with all the Earth's fighters, Goku vs. Frieza, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Earth exploding</span> are some of the best animated scenes in the movie.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimax">Anti-Climax</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Frieza ultimately ends up as this, despite gaining a new Super Form because despite the power up, he still lacks the stamina to keep up with Goku or Vegeta. Neither Goku nor Vegeta takes the fight completely seriously, even briefly fighting <em>each other</em> at one point over whose turn it is to fight Frieza. Their lax approach to the situation results in Goku almost dying and Frieza successfully destroying the Earth.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseWow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseWow">Apocalypse Wow</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Frieza destroys the Earth after it's absolutely clear that Vegeta has beaten him. Unlike on Namek, he doesn't drag things out, but the ensuing destruction is still quite spectacular, as we see the ground cracking beneath the heroes' feet, volcanoes starting to erupt everywhere, and a good 30-second CGI shot from outer space where the planet is slowly consumed by fire and breaks apart before exploding.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a>: Frieza fully sees Goku as this to the point he wants to kill Goku without caring so much about the Saiyan who sliced him up and blew him to bits. He went as far as to call Goku his old nemesis. The feeling is not mutual. Despite Frieza pushing him into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a> during their battle on Namek, Goku no longer holds any personal grudge against Frieza and even <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">offers him the chance to leave and fight him again one day</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Frieza's ultimate transformation, Golden Frieza. In this form, his power surpasses any form of Super Saiyan, even a Super Saiyan enhanced by the aura of a god. However, since Frieza never mastered this form, he burns through his energy so quickly that Goku only has to withstand Frieza's attacks for a few minutes before they become completely ineffective.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeByAnalysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeByAnalysis">Awesome by Analysis</a>: Jaco's approach to taking down large quantities of Freiza's henchmen involved precisely aimed shots to incapacitate them, and using his surroundings to evade from or take down his attackers. At one point he manages to trick a whole squad into getting eaten by a giant shark.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>: Frieza seems completely in control, composed, and on the ball with what needs to be done in order to reclaim his position in the universe...at first. Then he starts fighting, and more and more you see just how utterly <em>broken</em> his defeat at Goku's hands has left him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He's even fine with blowing up the planet, point-blank and <em>immediately</em> with a manic grin on his face, because even if it kills him, he <em>has</em> to kill Goku. He seems mentally incapable of accepting <em>any</em> other reality, whether or not he's even <em>still</em> alive afterwards.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>: Frieza; with a taste for vengeance. One of his subordinates wished him back.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackToBackBadasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackToBackBadasses">Back-to-Back Badasses</a>: Jaco and Krillin fight back-to-back long enough to trade quips.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a>: Jaco is the only fighter in this movie who cannot use <em>ki</em> or fly but he still beats Frieza's army very well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">Bad Boss</a>: Frieza kills all of his men, except Sorbet, for failing to defeat the Z warriors.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldOfAwesome">Bald of Awesome</a>: Krillin asks 18 to shave his head before he joins the Z-Fighters against Frieza. Gohan remarks how nostalgic looking at him feels. Frieza, however, just knows Krillin as that guy he blew up once.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">Be Careful What You Wish For</a>: When Sorbet first wishes for Frieza's revival, Shenron says that it's pointless to bring him back since he would return in pieces. After talking with Tagoma, Sorbet demands that his wish be granted.

Think about it, for him to be able to dispatch Frieza's men can only mean one of two things. The first is that Frieza's men are pitifully weaker than they ought to be, which would make no sense as we know his forces were preparing alongside him for the invasion. The only other explanation is that Master Roshi's been doing some bulking up in his spare time, at least enough for his "MAX" state to be able to blow them away.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Goku by the time of the movie not only mastered Super Saiyan God, but he can now transform into a Super Saiyan using his godly aura, surpassing a <em>god</em>. He can also easily fight off Frieza's true form, which he finally mastered, without becoming a Super Saiyan, reminding Frieza and the audience that once Goku surpasses someone they next to never catch up to him again.</span></li><li> Vegeta went from not surpassing Super Saiyan 2 to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being able to reach the same level of Super Saiyan God as <em>Goku</em>, coming within striking distance of his rival's power once again.</span></li><li> Frieza's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook">Elite Mook</a>, Shisami.

He refers to Vegeta as a pet and calls Krillin pathetic when he learns that the Dragon Balls revived him. Probably the worse burn comes when he mockingly calls Vegeta the prince of no one.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod">Top God</a>: Once again, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Whis</span> shows why he's canonically <em>the</em> most powerful character at this point in the series. Specifically, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">besides being stronger than Beerus, he even shows off some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongContextMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongContextMagic">abilities that aren't native to the DB universe</a>. Specifically, he can rewind time itself. Not jump back into time like Trunks did, mind, which ended up creating multiple time lines, but <em>completely reverse the flow of time itself</em> to prevent any alternate timeline shenanigans. Normally, he only uses it when Beerus has one of his tantrums and blows up far more planets than he's supposed to, but he was willing to do Goku a favor when Frieza successfully managed to blow up Earth.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a>: No pun intended; this is what Frieza subjects himself and his men to for a grueling four months in order to prepare for the invasion of Earth. Given Goku, Vegeta and the Z Fighters had <em>years</em> of improvement since Namek, you can see the results pretty clearly in their ability to even provide a challenge, much less fight them evenly. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Goku even compliments Frieza for coming so far within such a short time, saying it took him years to reach that level. Frieza doesn't take kindly to Goku's praise, especially since Goku still proves to be the better fighter. Even the strongest of Frieza's soldiers was one-shotted by Gohan, who's nowhere near as powerful as he could be</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationIsAFreeAction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationIsAFreeAction">Transformation Is a Free Action</a>:<ul><li> Goku and Frieza let each other transform before they start their real battle.</li><li> Subverted in the prologue of the Director's Cut, where Frieza's first transformation lasts less than 30 seconds.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a>: This is Frieza's state of mind throughout the entire movie. Even though he keeps it buttoned up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury">Tranquil Fury</a>, when the punches start flying he flies off the handle and turns into a rabid maniac.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderestimatingBadassery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderestimatingBadassery">Underestimating Badassery</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith">Played With</a>. When Frieza hears that Goku defeated Majin Buu, he knows beyond a doubt that he cannot defeat Goku in his present state. This is what motivates him to buckle down and train for once, unlocking a terrifying amount of power in the process. When he comes to Earth, he is clearly appreciative of the fact that Goku will be a tough opponent to take down, and he goes so far as to have a contingency plan up his sleeve just in case he loses again. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Despite this, he is still surprised that Goku didn't need to go Super Saiyan to easily handle his true form and that he should have mastered his new transformation and not rely on raw power alone. He also plays this straight in regards to Vegeta. The thought never crossed his mind that Vegeta might have become nearly as powerful as Goku. He didn't even believe Vegeta could become a regular Super Saiyan</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard">Ungrateful Bastard</a>: You would think Frieza would be a little more grateful to his men for reviving him and saving him from more years in Hell.

Yeah, keep it classy, Frieza.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoryByEndurance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoryByEndurance">Victory by Endurance</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Despite Frieza overpowering Goku once he transforms into Golden Frieza, Goku still wins because Frieza is leaking power every second. By the end, Frieza exhausts himself so much that he can't even hurt Goku anymore and Vegeta completely kicks his ass once he enters the fight.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainCred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainCred">Villain Cred</a>: While Frieza is mostly after Goku for revenge, he does take a moment to point out that he can't be taken seriously if he is afraid to fight some filthy monkey on a backwater planet.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay">Villain Decay</a>: Averted and <em>reversed</em>.

This was even discussed at Jump Festa 2015, in which it was stated that Frieza "decided to train for the first time in his life". Frieza remarks that he was such a natural prodigy that he had never needed to train even for a day in his life, and he never did, but now that he's aware that Goku has surpassed Buu, he decides to train, realizing that, since the Saiyans got where they were because of sheer work and effort in their training, just imagine how powerful he could be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatThemAtTheirOwnGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatThemAtTheirOwnGame">if he started training as well.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a>: Frieza has several. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His first one is when Goku outmatches his true form without going Super Saiyan. He has another one after Goku beats his ultimate transformation because he's leaking power. He has <em>yet</em> another one when Vegeta reveals that not only can he go Super Saiyan, but he has the same type of transformation as Goku. Again when he loses his golden form, screaming and punching the ground in anger, almost as he's going to cry. Finally, Frieza screams in horror as he's welcomed back to his tree in Hell.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainRespect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainRespect">Villain Respect</a>:<ul><li> Played with in Frieza's observation of Gohan as Sorbet stares in shock at how easily he takes down his army:</li></ul><div class="indent"> "Oh, this is not surprising me in the least. That son of Goku could wipe out a thousand-man army in an instant he were so inclined. Watch him closely and you'll see his attacks are deliberately non-lethal. The boy has a soft heart, like his father! Despite all my heinous provocations on Namek, Goku <em>still</em> couldn't will himself to destroy me! He's a noble man of great moral clarity...so pure, <em>IT MAKES ME WANT TO VOMIT!</em>"</div><ul><li> He gives subtle ones to Goku. First, when Sorbet tells him that Goku has gotten much stronger, Frieza isn't surprised and expects it to be the case. He knows that Goku is the "self-improvement type". When told the extent of Goku's growth, he's both surprised and impressed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After Goku easily beats him in his true form without going Super Saiyan, Frieza compliments Goku after he calms down</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtueIsWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtueIsWeakness">Virtue Is Weakness</a>: As mentioned above, Frieza shows nothing but contempt and disgust for Goku for showing mercy to him, and considers Gohan weak for not killing any of his men.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWarSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWarSequence">The War Sequence</a>: The five Z-Warriors and Jaco <strong>VERSUS</strong> The 1000-strong Frieza Army. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Frieza Army got stomped badly.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WastefulWishing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WastefulWishing">Wasteful Wishing</a>:<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith">Played With</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After Frieza is revived, Sorbet and Tagoma still have one more wish from the Eternal Dragon.

He even offers him the position of Supreme Commander. Why Frieza expects Vegeta to join him after he bragged about killing his people, humiliated and demeaned him, and tortured him to death is beyond explanation, though it fits with Frieza's arrogance and he didn't expect Vegeta to have reached Goku's level.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellAreYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellAreYou">What the Hell Are You?</a>: Downplayed, but this is Vegeta's suspicious reaction to Whis casually mentioning <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he can rewind time</span>.

Once Goku realizes it's what he should've done in their fight, Whis allows him the chance after rewinding time.
