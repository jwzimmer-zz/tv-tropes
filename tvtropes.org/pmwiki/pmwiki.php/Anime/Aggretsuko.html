It stars the beleaguered office worker, Retsuko, a 25-year-old single red panda, who seems cute and submissive on the outside, but is secretly <em>seething</em> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuppressedRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuppressedRage">Suppressed Rage</a> at her stressful work in an accounting department and annoying coworkers and bosses. How does she deal with it, you ask? By singing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathMetal">Death Metal</a> about her irritation, of course! After 5 years of working the daily grind, her relationships with her various co-workers are starting to shift, and slowly begin to open up in ways that can change her life for the better ...or for the worse.</p><p>This is where it gets a bit interesting. There are two series with the <em>Aggressive Retsuko</em> name; one is made by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TokyoBroadcastingSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TokyoBroadcastingSystem">Tokyo Broadcasting System</a>, and the second is a collaborative effort between TBS and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix">Netflix</a>, but both have similar premises.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The TBS series was a series of 100 self-contained one-minute episodes (except the first episode, which was 30 seconds longer) that was broadcast as a segment of the variety show <em>&#332;-sama no Brunch</em>, starting in 2016 and ending in March 2018. The shorts focused more on the frustrations of random situations that Retsuko ended up in, such as being asked to pick up the bill at a friend meet up.</p><p>The collaborative TBS x Netflix series, which began with a ten-episode season that was released in 2018, is different from the shorts as it focuses more on Retsuko pushing through bigger societal problems, such as dealing with horrible bosses, and the problems of falling straight into love. The episodes are also longer (around 15 minutes) and follow a new continuity compared to the original series. Adaptation tropes do apply to this series.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasSpecial">Christmas Special</a> titled <em>"We Wish You a Metal Christmas"</em> was released on December 20, 2018, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmediateSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmediateSequel">and takes place right after season 1.</a> A second season of the Netflix series was released on June 14, 2019.

She is also a huge gossip, and hippos have big mouths. Ton is a fat sexist pig who is literally a pig. Tsunoda is a Doe-eyed Gazelle. Tsubone is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReptilesAreAbhorrent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReptilesAreAbhorrent">mean, creepy komodo dragon</a>. Fenneko the fennec fox is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CunningLikeAFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CunningLikeAFox">intelligent and a bit of a trickster</a>. Although some characters do not fit the stereotype such as Haida, who is a spotted hyena, but doesn't have any of the traits associated with hyenas. The CEO is an elephant who isn't very smart. The main character, Retsuko, is meant to be a subversion of her stereotype. She is a very cute animal, but she is hiding a lot of anger and a very noncute hobby.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtStyleDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtStyleDissonance">Art-Style Dissonance</a>: The show is full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyCuteCritter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyCuteCritter">Ridiculously Cute Critters</a>, and yet the show mainly explores surprisingly mature and dark themes, thus the art style goes completely at odds with the content. This includes topics such as work life issues, female workplace sexism, bullying co-workers (or being on the receiving end of it), and general life expectations. Retsuko often screams her inner frustrations out either in her head or at the Karaoke booth, and isn't above getting wasted on alcohol too. There is also copious amounts of swearing in the Netflix series, which <em>really</em> doesn't fit the age rating.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBeadEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBeadEyes">Black Bead Eyes</a>: Most of the characters have this, with Fenneko being the most notable.

Retsuko becomes the group's accountant after she accidentally bumps into their producer's van, and she later joins the group herself. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She's later stalked and almost killed by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyFan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyFan">Loony Fan</a> who doesn't like the direction the group is going in after she joined, and she ultimately quits because of it.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">The Lancer</a>: Fenneko, Retsuko's best friend and frequent confidant, who occasionally backs her up on drums during her enraged singing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALizardNamedLiz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALizardNamedLiz">A Lizard Named "Liz"</a>: A lot of the characters have names that are related to their species, although only if you understand Japanese. The unofficial subtitles of the TBS shorts also gives the characters names like Eaglette, Hippatricia, and Giselle in an attempt to translate the names.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatureAnimalStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatureAnimalStory">Mature Animal Story</a>: While not as dark as other examples, the series is one of Sanrio's only properties specifically aimed at adults, even though it takes place in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfFunnyAnimals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfFunnyAnimals">World of Funny Animals</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtStyleDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtStyleDissonance">adorable designs</a>.

Some of them are even openly sexist and determined to find fault in her <em>solely because she's female</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalScream">Metal Scream</a>: Retsuko has a mean set of pipes on her!</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrsRobinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrsRobinson">Mrs. Robinson</a>: Tsubone(late middle age at best) all but flirts with Ookami in one of the shorts, and eagerly saves a seat for Haida at a party in the series. They don't reciprocate.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicalWorldHypotheses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicalWorldHypotheses">Musical World Hypotheses</a>: Mainly uses the All In Their Heads hypothesis. In the majority of episodes of the TBS series, Retsuko's songs are only happening in her head; other characters do not react to her singing, since the songs express the things that she wants to say but can't. In the Netflix series, it uses the Diegetic or Maestro Cast hypothesis more often, as it more frequently shows Retsuko actually going to Karaoke or somewhere else private to sing her rage songs. Although the lyrics of Retsuko's songs are improvised, she usually is using the same music to sing with, so it is more believable.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficiallyShortenedTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficiallyShortenedTitle">Officially Shortened Title</a>: The franchise name is shortened to <em>Aggretsuko</em> for its English release.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyOneName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyOneName">Only One Name</a>: Almost every named character is only known by one name, whether it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstNameBasis">their given name</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastNameBasis">their family name</a>. Strangely the only character whose full name is known is Natsuko Yokosawa, a minor character in the shorts and only a background character in the series.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokemonSpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokemonSpeak">Pok&eacute;mon Speak</a>: The only word that Retsuko's yoga instructor ever says is "protein".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalityBloodTypes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalityBloodTypes">Personality Blood Types</a>: Retsuko introduces herself to the audience in both series as a Blood Type-A.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReptilesAreAbhorrent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReptilesAreAbhorrent">Reptiles Are Abhorrent</a>: One of Retsuko's superiors (Tsubone) is a ugly old reptilian woman who is very condescending towards her and has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfPersonalSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfPersonalSpace">No Sense of Personal Space</a>. And in the Netflix series she is an outright sadist and one of the few characters who never gets any sympathetic moments.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistShow">Sadist Show</a>: The original shorts were like this. Good things almost never happen to Retsuko and most of the other characters are either jerks or just annoying to Retsuko and never face any consequences for their behavior. The Netflix series is less sadistic, as although good things still rarely happen to her, the series shows her learning and maturing from her experiences.

Naturally her friends are worried about her well being. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Not at all helped by the fact that Tadano is actively encouraging her to stay with him in his limo (implied to be where he actually lives) instead of going out or seeing her friends. The end result is that it looks like he's kidnapped her.</span></li><li> When Gori and Haida start stalking Retsuko, they see her get into a van and arrive at the airport with a man and 3 other women, Gori theorizes that The man is planning to sell Retsuko to the highest bidder, AKA Human trafficking.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a>: Compromising yourself constantly just to satisfy other people, whether at work or your love life, just ends up leaving you worn out and unsatisfied.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity">Alternate Continuity</a>: The Netflix series has a different continuity compared to the TBS shorts that aired in Japan, mostly seen in the characters' personalities and how they interact as seen above.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcNumber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcNumber">Arc Number</a>: "9091-89".

There also are some small differences in character design. One of the most noticeable differences is that Ton appears much larger and imposing in the Netflix series.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Ascended Extra</a>:<ul><li> Haida (the hyena) was originally a minor character who had barely any interaction with Retsuko. Here he's a friend of hers and has a thing for her. Though some of the characters that Retsuko did interact with a lot in the original shorts have been demoted to background characters with almost no lines. Beyond that, he had a few moments of trying to use his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">supposed good looks</a> to attract females and get them to do his work, which annoyed her. Conversely, in the Netflix series, he's much kinder, possibly being the least sexist male in the show, and openly has a crush on Retsuko.</li><li> Fenneko also has more screentime and is more talkative with Retsuko and the other co-workers compared to the original TBS shorts where she was a minor character.</li><li> Resasuke also has a bigger role in the later episodes, despite only showing up three times in the TBS shorts.</li><li> The manly yoga instructor only appeared in one episode of the TBS shorts, but in this series, he plays an important role in the plot of the series by helping Retsuko become friends with Washimi and Gori. He appears once more in Series 2 in the background when Retsuko, Gori and Washimi go to the gym.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AstralProjection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AstralProjection">Astral Projection</a>: Yes, really!

Retsuko puts on a mask at work, and yet is oblivious to the fact that literally everyone else at work is doing the exact same thing. Washimi and Gori's major role in the series is to help Retsuko feel more comfortable about revealing her true self to others, particularly her coworkers - while simultaneously also putting on a mask at work that makes her less of a target of abuse. Gori is a particularly good example of this, never showing weakness at work while being very vivacious and convivial outside of it. Washimi, conversely, is much more subtle in her variations, and is the one who seems to be most in control of her own life, and most able to be her own (apparently very controlled) self in general.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigWhat">Big "WHAT?!"</a>: In Season 2, Episode 7, Retsuko and Gori do exactly this when Washimi reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she divorced four months into her marriage</span>.<ul><li> An <em>even bigger case</em> happens when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">everyone finds out that Retsuko and Tadano are dating</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus">Bilingual Bonus</a>: In Episode 4, Retsuko drinks out of an "Agua" bottle.

The second is at a driving school, where Retsuko is taking a class so she can get her driver's license.

She jumps down a short flight of stairs but misses the landing and sprains her ankle. In the last episode her expectations are more grounded in reality and reasonably optimistic. When she makes the same jump, she lands it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BothSidesHaveAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BothSidesHaveAPoint">Both Sides Have a Point</a>: In Season 2, Washimi and Gori get into a big fight over their views of marriage that lasts until the Season Finale. Washimi was married for three months, decides that marriage is not for her, and she immediately assumes that Gori isn't made for marriage either. On the other hand, Gori dismisses Washimi as being biased by her own bad experience, and she has no right to rule out marriage for everyone.

Her rage face at resistance to letting it go is what transitions into the title... then it's revealed 30,000 yen is a majority of her food money and she's hiding in the archive room to prevent Haida and Fenneko from seeing a sub-standard lunch.</li><li> "The Duel": Retsuko's metal rage moments are usually her complaining about her position and life. This includes the hilarious "MATRIMONIAL FREEDOM!" in "Walking Down the Aisle". "The Duel" presents this in a more serious context: calling out Ton for his behavior and <em>exploding</em> at him, and the only reason she gets away with it is because it happened at an office party and everyone except Retsuko is drunk enough to hardly remember anything.</li><li> In "A Good, Hard-Working Girl", Retsuko visits the store "ALP", which she doesn't usually visit, and gets mildly harassed by an employee trying to get her to buy something ("no pressure!"), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForComedy">Played for Comedy</a> regarding overly-cheery salespeople.

When Retsuko starts mirroring Tsunoda's social media in "Metal Christmas", it's treated as a joke. When Tsunoda posts a social media pic showing her going out with someone on Christmas while Retsuko is stuck late in the office and without anyone to spend Christmas with, it drives Retsuko into a rage.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsBoomerang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsBoomerang">Chekhov's Boomerang</a>: Resasuke's love of canned coffee just starts out as a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood">Trademark Favorite Food</a>.

In the original shorts it's usually Retsuko's colleagues' general ignorance and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurroundedByIdiots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurroundedByIdiots">gross stupidity</a> that ultimately gets the better of her, triggering her fury. In this series, there's definitely <em>malice</em> behind some of their actions. Especially her pig boss, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy">Director Ton</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">Hidden Depths</a>: A major theme of the show is this; <strong>People are rarely who they appear to be at first glance.</strong> To that end, nearly every character has hidden depths to them in some way:<ul><li> There's Retsuko herself, who presents herself as a demure office worker but in reality represses <em>lots</em> of anger from people assuming that they can shift their responsibilities onto her without consequence. And in a less personal example, she's talented at singing death metal.</li><li> Fenneko starts the series appearing aloof and indifferent to the drama around her, and even messes with a few of her coworkers for fun. As the show goes on, however, she's revealed to care deeply about her friends, both acting protectively toward Retsuko <em>and</em> assisting Haida in his mission to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">win Retsuko over.</span> In addition, she has a keen eye for social media and gleams surprising amounts of information about people from what they post online.</li><li> Tsunoda&#146;s interactions with Retsuko and others are laden with passive-aggressiveness disguised as politeness, and she has a habit of blatantly sucking up to Director Ton to avoid the mistreatment he directs to other employees. As a consequence, much of the staff badmouths her behind her back. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She&#146;s completely aware of what everyone thinks of her and doesn&#146;t care one bit, reasoning that her sycophantic actions are worth it if they make Ton and the work environment in general less abusive. In addition, she&#146;s fully aware of Fenneko&#146;s social media sleuthing, and exploits it by loading her accounts with things she know will anger Fenneko.</span></li><li> Director Ton shifts his own work onto employees who already have their hands full and pushes menial tasks onto the women in his workforce, all the while berating them for not getting their doubled or tripled workload finished on time. To top it all off, he&#146;s a literal sexist pig. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Much of his bitterness toward his employees comes from mistreatment he endured from his own boss, <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay">which was acceptable when he was an underling but isn&#146;t seen as lightly now that he&#146;s a boss himself.</a></span> And despite his constant slacking off, the final episode shows that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">he&#146;s more than qualified for his position</a> by crunching down on a week&#146;s worth of work in day using only an abacus. And in the final episode <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he gives Retusko some surprisingly useful relationship advice.</span></li><li> Gori is seen in many departments as a glamorous, high-ranking woman who has complete control of her life. Despite this, she nonetheless possesses deep insecurities about how other people see her.</li><li> Washimi is seen as the strongest and most stoic woman in the entire company, and backs it up by intimidating her own boss from doing stupid things. However she can be just as prone to shenanigans like the rest of them, especially when around Gori. Gori even notes that she wiggles her tail uncontrollably whenever she's really happy, but only her closest friends know this. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It turns out that she was married before, and divoriced a scant 4 months later. This is actually why she has a more pessimistic view of love and marriage than Gori.</span></li><li> The yoga instructor, despite seeming like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">Dumb Muscle</a>, is actually quite perceptive of people. To wit, she notices Retsuko's difficulty in opening up to Gori and Washimi and helps the latter two by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">giving Gori the number to the song Retsuko sings at the karaoke parlour, which is needed to break the ice between them.</span></li><li> Even minor comic-relief characters are subject to this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GossipyHens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GossipyHens">Kabae</a>, for example, is absent for much of the final episode of series 1, on account of being arrested for espionage, of all things (the show never specifies much else about it). In series 2, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her motherly side, paired with her ability to deal with her three unruly children, allow her to calm Anai down, after even big bad boss Ton had cowered when confronted by him. In addition, her gossipy nature turned out to be <em>extremely useful</em> in digging up info about Retsuko's weird date with Tadano, on par with Fenneko's sluthing ability.</span></li><li> Resasuke could be interpreted as a deconstruction of this trope. Out of the main cast, he&#146;s the character who (unwittingly) presents his inner self the most outwardly &#133;and is regarded as an eccentric <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheep">Black Sheep</a> by the office for it. But despite being good-natured, he&#146;s self-centered to a fault, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which is part of what ultimately ends his relationship with Retsuko.</span> On the other side of the coin, he also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">appreciates and enjoys Retsuko&#146;s death metal singing when she finally reveals her penchant for it to him, rather than regarding it as unusual.</span></li><li> The penultimate scene of the first season discusses this trope: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Haida admits that he&#146;s probably not attracted to Retsuko herself, so much as who he perceives Retsuko to be, and in dating her wants to learn who she really is.</span></li><li> Tadano appears on the surface as a lazy drop out college kid when we see him take his driving test (and fail multiple times), but he's actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> an entrepreneur who not only can fly a plane on his own, but also has seemingly infinite amounts of money at hand. He is also reliant on the AI he programmed himself, which, among other things, drives for him.</span></li><li> Anai in season 2. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He is the complete opposite of everyone else in this department, being a chipper and eager employee straight out of college, much like Retsuko was implied to be, but becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">Bitch in Sheep's Clothing</a> who aggressively bullies Retsuko and the rest of the department into doing his work for him. When this manages to extend to Tsunoda and Director Ton, he even becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The Dreaded</a> because no one can stand him.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">It's All About Me</a>: In keeping with the concepts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathTheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathTheMask">Beneath the Mask</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">Hidden Depths</a> being core themes of the show, self-centeredness (including selfishness in general) is a recurring flaw many characters share. In both season finales, Retsuko is forced to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">end romantic relationships she's in</span> because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her partners</span> are unable to see past their own worldviews and take her feelings into account.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntoxicationEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntoxicationEnsues">Intoxication Ensues</a>: In episode eight Retsuko loses track of how many beers she drank and gets very drunk, causing her to start seeing Resasuke as much more handsome than he actually is and also throw up.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">Irony</a>: Retsuko does not usually talk to Fenneko about her love life. Fenneko, through social media sleuthing, probably knows more at times about her love life than Retsuko herself does. It's even funnier when Sanrio's own website says Retsuko thinks of Fenneko as a "frenemy" but Fenneko has good intentions for Retsuko; while Washimi and Gori are probably wiser, Retsuko probably could also trust Fenneko with it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint">Jerkass Has a Point</a>: Director Ton mostly cares about Retsuko's usefulness to the company, but he does give sage advice when reminding Retsuko that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> love, like accounting, only works when there's an even balance between how much you give versus how much you get.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLastStraw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLastStraw">The Last Straw</a>: In the very last scene of season one, Retsuko is back to taking abuse from her bosses and coworkers with a smile once again, only to snap when Ton berates her for not putting a staple at a 45&deg; angle.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveTheTwoLovebirdsAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveTheTwoLovebirdsAlone">Leave the Two Lovebirds Alone</a>: Near the end of the Christmas special, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Washimi has to drag Gori away to get her to give Haida and Retsuko some time to work out their feelings for one another.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyFan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyFan">Loony Fan</a>: One stalks Retsuko after she becomes a member of OTMGirls in the belief that Retsuko is ruining the group's image. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He later tires to kill her with a box cutter before being stopped by Haida</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveConfession">Love Confession</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Haida, in the hospital, to Retsuko, though it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscretionShot">isn't directly shown on screen</a>.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingAShadow">Loving a Shadow</a>: Retsuko sees Resasuke through rose-tinted glasses while she's dating him. She interprets his habit of staring off into the distance as something cool and dreamy when it actually just shows how distracted and oblivious he is, and she thinks of him as a considerate boyfriend because she focuses on the few nice things he did for her (often thanks to his friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingCyrano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingCyrano">Playing Cyrano</a>) while handwaving all the times he failed to notice her discomfort. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Realizing this is what causes her to break things off. Haida also acknowledges at the end of season one that he probably likes an idealized version of Retsuko that he made up in his head, but from now on he wants to get to know her better.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a>: The finales of both seasons have Retsuko say: <em>"Time for the truth about Retsuko!"</em>.

Not only does she realize what she <em>really</em> wants in life, but also to stop lying to herself. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In the first season she insisted on being Resasuke's girlfriend to her own detriment, and in the second season she parroted Tadano's belief that marriage is unimportant.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareSequence">Nightmare Sequence</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> After Retsuko is unconscious after an attempted murder. We get a short sequence which takes place inside Retsuko's head.

This is actually more accurate to the original Japanese, the &#145;U&#146; sound in Japanese is much shorter than their other sounds, and is often used to bridge consonants in English words, <em>" Aguresshibu"</em> for &#145;Aggressive&#146; for example.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic">Not So Stoic</a>: Fenneko shows more emotions and is less stoic when drunk. It's more notable at a singles party attended by Tsunoda and Retsuko where she has a drunk conversation with the guys and talks to Haida after the party by herself. She also expresses fright when Haida gets angry at her and when Director Ton doesn't act like himself, flips her lid when she finds out Retsuko was hanging with Tsunoda and when Tsunoda invites her to a mixer, shows visible irritation around Tsunoda at times, and reacts aggressively to a guy who tries to talk to Retsuko at the mixer. She lampshades it herself early on, discussing how she would have flown off the handle if she got treated the way their bosses treat Retsuko in near monotone.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness">OOC Is Serious Business</a>:<ul><li> When the sadistic Tsubone actually looks concerned and the literal chauvinistic pig Ton gives a heartfelt advice to Retsuko, you know tht things have hit rock bottom.</li><li> When Retsuko is about to unleash her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalScream">Metal Scream</a> only to immediately back down saying "I'm scared" from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Anai's bullying</span>, you know the guy's trouble.</li><li> Haida, usually an upbeat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a>, getting truly angry and sullen is <em>usually</em> a sign the comedy is about to level off a bit and the drama is about to be ramped up. Played with in the case of Tadano, where the drama is already getting ramped up and Haida's anger turns to fanboying.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficeGolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficeGolf">Office Golf</a>: Ton spends most of his work days doing this.

Retsuko almost conceded defeat until her friends encouraged her, and decided to call out Ton in front of everyone in return. For Retsuko, who's been keeping her hobby under wraps, to perform in front of her workmates (though alcohol helped) would mean that the rage threshold had been crossed.<div class="indent"><strong>Retsuko:</strong> YOU'RE A SHITTY BOSS!

Every onscreen couple that has children is same-species, with children to match.

Fenneko notes that this kind of behavior isn't legal anymore, but Haida notes that all Ton has to do is humbly apologize for being "too forceful" and then make things worse for whoever brought the complaint. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This is exactly what happens later when Washimi forces the CEO to bring Ton in. Ton is genuinely fearful for his job, apologizes, and then puts on a (terrifying) happy face around the office. But when he realizes that the complaint originated with Retsuko, he retaliates by humiliating her in front of the whole office at a drinking party. Fortunately, nearly everyone is too hung over to remember what happened.</span></li><li> Relationships require maintenance and communication on <em>both</em> sides in order for the relationship to succeed. A relationship that's all give and no take isn't one that can last in the long run. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Resasuke's inability to understand how he's wearing Retsuko down is what ultimately destroys the relationship.</span></li><li> As much as you may hate your job and want to quit for a new one, make sure have an actual job lined up instead of the vague promise of one (and in a business that's just starting out at that) before you do things like complain about your crappy boss on live television, talk back to your superiors, or use your company's computer to complain about it online, otherwise the same people you complained about can make your life even harder.</li><li> As Retsuko's mother tells her, while trying to make some matchmaking, the men she shows her aren't just pieces of sushi in a conveyor belt that she gets to pick or turn down, they also get a say in it. Retsuko realizes this when she is turned down by one of those men, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and when she says she might want to get in touch with Shirota again, she learns he's already seeing someone else.</span></li><li> Retsuko ends her relationship with Resasuke when she realizes she cares about their relationship much more than he does and that she was looking at him through rose-colored glasses from day one. Her relationship with Tadano, however, <em>is</em> a genuinely happy and healthy one until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Retsuko learns Tadano has no interest in getting married or having children, whereas she does. Unfortunately, relationships won't always end because they were unhealthy, or because one party was blatantly at fault. Sometimes they need to end because the couple's life choices and goals are incompatible. It breaks both of their hearts, but Retsuko and Tadano break up because happy though they were, neither are willing to give up on what they want for the other.</span></li><li> The <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> season 3 finale has the OTMGirls fan who stalks Retsuko and goes after her with a box cutter and behaves in a way that is startlingly like real-life stalkers.

However, one moment that sticks out the most <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> is the slideshow where Retsuko is shown a picture of a cracked windshield with blood and a deceased driver.</span> Season three is even worse, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyFan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyFan">since a stalker</a> of the girl group OTMGirls attempted to murder Retsuko.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a>: At a company drinking party, Ton, who thinks Retsuko complained to the boss about his treatment of her (it was actually Washimi), tears into her during karaoke with a brutal diss rap.

The <em>"We Wish You A Metal Christmas"</em> special has her briefly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">sport a deerstalker cap</a> too. Series 2 has Fenneko do this when trying to find out why Retsuko is away from the office, and for the first time in the series, she barely explains how she comes to the conclusion of how Retsuko flew from Tokyo to Hokkaido in a single day. Amusingly, despite her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockScan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockScan">Sherlock Scan</a> tendencies, Fenneko is just as unaware as everyone else is to Retsuko's Death metal karaoke sessions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">Shown Their Work</a>: Washimi is a secretary secretarybird, which makes for a good pun, but the series also has her smash several things with her legs when angry.

He panicked when he thought she might be pregnant, blushed when Retsuko enthusiastically thanked him for optimizing her laptop, and cried into his beer (multiple times) to Fenneko when she wouldn't hang out with them, asking Fenneko if she thought Retsuko might have a boyfriend. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is proven correct. So much that the poor guy spends most of the last episode utterly depressed Retsuko does infact have a boyfriend. But he does finally confesses his feelings to her at the end <em>(but is turned down)</em>. The Christmas Special then zig-zags it all over the place, going from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFriends">Just Friends</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeEverAfter">Maybe Ever After</a>.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">Shipper on Deck</a>: Fenneko helps Haida with getting alone time with Retsuko and keeping guys away from her at a singles mixer. At one point, she encourages him to talk to Retsuko by planting into his head the idea that Retsuko might commit suicide.<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tadano</span> is implied to be one as well for Haida and Retsuko. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He apparently tampered with the dating app Gori was making which was based on his ENI-O system, so he must have the means to alter the code for it.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialMediaIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialMediaIsBad">Social Media Is Bad</a>: During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasSpecial">Christmas Special</a>, keeping up with the "perfect" expectations of social media (not helped by peer pressure from a colleague popular on Instagram) clearly makes Retsuko unhappy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeciesSurname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeciesSurname">Species Surname</a>: Played straight via puns for many characters, such as the male co-worker who is a maned wolf (a species of canid that looks much like a large fox) named "Ookami". In Japanese, "Okami" means wolf.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiceUpTheSubtitles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiceUpTheSubtitles">Spice Up the Subtitles</a>:<ul><li> The English release dub has language that many would not find suitable for its PG age rating.</li><li> The Mexican Spanish dub is an odd case: The only profanity used in the dub is "fucked" (jodida), and just in episode 4 when Fenneko cursed herself regarding a wedding. The rest of the dub is quite clean, but on the other hand, this is still played straight with the subbed version, but only for the songs.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">Stealth Pun</a>:<ul><li> Gori is a gorilla and she is in Marketing.

Haida later points out an episode later that Fenneko has a tendency to smack-talk technology without trying it out first (as she did with smartphones and Instagram), and eventually reveals she <em>herself</em> has gotten addicted to the VR games' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Microtransactions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Microtransactions">Microtransactions</a> (though she clearly hasn't overspent to the extreme Retsuko did).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">The Stoic</a>:<ul><li> Fenneko usually talks without showing much emotion. Apart from a few moments of terror, the closest she comes to speaking with some emotion is when she's drunk after drinking a lot of alcohol she has in episode 7 and 8.</li><li> Resasuke never changes his blank, neutral expression, and it's hard to tell whether he feels any strong emotions at all.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedRhymeEveryOccasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedRhymeEveryOccasion">Subverted Rhyme Every Occasion</a>: Fenneko's famed "Selfie, dessert, latte art," etc. line is a perfect limerick except for "a thigh pic."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial">Suspiciously Specific Denial</a>: Kabae, upon returning to work, says:<div class="indent"> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "I wanna tell you all about my vacation which was a vacation and definitely not a cover for espionage!"</span></div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TapOnTheHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TapOnTheHead">Tap on the Head</a>: When Fenneko and Haida start to remember Retsuko death metal screaming at Ton she karate chops them both to the back of the head.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeAmigos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeAmigos">&iexcl;Three Amigos!</a>: Retsuko, Fenneko, and Haida are a straight example (albeit in the context of 20-somethings in office jobs rather than the usual school setting; but this fits in with the theme of them not quite considering themselves adults yet), with Retsuko being the everyman hero, Fenneko as the best friend sidekick, and Haida as the opposite gender best friend<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a></span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">Troll</a>: Haida calls Fenneko a troll at one point in the English dub.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThematicThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThematicThemeTune">Thematic Theme Tune</a>: Jingle Bells for the "Metal Christmas" special. Instead of the standard metal of the normal show, however, it's a punk cover, fitting considering Haida - who wears punk-rock clothing and is even shown playing guitar in the opening - essentially moves to the secondary main POV spot for the episode's premise.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Title Drop</a>: In Season 3, when Retsuko finally steps up to the stage to perform with the other OTMGirls, Hyodo remarks that this will be the night <em>Aggretsuko</em> was born.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>:<ul><li> Believe it or not, the overwhelming and abusive state of Retsuko's work environment is not an isolated incident.

To survive, he adopted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo">many of their mannerisms</a> and eventually lost any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters">idealistic innocence</a> he once had.
