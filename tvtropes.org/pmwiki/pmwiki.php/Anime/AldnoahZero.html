In truth, however, it's just an obsolete trainer, one of many handed over to schools for use in live-fire exercises - it's entirely down to Inaho's intellect and ability that it repeatedly goes toe-to-toe with the martian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobot">Super Robot</a> level Kataphrakts. Even when he's given the option to upgrade to a newer model, he refuses, stating that the main advantage it has over the older model is better armor (which wouldn't have helped against any of the overpowered Martian weapons they've encountered), and while the additional weight from that is compensated for by a superior powerplant, it has pretty much the same performance as the Sleipnir, so he might as well stick to what he's familiar with.</li><li> Played straight in the final episode.

Eddelrittuo was present only as Asseylum's bodyguard, and Slaine, originally a Terran, was originally refused permission to go to the front lines. The main cast, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the crew of the Deucalion,</span> are special commandos and are on the front lines only because they have consistently proven their competence and tenacity.

Inaho finds another weakness, namely that Slaine has to be able see the threat in order for it to be effective, meaning that he can be caught up in the rocket anchor cables after dodging the initial projectile.</li><li> The (original) Deucalion also counts as an aversion, as the only reason it was defeated was due to the cataclysmic events of Heaven's Fall.

After wiping out several cities by dropping their enormous "castle" spacecraft onto them, they destroy all undersea cables and satellites to block communication and deploy powerful EMP jammers... none of which really matter, because all of their vehicles and mechas are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets">Immune to Bullets</a> and can casually massacre Earth's armies without taking a scratch. But this ties into the VERS being smart. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The VERS Kataphrakts all have distinct weaknesses that take careful study to notice. They can also be overwhelmed by tactics and vastly superior numbers, as demonstrated by Inaho and the timely arrival of the escort ship and its own mechs.

Despite having a superior Kataphrakt, he's utilizing all of the same powers that Inaho's other opponents used. As a result, Inaho is able to counter every single one of his attacks, and were it not for Slaine's intervention, Saazbaum would've been killed off right there.</li><li> Inaho delivers one in episode 13. After finding out the new Kataphrakt's attacks, he manages to get close enough to destroy it, whereas a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirt</a> squad was wiped out moments before when they tried to fight him.</li><li> Inaho once again in episode 14 against the Martian's sneak attack group. They assume their distance and speed will keep them safe from the Terran's attacks, and for the most part it does. However, using his observational skills and calculations, Inaho is able to predict their movement patterns, and times his shots so that they hit the Martian units. Slaine would've suffered this as well were it not for his Kataphrakt having the ability to predict Inaho's shots and dodging them.</li><li> Slaine destroys Trident Base single-handedly after the Deucalion leaves with Inaho in episode 16. This helps to cement his position within the Martian ranks, though a few still refuse to accept him due to his Terran origins.</li><li> The three Martian knights who attack together deliver one to Earth's forces in episode 20, and Inaho is forced to retreat with the other survivors due to the disadvantage they were at. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He repays them in the next episode, and Earth's forces are able to take all three of them out during a pitched battle.</span></li><li> The remaining Martians who attack the Deucalion in episode 24 suffer quite badly against the Terran forces.

Count Trillram's Nilokeras, for example, is covered in a "Dimensional Barrier" that seemingly blocks all matter and energy...

The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meissner_effect">Meissner effect<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is also referenced to explain why the reverse entropy field <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC-3li6ScUE">causes bullets to not hit it<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>: there is a magnetic field that is locking the now-superconductive bullets into a predetermined trajectory that leads away from the Kataphrakt, which is why an enemy unit must close to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoRangeLikePointBlankRange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoRangeLikePointBlankRange">point blank range</a> to avoid the Meissner effect.</li><li> The space battles that have been showcased in the show's second half do demonstrate a decent understanding of physics in space. The United Earth Kataphrakts mainly use their boosters for maneuvering and rely on inertia for movement, while the Martians can freely use thrusters thanks to Aldnoah Drives. The Martian convoy in Episode 14 utilizes a slingshot maneuver to travel around the Earth and realistically use spacecraft with massive circular shields to survive flying through the atmosphere.</li><li> Episode 16 shows that the debris from the space battles <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">needs to be cleaned up</a> afterwards.</li><li> In Episode 18, it really can't be overstated just how much work was put into the New Orleans battle: the coordinates that Inaho gives for the location of the Solis Kataphrakt (29.951103, -90.085579), do indeed correspond to the actual I-90 interstate bridge in New Orleans. The coordinates are <a class="urllink" href="http://imgur.com/a/xSiuS">slightly off<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> from where the Kat is, but it's still quite close. Even so, a reason for the inaccurate coordinates may be because Japan uses <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gsi.go.jp/ENGLISH/page_e30030.html">a different geodetic data standard<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, so the coordinates may be accurate according to Japanese maps. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.aldnoahzero.com/assets/img/world/Vs_032-EP18.jpg">This image<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> from the show's official website tells us exactly where the combatants were: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousPrecision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousPrecision">The Solis is in the middle of the Crescent City Connection bridge, Inaho is somewhere between W. Judge Perez Dr. and St. Claude Ave., Marito and his forces are on the southern shore near the Timberlane and Woodmere districts, and the Deucalion is directly east, likely in Lake Borgne.</a> Also, the battle against the Solis showcases one reason why lasers are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> weapons in real life for ground warfare: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> they only shoot in straight lines, and can't account for the Earth's curvature when firing at long range.</span><ul><li> In the same episode, when Mazurek is wandering around in the Arabian desert, he's somewhat fascinated by the compass he has, noting that it would only work on a planet with a magnetic field.

Though, as noted by Calm in the first episode, Japan was one of the nations on Earth that managed to recover pretty well from Heaven's Fall, which may be why the princess's tour began there.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Took a Level in Badass</a>: Thanks to Inaho's combat data recorded via his cybernetic eye, both Mustang and Clydesdale platoon become much more effective in combat against the remaining Martian forces in episode 24.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TripodTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TripodTerror">Tripod Terror</a>: The Deucalion Kataphrakt was three-legged, though it also had an anti-gravity engine that allowed it to float, thus making it a hybrid of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarOfTheWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarOfTheWorlds">literary</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWarOfTheWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWarOfTheWorlds">1953 movie</a> version of the archetypal Martian war machine.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanWarfare">Urban Warfare</a>: The entire conflict the protagonist and antagonist gets cities and towns involved.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndergroundCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndergroundCity">Underground City</a>: United Earth HQ is not only big enough to house thousands of refugees, it's so big that aircrafts can fly around the base at top speed.<ul><li> It's been speculated that it was built in the abandoned <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-pit_mining">open-pit mine<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, which then has been covered and built up. Open-pit mines can be so big that they have their own climate inside.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson">Unperson</a>: Slaine's father, Dr. Troyard. You'll hear him mentioned by a few characters, but good luck finding out his first name or what he even looks like.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong">Unskilled, but Strong</a>: Pretty much every Martian count. They have incredibly powerful Kataphrakts with seriously broken abilities, but they have pretty much no actual battle experience, and as soon as someone can get around their advantages, they simply can't put up a fight.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">Utopia Justifies the Means</a>: Slaine's response to Lemrina in episode 21 after the latter confronts him about why he's still dragging the war on. He knows the costs in lives and resources will be extremely high, but he wants to utterly annihilate Earth's resistance so that Asseylum can rule over it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lemrina then turns out to be Asseylum in disguise, and she attempts to order him to stand down at gunpoint. But he puts both princesses under house arrest and continues his plans anyway.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeteranInstructor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeteranInstructor">Veteran Instructor</a>: Marito is a veteran of the war against Vers from 15 years ago, and one of the first things we see him doing is instructing high school students who are training to pilot Kataphrakts.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousRescue">Villainous Rescue</a>: Inaho and the others are saved from Femieanne's final attack in episode 6 when it's deflected by a shot from a Martian plane <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being flown by Slaine.</span><ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Also in Episode 15, when Inaho is saved from the Dioscuria's relentless pursuit by a trap Slaine had set up beforehand. Played with, as Slaine had originally set up the trap for Inaho, and Inaho managed to capitalise on it with a little help from Inko.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">War Is Hell</a>: The framing trope here.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarRefugees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarRefugees">War Refugees</a>: The majority of Season 1 is Inaho and his friends trying to safeguard and evacuate a substantial group of refugees to United Earth Headquarters in Novostal'sk, Russia, the Martian princess being among them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeDoTheImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeDoTheImpossible">We Do the Impossible</a>:<ul><li> In the chaos of the initial invasion, Vers Kataphrakts were almost unstoppable, until Inaho and crew took out the Nilokeras and the Argyre.</li><li> Played down a little in the second cour, since less Vers Kataphrakts take the field and are also taken out with less ceremony, even though Inaho is still the only one shown explicitly destroying Vers fighters.<ul><li> That said, the Deucalion crew plays it straight, as Magbaredge comments that Earth has no idea what to do with them, so orders them from various places to fight or defend against VERS incursions. Even their operation in episode 22 has them act as bait to lure out the bulk of the Martian forces on the moon so a second group can successfully assault the moon base. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Magbaredge later correctly suspects that the true objective was to assassinate Asseylum by inserting a group of Terran spec-ops troops while the fighting was raging on above the moon base.</span></li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeightWoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeightWoe">Weight Woe</a>: In episode 17, Inko, Nina, and even Kaoru are shocked that Rayet has never been on a diet. They ask her how she keeps her slim figure, but she never gets around to telling them after finding out Inaho is interrogating the Martian knight they captured from the previous episode.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a>: In fairness, the last four episodes of the first cour count, as do two of the three episodes thus far in the second cour, for varying levels of Wham. The really standout ones in terms of true HSQ would probably be the following:<ul><li> Episode 8, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Count Saazbaum singlehandedly crashes Castle Cruhteo, trashes the place, and makes off with Slaine, just as Cruhteo was about to intervene to stop the war.</span></li><li> Episode 12, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> with the massive, massive cliffhanger and apparently a total cast wipeout.</span></li><li> Episode 15, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when Slaine is promoted to Saazbaum's heir and then later to Count of Saazbaum Castle.</span></li><li> Multiple events occur in episode 18. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Slaine defeats Marylcian, helping to quell dissent of him within the knight's ranks, Lemrina as Asseylum proposes the orbital knights break off from the Mars colony and start a new kingdom on the Moon as well as marrying Slaine, and perhaps biggest of all, the real Asseylum starts waking up from her coma.</span></li><li> In episode 19, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Asseylum finally wakes up, but her mentioning Inaho seems to make Slaine uncomfortable.</span> Additionally, while fighting against one Martian Kataphrakt and learning about its abilities, two more show up before Inaho and the others can take the first one out.</li><li> During episode 20, Earth's forces realize at least some of the Martian knights are now starting to work together, whereas in the past they often attacked on their own due mostly to their pride. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lemrina also begins to get quite upset that Slaine seems to spending a lot of time away from her, and when she goes to Asseylum's medical chamber, finds that she is no longer in there. Meanwhile, Asseylum sees the necklace she dropped after she was shot back in episode 12, which seems to trigger some of her memories of her time on Earth, after Slaine had hoped she would not recall them.</span></li><li> <em>Episode 23</em>. To summarize, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Asseylum tries talking to her grandfather to stop the war, but his mind is too gone to do anything. Slaine decides to have his forces on Earth completely wreck Earth. Asselyum then decides to marry Klancain and become Empress, then tells everyone on Earth and Mars that the war is over...meaning that if the war continues, the Martians (and Slaine by extension) will be fighting against their kingdom.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a>: "You... are my enemy."<ul><li> Ending of Episode 21</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Vers Knight:</strong> The blue planet where my father lies interred... <br><strong>Vers Soldier:</strong> Yes, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><strong>Count Cruhteo</strong></span>.</div><ul><li> In episode 23, Asseylum broadcasts a message to both the VERS and Terrans, succeeding her grandfather as the new Empress of the VERS Empire, and orders the fighting to stop. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She then gets up from her wheelchair, and announces she's going to marry Count Klankain.</span></li><li> In Episode 24, the newscast says <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that Slaine planned the assassination of Asseylum all along. This might be a cover story, as it also claims that Slaine is dead when he's actually imprisoned for life in secret.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a>: In Episode 2, we get a montage of 4 Vers pilots laying waste to Beijing, Tokyo, Maputo, and New Orleans. As the series progresses, 3 out of 4 of these pilots are eventually fought and defeated by the UFE. But the pilot that landed in Beijing never appeared again. Considering the state of the war as of the second season, it's likely he was killed off-screen as the UFE recaptured China. He has a bigger role, however, in the <em>Twin Gemini</em> manga which revealed his name was Count Keteratesse and his Kataphrakt was called the Geryon.<ul><li> Lemrina's final fate. We last see her on her way to Mars and isn't shown in the final scenes of the series unlike the rest of the cast.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a>: Inverted/villainous example used in episode 21, after Lemrina learns about Slaine's plans to conquer Earth and have Asseylum rule over it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Except that Lemrina turns out to be Asseylum in disguise, who was told about Slaine's plans by the real Lemrina. Asseylum is quite upset that Slaine turned away from any peaceful resolutions to the war.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorfBarrage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorfBarrage">Worf Barrage</a>: Marito, Yuki, and their squadmates do this to a Martian Kataphrakt in episode 16. They shoot quite a bit at it, and though their shots connect, that doesn't seem to slow it down much. Once the Martian starts up his attack, the best Marito can hope for is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DelayingAction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DelayingAction">Delaying Action</a> and luring it away from the nearby city.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy">Wrong Genre Savvy</a>: Just about any Orbital Knight believes they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a> that should be impervious to mere <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a>, while in actuality they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantGoHomeAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantGoHomeAgain">You Can't Go Home Again</a>: Shinawara is destroyed by meteor bombardment after Inaho and his friends evacuate.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveGOTToBeKiddingMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveGOTToBeKiddingMe">You Have Got to Be Kidding Me!</a>: Inko utters this when Inaho, in his orange, hitches a ride with Slaine's bat.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">You Have Outlived Your Usefulness</a>:<ul><li> The terrorists who assassinate the Princess in episode 1 await retrieval in episode 2 by Trillram. He congratulates them on their successful mission, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">then immediately kills them to silence them in case they have second thoughts later and reveal their part in the assassination.</span></li><li> Rare heroic use of this trope in episode 7. After Slaine helps Inaho to deal with Femieanne, the former asks him if they're exploiting Asseylum. Mistrust starts to grow between them after Inaho gives him the runaround, and he then causes Slaine's plane to crash into the ocean. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">While Slaine survives the crash, he's next seen being tortured by Cruhteo in episode 8.</span></li><li> Not so rare for this show: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Slaine plays up the impression of loyalty to Saazbaum, enough to be named Saazbaum's heir. Almost immediately, at the end of the same episode, he backstabs Saazbaum to usurp his position and become Count Slaine Saazbaum Troyard.</span></li></ul></li></ul><hr>
