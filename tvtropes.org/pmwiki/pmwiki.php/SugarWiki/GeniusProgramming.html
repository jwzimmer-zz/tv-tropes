The Demoscene is Genius Programming pretty much by definition, as it was born in an age when computers were dramatically limited in their capabilities, and its entire goal was to exploit available hardware to the highest degree possible &mdash; often way beyond what the original designers had envisaged. Modern hardware obviously doesn't have these limitations, but the Demoscene crowd decided it wasn't fun to do what game developers were already doing (that is, 3D eye candy using gigs and gigs of textures and 3D models), so they enacted self-imposed limits &mdash; often harsher than those they originally had to deal with. Hence a division in categories, one of the most famous and prestigious being "64k" &mdash; that is, demos whose entire code and resources fit in <em>sixty-four kilobytes</em>. For reference, that's 3.5 <em>seconds</em> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MP3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MP3">MP3</a> music, and you could fit it <em>twenty-two times</em> in a "modern" 3.5" floppy disk and almost <em>eleven thousand</em> times in a CD-ROM.
<p></p><ul><li> Farbrausch is a widely known crew that attained massive fame for <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=1221">fr-08: .the .product<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, the first 64k demo with really impressive graphics (for the time). Witness it <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3n3c_8Nn2Y">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. <br>Not content with having redefined the standards for demos, later on they developed <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kkrieger">.kkrieger<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, an interactive shooter game with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a> 3</em>-tier graphics &mdash; which <em>fits in the same 64 kilobytes</em>. These guys have a lot more stuff, available <a class="urllink" href="http://www.farb-rausch.de/">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> video really doesn't do justice to how impressive it is to watch this thing running on a 16-bit machine with 1 megabyte of RAM, a 7 MHz processor and an 880K floppy drive for storage. The fluidity is all the more impressive when you remember that the demo is constantly loading new data in from the floppy drive while displaying all that animation.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ywbtsUoU3c">Tint<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (possibly NSFW due to a second or two of boobies) by <a class="urllink" href="http://www.tbl.org/">The Black Lotus<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Needs rather meatier hardware to run than the aforementioned State Of The Art, but the real-time lensing and fluid effects near the end will blow your mind. Also, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/AwesomeMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/AwesomeMusic">Awesome Music</a> helps a lot.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1p1im_2uf4">The 8088 Corruption<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, a demo that runs "video" at 60 frames per second and impressive digital audio, on an old IBM PC, using the Intel 8088 flavor of processor. For those that don't know their computer history, the 8088 is a 16-bit processor, but it's crippled to an 8-bit data bus.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/MWdG413nNkI">8088 Domination<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> takes this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> by increasing the resolution, number of colors, and framerate. This goes as far as including the fully voiced FMV Bad Apple!! Note that to squeeze as much performance as possible, each video is actually compiled into its own player program, which essentially constantly rewrites the computer's video buffer.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAnhcUNHRW0">Chaos Theory<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, by Conspiracy, which took the 64k approach but with graphics about on par with modern games. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFAIaclLrKE">The remake of Chaos Theory<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> by KK / DMA. While some cutbacks to the graphics and music quality were made, the demo was squished into <em>four kilobytes</em> &mdash; that's 16x less than the original.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNRO7lno_DM">8088 MPH<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is a demo that does <strong>1024</strong> colors, polygon rendering, 4 channel music with a <em>one channel beeper</em> and other things that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IBMPersonalComputer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IBMPersonalComputer">original IBM PC</a> with a CGA card (on a composite monitor) should not be doing. It's so <em>very</em> specifically tailored to the IBM PC's exact hardware and quirks that no emulator exists that can run it without crashing.
</li><li> Due to their experience with procedural generation, many demoscene programmers were hired to work on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spore">Spore</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWblpsLZ-O8">A Mind Is Born<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is a demo that displays a pulsing screen of corrupt images while playing a techno-style tune lasting about 2 minutes. Why is that genius programming? The whole thing is <strong>256 bytes</strong>. That's not 256k, that's 256 bytes - a quarter of 1k. The entire code and data of the demo is shorter than this description.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CAcjNQDwPo">Demotronic<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is a Game Boy Color demo that features parallax scrolling. While parallax is fairly common in 2D games, this demo pulls off <em>vertical</em> parallax, which is unheard of on most systems, especially 8-bit and 16-bit consoles. This also allows to perform hardware scaling, which is combined with rapidly changing the color palette to produce the 3D checkerboard that makes up the first part of the demo.
<ul><li> This trick requires cycle-perfect emulation in order to not break. For this reason, the demo also includes some emulator detection (which most current emulators don't trigger, but it was fairly accurate at the time.)
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imquk_3oFf4">Memories<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, the winner of the Revision 2020 demoparty's 256 byte division, blows A Mind Is Born out of the water by fitting in <em>seven distinct graphical effects</em>, plus smooth transitions between the effects, plus background music. Just look at the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/589179638?t=7h02m40s">live reactions<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> when it was first unveiled.

<ul><li> ROM Hacks in general, especially when they go beyond what you'd think the game engine or even the <em>system</em> was capable of, for example:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrutalMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrutalMario">Brutal Mario</a>/Super Kitiku World</em> and its massive use of custom assembly to do things <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a></em> wouldn't do otherwise.

</li><li> Give or take, any of the really well done <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan2">Mega Man 2</a></em> hacks.
</li><li> <em>Rockman 5 Air Sliding</em> featured its unique <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">titular gameplay mechanic</a>, alongside some interesting level and weapon changes (including an improved Gravity Hold and making Stone Man's level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedGlitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedGlitch">orient itself to the left</a>).
</li><li> <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimilarlyNamedWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimilarlyNamedWorks">not to be confused</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey">the official game of the same name</a>, or a separate <em>Super Mario World</em> ROM hack that implements the official game's capture mechanic) and other <em>Super Mario World</em> hacks using the MSU-1 patch. Why is this? Because with a custom patch, they've managed to get MP3 quality music working on the SNES, as heard/seen <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROgMDo9xk9w">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> Two Wii-based mods: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewerSuperMarioBrosWii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewerSuperMarioBrosWii">Newer Super Mario Bros. Wii</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProjectM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProjectM">Project M</a></em>. The former is a highly extensive mod of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBrosWii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBrosWii">New Super Mario Bros. Wii</a></em> that even manages to surpass the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBrosU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBrosU">official sequel</a> in some ways. The latter is a highly extensive mod of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a> Brawl</em>, intended to both replicate and surpass <em>Melee</em>, and the kicker: It adds two additional slots to the character select screen. Before that was added, modders were only able to have custom characters by replacing existing ones.
</li><li> The only reason why Yoshi was omitted from almost all NES Mario games was because of technical limitations of the time preventing his use within the game. Not only does <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3Mix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3Mix">Super Mario Bros. 3Mix</a></em> implement Yoshi within the engine of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a></em> (a NES Mario game), it also implemented features from later games in the series, such as the gravity mechanic from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackMesa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackMesa">Black Mesa</a></em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanRemake">Fan Remake</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1">Half Life 1</a></em>, constantly pushes the Source Engine to the limit, doing many things that even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ValveSoftware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ValveSoftware">Valve Software</a>, the engine's creators, didn't or couldn't do with it. Unfortunately, due to the sheer taxing of the system, it's not uncommon for the game to slow down even in the most high-end computers, or crash altogether. Fortunately, a few of its developers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedFanboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedFanboy">were hired by Valve</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em> series:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanDoom">Batman Doom</a></em> is a <em>Doom II</em> mod that manages to achieve some truly impressive tricks that would be incredibly difficult to pull off. These tricks includes a moving train, the Killer Croc's ability to pick up and throw rocks, flying helicopters, bigger explosions and much more. All of this was done by ACE Team, a small team of three brothers who went on to make <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZenoClash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZenoClash">Zeno Clash</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockOfAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockOfAges">Rock of Ages</a></em> years later, with DeHackEd and the Doom Engine alone, which was notable for being inflexible for modders at the time.
</li><li> <em>Requiem</em>, a 1997 map pack, manages to use some clever programming to pull off some unusual architectural tricks in <em>Doom</em>'s 2.5D engine that should be impossible given the vanilla engine's limitations &mdash; actual bridges that are not connected to the ground, <em>bridges over bridges</em> that can both be walked on, and simulated sliding and swinging doors.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrutalDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrutalDoom">Brutal Doom</a></em> is an effort by <em>one</em> modder, known in the community as Sergeant_Mark_IV, to take apart Doom and put it back together in a way that's engaging and challenging even for the modern gamer. It has alt-firing weapons, locational damage, dynamic AI, <em>many</em> animations including spectacular deaths and fatalities, improved interactivity with the levels and a host of other features that nobody suspected the Doom engine was capable of. The developer even regularly put up demos on many astounding new features announced in the upcoming versions.
</li><li> Then another lone modder decided <em>Brutal Doom</em>'s modifications weren't radical enough, so he amped everything up to eleven and created <em>Project Brutality</em>. It went through several phases and at some point generated a bitter fight between supporters of it and of its predecessor, which eventually involved the makers - who have since, thankfully, buried the hatchet. <em>Project Brutality</em> is still being actively developed as of 2020, with new features added regularly.
</li><li> <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/megawads/av">Alien Vendetta<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> is another well-known level pack in the Doom community. The project was designed to be fully compatible with Doom 2 Version 1.9 (no source ports are needed to play), which is not a simple feat, considering the limitations on the original engine such as the infamous "VISPLANE OVERFLOW" that crashes the game when there are 128 unique floors and ceilings on the screen at once. However, Alien Vendetta combines well-detailed levels with challenging gameplay, and stretches the original Doom engine to its limits at times. <br>One level that can stress the limits of the engine is <a class="urllink" href="http://doomwiki.org/wiki/MAP20:_Misri_Halek_%28Alien_Vendetta%29">Level 20: Misri Halek<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, a colossal Egyptian pyramid complex taking place mostly underground with a breath-taking number of corridors. <a class="urllink" href="http://doomwiki.org/wiki/MAP25:_Demonic_Hordes_%28Alien_Vendetta%29">Level 25: Demonic Hordes<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> features an incredible swarm of preplaced monsters combined with large cathedrals in open fields for action on par with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SeriousSam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SeriousSam">Serious Sam</a></em>. For being limited by the original Doom engine, the whole level pack is a thrill to look at as well as play.
</li><li> OBLIGE Level Maker allows one to make DOOM level sets in just a few minutes. Random level makers aren't news these days, of course, but what sets OBLIGE apart is the high quality of what it produces all by itself, let alone when you upgrade it with the ObAddon extra pack. Get an unaware player to fight through an urban map - a type particularly hard to convincingly create with the Doom engine - replete with random city features such as shops and park benches and fairly credible street mapping, and they'll probably praise the mapper's skills. It really doesn't look procedurally generated until you play through several maps and start to spot some typical characteristics of semirandom designs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicRoboBlast2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicRoboBlast2">Sonic Robo Blast 2</a></em> may be one of the most celebrated DOOM total conversion mods in the series's history, a complete reworking of the original game into a full-fledged Sonic game.
<ul><li> The special stages go one step further. You think making basically the never-made Sega Saturn 3D Sonic in the Doom engine is impressive? The special stages are basically all new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NightsIntoDreams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NightsIntoDreams">NiGHTS into Dreams...</a> Levels played as Super Sonic.
</li><li> If a full-blown Sonic game in DOOM wasn't enough, someone made a mod of THAT to make <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicRoboBlast2Kart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicRoboBlast2Kart">Sonic Robo Blast 2 Kart</a></em>, a full-fledged <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart">Mario Kart</a></em> clone! Again, <em>in DOOM</em>!
</li><li> The base version of SRB2 uses sprites for characters and some environmental assets, which already look great. One modder, however, has <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_75W7JVH0GY">created low-poly 3D models<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that truly stand out visually. And yes, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8q3z5ZQ5h8">it also works for SRB2 Kart<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> While the aforementioned <em>Sonic Robo Blast 2</em> is an absolute masterwork, its predecessor is also amazing in its own right: by today's standards, the original <em><a class="urllink" href="https://wiki.srb2.org/wiki/Sonic_Robo_Blast">Sonic Robo Blast<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> is very primitive, and even when it was new, it was a buggy and glitchy mess. At the same time, however, it was one of the most expansive Sonic fangames at the time of its creation, which is no small feat considering the limitations of the two gameplay engines it was made in, Clickteam's "Klik &amp; Play" and "The Games Factory". While the graphics may not have been the best due to being made in MS Paint by a relative novice, the game featured over twelve unique zones (plus secret levels), cutscenes, and myriad Easter eggs, from a pong minigame to hidden sound clips from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicTheHedgehogSatAM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicTheHedgehogSatAM">Sonic the Hedgehog (SatAM)</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicTheHedgehogTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicTheHedgehogTheMovie">Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie</a></em>.
</li><li> A (sadly discontinued) NPC mod for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a></em> included a character called Nessa who could manage her own equipment, actively avoid hitting or being hit by the player during combat (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingVideoGameHelper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingVideoGameHelper">common complaint</a> among other NPC companions), and had a complex AI script that determined whether or not she would comply with the player's orders (the highlight of the mod was that she wouldn't always do so for various non-random reasons). You could, for instance, tell her to "rest" outside an Oblivion gate, only for her to get worried about you and follow you inside. Who would have thought that an NPC could actually <em>worry</em> about the player and then act on that impulse?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashFlash">Super Smash Flash</a> 2</em>, a completely fan-made project, has somehow managed to rebuild and port the engine of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1kmd7');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1kmd7" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1kmd7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Remember that <em>Super Smash Bros.

The game was intended in the first place to push the limits of the program, and that it does &mdash; it's progressed so much that it's essentially a console-quality game. Unfortunately, it's still a victim of the program that it runs in, as Flash itself falls <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/IdiotProgramming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/IdiotProgramming">on the other end of the spectrum</a>... that said, though, <em>SSF2</em>'s remarkably efficient for what it does, and slowdown on lower-end computers is fairly minor.
</li><li> Ever since the developers of the Dark Engine (used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SystemShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SystemShock">System Shock</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Thief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Thief">Thief</a></em>) released their mission editor "DromEd", the games have seen a huge number of fan-missions with awesome maps and custom AI. At the point of writing, the number of professional quality fan-missions outnumber the ones made for the games themselves.
</li><li> Behold, the entirety of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">Pok&eacute;mon Red and Blue</a></em>... <a class="urllink" href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/maps/2803888-pokemon-red-fully-recreated-without-mods">Ported to Minecraft.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> No, really, the entire game (besides the music and sounds). It even went as far as to keep some of the glitches. It doesn't even require other mods to work.
</li><li> While there's not that many, there's some mighty impressive <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64">Super Mario 64</a></em> mods out there. For starters, someone <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTG_UJMU-_U">brought over<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGcsVQB1NAA">the gimmicks<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a></em> not too long after they were revealed. Wanna know what's even more impressive? Both of these were coded under an hour. Each.
</li><li> The fan translation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3">Mother 3</a></em> boasts not only a professional quality translation of the game, but also a series of impressive hacks that made it possible to patch the translated text into the game. Needless to say, all of these were accomplished without access to the game's source code. The online <a class="urllink" href="http://mother3.fobby.net/or/">README<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for the project gives a long list of all of these hacks, with many of them featuring comments from the developers that they should have been impossible, but that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible">team managed to accomplish them anyway.</a>
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a></em> Trilogy. It does everything that the Enhanced Versions did, but a decade earlier and without access to the source code. It also runs a helluva lot faster, and is free!

It includes a "making of" level to explain all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGyvering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGyvering">MacGyvering</a> it took to recreate those puzzles on an engine that was clearly not designed for that.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GunpeiYokoi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GunpeiYokoi">Gunpei Yokoi</a> had a philosophy to video game hardware design called "lateral thinking with withered technology": instead of jumping onto the cutting edge of newly developed technology, he espoused the virtue of using technology that is cheap and commonplace in new and creative ways. It is this philosophy that gave rise to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameAndWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameAndWatch">Game &amp; Watch</a> series, using technology that was already commonplace in digital LCD calculators and repurposing them into simple yet fun portable games (with a digital watch built in as well). It was this design philosphy that also gave rise to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy">Game Boy</a>: while other handheld consoles from competitors, like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AtariLynx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AtariLynx">Atari Lynx</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameGear">Game Gear</a>, boasted full color and backlit screens, Yokoi opted instead to use monochromatic graphics. This turned out to be a great boon, as this eased the power requirements of the Game Boy (the Lynx and Game Gear were notorious battery eaters) while providing a portable gaming experience on par with the NES, allowing the Game Boy to not only outlast its competition, but see continued use and development <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">from its debut in 1989 to its discontinuation in 2003 - an impressive fourteen years!</a> Even after his departure from Nintendo and subsequent passing, the company that he helped become a dominant force in the industry still continues to use his philosophy, foregoing cutting-edge graphics in favor of using existing technology in new ways.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrehistorikMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrehistorikMan">Prehistorik Man</a></em>, or rather its Game Boy version. The intro features a full parallax scrolling with layers (the trees are in front of Sam and the text boxes he's dragging, which themselves are in front of the foliage background), on a system with <em>no layers at all</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note25xy6');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note25xy6" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note25xy6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Technically, there's one additional background layer, used here for the text boxes, but it's very limited and has no transparency whatsoever</span>. This is topped off by a track that's more than decent for a Game Boy game.
<ul><li> Each level intro features text scrolling away in 3D, which is done <em>in software</em>, by actually changing the color palette while the screen is being drawn, which requires cycle-perfect accuracy to be properly emulated..
</li><li> The game itself plays pretty well, featuring decent animation for a Game Boy game, as well as some parallax effects that simulate layers.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AladdinCapcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AladdinCapcom">Aladdin (Capcom)</a></em>, in addition to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/NoProblemWithLicensedGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/NoProblemWithLicensedGames">pretty fun in its own right</a>, managed to fit an entire chiptune version of "Friend Like Me" without lyrics for the music in the Genie's Lamp level, as well as "A Whole New World" for the rug ride bonus stage. Impressive, when one considers the music in most other stages are just loops of around forty seconds or so.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Recca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Recca">Recca</a></em> is a fast-paced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">Bullet Hell</a> shooter with awesome graphics, creative bosses, homing weapons and techno music. Even with more than 20+ enemies and bullets on the screen, there is usually little to no slowdown. One must wonder how KiD managed to code something like this <strong>for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem">NES</a></strong>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia">Tales of Phantasia</a></em> may not be ridiculously small in size as far as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperNintendoEntertainmentSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperNintendoEntertainmentSystem">SNES</a> games go, being one of the larger games on the system, but this game pushed the capability of the SNES <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">to its limit</a>. For example,the game's copious amounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn">Scenery Porn</a>, in quantities which were deemed almost impossible for a cartridge (at the time). Then the programming and sound team one-upped all this by... <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3SA9LuqQgA">inserting a whole theme song with voice into the opening<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>! This was completely insane and was thought to be absolutely impossible for a cartridge title, especially one sporting as much visual flash as <em>Phantasia</em>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note35j9v');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note35j9v" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note35j9v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It's also insane from a technical perspective, too: the song itself is <em>dozens</em> of tiny voice clips, since that's all that will fit into the available sound memory, swapped out and loaded in sequence from the ROM cart as the song plays. Getting it to emulate cleanly was an infamous bugbear of the emu scene in the late '90s and early '00s (as the code makes a number of odd calls to the SPU to make the constant file-swapping work), and it uses more than a little compression on top of this, and "can cleanly emulate <em>Phantasia</em>" was a major feather in the caps of ZSNES and SNES9x.</span> Every Tales game since has a theme song, but it's all less impressive when more memory, both in RAM and storage, is involved. Almost every technical concept from <em>ToP</em> was then imported into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOcean1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOcean1">Star Ocean</a></em> (which featured many of the same staff, who had left Wolf Team/Namco in the interim) which was even <em>more</em> technically bonkers: while it didn't have a full vocal song like <em>Tales</em> did, its introductory cutscene was <em>fully voiced</em>!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em>
<ul><li> The first game in the series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsArena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsArena">The Elder Scrolls: Arena</a></em>, was an impressive early feat in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProceduralGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProceduralGeneration">Procedural Generation</a> for games, with a massive world filled with dozens of towns, hundreds of dungeons, and innumerable NPCs in addition to a full-fledged day/night cycle. The sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIDaggerfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIDaggerfall">The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall</a></em> has a 62,394 square mile world which takes <em>two weeks</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">real time</a></em> to walk across, over 500,000 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPCs</a> in 15,000 locations.

This necessitated some genius programming utilizing a little known trick - a background reboot of the system. Once the system memory is nearly full, the game puts up a loading screen while <em>rebooting the Xbox in the background</em>. This clears the memory, allowing you to keep playing, while explaining some of those <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfLoading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfLoading">excessive 3+ minute loads</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a></em> featured the first appearance of Bethesda's "Radiant AI", highly sophisticated NPC AI that makes each character in the game's world, down to the lowliest serf, a fully-fledged character. The system essentially gives NPCs a list of tasks to undertake throughout the day, like "Eat a meal at 2 PM" for instance, and gives them broad latitude in how to accomplish these tasks. In the case of eating a meal: one NPC may eat this meal at home at the appointed time, but if you stole the food from their house, they will venture out to procure more food. In so doing, they may put themselves in danger contending with monsters or bandits. With NPCs given freedom to achieve tasks in whatever way they see fit, Radiant AI helps to give the world of the game an organic and natural feeling. The tech would later be used and improved upon in further games, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skyrim">Skyrim</a></em>.

Yet the whole thing is about five megabytes. On top of that, all the programming is done by one guy. Who describes himself as "not very good with computers". Holy crap.

It's the game which launched the entire genre of Space Trading Sims. It was quite literally years ahead of its time and it's also one of the first commercially released 3D games, yet the whole thing fits on <em>~20 kilobytes</em> of disk space. <br>The low disk space usage is because all content (planet names, their coordinates, commodity prices, etc) in the game was procedurally generated and, basically, boils down to the single 8-bit seed number and a couple of rules checking that you won't get planets named "Fuck" or "Arse."
</li><li> The game's NES port is no less impressive. It features <em>3D vector graphics</em> on an 8-bit system, long before the Super FX and other console 3D accelerators. The unreleased <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy">Game Boy</a> version <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFEtHJYs3mo">is just as impressive<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> The sequel, <em>Frontier</em>, isn't too shabby either. The PC version has over 20 textured 3D models and enough star systems to fill the entire Milky Way, yet fits on a single 1.4MiB floppy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EliteDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EliteDangerous">Elite: Dangerous</a></em> continues the tradition, using cloud computing to create a full-scale replica of the Milky Way.

And all this could run on a PC made in the early '90s, without lag. The secret is that the system was <em>programmed in raw assembly language</em>, only relying on more high-level code for graphical stuff. The performance of <em>RCT 1</em> and <em>2</em> is even more impressive compared to the third iteration, which had widespread graphics card compatibility problems and brought many contemporaneous systems to their knees. Hell, many 2009 PCs struggle when everything is maxed.
</li><li> Raw assembly programming allowed ZSNES to run games at full speed well before its competition. Though it has been outclassed by more modern emulators and fell out of favor with the emulation scene due to compatibility issues and newer emulators like <em>bsnes</em> preferring more machine-accurate emulation, the ZSNES was still ahead of its time for its efficiency and speed, and to this day still being used for some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanTranslation">Fan Translation</a> patched games that won't work on newer machine-accurate emulators.

With a RAM expansion, the game could even play voice samples on that same hardware! You think that's impressive?

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BelowTheRoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BelowTheRoot">Below the Root</a></em> for the Commodore 64 was one of the earliest games where you could pick the gender, race, and age of your avatar &mdash; with stats altered accordingly, and with <em>hidden</em> stats that fit the race in question. Erdlings got knocked for a loop by Wissenberries, whereas Kindar had a tolerance, and Kindar took a hit to their spirit stats by eating meat. It also had NPC characters respond differently based on which avatar you chose. It was also, very possibly, the first game to be considered an authorized, canonical sequel to material written for another medium. Yes, the distant ancestor of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheForceUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheForceUnleashed">The Force Unleashed</a></em> is a 1984 side-scroller where killing anyone makes the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a>.

Made at the tail end of the handheld's lifespan, the developers at Way Forward wanted to get their passion project out in any way they could. In an era where most handheld games were either first party games released early or barely passable licensed games, <em>Shantae</em> features a bright and expressive range of colors, very detailed sprites for all the characters, a large and witty script that had an admittedly silly but still fairly involved plot, each NPC has quite a few frames of animation and gestures, Shantae herself had very smooth movements that would make several Advance games jealous. She didn't just make a few token steps, she belly dances, whips her flowing hair around, and even winks at the screen. The music pushes the sound to the absolute limit, and it's a full on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metroidvania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metroidvania">Metroidvania</a> crossed with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhythmGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhythmGame">Rhythm Game</a> with an involved day and night cycle similar to <em>Simon's Quest</em>.

</li><li> The programming team behind <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpyroYearOfTheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpyroYearOfTheDragon">Spyro: Year of the Dragon</a></em> had a unique insight into preventing piracy: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesOfTheInternet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesOfTheInternet">You can't.</a> However, it doesn't matter, because 30-50% of the sales of a game are made in the first two months. So, with the goal of slowing down pirates as much as possible, the developers started by designing "crack protection," distinct from the normal copy protection (which detects whether the game is run on a CD-R). The crack protection they came up with relies on a checksumming system that's ingenious and more than slightly twisted; by interleaving, overlapping, and combining multiple checksums over a block of data, it's virtually impossible to make them all add up if even one bit is changed, but because not every checksum goes over all of the data (and because CRC has a few exploitable weaknesses), the checksums being compared to <em>can be a part of the data being checksummed</em>. This, combined with tons of other traps designed to make life hell for pirates, meant that it took over <em>two months</em> for a working crack to finally be released (at a time when "Wow, that hasn't been cracked yet?" meant something like four days), and only <em>then</em> because the developers held back to avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfLoading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfLoading">Loads and Loads of Loading</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4bxap');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4bxap" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4bxap');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">More specifically: The copy protection takes 10 seconds of uninterrupted access to the disc drive, so it's only done on startup (the wait time is disguised by the studio logos being shown). The final crack worked by hacking the game's boot executable to bypass the copy protection, then reloading the correct binary file, which makes the crack protection happy. If the copy protection had been run during every load time, this method wouldn't have worked, as the copy protection would have been triggered at that point. However, the developers wisely decided that adding 10 seconds to every load time would have made the game unplayable regardless of whether it was a crack or a legal copy.</span> <br>The whole renderer in the Spyro games. It managed to do things on the PlayStation that should have been literally impossible, including implementing an entire LOD system on the CPU and having it run in real time.
</li><li> Denuvo Anti-Tamper basically uses the same method as Spyro: Year of the Dragon above, but benefits highly due to the common <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PowersOfTwoMinusOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PowersOfTwoMinusOne">x64 architecture</a> of PC nowadays and avoids the aforementioned 10 seconds access.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XComUFODefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XComUFODefense">X Com UFO Defense</a></em>, released in 1994, was programmed to run on an Intel 80386, a microprocessor released in <strong>1985</strong>. The game's AI only takes up a few scant kilobytes of space. To this day, lead programmer Julian Gollop still can't recall exactly how he was able to pull off creating a full-fledged in-depth strategy game under these conditions!
</li><li> The original 1.0 release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> was, to put it generously, hot garbage. So dismal was its reception that Square-Enix fired key members of the development team and put together a new team to try and salvage the latest iteration in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">soul-sunderingly popular</a> <em>Final Fantasy</em> series. Enter Naoki Yoshida, who was put to the unenviable task of trying to salvage FFXIV. He managed to make great strides in improving FFXIV, including streamlined battles, instanced dungeons, and a vastly better story questline. Eventually, it became clear that there were limits to how much improvement could be made to the game as it was, so Yoshida decided to scrap the game entirely, discontinuing service in 2012, and set about rebuilding the game from scratch (while still maintaining the original game until it was shut down). In 2013, the fruits of his labor were released: the remade game, subtitled "A Realm Reborn", was practically a completely different game, a <em>better</em> game which has remained active since and enjoys ongoing mainstream success.

As the game was developed in a time when floating-point arithmetic was relatively slow, this code significantly speeds up the calculation of 1/&radic;x by performing a magic calculation on the bytes of the floating-point number interpreted as if it was an integer. It is very much not obvious what this code even does, hence the "what the fuck?" comment. The last line, an iteration of Newton's method, makes much more sense in comparison. The algorithm runs roughly <em>four times</em> faster than traditional implementations, and still faster than other "optimized" algorithms of the time.
<ul><li> Just the fact that the games themselves (including Q3A) are programmed in plain C, as opposed of the widely-spread C++. Id co-founder John Romero <a class="urllink" href="https://www.mcvuk.com/10-development-commandments-that-led-doom-dev-id-software-to-change-the-games-industry/">gave once a speech<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in which he revealed some of Id's old approaches to coding for the games, which may shed some light on their code being <em>that</em> good:
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <em>&#147;No prototypes. Just make the game. Polish as you go. Don&#146;t depend on polish happening later. Always maintain constantly shippable code.

Bulletproof your engine by providing defaults upon load failure.&#148;</em> <br><em>&#147;Keep your code absolutely simple. Keep looking at your functions and figure out how you can simply further. We made everything up to Quake in plain C, not C++.&#148;</em> <br><em>&#147;Great tools help make great games. Spend as much time on tools as possible.

<ul><li> Nintendo has quite a history with impressively small file sizes for their games, and it continues to this day with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Nintendo Switch</a>. In an era where many triple-A titles can be upwards of 60 to 100 GB in size, with 20 to 30 GB being considered "small", Nintendo has managed to keep many of their big titles quite compact.

While <em>The Wind Waker</em> is predominantly cel-shaded, the tower pictured is <em>realistically</em> shaded&mdash;but the red dot near the bottom of the picture is cel-shaded. The game can run <em>two lighting systems at the same time</em> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube">a system without programmable shaders</a>! Even in regular gameplay, large landforms like the tower are real-shaded to emulate the matte backgrounds of animated movies.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em> pulls off a crazy amount of real-time effects, which most other games would have kept pre-baked, on the underpowered and outdated Wii U. There's Mie scattering for sky color and clouds, atmospheric moisture simulation for rainbows and optical halos, full-on volumetric lighting and shadows, soil erosion variables for sea foam, and an unnecessarily realistic lens flare that takes into account aperture, light intensity, and light scattering. Oh, and there's physically-based rendering for materials, light-probe based global illumination, screen-space reflections within shrines, Unreal Engine Scene Capture 2D - style reflections in the overworld, and sub-surface scattering for translucent materials. And it's all toon-shaded. Honestly, the physics engine is one of the less impressive features of the game.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a> Brawl</em> runs cel-shading and realistic shading at the same time. All the trophies related to <em>The Wind Waker</em>, with the exception of the Toon Link trophy (which is technically part of <em>Brawl</em>, not <em>The Wind Waker</em>; Toon Link himself is also not cel-shaded), are cel-shaded in the same style as in <em>The Wind Waker</em>. However, the trophy bases are realistically shaded. Like the GameCube, the Wii does not have programmable shaders (because its hardware is based on the GameCube's).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros4">Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS</a></em> is an impressive feat in squeezing out every ounce of a modestly powerful handheld console's capabilities to deliver a game experience on par with consoles. The game runs at 60 frames per second, even with 3D on, and the characters remain as fluidly animated as they would be on the Wii U (aside from Assist Trophies, summoned Pokemon, and Olimar's Pikmin). Pulling this off required so much power from the 3DS that base models of the console were practically incapable of doing anything but play the game until it was closed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/TokimekiMemorial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/TokimekiMemorial">Tokimeki Memorial</a></em> received Game Boy Color adaptations. On the one hand, the limitations of the system meant that the full roster of girls could not be included in one cart, necessitating the release of two different versions with the cast of girls spread across them. On the other hand, <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/dmhFksQAnGI?t=121">the games have voice acting<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>! <em>On a Game Boy!</em>

Hundreds of planets, all unique, dozens of alien races, an epic backstory, and a quest to Save The Galaxy. And it all fit on a <em>single</em> 720K floppy disk, or two 360K floppies. Might have something to do with the fact that it was programmed in Forth &mdash; an efficient but difficult programming language nobody really meant for games which, aside from Starflight itself, was mostly used in low-level computer firmware and <em>space applications</em>.

<ul><li> The title and ending tracks were made of MOD format music. To clarify, the Yamaha YM2612 has very limited sample support due to only having a single 8-bit DAC for this purpose, which must be written to in real time because of no on-chip sample memory, but the MOD format consists <em>entirely of sound samples!</em> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5f5pr');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5f5pr" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5f5pr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3m3JrVImmU">A video<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> shows that the workaround for the limitations of the sound capabilities of the Z80 CPU (i.e. the fact that the Z80 CPU couldn't receive data <em>and</em> play audio simultaneously, the delays produced by which usually being the culprit of scratchy-sounding PCM audio in some Genesis games) was to limit the data being transferred at the time to minimize the quality loss, instead utilizing lookup tables to assist in combining the frequencies of overlapping samples.</span> <br>This is similar to how music in most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a> games works. The GBA has only two PCM channels and no sample memory for playing sample-based music, so samples are handled by CPU-side sound engines that play, modulate and mix samples in real time.
</li><li> The graphics are incredibly well made, featuring lots of animation frames and even a 3D floor effect without slowdown or sprite flicker. This also goes for the Super Nintendo version.
</li><li> But the crowning technical achievement has to be the Genesis version of the level <em>Really Inside the Claw Machine</em>. One thing the Genesis lacks is the ability to scale or rotate sprites. So what does Traveller's Tales do? <em>Create an entire level in first person view akin to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wolfenstein3D" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wolfenstein3D">Wolfenstein 3D</a>!</em> With texture mapped walls and a solid framerate (for its time), it's astounding what Traveller's Tales was able to accomplish with such hardware limitations.

He did this by using the same background for every room of the maze. The background had exits in every possible direction. The exits that weren't supposed to be open in a particular room were covered up with overlays. To hide the fact that it was always the same background, he mirrored it, along with the overlays, every time you left the room. This also saved a lot of memory and disk space.

</li><li> Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to introduce you to the late, great <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SatoruIwata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SatoruIwata">Satoru Iwata</a>, once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo">Nintendo</a>'s global president and the acting president of HAL Laboratory earlier still. When he was younger, he <a class="urllink" href="http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/3ds/creators/4/0">disassembled the programs for his home computer by writing down the memory dumps by hand.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Mind you, this was before printers. Among his achievements as a game programmer, he...
<ul><li> ... ported the battle code of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonStadium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonStadium">Pok&eacute;mon Stadium</a></em> to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64">Nintendo 64</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/news/iwata/iwata_asks_-_pokmon_heartgold_version__soulsilver_version_16288_16289.html">despite not having any access to crucial documents. And he did it all in a week.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> ... completely rewrote the programming of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em> after previous programming work failed to produce a working game, also with remarkable speed. At the time, the project was very close to being jettisoned due to the unmanageability of the original coding. The coding he used is a huge scripting language, so complex that, theoretically, <a class="urllink" href="http://earthboundcentral.com/2011/04/a-look-at-the-mother-2-side/">the text system alone could be used to write an emulator, if altered somewhat.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> ... compressed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">Pok&eacute;mon Gold and Silver</a></em>, which filled the cartridge despite only being half-finished. This was the whole reason that almost the entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">Kanto region</a> was able to be included in the games (it was present as early as 1997, but before Iwata's intervention it was heavily condensed to just the size of a large city). There was <em>that much</em> space left after he was done.
</li><li> ... debugged <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em> all by his lonesome. It only took him two weeks&mdash;which was all the time he had to get it out.
</li><li> And last but not least, as revealed after his unfortunate passing, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.siliconera.com/2015/12/30/how-satoru-iwatas-zealous-work-helped-in-the-unlikely-localization-of-pokmon/">Iwata was basically responsible for Pok&eacute;mon being localized.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> As is was revealed, he reviewed the source code for the origianl games and mapped out for how to make a localized version of it. Game Freak wanted to move over to the next generation in the series at that point, but Iwata insisted on doing the development work for the localization with just Teruki Murukawa assisting him. What made this surprising is that Iwata was <em>the company president of HAL Laboratory at the time</em>. Without Iwata, <em>Pok&eacute;mon</em> would not be a global phenomenon that it is today. Rest in peace, you wonderful man.
</li></ul></li><li> While being more known as a game designer than a game programmer, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasahiroSakurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasahiroSakurai">Masahiro Sakurai</a> programmed the enemy patterns in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysDreamLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysDreamLand">Kirby's Dream Land</a></em> <em>entirely in hexadecimal</em> <em><strong>with nothing but a trackball</strong></em> on a custom Famicom IDE. What makes this even more impressive is that each enemy has its own individual path.
</li><li> Naughty Dog loves to show off their technical prowess.
<ul><li> Sony &amp; Microsoft's seventh and eighth generation game consoles are almost infamous for requiring data installs, as searching for and loading information off a high-capacity Blu-Ray Disc would result in extremely long load times... or so people thought. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uncharted2AmongThieves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uncharted2AmongThieves">Uncharted 2: Among Thieves</a></em> required absolutely no installation, and the only loading time you would see is when the game starts up (about 10 seconds), and when you start or continue a game (again, about 10 seconds). The rest of the game loads seamlessly, not stopping for <em>anything</em>, including area transitions, from start to finish.
</li><li> The iconic scene in the same game, the train sequence, is also a marvel of technical engineering. In addition to adjusting the physics to account for the fact that Drake's on a train, the entire sequence, from the start in the jungles to the end in the snowy mountains, has no repeated environments. Every single view and vista is unique, and waiting long enough for, say, the point where it's curving around a lake or mountain, will eventually give you alternate views of the location as your position shifts. And to top it all off, you can see the train curving ahead of you in the distance: you <em>can</em> reach all of those cars, and eventually will.
</li><li> They cut their teeth on the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot1996" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot1996">Crash Bandicoot</a></em>. They developed it as a PlayStation 1 exclusive, and when it came out, it was so much better than anyone had ever managed to accomplish on the console that other developers cried foul, insisting that Naughty Dog had used secret libraries provided by Sony to them and them alone. The opposite was true: they used as little as possible of Sony's stuff, and essentially hacked as much of the game as possible to run as close to the hardware as they could make it, effectively developing their own development as they went. The result was <em>way</em> ahead of what anyone had managed on the meagre (even for the times) power of the PlayStation 1. You can read about many of the tricks they used in <a class="urllink" href="http://all-things-andy-gavin.com/2011/02/02/making-crash-bandicoot-part-1/">Andy Gavin's postmortem<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for the game. <br>A standout example is loading in polygons just before they're on-screen rather than everything in the level (the effects of which are plainly visible when forcing a widescreen resolution on the game), allowing lush environments with more in them in one screen than entire levels in other games of the day. This technique also solved performance issues in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateTheSimpleSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateTheSimpleSolution">much cruder manner</a>; got slowdown when coming over the crest of a hill? Stick a big fat leaf in the way so that half the stuff won't load until it's out of shot!
</li><li> As another example to prove how much of a technical achievement they pulled with this game, Crash's model is one full mesh. May not sound special since this can be done so easily today, but at the time of early 3D games, characters used multiple meshs to make up the model, causing certain parts of the model (like limbs) to look so blocky. What Naughty Dog did to get is that they had to invent assembly language to pull the vertices in certain ways to animate the model. You can see the model up close in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3Rjg8JGa9w&amp;t=0m37s">this video,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that covered the aforementioned note.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MickeyMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MickeyMania">Mickey Mania</a></em> pulled off some impressive perspective tricks in a number of its levels, with stages such as a <em>Nebulus</em>-style rotating tower and a head-on moose chase. Not so much of a big deal on the SNES, with its GPU support for background perspective in Mode 7. It <em>is</em>, however, a big deal on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis</a>, where all of these effects had to be emulated <strong>in software</strong>...
</li><li> While the feat was never completed during the Super NES's official run, someone managed to convert <em>Road Blaster</em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DataEast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DataEast">Data East</a>-developed laserdisk game, into <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YuWwoeAxCk">a fully-working SNES ROM<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. The technology that made this feat possible, the MSU-1 Media Enhancement Chip, was developed well after the SNES was discontinued and was mostly used to add MP3-quality music to existing games, but <em>Super Road Blaster</em> demonstrates the chip's ability to support <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullMotionVideo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullMotionVideo">Full Motion Video</a> as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JettRocket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JettRocket">Jett Rocket</a></em> set the standard for what could be done with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiWare">WiiWare</a>'s 44 megabyte limit. To most developers, this is a cripplingly small amount, and they deem it unreasonable and unworkable. Shin'en Multimedia created a full-length 3D platformer on it that looks and plays like a retail game.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenCroshaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenCroshaw">Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw</a> created the side-scrolling action/stealth platform games <em>1213</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheArtOfTheft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheArtOfTheft">The Art of Theft</a></em> using Adventure Game Studio, a game engine designed for point-and-click adventure games and nothing else.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CannonFodder">Cannon Fodder</a></em> on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyColor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyColor">Game Boy Color</a> seems like just another GBC title, until the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKjTCSikTus">intro sequence<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> explodes into a <em>full-color pre-rendered FMV</em>. Adding to that, all music, voice clips, and sound effects are fully recorded, with not a single 8-bit bleep in the game. The method used to display full-color video on the Game Boy Color is quite ingenious. Because it can only display a few colors at a time, each frame of video alternates between different color palettes. The frames alternate faster than the human eye can pick up, creating the illusion of a much larger set of colors.
</li><li> The unusual arcade game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PuLiRuLa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PuLiRuLa">Pu&middot;Li&middot;Ru&middot;La</a></em> is very colorful and packs in a lot of detail in both sprites and backgrounds. Animations are very fluid, and the game even includes some voice clips. And it runs on hardware weaker than that of the SNES! The level of animation and detail is more akin to a <em>modern Flash game</em> than an arcade game from 1990.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackAndWhite">Black &amp; White</a></em> had the Creature AI that could make your "pet" learn new skills and develop its own preferences. Famously, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterMolyneux" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterMolyneux">Peter Molyneux</a> was demonstrating the game to potential buyers when the Creature did something like throwing a rock over its shoulder. Molyneux was surprised &mdash; he never programmed <em>that</em> subroutine in the game.
</li><li> One of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RogueSquadron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RogueSquadron">Star Wars: Rogue Squadron II</a></em>'s claims to fame is its use of the GameCube's TEV (Texture EnVironment) pipeline to create the shader used for spacecraft targeting computers. The only catch (as mentioned with Wind Waker above) is that the GameCube does not <em>have</em> programmable shaders! Programming a shader in hardware that does not support programmable shaders is quite impressive. The game was also developed in little over a year in order to be released as a GameCube launch title. Despite the lack of development time, the quality of the finished game was still incredible, and to this day it is widely considered the best of the series.
<ul><li> The Nintendo 64 version of the original Rogue Squadron also deserves a mention in that it contains over 80 minutes of high quality stereo sound and 40 minutes of voice acting on an N64 cartridge. This is due to that Factor 5 programmed their own sound drivers and advanced compression software to squeeze all that data into a 14MB ROM.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>:
<ul><li> Most of the classic side-scroller <em>Sonic</em> games qualify for this. Not only did the Genesis/Mega Drive not support transparent textures (It was given the illusion of transparent textures by rapidly alternating between one frame of one sprite and another frame of another sprite), it also didn't support sprite rotations. It also didn't have any Mode-7-esque effects to speak of. In order to create panning backgrounds that moved at different speeds to give the illusion of depth, the devs layered textures on top of each other and had then move at different speeds and directions, among other creative <a class="urllink" href="https://s3unlocked.blogspot.com/2017/05/extra-layers-via-tile-replacement.html">background<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://s3unlocked.blogspot.com/2017/07/the-25d-waterline.html">trickery<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Additionally, the physics were <em>really</em> impressive for the time; many people's jaws dropped when they came across their first loop-de-loop. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles">Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles</a></em> in particular was able to seamlessly transition between acts seemingly without moving the player character or swapping out any visible art, by way of tricks such as placing a perfect replica of the end of one area at the start of the next one and making sure that any art which is swapped out isn't visible during the transition (by, for instance, swapping out the background while the character is going through a tunnel which obscures said background). And as for how well optimized the games themselves were, in the first game, the "SE-GA" jingle at the beginning used one-eighth of the space of the four-megabit (approximately 512KB) cartridge. This is to be expected from the expert programmer Yuji Naka, given that <a class="urllink" href="http://sonic.wikia.com/wiki/Yuji_Naka">this is the man who created a NES emulator for the Genesis<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingItForTheArt">in his spare time, for fun</a>.

And when it crashes, it doesn't even <em>look</em> like anything has gone wrong - the game just takes the player to the level select screen, while congratulating them on finding a "secret".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicR">Sonic R</a></em> is a technical wonder, displaying effects believed impossible on the Saturn like distance fading, transparent polygons or environment mapping. And that's to say nothing of the environments, which were extremely detailed and vibrant, putting other contemporary racing games to shame and holding up against some of the best looking Nintendo 64 games.

As .PNG's, the animation frames for six different characters adds up to around 10.5 GB. With the compression tech made by Mike (<a class="urllink" href="http://www.twitch.tv/eightysixed/b/463593588?&amp;t=3h8m25s">based on a paper made by Farbrausch<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>), the characters only take up around <em>900 MB</em>, with 491 MB of that being used in any given match, which then has to fit into the 130 MB of RAM left over for the characters on the PS3.

The system had negligible capabilites, but he managed to pull off sampling and proper wave forms (as opposed to square waves) by stripping the machine open and putting a voltmeter across the sound chip. <br>If modern players are amazed by the ability in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMansSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMansSky">No Man's Sky</a></em> to easily lift your ship off from one planet, into space, and to another planet, without any loading or breaks, then think how amazed they were when <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarGlider2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarGlider2">Star Glider 2</a></em> had the same feature in 1988, on the Commodore Amiga 500, a machine with 1mb of RAM. <br>Jez San was notorious for using ridiculously low-level engineering techniques on home computers to achieve the otherwise impossible. He was infamous for asking representatives of computer manufacturers at trade shows if he could have a version of the computer <em>with no Operating System</em>, because it'd be easier for him to program.

Leaving aside the fact that there are about three or four overlapping stories, the magical system relies on the ability to write down spells. Not only that, but the English translation is even more so, bordering on incredible. You can type the basic words given, like "Lefna". You can add prefixes and suffixes. You can write English words, like Heal, Healing, Cure, Earth, Fire, Water, Air, Angel, Heaven, Hell, Jade, etc. You can also write Japanese versions of these words, at least to an extent. All of this from an English key input translation. Let this sink in....
</li><li> It's already impressive enough that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade">Xenoblade</a></em> manages to cram in the absurd amount of content that it does into a single disc. What's even more impressive is the game's ability to load entire maps seamlessly (already no small feat considering how huge and full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn">Scenery Porn</a> they are) complete with numerous enemies and collectible objects, to transition in and out of battle without a hitch while maintaining fairly constant framerate, and instantly travel throughout every single map in the entire game with minimal loading times. What's particularly baffling is how <em>Xenoblade</em> manages to achieve what smaller games on more powerful systems often fail to do while being run on hardware that was already considered dated at the time it was released. <br>Its descendant, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChroniclesX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChroniclesX">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a></em>, does not disappoint, containing a full campaign, full equipment and enemy listings, and a world bigger than <em>Skyrim</em>, <em>Wild Hunt</em>, and <em>Fallout 4</em> <strong>combined</strong> on a single Wii U disc's worth of space. While data packs exist for the game, they merely accelerate internal processes; the entire game's essentials are on the one disc, and everything is still as seamless as its predecessor.
</li><li> Someone managed to create a game resembling <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal">Portal</a></em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a>. What makes that so special? The game contains fully 3D environments, with <em>working physics</em>, and even renders the view through portals. As if that wasn't enough, this is a homebrew game made without access to Nintendo's official SDK, using information gained from reverse engineering. Despite this, it's more advanced than most official games. You can <a class="urllink" href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/aperture-science-ds-new-nds-homebrew.353315/">download it here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8bavc');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note8bavc" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8bavc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In order to play this on an actual Nintendo DS, you'll need a flash cartridge, but those have become quite cheap.

Despite the fact Cybiko is a texting device that has a black-and-white LCD screen (which is meant to run 2D images, much like the Game.com), <em>CyRace 2</em> is a <em>full-fledged 3D game</em>. And this is from a device that was released in the early 2000s, where the specs for the platform are so low it couldn't run something like this without it stuttering.

Yes, you read that right.

In fact, they even managed to add a physics engine into the game for the actual outfield play. All this on an engine originally designed for scripting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureGame">point-and-click adventures</a> like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ManiacMansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ManiacMansion">Maniac Mansion</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSecretOfMonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSecretOfMonkeyIsland">The Secret of Monkey Island</a></em>, and absolutely nothing else.

The game renders a big, photorealistic open map with dynamic weather in real time, all the while the game uses Denuvo Anti-Tamper, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PowersofTwoMinusOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PowersofTwoMinusOne">x64 based copy protection made by the same firm as Securom yet without its flaws...</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/IdiotProgramming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/IdiotProgramming">until a version in 2017 anyway</a>.

</li><li> On the same note about the use of Denuvo Anti-Tamper and its nonexistent negative effect on performance overall, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom2016">DOOM (2016)</a></em>, although the raw performance demands something higher than The Phantom Pain above, are also known to be well-optimized (even without the dedicated graphics card drivers). Up to Eleven when support for the cutting-edge Vulkan API was patched in, with rigs with supported graphics cards reaching upwards of 200 frames per second at 1080p with the visuals maxed out. Eventually the Denuvo in the PC version of the DOOM executable was patched out (although it still uses Steam DRM) come the end of 2016 with little notice. Sadly though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/IdiotProgramming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/IdiotProgramming">this might be not the case anymore as of 2017</a>, as several high profile games using the newer version of the Denuvo such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken7">Tekken 7</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicMania">Sonic Mania</a></em> are considered to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster">Porting Disaster</a> that might be tied from the protection module of the newer versions of Denuvo.
</li><li> As ridiculous as it sounds, most games on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atari2600" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atari2600">Atari 2600</a> qualify as this. The system specs made it capable for running for simple, symmetrical games like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pong">Pong</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Combat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Combat">Combat</a></em>. Many developers found ways to bypass the limitations of the 2600 and did <em>a lot</em> of impressive stuff with it:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeFromTheMindmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeFromTheMindmaster">Escape From The Mindmaster</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxFirstPerson3D" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxFirstPerson3D">Faux First-Person 3D</a> with smooth movement from square to square.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceInvaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceInvaders">Space Invaders</a></em> port <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">had it up to 39 player objects and four shots on the screen at once</a>, with no extra RAM or other special chips on the cartridge. It was doing things that nobody <em>ever</em> would have dreamed of having been possible on the Atari 2600.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Adventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Adventure">Adventure</a></em> not only takes the honor of being the first console action-adventure game, but had a world composed of 30 screens and was able to keep track of all of them at once.
</li><li> The homebrew scene took note of this with <a class="urllink" href="http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=R1G_si-9fgE">"The Byte Before Christmas"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, which pushes the systems aesthetics to their limits; in a true rarity, the characters not mainly feature fluent animation principles like overlapping animation, but the game "Bell Hopper" features fluid parallax scrolling&mdash;on a system that didn't support scrolling, and should have been impossible to perform it on!
</li><li> Even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PacMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PacMan">Pac-Man</a></em> of all games achieved it on the same system with so many objects from pellets, ghost and the titular character himself running at the same time. This is only talking about the game on a technical aspect, because as a video game, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster">nothing worth bragging about</a>. <br>The 2600 ports of <em>Ms. Pac-Man</em> and <em>Jr. Pac-Man</em> are huge improvements from the <em>Pac-Man</em> port. Dennis Debro also made a homebrew version of <em>Pac-Man</em> on the 2600 called <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAYuBcuvIww">Pac-Man 4K<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, which is a much better port that uses the same 4-kilobyte size limit as the official one, and would later be included on the second version of the Atari Flashback Portable.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://www.wired.com/2013/07/princess-rescue/">fan port<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em>, which replicated the gameplay style very admirably. It floored <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesRolfe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesRolfe">James Rolfe</a> when he and Mike tried it on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/JamesAndMikeMondays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/JamesAndMikeMondays">James and Mike Mondays</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/J0uxnSXAoek?t=3">A 2018 homebrew port<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of the arcade game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mappy">Mappy</a></em> is worthy of mention. It's quite faithful to the arcade game on which it's based, complete with nicely drawn character sprites and a full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarWorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarWorm">Ear Worm</a> soundtrack!
</li></ul></li><li> Early games in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> series had to contend with loading that threatened to break the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivalHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivalHorror">Survival Horror</a> games' tense pacing. To get around this issue, the developers showed animations of doors opening whenever players traveled between separate areas, disguising the load times while keeping the pace. As the series progressed, developers even managed to throw curveballs by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare">having zombies attack the player through the doors on occasion</a>, increasing the tension further.
</li><li> The Nintendo 64 version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2">Resident Evil 2</a></em> is/was noteworthy for squeezing a two-disc PlayStation game (1.2 GB), filled with voiced dialogue and full-motion video cutscenes, on a 64 MB cartridge, fully intact. Only the cutscenes took a slight hit, but besides that, it's still considered the one of the best versions of the game.
</li><li> On the subject of squeezing two-disc Playstation games onto tiny cartridges, a <em>Game Boy Color port</em> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil1">Resident Evil</a></em> was in the works. The game would never be finished or officially released, but <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRCd2VVmLXw">from what can be seen from the prototype ROM<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, it was an impressive effort that managed to replicate much of the original game's gameplay on the GBC: the tank-style controls and static camera angles remain intact, sprites scale realistically as characters move towards or away from the camera, and even the series's iconic "door opening" loading screens are faithfully recreated.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsChainOfMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsChainOfMemories">Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories</a></em> had full FMV opening and closing scenes that matched the quality of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI">original PS2 game</a>. On a GBA cart. They managed to do the impossible by essentially turning the FMV into one incredibly long GIF sequence.

Even their first and less technically impressive N64 game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KillerInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KillerInstinct">Killer Instinct</a> Gold</em>, was still noteworthy for running at 60FPS on a console where that almost never happened. Following that was the huge size of both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64">Donkey Kong 64</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoTooie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoTooie">Banjo-Tooie</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs">impressive splatter effects</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JetForceGemini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JetForceGemini">Jet Force Gemini</a></em>, and most impressively, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ConkersBadFurDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ConkersBadFurDay">Conker's Bad Fur Day</a></em>, which had some of the best graphics, most fluid animations and furthest draw distance of any N64 game, all while still managing to cram in full voice acting, of which there's a ton of. The impressive part? All these games had to be crammed into N64 cartridges, which could hold 64MB at the most, and yet some of these games, especially Conker, still look better than some early PS2 or Dreamcast releases.

You can learn more about <em>ROTT</em>'s engine in the 1997 article, "<a class="urllink" href="http://archive.kontek.net/rott.classicgaming.gamespy.com/hell/">ROTT in Hell<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShinyEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShinyEntertainment">Shiny Entertainment</a>'s 1997 third-person shooter <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MDK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MDK">MDK</a></em> not only contains graphics that were very impressive for the time, the game engine also allowed huge environments with unlimited draw distance, allowing the player to fully utilize the sniper mode with 100x zoom. Loading between areas is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicLoading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicLoading">cleverly disguised with tunnels connecting them</a>; the only actual loading screens are between levels and they are very brief. Despite all of this, the game had some really modest system requirements even by the standards of its time. It was designed to run consistently with minimum 30FPS with measly 60MHz Pentium and 16MB RAM, without any additional GPU requirements as the graphics ran entirely by software rendering (although patches were released to add support for most hardware-based rendering APIs). They utilized some incredibly simple yet elegant optimization tricks to achieve this, such as making the player character a 2D sprite instead of actual 3D model (which worked so well that many players didn't even notice it!) and intentionally leaving some surfaces black with no textures and shading, which also worked as a part of the unique graphical style of the game. The developers also had to <em>write their own programming language</em> for the game because they were doing things that no one had ever even attempted to do before.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SystemShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SystemShock">System Shock</a></em>, released in September 1994 (for reference, the same month as <em>Doom II</em>, several months before <em>Marathon</em>, and a year before <em>Rise of the Triad</em>), runs on a hybrid between a block-based engine like <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em> and a full 3D engine. You can look 100% overhead or down, the maps are true multi-leveled, and the world is rendered in fully 3D polygons. It also has angled floors, like ramps &mdash; in other words, the walls and floors aren't all at 90 degrees to one another, so you can be walking down an octagon-shaped corridor, for example. Although sprites were used for smaller objects, larger objects were 3D, were fully destructable, and could be stood upon. It also had a really slick physics system: objects you throw bounce of the walls and roll down inclines, if you shoot a robot on a ledge it may fall off (and even crush another robot below), and the player can jump, crouch, crawl, lean, dodge, or do combinations of those. Objects can be pushed, picked up, and thrown. The game features dynamic lights that can pulsate or be toggled on and off. Doors and bridges can be translucent. And all of this in a mere <em>4 MiB</em> of RAM.

Yes, it's a glitchy, blatantly unfinished mess that had to be patched with entirely new full-sized level maps, but the team behind it had it sprung on them that it would be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU">Wii U</a> exclusive <strong>after</strong> they had already completed too much development and were too close to deadline to start over... when the game was designed with CryEngine 3, a engine that was literally <strong>not designed to be able to run</strong> on the Wii U. The fact that it runs at <em>all</em> borders on the miraculous, and required outrageous hours and vast amounts of help from the engine's developer, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Crytek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Crytek">Crytek</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSeventhGuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSeventhGuest">The 7th Guest</a></em> has video streamed from a CD-ROM overlaid with computer generated scenes. Sounds unimpressive nowadays, but in 1993 the performance of CD-ROM drives was much worse and there were <em>no</em> codecs or any support available because literally nobody had done it before; the lead programmer, Graeme Devine, had to write the entire streaming and decompression system from scratch. For the sequel, <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheEleventhHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheEleventhHour">The Eleventh Hour</a></em>, Devine was upset to learn that the videographer had produced outside footage, which &mdash; because it contained more movement than the simple blue-screened scenes used in the original &mdash; could not be decompressed fast enough by the original code; so he rewrote it <em>again</em> so that it was fast enough! <br>These games also had an unfortunate case of Genius Programming backfiring. The AI Devine designed to play against the player in several of the mini-games was so efficient it was unplayably strong, and players were unable to defeat it, stalling their progress in the game.
</li><li> The concept of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_code_execution">arbitrary code execution<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> has been used in some rather mind-blowing technical demonstrations. Basically, arbitrary code execution refers to the act of exploiting a glitch to execute RAM data as processor instructions. While the concept itself is not recent (this is a common method for viruses to gain control of a system), even with regard to its usage within video games<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9z7bd');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note9z7bd" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9z7bd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(e.g. the Twilight Hack, which uses a buffer overflow from a modified <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em> save file to gain control of the Wii)</span>, the concept became revolutionary within the TAS community after the following events:
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5T81yHkHtI">This TAS<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonYellow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonYellow">Pok&eacute;mon Yellow</a></em> begins with using a save corruption glitch to swap around chunks of memory using the item menu. Normal for those used to watching TASes. Imagine, though, the jaws that dropped when the game played a chiptune rendition of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> theme song, without any sort of ROM hacking or cheating done <em>whatsoever</em>.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vjm8P8utT5g">A sequel TAS<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> by MrWint took this even further. By glitching the game into a state where it can read from the Game Boy Color's joypad inputs at a rate of much higher than the usual sixty frames per second, MrWint manages to get <em>Pok&eacute;mon Yellow</em> to transform into <em>different games</em>, and culminates in streaming shockingly high-quality audio and video to the Game Boy Color. One would be shocked to know that everything shown in the video is <em>completely possible</em> within the confines of the cartridge, using only inputs and legitimate glitches to pull off.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Super Mario World</em> has been subject to these kinds of exploits. Players such as Masterjun and SethBling have discovered that by using glitches and adjusting various factors in the game environment such as the position of shells in order to affect the behavior of the glitches, you can use arbitrary code execution to turn the game environment <em>itself</em> as a programming environment. The mechanics become more obvious once they are <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAHXK2wut_I">explained<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> to a savvy user, but having to figure all of this out beforehand and abusing it to its fullest takes a special kind of mindset. Through these glitches, with <em>no</em> external cheating devices or ROM-hacking devices whatsoever, players have been able to...
<ul><li> ...<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14wqBA5Q1yc">complete the game<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> within <em>minutes</em>.
</li><li> ...<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB6eY73sLV0">write and execute the source code to Flappy Bird<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <em>within the game</em>. Granted, it takes an hour of painstaking movements and one mistake could mean starting over, but you're effectively reprogramming memory without so much as an address editor.
</li><li> ...and create said <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixu8tn__91E">address editor<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, which can be stored and loaded through a save file.
</li></ul></li><li> While not specifically a speedrun, <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/4yOni0xaPfM">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> video uses similar principles on the original release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranTurismo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranTurismo">Gran Turismo 2</a></em>, exploiting a nasty garage erasing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">Game-Breaking Bug</a> to allow for less license tests to complete a license and quickly reach the money cap.
</li></ul></li><li> The Source Engine. Despite starting life as the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Quake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Quake">Quake</a></em> engine, Valve created a versatile and thoroughly reliable engine that's still in use today. Cheap off-the-shelf computers can run Source games with little problem, and older games have almost no compatibility issues with newer machines. A large part of its longevity is its very modular nature; pieces of the engine are constantly being updated and rewritten, so that like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheseusShipParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheseusShipParadox">Theseus' Ship Paradox</a> it bears no relation to what it started out as while maintaining the same basic accessibility.
</li><li> Many people will tell you that using a controller is not a viable option when playing shooters. The reason being that it's not as precise as using a mouse. However, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em> finally found a way around this. How you might ask? Two words: motion controls. Along with the traditional twin-stick controls, tilting the controller moves the camera around, essentially giving you the precision of a mouse with the accessibility of a controller. And it's not a novelty either. A lot of members of the competitive <em>Splatoon</em> community find the motion controls an important part of the game's meta <em>because</em> it's more precise.
</li><li> Plug &amp; Play games are more or less novelty items, but every once in a while, they hold a fair share of surprises.
<ul><li> The Commodore 64 Plug &amp; Play has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a> that gives you <em>a full fledged C64 BIOS</em>, and it can run any C64 program you give it. You can even modify the device to support C64 peripherals. In fact, it's not just a full fledged C64, it's actually <em>more</em> powerful than a C64 as it supports multiple graphics modes that were added for modders; the documentation is also built into the device. And the whole C64 system is on a single chip. It single-handedly made the name of the hardware engineer, Jeri Ellsworth.
</li><li> The early models of the Atari Flashback were nothing more than a NOAC with homebrew NES roms made as accurate as possible to the original games.
</li><li> Say what you will about the NES Classic Edition, but you have to admit the emulator is extremely accurate (albeit with noticeable audio issues), even compared to the one used for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VirtualConsole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VirtualConsole">Virtual Console</a>. It might help that NOE developed the emulator this time. It would later be used for the NES games included with Nintendo Switch Online, with said audio problems amended.
</li><li> While its AV output is nothing to write home about, Radica's SEGA Genesis Plug &amp; Play can be modified to take actual Genesis cartridges, and run them surprisingly well. It's no surprise that future Genesis Plug &amp; Plays would feature a cartridge slot out right.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Goldeneye1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Goldeneye1997">Goldeneye 1997</a></em> has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> ZX Spectrum emulator and four games that were developed by Rare back when they were known as "Ashby Computer Corporation", albeit without sound. Why did they do it? <em>Because they could</em>. The emulator would later be used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64">Donkey Kong 64</a></em> for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Jetpac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Jetpac">Jetpac</a></em> mini-game, this time with the sound intact.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TommyTallarico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TommyTallarico">Tommy Tallarico</a> composed some impressive music on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis</a>, and "Rave Dancetune", the bonus level theme from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CoolSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CoolSpot">Cool Spot</a></em>, demonstrates why. Through careful manipulation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sega" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sega">Sega</a>'s <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/WEvnZRCW_qc?t=12m44s">GEMS<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10rbxi');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note10rbxi" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10rbxi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Genesis Editor for Music and Sound Effects</span> software, despite the system's YM2612 chip only being able to play music through six channels at any time, Tommy was able to give players the perception that "Rave Dancetune" uses up to <em>nine</em> instruments at the same time, three beyond the chip's basic capability. A slightly modified version of "Rave Dancetune", which is reprogrammed to utilize two Genesis YM2612 chips concurrently, <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/n7pMcVosV2g">can be heard here in its full glory<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> <em>Treasure Master</em> was a contest based game for the NES, but the existence of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GameGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GameGenie">Game Genie</a> would lead to players cheating. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight">The developers knew that this is bound to happen,</a> so they made the game be able to <em>detect if the Game Genie was being used and prevent it from running</em>. It wasn't until years later when fans discovered a code that bypasses it, but by then, the contest was well over.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonsLair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonsLair">Dragon's Lair</a></em> was a really impressive game at the time, and still holds up today. What's really impressive is the machine's hardware. All the game is is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LaserDisc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LaserDisc">LaserDisc</a> player, with the controls simply telling the game to switch to certain frames (a lot of home versions even retain this, albeit by separating the game's scenes into chapters instead). That being said, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">LaserDisc is both a blessing and a curse</a>, but it's still impressive because of how minimalistic it is.
</li><li> The windows to inaccessible areas in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AHatInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AHatInTime">A Hat in Time</a></em> are just 2D textures but look like they are projecting actual rooms. The technique used to do this is cube mapping which is usually used for reflections, but these cube maps are inverted to let the player see what the other side of its surface is reflecting, giving the illusion of a 2D texture projecting a 3D space.
</li><li> A lot of people will tell you that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy2">its sequel</a> look absolutely <em>gorgeous</em> on native hardware. <a class="urllink" href="http://media.moddb.com/images/games/1/52/51317/3.jpg">Just look at it!<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> It just goes to show that 480p is all you need to make a game look great.
</li><li> The NES version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TecmoBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TecmoBowl">Tecmo Super Bowl</a></em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LicensedGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LicensedGame">licensed</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague">National Football League</a> title released in <em><strong>1991</strong></em>, not only keeps thorough overall statistics on all 28 teams featured, it even keeps track of rushing, passing, kicking, interceptions, and scoring for each player which can also be sorted by conference. With 30 players on each of the 28 NFL teams present&mdash;840 players total&mdash;that's a pretty impressive database feature for an NES game of its vintage!
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArcSystemWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArcSystemWorks">Arc System Works</a> has a history of creating gorgeous fighting games, starting with the huge, well-animated sprites of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear">Guilty Gear</a> games, but then they created <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear">Guilty Gear Xrd</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoAndAHalfD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoAndAHalfD">2&frac12;D</a> fighting game with a visual style that could fool people into thinking it was actually 2D, in Unreal Engine 3, an engine thought to not be remotely designed with these types of games in mind<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11y97j');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note11y97j" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11y97j');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Although Unreal Engine 3 &amp; 4 are more flexible for all kinds of genres.</span>, all in a reasonably larger 12GB package on the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3. They would later top themselves by creating an the better-looking <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallFighterZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallFighterZ">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a></em>, a current-gen built on Unreal Engine 4. It has gorgeous visuals that emulate the anime perfectly, a fully-voiced story mode, and the option between the original Japanese voice acting or an English dub. The file-size is <em>just under 5GB.</em>
</li><li> The year is 1979. The newly created company known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Infocom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Infocom">Infocom</a> had the daunting task of taking the 1 MB file for the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Zork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Zork">Zork</a> game and make it fit into 32k of RAM. Solution? First off, cut the game in half and keep the part that was cut on standby in case of a sequel (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">of which there were many</a>). Next, create a new programming language just for the game. Then, create a virtual machine for the game to run in. After that, make an encoding program that makes it so most characters could fit into 5 bits instead of 8 and abbreviate a lot of the text in the file. Finally, create enough virtual memory within the virtual machine so that all of the static data would be stored away while the dynamic memory (things you did within the game) takes up 18k. Put all of that together and you have one of the most beloved text adventure games of all time.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperGameBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperGameBoy">Super Game Boy</a> is a peripheral for the SNES that lets you play Game Boy games and a few select Game Boy Color games on your TV. First off, it's not an emulator (the SNES wasn't capable of emulation of any sort). Open up the cartridge, and you'll find actual Game Boy hardware inside. Literally the only thing that isn't 1:1 with the original Game Boy is the clock speed (and even then, it's not by much, and for most games, that doesn't even matter anyway). Probably the most defining feature of the peripheral is the enhancements it would give to the certain games. Very few games made actual use of it (most of the time, you'd just get a custom border and a pre-loaded palette if you were lucky), but the ones that did were Genius Programming in and of themselves.
<ul><li> The Game Boy port of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></em> game completely overrides the soundtrack with music that sounds strikingly similar to the Sega Genesis port (especially odd, considering the game was ported to the SNES itself already, also with a distinct-sounding soundtrack).
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GameAndWatchGallery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GameAndWatchGallery">Game &amp; Watch Gallery</a></em> games use the peripheral's borders and palette to make complete 1:1 replicas of the original handhelds when you play in "Classic" mode, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retraux" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retraux">as if the remakes didn't look authentic enough already</a>.
</li><li> Probably the most famous game to use the Super Game Boy is the port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceInvaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceInvaders">Space Invaders</a></em>. Not only does it include <em>two</em> customs borders that resemble the upright and tabletop versions of the original arcade machine, but it also contains <em>the entire SNES port of the game</em> within the ROM. That's right, it completely overrides the Super Game Boy's own ROM and loads its own. All of this is being read from the game's cartridge and nothing else.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong94" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong94">Donkey Kong '94</a></em>, being made as a showcase for the Super Game Boy's power, shows off some of the most impressive tricks of the era. On top of the standard high-quality border, Pauline had an additional voice clip of her crying for help, something that was rare for even full-on SNES games at the time. In addition, the map screen is <em><a class="urllink" href="https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldp2deAXYS1qzvs0a.png">fully-colored<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small></em>, with no monochrome in sight. How they pulled this off is pretty impressive. Each 8x8 pixel region of the screen could have its own individual color palette; <a class="urllink" href="https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldp3c0Vkej1qzvs0a.png">here's that screenshot with the grid shown.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> Few games ever took advantage of this, because it required extreme planning to make sure the tiles all fit together properly, but those that do can pull off some incredibly impressive effects.
</li></ul></li><li> The mainline <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Touhou">Touhou</a> Project</em> games definitely count. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">Lord knows how many bullets can be drawn on the screen at once</a>, and the weakest of processors don't choke in the slightest. The worst you'll ever get is a minor frame drop.
</li><li> While the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlaystationPortable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlaystationPortable">Playstation Portable</a> was well-regarded in terms of its graphical capabilities (regarded as being superior to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a>), few would expect the system to be able to have good ports of contemporary console games like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Playstation3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Playstation3">Playstation 3</a>. That, however, is the beauty of the PSP port of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken6">Tekken 6</a></em>. Even though some cuts had to be made to fit the game onto a UMD (the story mode couldn't be included), the core gameplay is <em>exactly</em> like on the consoles, and the graphics are easily on par with the PS3.
</li><li> Micro Mages is an 8-bit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retraux" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retraux">Retraux</a> game, but unlike <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ShovelKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ShovelKnight">Shovel Knight</a></em>, is made for actual NES hardware. More importantly, it uses the same ROM design as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/SuperMarioBros1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/SuperMarioBros1">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> &mdash; no bank-switching, no mapper chips, no extra space, only 40kb of data.
</li><li> Nintendo is generally known as having some of the worst netcode in the gaming industry, with their online multiplayer generally panned for being unreliable and lag-prone. Thus, when Nintendo released the first batch of SNES games for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Nintendo Switch</a>, people were shocked to find that the included online multiplayer ran <em>incredibly well</em> - by successfully using rollback to reduce input latency and host migrating on the fly based on who&#146;s turn it is, it manages to have smoother netcode than most of the Nintendo games that run natively on Switch. As a bonus, consider that getting emulators to work well at all online is generally very difficult. Note that this does not apply to the NES app, where the online experience is generally considered quite poor.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Infinitode2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Infinitode2">Infinitode 2</a></em> deserves a mention for its unbelievable level of compression even for a smartphone game that still lets it run well. As of 2020, the game weighs 11MB - a megabyte less than the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Infinitode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Infinitode">Infinitode</a></em>. However, the game has dozens of towers and maps, several pieces of music, a map editor, and has been translated into 15 languages.

<div class="indent"><strong>Person:</strong> FIND A BLOCK WHICH IS TALLER THAN THE ONE YOU ARE HOLDING AND PUT IT INTO THE BOX. <br><strong>Computer:</strong> BY "IT", I ASSUME YOU MEAN THE BLOCK WHICH IS TALLER THAN THE ONE I AM HOLDING. <br><strong>Computer:</strong> OK.

</div></li><li> There exists a BASIC code one only one line long that is capable of <a class="urllink" href="http://10print.org/">generating mazes.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.reactos.org/">ReactOS<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>: the project aims to create an open-source Windows-compatible operating system from scratch. After 12 years of development, it has some basic compatibility with Windows. You may not be able to run the latest games on it, but you can check your email and browse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes">TV Tropes</a>.
<ul><li> Printing, NTVDM (the layer allowing 16-bit applications to run on 32-bit Windows), and virtualization software (e.g., VirtualBox or Virtual PC) support have finally been implemented in the latest versions of ReactOS, along with NTFS read support, and even features that Windows itself doesn't support, such as out-of-the-box <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs">Btrfs<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> support.
</li><li> As of May 2016, ReactOS can run <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skyrim">Skyrim</a>, as <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4hLycfaQD4">seen here.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> Compared to modern versions of Windows, ReactOS is also quite lightweight, requiring (as of 2018) just 96 megabytes of RAM and 500 megabytes of storage, compared to 1 gigabyte of RAM and 16 gigs of storage for the 32 bit edition of Windows 10.
</li><li> <em>Wine</em> is a project that attempts to <em>recreate</em> the full Windows API on Unix-based and Unix-like systems. It's not an emulator, either (it's actually part of the recursive acronym, <em>Wine Is Not an Emulator</em>), but is actually a piecemeal reverse-engineering of Windows one library at a time, which makes Windows-only applications run just fine on Unix and other OSes. This includes very modern games like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>, which are fully playable this way.
</li><li> Wine and ReactOS are a sister projects and have a shared codebase. Or, more correctly, Wine is a Windows-compatible userland to run application software atop compatible kernels, while ReactOS developers concentrate on a Windows-compatible backend side, that is, kernel and driver support.
</li></ul></li><li> Pretty much any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Emulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Emulation">emulator</a> qualifies. Especially ones which emulate hardware for which there is little or no official information available, requiring the use of reverse engineering.
<ul><li> SNES Advance and Snezziboy are particularly impressive &mdash; fully playable SNES emulators squeezed onto the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a>.
</li><li> The various [console] Sound Formats, such as the PlayStation Sound Format emulate the original sound hardware/software, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">so you can listen to how the track originally sounded</a>. As an added bonus, these files are often a fraction of the size of a normal line-out rip without any significant loss of quality.
</li><li> Higan may be relatively slow, but its SNES core (originally its own emulator, called BSNES) is notable for being <em>100%</em> accurate to the original machine, with no game-specific hacks. (More accurate emulation requires more processing power in general, explaining why Higan is slower and possibly explaining why Nintendo's own SNES emulation for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS">Nintendo 3DS</a> requires the more powerful New Nintendo 3DS models).
</li><li> While similarly slow, Exodus is an open-source Sega Genesis emulator that prioritizes 100% emulation accuracy of the architecture of the Genesis, on top of being rife with numerous debugging tools.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://bgb.bircd.org">BGB<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is a Game Boy emulator that perfectly runs games using cycle-perfect tricks (such as Prehistorik Man, mentioned above). The zipped emulator clocks in at a meagre <em>421 kB</em>, runs even on low-end Windows 95 computers at full speed, features impressive debugging tools that actively warn against undesirable behavior, and the kicker: <em>it's coded in Pascal</em>.
</li><li> John Harris, who is profiled in the Steve Levy book <em>Hackers</em> had to downgrade Jawbreaker (an off-label <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcadePerfectPort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcadePerfectPort">Arcade-Perfect Port</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PacMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PacMan">Pac-Man</a></em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atari8BitComputers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atari8BitComputers">Atari 8-Bit Computers</a>) to play on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atari2600" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atari2600">Atari 2600</a>. Since the process of testing code for the 2600 as you wrote it was extremely laborious, he wrote a 2600 emulator for the Atari 800. Let that sink in; an Atari 2600 emulator was written for a home computer in 1981!
</li></ul></li><li> A lot of programs in an <a class="urllink" href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/">esoteric language<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> count, just because of how weird the languages are. Take, for example, <a class="urllink" href="http://99-bottles-of-beer.net/language-malbolge-995.html?PHPSESSID=2985a88f7e629576ba1e73e3c874e2ee">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

A pretty general rule of thumb is that it gives the same as MP3 quality at one-fourth of the size (24kbit <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Efficiency_Advanced_Audio_Coding">HE-AAC<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> sounds as good as 96kbit MP3). Discovering it has been known to lead to at least one joygasm. Preceded by <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mp3pro">MP3PRO<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, which uses the same <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_band_replication">Spectral Bandwidth Replication<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> algorithm to shrink the file size to half.

What makes it shine, however, is the low algorithmic delay it provides, making it highly suitable for real time applications like Skype.
</li><li> jQuery is a JavaScript library that is used in a surprisingly high proportion of the most visited web sites. It provides just about all the functionality that really sets apart modern web pages from the static web pages of yesteryear (where yesteryear is approximately any year prior to 2005). It is also designed to be as unobtrusive to other code as possible, only uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">confusing trick code</a> where unavoidable, and still only clocks in at under 100 kilobytes. <br><br>It gets even better. jQuery uses <em><a class="urllink" href="http://importantshock.wordpress.com/2009/01/18/jquery-is-a-monad/">monadic<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> programming structure for most of its functions, which is basically a fancy way of saying you can call functions one after another on the same object on the same line without needing external variables to keep track of it all. The thing is, monads are typically associated with <em>Haskell</em>, not Javascript, and they're one of the hardest parts of the language for most people to wrap their heads around. If you're good with jQuery, then you've also got a conceptual grasp on how monads work, despite working in <em>completely different programming languages</em>!
</li><li> Microsoft Excel. While mostly known for being a boring spreadsheet program, it is actually very versatile. If you know what you're doing you can turn it into a rendering program or even a game engine with no real modification of the software.

</li></ul></li><li> Linux itself was started as a personal side project by Linus Torvalds in 1991. He had grown frustrated by the legalities and restrictions associated with MINIX and decided he could do better, so he started hacking away, and after some time he gave notice to the world of the existence of Linux &mdash; mentioning that it would be "just a hobby" and "nothing big and professional". Fast forward a few years and Linux basically runs the world; comparatively few people run it on desktops (though this number is increasing), but it's very often chosen by tech-savvy businesses in place of far less secure systems, it's in a lot of embedded devices and mobile devices running Android,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note136tcg');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note136tcg" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note136tcg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Android is based on Linux</span> and the infrastructure it all depends on runs on it almost exclusively. It also has support for a massive range of CPU architectures, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qSziR6sD8Q">even ones as old as the 486!<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.computerhistory.org/fellowawards/hall/linus-torvalds/">Linus Torvalds<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> also wrote Git in two days. He also made some of the most widely used computer software in the world casually and made it open source.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasiOka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasiOka">Masi Oka</a> was apparently in charge of coming up with genius programming for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IndustrialLightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IndustrialLightAndMagic">Industrial Light and Magic</a> before he started dealing with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">bending space-time</a>. In his words, he's the guy they called when they wanted something on the screen to blow up <em>without</em> also blowing up the computer rendering it (and then he had to teach the art team how to use the tools he created). His rendering tools for creating dynamic water in things like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePerfectStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePerfectStorm">The Perfect Storm</a></em> were repurposed to create the fiery explosions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar">Avatar</a></em>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14n0mr');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note14n0mr" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14n0mr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Because rapidly expanding gas behaves remarkably like a fluid &mdash; science!</span>
</li><li> When the Commodore 64 came out it was hopelessly slow at loading programs (which is why it's listed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/IdiotProgramming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/IdiotProgramming">Idiot Programming</a>). Fastloader cartridges and chips for floppy drives came out quickly, but though in the US floppy drives were widespread various market/import reasons made them <em>hilariously</em> expensive in Europe &mdash; one could easily spend about as much money on the floppy as they did on the computer itself. As a result most Europeans made do with tapes, which were both inherently slower and much harder to speed up &mdash; not only was tape intended for music and therefore not well-optimized for data storage, but the cassette drive lacked the relatively powerful hardware present on the floppy drives (which were effectively secondary computers in and of themselves, with their own CPU and RAM). As a result "turbo tape" loaders were developed, which would be loaded slowly by the original system and would then speed up about fivefold everything loaded after them. Notably, since they couldn't rely on additional hardware to do the job, turbo loaders required some pretty clever programming to intercept the original operating system routines and modify them to accept the new commands and improved functionality &mdash; see <a class="urllink" href="http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue57/turbotape.html">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for a detailed analysis.
</li><li> The Common Lisp language, although its syntax can be rather daunting, has the unique property that any feature of any programming language can be added to it &mdash; yet the compiler/interpreter is tiny and supports only 25 commands. Why? Because one of those commands lets you create a new language construct, and provide a Common Lisp program that expands that construct into a simpler one. This can then be expanded again, and so on until the program contains only those 25 commands. Essentially, it implements the compilation process itself as a language feature, meaning that the compiler is infinitely customizable. There's an <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule">aphorism<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> among programmers that claims that every sufficiently advanced programming language is just an inferior re-implementation of Common Lisp, and in light of the above, joke or not, they might have a point.
</li><li> iOS, for all its faults, has some wonderful surprises &mdash; for example, it can <em>take back</em> an error message. If an error message appears stating that there is no Internet connection available, and a connection becomes available while the error is on the screen, the error automatically closes itself and the original task resumes seamlessly.
<ul><li> iOS 11's facial recognition. More specifically, you only need to set it up once; there's no need to go through the process ever again. You could grow a mustache, dye your hair, or even be cosplaying, and it will <em>still</em> recognize you if your face isn't completely covered up. Literally the only flaw with this feature (and they do tell you this) is if someone else looked exactly like you. But of course, those chances are very slim.
</li></ul></li><li> Windows XP holds the record for the longest-supported Windows OS, and still sees a fair amount of use even four years after support was ended in 2014 (to the point that Microsoft released critical security updates to protect it against <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack">WannaCry<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlueKeep">BlueKeep<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in 2017 and 2019, respectively). Want to know why that is? It's very simple: its legacy support. Microsoft was quick to drop legacy support past this point, and as such, running older programs on new OSes is a complete crapshoot as to whether or not it works. XP, on the other hand, can pretty much run anything (at least pre-Directx 11 and pre-x64 applications) natively with little to no problems (though that may have something to do with it being the last OS to fully support 16-bit architecture). DOS games, decade-old 9x programs, even software as far back as Windows 3.1 can run on XP without any additional software. It even has Soundblaster 16 drivers built right in (although newer soundcards aren't built in, resulting in lack of sound until the user installs a compatible sound driver). It's by no means an operating system you can still use today, but some may keep that installation disc around; you'd be surprised at how all-in-one it feels when it comes to running older software on functional older computers or virtual machines with emulated drivers.
</li><li> Then came Windows 7, which has full 32-bit and 64-bit support (no 16-bit support on the 64-bit version). So much that even three years after the mainstream support ended in 2015 and no longer being available on retail channels or any kind of official store, Windows 7, particularly the 64-bit system (x64), will happily run pretty much any games and applications not programmed with the new Windows 10 UWP API (which, due to the lack of cross-platform documentations, its adoptions isn't widespread enough). Even as of 2018 pretty much all games that not on the Windows 10 Store will list Windows 7 as its minimum requirement, and it will run natively with little to no problems on the Windows 7 side.
</li><li> One of the new feature introduced in Windows 7 is built in sound driver. Windows 8 and 10 adds built in network drivers in the installation, removing the need for installing additional drivers. That being said, for some builds, it is recommended to use the provided manufacturer drivers in case of the "stock" drivers becoming glitchy.
</li><li> Windows Movie Maker is known for being very minimalistic. However, fans cracked it open, and found that the effects and transitions are simple XML scripts, and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.windowsmoviemakers.net/Forums/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=2203">by creating a specific directory<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, you can essentially make your own plug-ins. It's still a barebones video editor (try as you might, you're not getting more than one video track, nor are you able to fix inconsistent aspect ratios), but it definitely makes the fact that you're even using it less obvious.
</li><li> Bleem! was a commercially released PSX emulator for Windows. Notoriously buggy as it was, when the Bleem team boasted better looks than the native versions <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/MFY9Kv1c4-Q?t=520">they weren't kidding<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. What's even more impressive is that it used software rendering to do this, which at the time was the better-than-nothing fallback option for people who couldn't afford a 3D accelerator. Support for the then-burgeoning 3DFX graphics card was present as well, making the graphics look even better. Sure Bleem! was dueling with Connectix VGS, which had less bugs and more compatible, but Bleem! graphical enhancing techniques was amazing and unbelievable at the time.
</li><li> The entirety of Windows 95 <a class="urllink" href="https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows95">was ported to Electron<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. The OS is contained in a relatively small application, and it doesn't even require that much processing power like a virtual machine running the OS would. It's completely open source.
</li><li> Video compression has advanced a long way, enabling HD Video to fit into absurdly small files. For example, H265 and it's royalty-free counterpart VP9 can make file sizes even smaller with less noticable block artifacts than their predecessors, and were a boon for content providers (Such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>) who wished to provide HD Video hosting and save as much bandwidth as possible. For their time, advanced codecs like these required significant processor power to create a file, but are effective enough to fit 2-4 hours of HD Video onto a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DVD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DVD">DVD</a> with surprisingly-good quality in exchange. The quality is adjustable to taste for high-fidelity backups that still require less storage than its predecessors.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball">Pinball</a>:
<ul><li> Here's an interview with pinball programmer <a class="urllink" href="http://mypinballblog.blogspot.com/2008/01/in-begining.html">Dwight Sullivan<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, in which he describes how small the pinball software was at the time. Notable programmer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryDeMar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryDeMar">Larry DeMar</a> (the co-creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Defender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Defender">Defender</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Robotron2084" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Robotron2084">Robotron: 2084</a></em>) invented automatic replay adjustment (with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveRitchie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveRitchie">Steve Ritchie</a>), which automatically adjusts the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryTenThousandPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryTenThousandPoints">replay score</a> based on the players' performances on location) and software compensation for broken playfield switches/features, both of which were introduced in 1986's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/HighSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/HighSpeed">High Speed</a></em>.
</li><li> 1992's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/TheAddamsFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/TheAddamsFamily">The Addams Family</a></em> had an auto-flipper (called "Thing Flips") that actually did hit the Swamp scoop target, most of the time. When it doesn't hit the Swamp scoop, then the software auto-calibrates the flipper until it hits the Swamp. This also happens if the pinball machine is moved to another location. Not surprisingly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryDeMar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryDeMar">Larry DeMar</a> was the co-programmer for <em>The Addams Family</em>. DeMar also did the programming for 1990's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/FunHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/FunHouse">Fun House</a></em>, which featured "Pin-Mation", in which Rudy's (the talking doll head) eyes and mouth move in real-time, depending on where the ball hits the target.
</li><li> 1989's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/BlackKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/BlackKnight">Black Knight 2000</a></em> was acclaimed for having one of the best soundtracks for a pinball game, but according to <a class="urllink" href="https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/BrianSchmidt/20141104/229404/Interactive_Audio_in_Black_Knight_2000_The_Importance_of_Integration.php">an article by Brian Schmidt<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (one of the game's composers), getting the System 11 hardware (which Black Knight 2000 used) to play the vocals along with the music was impossible to do at the time, until Ed Boon (the game's programmer, and who would later go on to create <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a></em>) made it work.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Brian Schmidt</strong>: In fact, the ability of the music system (one computer board) to control the speech chip (which was on a wholly separate processor board) was thought to be impossible until Ed Boon finagled a way to make it happen; without that, there would be no &#145;Choir of Angels&#146; or taunting knight in the BK2K themes.
</div></li><li> TicketMaster managed to conquer their market by using such tightly written code it could run on 1/10th the space of its original competitors and still process the same amount of requests at the same speed.
</li><li> Apollo Guidance Computer software implemented a (cooperative) multitasking operating system plus all the software to run on it in 36,864 16 bit words of ROM and 2048 16 bit words of RAM (or in modern units, 73,728 bytes and 4096 bytes, respectively). And this was software that had to be extremely reliable and fault-tolerant because human lives depended on it. Apollo 11 demonstrated the benefits of the fault tolerant design when the guidance computer was given slightly more work than it was capable of coping with during the landing. Instead of curling up and dying, it issued an alarm, discarded jobs that were considered low priority and continued running the high priority tasks. This bit of design saved the mission. When you consider that a lunar landing abort would have been the most complicated manuver ever attempted by NASA (possibly to current day) this feature likely saved lives. <br>Some credit should go to both the programmers (chiefly Margaret Hamilton) and the operators, especially Jack Garman, one of the engineers in mission control during the landing. He diagnosed the problem immediately based on two four-digit error codes, recognized that it was solveable, and guided the crew through an on-the-fly procedural change to reduce the computer's workload.
</li><li> Linksys's WRT54G (and its spiritual successor, the WRT54GL<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15ba31');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note15ba31" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15ba31');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The "L" presumably stands for Linux</span>, <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1pdqo');"><sup>Addtional note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1pdqo" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1pdqo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which was released after Version 5 and later releases of the WRT54G switched to the VxWorks OS and reduced the RAM and flash RAM by half</span>) wireless router is one of the most hackable routers, because its firmware was based on Linux. After Linksys released the firmware source code under the GPL, software developers began developing customized versions of the WRT54G firmware, the most well-known being <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/site/index">DD-WRT<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato">Tomato<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Not only are they considered to be more reliable and better performing than Linksys's stock firmware, they would add advanced features that were only available in commercial-grade routers.
</li><li> While he was a professor at MIT, Dr. Edward Thorp (better known as the man who invented counting cards at blackjack) once made a tiny wearable computer which he programmed to secretly calculate where the ball would stop on a roulette wheel, allowing a player to bet on that number and win big. And this was in <em>1961</em> &mdash; before there were any laws against it, because evidently nobody else had imagined such a thing would even be possible.
</li><li> In the fancy lingo of computer science, a "quine" is a program that, when run, produces itself as output. A "multiquine with a cycle length of two" is a program that, when run, produces a program that, when run, produces the first program as output. Got that? Good. Now, <a class="urllink" href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/ku-ma-me/20090916/p1">contemplate this multiquine with a cycle length of eleven, each stage of which is in a different programming language<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> or its <a class="urllink" href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/ku-ma-me/20130715/p1">follow-up<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> which is written in 50 cycles/languages.
<ul><li> If that's not enough for you, try <a class="urllink" href="https://github.com/mame/quine-relay/">its follow-up,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> written in <em>128 cycles/languages,</em> among those Velato, whose source file is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MIDI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MIDI">MIDI</a>, and Piet, whose source file is an image!
</li></ul></li><li> Steve Wozniak made it so that a 3 1/2" floppy disk that would be 720 kB on other systems to have 800 kB on both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AppleII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AppleII">Apple ][</a>'s and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AppleMacintosh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AppleMacintosh">Apple Macintoshes</a>. Unfortunately, this ended up causing compatibility issues with most other systems, so Apple went with the 1440 KiB used for the rest of the industry.
</li><li> The QP Framework, developed by Miro Samek, is essentially a lightweight event driven framework based on software state machines. While that might not sound like much, consider that the framework includes a real-time OS kernel in the package for embedded processors. Okay, there are other real-time OSes! But when you consider that QP in its smallest takes up less than 100 bytes of memory and 1KB of ROM and yet still has most of its functions to allow for real-time event driven systems is nothing short of amazing. Even its full featured implementation takes up about 1KB of memory and less than 10K of ROM.
</li><li> All of the awesome animation they do in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>? All of it is managed on an older version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdobeFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdobeFlash">Adobe Flash</a>. Despite this, they manage to do things like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotionParallax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotionParallax">Motion Parallax</a> and non-CG 3D effects that would make Disney's animated films blush, and they all do this on old software instead of in traditional cels. It is this show that truly shows what animators with Flash could put out if they really put in both the artistic effort and had the programming chops to manage it.
</li><li> There is almost enough publicly available information to write a perfectly accurate emulator for the Cray-1 that can run on a modern workstation. The largest stumbling block is the floating point maths used by the Cray-1. The Cray-1 was a single processor supercomputer that was faster than any other computer in the world when it was built. It came with vector floating point functional units (i.e. subprocessors) which could be used in parallel, had exact calculation times, predate modern standards, and are poorly documented compared to the rest of the Cray-1. The Cray-1 used a 64-bit floating point format and algorithms that differ from and are much faster than what even modern computers use. When the Cray-1 hardware manual says that you can do floating point and integer division, multiplication, addition, and subtraction all at the same time, it isn't bragging. The hardware manual actually tells you how to do it.
</li><li> In the mid 90s when PCI was being introduced, there was a problem with how to allocate 8 expansion slots between it and the old ISA standard which was still used to a wide degree. The designer's solution? Make the PCI cards install upside down. This allowed an expansion bracket to fit an ISA or PCI card.
</li><li> When CompactFlash cards were designed their developers didn't develop a specific interface and protocol for them. Rather, the physical interface was three-fourths of a PCMCIA connector, and they were bilingual, able to speak with the computer either in PCI or common IDE mode. This made them <em>extremely</em> versatile: you could use them as stand-alone memory cards, in a cheap passthrough adapter as memory extensions for laptops or with another passthrough adapter as an IDE "hard disk" in any computer. The format was also small enough to be comfortable but large enough that it could house miniaturized hard disks, or &mdash; exploiting the PCI compatibility &mdash; expansions that had nothing to do with flash memory. In the flash-memory format wars to follow they would be the favourite for many years, and though SD would eventually overtake them they still hold a well-deserved second place today.
</li><li> Introducing the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gnvQS2xhRg">Samsung Gear VR<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. All the functions of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OculusRift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OculusRift">Oculus Rift</a>, but in a more affordable form that only requires your smartphone. And by "Oculus Rift", we seriously mean "Oculus Rift". The device actually uses the Oculus firmware and HMD instead of just using the phone's accelerometer like other phone-based VR systems do. All you have to do is plug in an Android phone with a Micro-USB port that can fit inside it. While there's not much of an install base for the device as of this writing, theoretically, you could port anything that uses the Oculus runtime, and it'll work with some light tweaks.
</li><li> AMD Ryzen. Indeed, it was near 7 generations AMD used the Bulldozer design and were extremely behind Intel. However a whole revamp on their microarchitecture (giving back 2 float point units per core), along some massive improvements and the reuse of the L3 Cache in big amounts, puts them back again to the processor competition, even defeating Intel's offering <em>just the generation they returned</em>. And that was with Ryzen without GPU.
<ul><li> Months later, they released the version with GPU (using Vega's architecture) on laptops, it defeated Intel's counterparts and it was only defeated by putting a dedicated GPU inside, increasing noticeably the consumption, making the AMD's offering way more attractive.
