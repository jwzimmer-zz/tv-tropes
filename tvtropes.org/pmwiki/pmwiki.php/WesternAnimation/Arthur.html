Even if an Amish family agreed to this, it would have to be cleared through their church elders and bishop, and the family/groups involved would need to have a close bond with the teacher or someone at the school.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Ascended Extra</a>:<ul><li> Fern and George in Arthur's group, James in D.W.'s group, and George makes friends with a boy named Carl, who has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AspergersSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AspergersSyndrome">Asperger's Syndrome</a>.</li><li> Prunella and Molly.

There have been instances where other characters besides Arthur introduce the show, like Fern's mother in S2's "Fern's Slumber Party". ("Look into the camera, like when Arthur does it.") There have been instances though where it happens in the show proper:<ul><li> S2's "Arthur and the Square Dance", where Francine looks at us and says "What's gotten into <em>him</em>?" after Arthur hastily leaves the Sugar Bowl ice cream shop following a silent teasing from Brain and Binky.</li><li> S3's "Buster's Growing Grudge" has Binky ask <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWouldWantToWatchUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWouldWantToWatchUs">who would want to watch Arthur on TV.</a></li><li> S3's "Arthur's Almost Real Not Live Music Festival" has D.W. tell Arthur and Buster that "their show would never work on real TV."</li><li> S4's "What is that Thing?" has Buster suggest that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">there's something to be learned from all this.</a>" He and his friends then shout "Nah!".</li><li> S5's "You Are Arthur", an episode entirely shown in Arthur's perspective, has Buster asking the former if there is somebody watching everything he's doing from a TV screen.</li><li> S8's "D.W., Dancing Queen" has Binky quoting the theme song. D.W. asks him if he made it up, and Binky responds that he heard it somewhere, but can't remember exactly where.</li><li> S12's "I Owe You One" ends with Arthur demanding his show back, unpleased with Muffy taking over with "Smart Accounting with Muffy".</li><li> S12's "Home Sweet Home" has Buster writing that he hasn't eaten in two hours. When he writes again at the end of the episode, he states that it has been two hours and eleven minutes.</li><li> S22's "The Longest Eleven Minutes" has the internet go out for 11 minutes, AKA the entire duration of a typical <em>Arthur</em> episode.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">Brick Joke</a>: The aftermath of the big snowstorm was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when D.W. got her special snowball</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeEpisode">Broke Episode</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">Downplayed</a> in "Arthur Read: Super Saver": Arthur's parents have been making less money than usual, so Arthur tries to help them save money.

Sometimes, the actual moral seems to be, "Be yourself unless X." For example, in "Fernkenstein's Monster", Fern <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> changes a scary story she made up so it's tamer</span>, to placate friends who suddenly claim she is a dark, scary person ("Queen of Darkness" was the term Buster used). So...she's only allowed to pursue her interests and be herself if everyone else thinks it's okay? Other characters have fallen into this trap, too, often members of the "secondary cast".</li><li> "Arthur's Big Hit" has become infamous for this, with its intended message being that physical violence is never the answer in settling your disputes with others, as shown when Arthur hits D.W. for breaking his model plane. Binky is pressured into hitting Arthur later and the episode actually justifies this action as now Arthur has learned "how it feels when someone does it to him"; the way the episode goes about this instead just seems to justify the very thing it was speaking out against.</li><li> "Buster Gets Real" could be this in many different ways, as Buster stops watching <em>Bionic Bunny</em> in favor of an ambiguously more "realistic" show named "Top Supermarket Clerk" for the simple fact that Bionic Bunny <em>isn't real</em>, as if something being of a fictional nature takes away from its value as something to enjoy, further undermined by the fact that it's Buster of all people making this claim in stark contrast to his eccentric, superstitious nature. It also may host several unfortunate implications about conformity, as Arthur insists in classic fashion that unless they like the same things, then they can't call each other best friends anymore. Arthur then attempts to mend things by training himself to enjoy <em>Top Supermarket Clerk</em>, which he still does not care for. Granted, the true message may be that your friendships will remain strong even if you don't all have the same common interests, but the confusing nature of the episode and the strange decision to have Buster saying these things may only rob it of its intended meaning.</li><li> The first book, <em>Arthur's Nose</em>, was about Arthur wanting to change his nose because of the suffering he endured from having it, and then deciding not to because he realized looks aren't important. That didn't stop Marc Brown from redesigning him over the next decade until his nose became invisible, though.</li><li> According to "Fern and Persimmony Glitchet", if you write happy stories, they'll be really boring and nobody will like them. Your stories have to be super dark and depressing for people to like them. This moral doesn't apply to any of the show's episodes.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">Brutal Honesty</a>: In "To Tibble the Truth", Timmy and Tommy decide to be super honest and always tell the truth.

She's completely confused by his vague terminology... and then Muffy walks in accusing him of stealing her cellular phone.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooForeign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooForeign">But Not Too Foreign</a>: Do any of the characters look their nationalities?

He was also seen as having little regard for organization, leaving his bedroom in shambles - Arthur even points out how neat and tidy he was when he spent the weekend at his house, to which he responds, "Yeah, and it almost <em>killed</em> me!"</li><li> Arthur goes from being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a> (in "My Club Rules", he tries to get D.W. to kick a bowling ball because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">she asked what he and his friends were doing</a>, and he screeches at his band in "Arthur and the Crunch Cereal Contest" when they start playing without his permission) to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>:<ul><li> As noted above, Francine was a lot meaner in earlier episodes; in fact, during the first couple of seasons in general, she was not above outright bullying others: she was the first to make fun of Arthur when he started wearing glasses, and was quick to harass him about having not lost any baby teeth; she even proudly boasts in one episode, "I'm kind of a rude person." Although she mellows out eventually and isn't much of a straight-forward bully anymore, she does still have a tendency to stoop to passive-aggressive actions against her friends, sometimes for no reason.</li><li> Similarly, Binky <em>is</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully">The Bully</a>, especially in the first season, where he's more of a supporting character, and was only featured on the show on a semi-regular basis. Starting in the following season, he slowly becomes part of Arthur's gang, and also slowly and progressively evolves more into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant">Gentle Giant</a>, though still occasionally will do something mean and/or unnecessary, if only to maintain appearances.</li><li> Related to Binky above, the rest of the Tough Customers started getting in on this, too, eventually interacting with and helping out Arthur and friends <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and even swearing off bullying completely as of S16's "The Last Tough Customer". Molly in particular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">shapes herself up</a> after seeing her brother James <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleBrotherIsWatching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleBrotherIsWatching">copy her tough act</a>, and writes apology letters to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">George</a> and everyone she has bullied in the past.</span></li><li> Both Fern and George have become a lot more outgoing and socialize with other kids a lot more over the years, but are still a little shy, though nowhere near as reclusive and withdrawn as they originally were. It helps that they're both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Ascended Extras</a>.</li><li> Prunella was initially rather stuck-up and somewhat snobbish (though not to the same extent as Muffy), nor was she above giving Arthur and his friends a hard time about having Ratburn as their teacher, as she had him the year before; at the same time, she was also somewhat popular and had <em>huge</em> birthday parties for herself (both full birthdays and half birthdays) that everyone attended. After a season or two, she mellowed out, and was occasionally shown to be pretty good friends with Arthur and the others. By the time she befriends Marina, she's a lot more of a thoughtful and considerate person, even though she occasionally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive">goes overboard with her good intentions</a>.</li><li> Muffy is still something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">Spoiled Brat</a> who believes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">It's All About Me</a>. However, she has slowly developed more empathy in later seasons. Examples include:<ul><li> "Spoiled Rotten!" at the end of which she takes on a charity project/job helping sell secondhand clothing.</li><li> "The Cherry Tree", wherein she expresses sincere regret that her desire for a bouncy house will mean the loss of the eponymous tree she's had since she was little. Even though <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the tree is cut down</span>, she ultimately decides to dedicate her annual spring party to cherry tree planting, not the bouncy house (which she ends up not commissioning).</li><li> "Shelter from the Storm", during which she has to relocate to a shelter during Hurricane Sadie and meets a new friend, Kaylie. Upon learning Kaylie's house was destroyed, Muffy invites her and her family to stay with the Crosswires for a while.</li><li> "Little Miss Meanie", during which she almost tells Lydia Fox, who uses a wheelchair, to drop out of a beauty pageant to avoid winning due to sympathy. When Muffy hears another girl say the same thing to Lydia, she realizes it's mean, and she and Lydia team up to try to help each other win. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Neither does, but they do tie for first runner-up, and their nemesis receives no honors.</span></li></ul></li><li> D.W. seems to be maturing, perhaps because of positive influences from the Compson siblings Bud and his sister Ladonna.</li><li> In early seasons, Mr. Ratburn would assign insane amounts of homework, such as filling in a map of the entire world. He also seemed like a somewhat aloof and scholarly person. Of course, that could be due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a>, but this has been toned way down. Now he's still strict and dedicated to his students' educations, but seems to be much warmer and more relatable.

Averted with Marina; she's blind, but it's treated as a normal part of her character after "Prunella Sees the Light," where the latter learns not to make a big deal of Marina's disability. We also know, for example, that Marina plays soccer, quilts, is a Henry Skreever fan, and is great at yoga&mdash;more character development than most characters with disabilities ever get. However, the trope seems to have been played straight with Lydia Fox, who uses a wheelchair and has only been seen in an episode where said wheelchair figured prominently. Her main purpose seemed to be showing Brain that being in a wheelchair didn't have to slow him down, therefore making her a type B.</li><li> Discussed and averted in Season 18's "Little Miss Meanie." Muffy and Lydia enter the Little Miss Crocus pageant, and Muffy assumes Lydia will "get the sympathy vote" because of her wheelchair.

Muffy and Lydia then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> defeat the mean girl, tying for first runner-up, while their nemesis receives no honors.</span></li><li> Also averted with George, who has dyslexia. Other than the episode featuring the learning disability&mdash;justified in that the cast didn't know he had it until that point&mdash;his dyslexia rarely comes up. He does mention it in "Do You Speak George?" as a reason for why he has problems with secret languages, but in a refreshing aversion, he goes on to make up his own, non-word-based language.

She's well-known for several episodes where she acts particularly bratty and doesn't get punished, but the amount of times she does get punished actually outweigh those instances. It just happens that the cases where she <em>doesn't</em> get punished are so infamous that it's the only cases people remember. Specifically:<ul><li> "Play it Again, D.W.": She consistently drives Arthur and the rest of the family up the wall by overplaying her Crazy Bus CD, and faces no repercussions for distracting Arthur from trying to do his homework or for falsely accusing him of taking her CD.</li><li> "D.W. Goes to Washington": She acts extremely bratty and ungrateful for their entire trip to Washington, bringing up how much she'd rather be at Ponyland. When she ends up meeting the president, he loves her and her parents completely forget about all the frustration they just dealt with.</li><li> "D.W.'s Very Bad Mood": Possibly the worst offense. She screams and yells through the entire episode, regularly insulting her family and friends while David and Jane do absolutely nothing about any of it. Worse yet, not only is she not punished, she's <em>rewarded</em> with an invitation to Francine's party.</li><li> "Arthur's Big Hit": The other most known example. She breaks Arthur's model plane after ignoring multiple warnings not to touch it, and the most we hear is a throwaway line where David and Jane tell Arthur "We'll deal with what she did, but what you did is bad too." This happens offscreen though and her lines toward the end of the episode suggest she was barely called out for it.</li><li> "Arthur's Perfect Christmas": She kicks and screams over not getting the one toy she really wanted, and rather than Jane calling her out for her ungratefulness, she rubs her and sympathizes with her. She has a quick attitude adjustment, but it's still far and off from what could be considered unpunishable.</li><li> "The Pageant Pickle": After fake-crying, D.W. tricks Arthur into acting like a monkey, embarrassing himself in front of the play's audience. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">The episode ends with Arthur's friends making fun of him for it.</a></li><li> "D.W., the Picky Eater": D.W. throws a big tantrum in a restaurant after ordering salad and screaming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunctuatedForEmphasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunctuatedForEmphasis">"I! HATE!

In the episode "Arthur Accused!" Mrs. MacGrady absentmindedly mixes in a bag of quarters Arthur had donated for a school fundraiser into a brownie batter. Arthur winds up taking the blame for the misplaced quarters and winds up in trouble at school. At the end of the episode Buster solves the case freeing Arthur's name but Mrs. MacGrady is never punished for her absentminded mistake that got Arthur falsely accused in the first place.</li><li> Buster steals a fossil from a dig site. He asks if he can take it home, and when the rangers specifically explain to them why he can't, he smuggles it in his hat. Buster does feel bad about it and tries to give it to Arthur, but when they both return it to the museum, they get <em>rewarded</em> with a name plate saying they both discovered it.</li><li> For that matter at the end of "Locked in the Library" we don't see if Miss Turner or any of the other library staff have to answer for closing up for the weekend without making sure Arthur and Francince have left.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">Kangaroo Court</a>:<ul><li> Arthur and his friends subject D.W. to one when they suspect she made Pal sick in S1's "Sick as a Dog."

There are many many examples of characters being introduced as new students in early episodes only to have known the characters for years <em>before</em> their supposed introduction, Muffy and Sue Ellen especially.

One alternate ending has Arthur losing all his friends as a result of Arthur refusing to apologize to Sue Ellen and still claiming that she overreacted; on top of that, Arthur actually brushes them all off and decides if they don't want to talk to him anymore that's their problem, not his. You can almost imagine Arthur just saying, "Fuck it all!"</li><li> "Nerves of Steal" is this as the entire episode has a much less cheerful air due to Buster not only moping over him and Arthur not having a CyberToy as the rest of their friends do, but actually stealing said toy when he can't afford to buy one by sneaking it into Arthur's bag unnoticed. The entire episode shifts to Buster being confronted with the consequences of stealing, a crime he dragged his best friend into, one who is completely justified in his anger at Buster having resorted to this. After a failed attempt to return the toy without anybody seeing it, the boys are caught anyway and forced to answer for the incident. The episode ends with both boys punished for their actions, and Buster forced to isolate himself in his room for an entire month while the rest of his friends go about their weekend. That said, it's an unusually offputting episode for the fact that it does not end on the usual happy note.</li><li> "Arthur's Big Hit", the only instance of actual physical and intentional violence in the series.

Goes to Washington</em> Arthur flashes back to a time when D.W. made a request to visit a place she had seen on TV. The ad appears to be for a Christmas-themed resort called "Santa's Igloo: Where Santa spends the summer." A billboard they pass on the way over there is an ad saying "Share a sundae with Santa". When they arrive the real igloo is just a regular house with a crude looking igloo cutout on the front. They get greeted by a man half-dressed in a cheap Santa suit who laments that they didn't bring him any sundaes to share, saying "How can you share a sundae <em>with</em> Santa, if you don't bring a sundae <em>to</em> Santa?"</li><li> In <em>Arthur's Family Vacation</em> this is subverted because the motel that the family winds up staying at is called the "Ocean View Motel" but there is no site of the ocean.

Not bad," and goes for another, while George watches happily.</li><li> Done a lot in "Germophobia."</li><li> In "Sue Ellen Moves In" Buster is in his room and notices the smell of roast beef, mashed potatoes, and raspberry pie that his mother has made for dinner to eat with Sue Ellen's family. He has to force himself not to notice the smell fearing it may be a trap.</li><li> In "Buster's Breathless" Francine hallucinates that Buster's asthma is wafting out of his mouth as he speaks, pictured as a typically rancid green color.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun">Visual Pun</a>:<ul><li> In "Arthur's Lost Library Book", Arthur dreams about the terrible things that will happen to him if he doesn't find the book. One scenario has the police tell him, "You can't escape the long arm of the law," and a long, rubbery arm reaches through the door to grab him.</li><li> In "The Short, Quick Summer" Buster and Arthur are horrified to learn Mr. Crosswire hopes to destroy the local carousel to expand his automotive business, and Buster says everyone must band together to stop it. He does this, complete with an actual band to headline the protest.</li><li> In-Universe in "D.W. the Copycat" on an episode of Bionic Bunny where Bionic Bunny uses his super power strength to break out of a crab villain's claw. He remarks calling it his "built-in escape claws".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalEvolution">Vocal Evolution</a>: And note, this is for characters whose voices naturally evolved over the years, <em>not</em> characters that went through changes in voice actors.<ul><li> Francine's voice pre-Season 5 is noticeably (though not incredibly) deeper, and a bit more resonant and robust.</li><li> Muffy's voice starts out a bit softer and has less of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValleyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValleyGirl">Valley Girl</a> undertone; she also has a slight lisp, probably due to originally having buck teeth. It got slightly higher around season 9 as well.</li><li> Binky's is probably the most noticable: his voice was originally much deeper (similar to Arthur's Dad, as they both share the same actor, but with a menacing tone) and had far less emotional range, which developed two or three seasons into the show.</li><li> Buster has had a very consistent voice since the beginning of the show, however, throughout the first season, Buster would have moments of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">deadpan snarking</a>, with his voice dropping a bit, sounding more like a teenager. Also, for some reason, throughout much of the second season, his voice got rather nasally/throaty (think similar to Barney Gumble).</li><li> Both Mr. Haney and Miss Turner are really obvious, somewhat sad examples. Miss Turner especially sounds incredibly hoarse and raspy as the show goes on, and Mr. Haney's is a tad scratchy as well.</li><li> Rattles would gain a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Joisey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Joisey">Joisey-like</a> accent after Season 14, when Scott Beaudin started voicing him.</li><li> The first voice actors to portray Arthur and The Brain, (Michael Yarmush and Luke Reid, respectively) were initially kept on for a few more seasons after their voices dropped, making Arthur and Brain sound more like preteens than third graders. Reid was finally replaced with Steven Crowder in season 5 and Yarmush was replaced with Justin Bradley (who was later dubbed over by Mark Rendall) in Season 6.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VomitDiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VomitDiscretionShot">Vomit Discretion Shot</a>: In S8's "Vomitrocious," Francine pukes, but her face is not visible to the audience when she does.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WantedPoster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WantedPoster">"Wanted!"

Arthur tells him that he thinks all of those chocolates (that his secret admirer sent him) have gotten to his brain. Buster's response? "We'll see about that."</li><li> In S16's "Sue Ellen Vegges Out," Muffy insists "We'll just see about that" when the other kids say that she won't last at being a vegetarian. She lasts less than a day, but she was only doing it anyway because it was the latest fad, and there was a new fad that day.</li><li> In S16's "Brain's Biggest Blunder," Brain is assigned to be part of a team for a math contest with Binky and Buster. Prunella thinks that this is her and her team's opportunity to win, and Brain comments "That Prunella thinks she's got this contest in the bag.

After the show is cancelled due to lack of research, Buster decides he now only believes what can be absolutely proven. Even <em>Brain</em> ends up wanting the old Buster back. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And yes, he does revert to his old personality.</span></li><li> S1's "Arthur's Substitute Teacher Trouble" is the "We Want Our Strict Teacher Back" variant - after Mr. Ratburn comes down with laryngitis, his class is initially happy... but then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">they get saddled with so many incompetent substitute teachers</a> that they cheer when Mr. Ratburn arrives completely healed and his voice restored.</li><li> "Popular Girls" has Sue Ellen and Fern pretty much switch personalities to gain popularity, prompting this.</li><li> "It's a No-Brainer" is the "We Want Our Genius Back" variant - The episode arc is that Brain's extreme stage fright caused him to freeze during Math-a-Thon preliminaries, meaning Buster was slated to participate in the all-school competition. Since this would have been a disaster, the other kids do everything they can to get Brain to compete again (Buster, knowing his chances, had dropped out).
