This action broke the curse for good, reviving the dormant gargoyles in a land and time far from their home. He didn't do it for altruistic motives, though; eventually, Xanatos and the clan of gargoyles became enemies. The clan manages to make an ally in New York detective Elisa Maza, however &mdash; and with her help, they work to protect their new home while simultaneously adapting to it.</p><p><em>Gargoyles</em> spans fantasy and science-fiction genres, and its plot would eventually involve magic, robots, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIlluminati" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIlluminati">The Illuminati</a>, god-like fairies, numerous characters straight out of Shakespearean plays, and much more.

Very few are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">Card Carrying Villains</a>; in particular, the charismatic and manipulative nature of Xanatos is why the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit">Xanatos Gambit</a> was named after him. Even the heroes are individuals with their own wants and desires that don't always lead to peaceful relationships.</p><p>The initial incarnation of the show lasted <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Gargoyles_episodes">two seasons and sixty-five episodes.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> It was followed by a retooled third season &mdash; <em>Gargoyles: The Goliath Chronicles</em> &mdash; but since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GregWeisman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GregWeisman">Greg Weisman</a> was only around to write the first episode of this season, a new team of writers completely new to the series ended up heading the rest of the season. As a result, the series underwent a drastic shift of tone; from a serialized, dark action series, into a more lighthearted, and at times, comedic romp. According to Weisman, this happened due to the show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">effectively being taken out of his hands by Disney higher-ups</a>, in addition to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasRushed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasRushed">tightening of schedules</a>, and as such <em>The Goliath Chronicles</em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">not canon</a>.</p><p>The series was later resurrected in canonical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTropes">comic book</a> form in 2006, picking up with an alternate timeline after a comic-book retelling of the opening episode of <em>The Goliath Chronicles</em> before going on to weave an entirely new story; it also resulted in a spin-off title, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BadGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BadGuys">Bad Guys</a></em>. When the publisher, Slave Labor Graphics, was hit with higher licensing fees imposed by Disney, both books were cancelled. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GregWeisman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GregWeisman">Greg Weisman</a> has vowed to find a way to continue the story.</p><p>The show and the universe it created still has an active online fanbase &mdash; including <a class="urllink" href="http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/">the creator<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

Jonathan Frakes and Marina Sirtis played the primary villains Xanatos and Demona; Brent Spiner, Michael Dorn, and Kate Mulgrew all played recurring roles; and the guest stars included Avery Brooks, Colm Meaney, LeVar Burton, and Nichelle Nichols.</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWikiRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWikiRule">In the grand tradition of the internet</a>, the show <a class="urllink" href="http://gargwiki.net/Main_Page">has its own Wiki.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></p><p>DVDs of the complete first and second seasons are available for sale, with the episodes uncensored.

Goliath gets his name from the Castle Wyvern Captain of the Guard, but the rest of the clan goes unnamed. After awakening in 1990s New York, the elderly gargoyle tries to compare the gargoyles' lack of names to rivers, only to wind up stunned upon the revelation that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnalogyBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnalogyBackfire">humans name rivers</a></em>.

"Enter Macbeth" forced the clan to relocate from their original home. "Metamorphosis" not only created the mutates but rubbed the viewers' faces in Xanatos' prideful and manipulative villainy. "Vows" and "City of Stone" explained much that had only been hinted at and set up an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlasPoorVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlasPoorVillain">Alas, Poor Villain</a> or two.

(Goliath in "Awakening, Part Three" and Xanatos in "Eye of the Beholder" do this to Elisa's guns too.) When Macbeth uses a sword, it generally ends up breaking as well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersCannotDoMath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersCannotDoMath">Writers Cannot Do Math</a>: Generally averted, but there is one example of this trope in "City of Stone". Demona claimed that the spell would steal one minute of life from everyone who saw and heard the spell, and that was how she had lived for more than a thousand years. But to gain even one year by stealing one minute each from people's lives, you would have to cast the spell on roughly 525,000 people; the population of Manhattan in 1995 would not have been enough to extend Xanatos' and Demona's lives by more than 20 years each. Of course Demona was a liar, but a few simple mathematical equations make her lie particularly transparent. And it seems out of character for Xanatos not to see through it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WronskiFeint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WronskiFeint">Wronski Feint</a>: Used many many many times throughout the course of the series.<div class="indent"><strong>Brooklyn:</strong> <em>(immediately after he and Angela cause two pursuing Steel Clan to crash into each other)</em> "You'd be surprised just how often that works."</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit">Xanatos Gambit</a>: <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry. It should be moved to the TRIVIA tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Obviously</a>. This may be one of the reasons <em>Gargoyles</em> is so well-remembered and became a watershed moment in Western Animation. It was never as simple as "Good Guys Win" &#150; more often than not, even if the good guys won, the bad guy (usually Xanatos, natch) still benefitted.<ul><li> Note that Xanatos Gambits are not exclusive to Xanatos; the Weird Sisters, for example, pull one off in "High Noon". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> They brainwashed Macbeth and Demona into fighting the New York clan. Their real goal was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KansasCityShuffle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KansasCityShuffle">distraction so they could steal magical items.</a> If Macbeth and Demona won, however, that would be an additional bonus.</span></li><li> Demona takes a note from Xanatos' playbook in "Mirror": She stages a robbery which of course is foiled by Goliath... just as she knew it would be. While he's pursuing her, her accomplices sneak in and steal the artifact she wanted.</li><li> Then there's also Thailog. In "Sanctuary" where he hooks up with Demona, they pool their resources and plot for Demona to marry Macbeth, then imprison him, staging a death so they could acquire his resources. Unbeknownst to Demona, Thailog plotted to have her and Macbeth kill each other so he'd be the sole heir of all the fortunes for him to build his planned empire on. Even if the planned double death failed, he still has Demona wrapped around his finger for him to use for his benefit.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosSpeedChess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosSpeedChess">Xanatos Speed Chess</a>: Most obvious in "Eye of the Beholder". Yet again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a>. By the episode's end, Xanatos is down to plan <strong>E</strong>.<ul><li> In "Upgrade", Xanatos and Fox invoke this trope against each other as their version of Family Game Night, manipulating the Pack and the Manhattan Clan respectively against each other, complete with a literal chessboard and chess piece representations.</li><li> In "Protection", Elisa of all people has to play Xanatos Speed Chess in response to Goliath's and Broadway's interference in her operation, and Dracon's reaction to the same.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Xenofiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Xenofiction">Xenofiction</a>: A relatively mild example, but definitely present. Gargoyles can relate to humans enough to have reasonably civil relationships with them, but they have trouble grasping the concepts of personal names and individual parenthood. Because they spend part of their lives as stone formations, gargoyles think of themselves as part of nature, and they don't feel the need to go by personal names unless humans <em>assign</em> them names. Likewise, their unique biology means that they collectively raise their eggs in rookeries, and they consider all hatchlings to be the collective children of the clan.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearOutsideHourInside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearOutsideHourInside">Year Outside, Hour Inside</a>: In "Future Tense", and in the case of Avalon in general, where time runs slower inside of it, at a rate of one Avalon Hour = one Real World Day. 1,000 years in the real world equal just over 41 years in Avalon, which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">accurately reflected</a> by how old the humans were portrayed to be.<ul><li> Additionally, it is stated in another episode that gargoyles age at half the rate of humans; every single gargoyle on Avalon appears to be in their late teens or early twenties.
