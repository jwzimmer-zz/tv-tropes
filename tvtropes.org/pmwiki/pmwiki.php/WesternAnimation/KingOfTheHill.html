For example, Hank got a few less facial wrinkles starting in Season 2, and his glasses shrunk down. Also, Peggy's tank top switched from gray to green starting in Season 2, along with no longer wearing tall socks. And Bobby's face was altered to be more cheerful and not look like he's sullen and/or mentally retarded. The colors also became brighter and less washed out.</li><li> Later seasons switched from cel animation to digital animation and some occasional CGI mixed with 2D (as seen on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>).

In reality, Ontario lacks mountains. On a related note, the idea that Boomhauer would hook up with a French-speaker in Guelph, Ontario &mdash; while not a logical impossibility &mdash; is extremely improbable given the demographics, and seems more the product of the writers thinking that all of Canada is bilingual when really, it's just New Brunswick and a select number of Quebec cities (Montr&eacute;al and Gatineau are functionally &mdash; but not officially &mdash; bilingual). Sure, lots of Canadians are English/French bilingual, but that's like assuming that every Southern US state has residents that are all English/Spanish bilingual.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseGeology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseGeology">Artistic License &#150; Geology</a>: In "Uh Oh Canada," Boomhauer's French Canadian girlfriend Suzette is mentioned as having a former lover or the like that is in an aluminum mine.

First, the law says you have to provide reasonable accommodations, not tolerate every absurdity. There is an interactive process, potentially including medical professionals, to determine what those accommodations would be. More critically, addiction is only granted limited protections compared to other medical conditions, and someone actively using alcohol or drugs would not be covered. That said, considering the welfare worker who's letting a junkie get away with all of this is the same guy who showed a clear lack of competence at investigating child-abuse claims back in the pilot episode, this might be intentional.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseMedicine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseMedicine">Artistic License &#150; Medicine</a>: "Hank's Unmentionable Problem": They wouldn't do a colonoscopy without flushing your system first.

That's the opposite of how separation of church and state works; even if she were right about Halloween being a druid holiday, that would mean that the state government <em>wouldn't</em> have the power to ban it without a very good reason. She is, naturally, also wrong about the origins of Halloween on multiple counts. Halloween is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThemeParkVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThemeParkVersion">secularized version</a> of a Christian holiday (Allhallowtide) whose celebrations draw somewhat on ancient Celtic traditions. Also, druids were just the priests of the ancient Celtic religion, not a sect in and of themselves, let alone one that could "invent" a holiday. She goes on to host a "Hallelujah House", a Christian version of haunted houses which intends to convert by scaring patrons with images of Hell, which is based in the very wrong (but sadly, not uncommon) belief that "everything I disagree with is Satanic". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees">Such "Hallelujah Houses" are real, though</a>.</li><li> Peggy was wrong to suggest Bobby might be "god to billions of Asians". A lama is more like "reincarnated prophet to millions of Tibetans," though this is pretty in-character for her, given that she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">Small Name, Big Ego</a> (in this case especially, reacting to someone else's bumper sticker claiming her child is an honor student) and the Hills are the kind of family that wouldn't know anything about other religions, except the Christian-based ones that are prevalent in the Southern and Midwestern United States. Additionally, Hank tells the monks to stay away from Bobby and that he has no control over what they do at airports. Buddhist monks don't preach at airports; it's a Hindu sect, Hare Krishna, who are well known for doing so. In fact, Hare Krishna airport evangelism was a staple joke in comedy films until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn">most airports banned such solicitation around the start of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">The War on Terror</a>. Hare Krishna members often wear saffron robes similar to Buddhist monks, and Hank likely wouldn't know the difference.</li><li> Arlen First Methodist in one episode displayed the trademarked logo of the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.umc.org">United Methodist Church<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Its disappearance in other episodes afterwards leads one to assume that the show mistakenly believed it was a generic Methodist logo. Moreover, due to the UMC's status as the majority organization in its brand of Christianity, Methodist churches in America almost always have the word "United" before the word "Methodist."</li><li> In "Luanne Virgin 2.0," Luanne participates in a church ceremony to become a "born again virgin" and agrees to join a Christian abstinence outreach program. While Methodists do believe premarital sex is a sin, "born again virginity" and a heavy focus on "purity" are more characteristic of Evangelical and Baptist denominations. This one may be the product of Reverend Stroop being pretty breezy with the actual tenets of her faith, and trying desperately to be relevant to younger parishioners, though it's a little unusual for her to approach the issue by being <em>more</em> puritanical than her faith calls for.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseSports" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseSports">Artistic License &#150; Sports</a>:<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintballEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintballEpisode">"The Man Who Shot Cane Skretteburg,"</a> both Hank's team and the teenage bullies do things that would get them thrown off the paintball range instantly in real life. No one's wearing face masks or eye protection; these are required before even stepping onto the playing field, and taking them off is an automatic DQ. There are no marshals or range masters anywhere to be seen to watch what's going on and enforce the rules. The bullies line up Hank's friends in a firing squad-style shooting; technically possible, but extremely unlikely. In a rematch, Hank and company use tape recorders, and Hank even dressed up as a range master to fool one of the teens, all of which wouldn't be allowed.</li><li> In the "Torch Song Hillogy" episode, there's a crisis when Hank accidentally extinguishes the Olympic flame while running with the torch. There's actually Olympic personnel with "backup flames" in lanterns. But if that fact was acknowledged, the plot or conflict wouldn't exist.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtShift">Art Shift</a>: In "Bad News Bill", after the opposing baseball team starts laughing at Bobby's performance, they suddenly turn into extremely distorted caricatures as if viewed extremely close up through a wide-angle lens, with different shading than usual.<ul><li> The dream sequence in "Are You There, God? It's Me, Margaret Hill" is animated with digital Ink &amp; Paint instead of the traditional style of the rest of the episode, a full season and a half before the show switched over to it full time. This also applies to the intro and fellow Season 6 episode "Bobby Goes Nuts" in their entirety and a couple of scenes in the subplot of "The Miseducation of Bobby Hill".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsHimself">As Himself</a>: Chuck Mangione, who's more or less a part of the supporting cast as he has so many appearances.

Later in the episode, Dale betrays Cotton to the police and Cotton tries to strangle him with some dental floss.</li><li> In "Lost in MySpace," Peggy brags about posing as Ted Danson and getting her friends to open up to her about their problems. She then adds that Kahn is a manic-depressive for seemingly no reason. In "Just Another Manic Kahn-Day", it's revealed that Kahn needs to take medication in order to curb the mood swings he has from being manic-depressive.</li><li> In "Cotton Comes Marching Home," there's a throwaway brick joke where Hank and Peggy are reading the paper at breakfast, and Hank remarks that the city council has voted to remove a yield sign in town.

Later, when Bill is describing all the unique quirks he's noticed about Hank's head over the years, he mentions that Hank's ear looks like it's missing a tiny piece; "I'm sure there's a story there."</li><li> In "Hank Gets Dusted," Hank advises Bobby to never ask <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ZZTop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ZZTop">Cousin Dusty</a> what time it is, because he'll just respond "It's time to rock!" Later on, Dusty asks Hank if he has the time; Hank starts to check his watch, but then catches himself and refuses to answer.</li><li> In "Full Metal Dust Jacket", Peggy buys the lease to a bookstore. When she gets invited to a book club by the former owner, they are reading a book called <em>A Dinner of Onions</em>. The episode features several other characters reading it as well and trying to figure it out. Several seasons later, random characters can be seen reading the same book. It also got a film adaption in "Stressed for Success" where Bobby is watching it with DVD Commentary.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BringMyBrownPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BringMyBrownPants">Bring My Brown Pants</a>: Dale in "Tankin' it to the Streets" when they find out they're stuck in an Army firing range during target practice:<div class="indent">"Gentlemen, the crap has literally been scared out of me."</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a>: In "Texas Skillsaw Massacre", Hank accidentally cuts off Dale's finger and must take anger management classes to remove a restraining order.

Hank chases Jimmy down and kicks his ass, literally.</li><li> In "Texas Skilsaw Massacre", Dale, Bill and Boomhauer dig a tunnel under the street and are about to be run over by a garbage truck. They assume Hank is lying about the truck, while the driver dismisses Hank as a drunk, saying "I used to drink, too." Hank gets them to leave by threatening to cut off all their fingers and toes, then the truck crashes into the tunnel.</li><li> A very odd twist; in "Yard, She Blows", Bobby damages Peggy's lawn gnome and Hank, who despises it, uses this as pretext to bury it in the woods. Eventually he confesses, but tries to take all the blame. Peggy correctly guesses that Hank's covering for someone, but <em>incorrectly</em> believes that Bobby is entirely to blame and punishes him very harshly. At the end of the episode, Hank buys a replacement gnome and lets Bobby give it to Peggy; again, she gets this right but assumes that Hank was taking pity on Bobby rather than trying to salve his own guilt.</li><li> In "Dia-BILL-ic Shock", Bill becomes diabetic and accepts the fact that his life will change for the worse. When he meets a new friend in the park, said friend gets Bill to take control of his life and have a more active lifestyle, even though the two of them are in wheelchairs. Bill does so for a while and manages to become healthy enough to the point where not only he can walk again, but his diabetes has vanished. When Bill's friends find out about this, they assume he actually lied about having diabetes in the first place and are angry with him. On top of this, Bill is shunned by the same women that loved him when he was in a wheelchair. Bill gets depressed and tries to ingest a bag of sugar to induce a diabetic blood sugar spike since he thinks people liked him better handicapped and would listen to him then. Luckily, Hank manages to stop Bill in time and give him a heart to heart talk. The doctor told him he'd just end up in a wheelchair and that he's a lost cause, he could always walk, but the diabetes were real, he had two diabetic shocks in a short amount of time.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFight">Cat Fight</a>: Bill's three Cajun cousins (one by blood, two by marriage), all while wearing lingerie.

Originally, Cotton was portrayed as a boisterous, short-tempered, and sexist old man who was on good terms with his son, to the extent that he sabotaged his own car just so he'd have an excuse to stay at Hank's house longer. Starting with Season 2, Cotton was portrayed as being a verbally abusive parent who had zero respect for Hank, though it could be chalked up to the fact that Hank chose his wife over his father during the climax of "Shins of the Father," and Cotton being Cotton, probably hasn't forgiven him for it. If he can't let go of the fact that Japanese soldiers shot his legs off, then he probably can't let go of the fact that his own son betrayed him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhov's Gun</a>:<ul><li> The cigarette Dale lit off the Olympic torch, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">coming back into play when the torch was dropped later on in the episode</span>.</li><li> In "The Buck Stops Here", Buck briefly mentions having a son in another state "named...Ray, or Roy or something."

Debbie!"</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClownSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClownSchool">Clown School</a>: Bobby attends a clowning class at the local college. He's disappointed to learn that the class teaches <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommediaDellArte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommediaDellArte">Commedia dell'Arte</a>-type clowning instead of circus clowning, and the teacher takes it very seriously.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessAesop">Clueless Aesop</a>: A number of conflicts in the series are effectively resolved by blackmail. This is understandable in cases where this is done towards the corrupt people that screwed over the Hills in the first place. But then you get scenarios like Hank threatening to empty Reverend Stroup's congregation, by steering them towards a megachurch, unless he gets his preferred seating.<ul><li> A number of episodes also end on the Aesop "conformity is good." Especially episodes where Hank encourages Bobby to give up some unorthodox new calling or interest on the grounds that Bobby will get bullied or ostracized for it, Hank is worried how Bobby's new hobby will make him look to the neighbors, or Hank steers him toward a socially acceptable alternative hobby (like grilling instead of baking).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdOpen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdOpen">Cold Open</a>: The pilot episode, "Order of the Straight Arrow," "Three Days of the Kahndo," "Life in the Fast Lane: Bobby's Saga", "Good Hill Hunting", "To Spank with Love", "The Bluegrass is Always Greener," and "Kidney Boy and Hamster Girl: A Love Story."

I've seen the test scores for Arlen High. If I have to go there, my only options will be DeVry or the University of Phoenix. Which one, Mrs. Hill? <br><strong>Peggy:</strong> Well, on the radio they both sound like good institutions, but... <br><em>(Connie glares at Peggy)</em></div></li><li> In "Unfortunate Son", Peggy makes a parade float for Veterans Day consisting of three skeletons raising a Jolly Roger flag in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IwoJimaPose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IwoJimaPose">Iwo Jima Pose</a>, with "THE FUTILITY OF WAR" on the sides of the float. She apparently had no idea that the veterans at said parade would find it incredibly offensive. Originally her float was a standard Iwo Jima pose, but she changed it when Cotton refused to lend her his medals (though he did offer to rent them for $400 a day), because authentic medals would apparently add a special element to it... even though such a detail would go unnoticed and the actual men involved weren't wearing medals at the time (the flag was raised during combat on the fifth day of the 35-day Battle of Iwo Jima).</li><li> Dale eventually realizes that Joseph isn't his real son. When it comes to concluding who the real father is, though, he settles on aliens who used his own seed. In another episode, while Hank, Dale, and Bobby are attempting to make Joseph have a spiritual vision on John Redcorn's advice, Dale ends up having the vision instead. He sees a Native American man wearing a massive Indian headdress making love to Nancy, and then Nancy giving birth to Joseph, who is wearing the same headdress. He immediately comes to the conclusion that it means that <em>he</em> is a Native American.</li><li> When told that trans fats are being restricted for health reasons, Bill concludes that means even still fatty trans free foods are healthy and stops eating with any restraint. He's eating in every scene and gradually gaining weight as through the episode until Hank confronts him with the fact that all his eating has made him unhealthier.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicalOverreacting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicalOverreacting">Comical Overreacting</a>: Hank, upon finding out Peggy and Bobby grilled using charcoal instead of propane in "Hank and the Great Glass Elevator":<div class="indent"> <strong>Hank</strong>: You brought charcoal into our house! <br><strong>Peggy</strong>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">I didn't know what it was.

Bobby is a rather weird example, in that he <em>does</em> age a bit over the first two seasons, but then that growth is suddenly paused, allowing for both Connie and Joseph, who are both younger than him, to go through puberty long before him. This is at least partly explained by Bobby being a late-bloomer, but it still gets odd in the final season, when Hank's comment on having waited "thirteen years" to hear Bobby take an interest in something refers to both Bobby's in-story age <em>and</em> how long the show had actually been airing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommercialBreakCliffhanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommercialBreakCliffhanger">Commercial Break Cliffhanger</a>: One of the most intense ones was in "Texas City Twister": A worried look on Hank's face as he drove towards the gigantic tornado that was careening towards Luanne's trailer, where she and Peggy were.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanionCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanionCube">Companion Cube</a>:<ul><li> Hank and his truck.

Many seasons later, she reveals that man was also the first person she ever slept with.</li><li> In "Now Who's the Dummy?", Hank is making a ventriloquist dummy for Bobby modeled after various football players; one of his reference pictures is David Kalaiki-Alii, from the episode "Peggy Makes the Big Leagues".</li><li> Mrs. Kalaiki-Alii appears as the Hill's insurance adjuster when Hank has deal with his accident with Kahn in "Traffic Jam".</li><li> In "Grand Theft Arlen", the <em>Pro-Pain</em> video game has a virtual reproduction of Alabaster Jones from "Ho Yeah".</li><li> In "Not in My Back-hoe", Hank and his new friend Hal visit a revolving hardware store in McMaynerberry and Hal mentions it used to be a restaurant. Hank and Peggy ate at that restaurant for their 20th wedding anniversary in "As Old as the Hills."</li><li> In "Leanne's Saga", it's mentioned that Luanne's dad is "hiding on an oil rig" and won't come ashore until Hank faxes him Leanne's death certificate. A few seasons later, when he makes an appearance, it's explained that the oil rig was a lie and Luanne's father really was in jail (and, if he commits one more crime, he'll be there for life).</li><li> Bill orders meat from Larson Pork Products for his barbecue in "Blood and Sauce."

The show was greenlit for more seasons and the actual final episode is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the episode where Hank discovers Bobby's talent for identifying flaws in cuts of beef, puts him on the meat inspection team at the local community college, and when Bobby wins, the two have a celebratory barbecue in their backyard.

Often the quotes are taken out of context for added humor, such as "Hank Gets Dusted", whose quote is Hank saying, "It's time to rock".

This is presented more sympathetically than most examples, as the man was the one who asked because (as Peggy puts it), being gay in Texas in the '70s wasn't exactly a lot of fun.

For one thing, you cannot get an accommodation from an essential job function. One of the ways to determine whether a job function is essential is if that function applies to all employees similarly situated. For instance, if a disabled employee wants his employer to relax a production quota, which is universally applied to all employees similarly situated, then that employee may well be out of luck. However, if the employer has a policy or practice of relaxing the production standard for <em>any</em> reason, then they must relax it (within reason) to accommodate the disabled employee.

While he does live up to his claims in most cases, it does not stop him from lying or having people lie on his behalf to dissuade Bobby from aspirations that differ from what he wants Bobby to be/do.

Gilbert explains not only that he had to sell the ancestral manor to publish a magazine, but that all of the blood relatives Bill invited are either dead, institutionalized, infertile, or outed as impostors, leaving (as Hank put it) "a crying drunk and an angry sissy" as the last living vestiges of the dying aristocracy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLameFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLameFun">Incredibly Lame Fun</a>: One of the sources of humor for Hank.

Dale bribes a patient to get in... and can't get out, so he calls Bill, who voluntarily commits himself after reading a pamphlet. They try to escape and fail, so they call Hank. Hank talks to the doctor and the latter reveals the following: Boomhauer was only committed for 72 hours and had been deemed not a danger to himself or others, so he was free to go; Dale was never officially admitted to the hospital, so legally, he was free to go (but the doctor felt he should keep taking his medication); and Bill voluntarily committed himself, so he could have left at any time, and his medical insurance wouldn't pay for his stay.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsecuritySystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsecuritySystem">Insecurity System</a>: Dale's front door is protected by a rather ridiculous security system which included primed crossbows (as befitting his personality).

The only real exception to most of the time is Connie. Notable examples include:<ul><li> <em>Cotton</em>. He's angry, selfish, foulmouthed, and hostile to nearly everyone. He's emotionally abusive to Hank, completely dismissive towards Peggy, and generally picks fights with everyone he meets. The only people he seems to get along with are Bobby, Kahn and Minh to a limited degree, and his fellow veterans.</li><li> Dale, to an extent; while he's not <em>normally</em> a jerkass, he can be very quick to throw his family and friends under the bus to save his own skin, can hold some very petty grudges, and some of his more harebrained schemes can be shockingly inconsiderate or outright dangerous to his friends with little concern on his part. To his credit, at least, he usually either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">gets his comeuppance</a> or else <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">realizes his mistakes and apologizes for them.</a></li><li> Kahn: he's an unrepentant racist and can be very selfish, likes to antagonize the Hills or his other neighbors for his own amusement, he goes out of his way to brown-nose Ted Wassanasong at his or his family's expense, and while he genuinely means the best for Connie, his aggressive parenting puts her under a lot of pressure that she admits she can't always cope with. Minh shares a lot of these traits, but not to the same extent as Kahn.</li><li> Peggy can fall into this at times, usually when her ego gets the better of her. She can also be prone to bad cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">Never My Fault</a>. Again though, she usually either gets hit with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Laser-Guided Karma</a> or else realizes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">My God, What Have I Done?</a>.</li><li> Peggy's mom. She emotionally abused and dominated Peggy for most of her life, trying to control her and never showing any love or appreciation. Peggy tries to reconcile with her emotionally as an adult, but she hasn't changed one bit, essentially blaming Peggy for their struggling farm, despite the commercialization and urbanization of the local town being the biggest problem. Even when Peggy busts her ass to save it, she <em>still</em> refuses to show appreciation, eventually causing Peggy to give up on her entirely. She's even hostile to Hank, claiming Peggy wasted her life and ruined their farm by marrying him instead of another local farmer.</li><li> Buck possesses little to no redeeming qualities and rarely getting comeuppance for his behavior. He's sleazy and selfish to an extreme, and worst of all is that the morally-upright Hank is not only blindly loyal to him but also idolizes him.</li><li> Bill's wife, Lenore, who treated him like crap and openly cheated on him before dumping him and ruining his life. Her only actual appearance in the series has her coming back because his relationship with former Texas governor Ann Richards attracted her attention.</li><li> Luanne's mother, Leanne. She's a raging, alcoholic psychopath who terrorized Luanne's father. In her spotlight episode, she returns, hooks up with Bill, and proceeds to terrorize him. By the end of the episode, she's flashed the Hills in front of Bill and Luanne, tried to seduce Buckley, who was Luanne's boyfriend at the time, and violently tries to attack him and the rest of the group after he rejects her advances. Her last appearance is her marching off in a drunken, angrily-sobbing heap, blaming Luanne for all her problems.</li><li> Luanne's father, Hoyt. He's a crooked slimeball and two-bit criminal. He spent time in prison.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note17bmv0');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note17bmv0" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note17bmv0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Luanne was convined he was working on an oil rig, and was unaware of his criminal nature.</span> In his spotlight episode, he robs a diner, manipulates Lucky into taking the heat, and shows absolutely no remorse after the fact. Once the Hills trick him into getting arrested anyway, his first reaction is to try and throw Luanne under the bus for his arrest. At the very least though, Hoyt gets a bit of redemption in the end, as he finally owns up to his mistakes and accepts life in prison in exchange for Luanne not finding out about his criminal record.</li><li> Anthony Page in the pilot. He's immediately willing to jump to conclusions based on highly circumstantial evidence to assume that Bobby is being abused, refuses to believe anything any member of the Hills or any of the neighbors says otherwise, and without any form of legal proceedings tries to have Bobby taken away and sent to foster care. In this case at least, <em>nobody</em> is on his side, and he ends up losing his job for going behind his boss's back. He shows up again in "Junkie Business". This time, he forces Strickland Propane into rehiring Leon Petard, a (not really) recovered drug addict, who proceeds to drag the business through the dirt, and prevents them from firing him due to a legal loophole even when it's clear he isn't clean at all. Fortunately, Hank is able to use a loophole of his own at the end.</li><li> Jimmy Witchard, the dim-witted jerk who Bobby is forced to work concession for. He pushes Bobby around and forces him to do humiliating and dangerous things, and Hank unknowingly guilt trips Bobby into accepting it without complaint. Luckily, he digs his own grave when Hank happens to catch him trying to force Bobby to cross a speedway <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">mid-race</a> to deliver something, leading to a literal asskicking.</li><li> Professor John Lerner in "The Arrowhead." He lies to the Hills about the value of an arrowhead they found, mocking Peggy in the process, then tricks Peggy into signing a document turning their property into a protected dig site, allowing him to destroy it with the protection of the law. While he's doing this, he starts seducing Peggy with his knowledge, even giving her a traditional romantic Indian bracelet in the process. After a jealous Hank concocts a scheme to humiliate him with a fake artifact, Lerner ends up using it to humilate Peggy instead, and when Peggy realizes that it was Hank who did it to try to discredit Lerner out of jealousy, he snidely jokes that he could have "scored" with her for the price of a cheap bracelet. The ending of the episode is one of the series' best combinations of funny moments and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Laser-Guided Karma</a>.</li><li> The Ace from the episode "You Gotta Believe (In Moderation)"; his entire schtick is hosting celebrity softball games against local teams, where he and his team humiliate their opponents through wild stunts and upon winning, gives the money to charity. Hank didn't get the joke and convinced his team to play a very boring bunt game, causing a very distraught Ace to declare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous">Let's Get Dangerous!</a> and absolutely destroy Hank's team; this time, on winning, he keeps the money for himself rather than give it to charity, and blames it on Hank. Later on, when Hank and the others confront him, Ace reveals he only gives away the charity money because he makes so much from endorsements and lands attractive dates because of his celebrity status, and Hank's performance put that in jeopardy. After forcing Hank to humiliate himself in exchange for donating the money, Ace reneges on his word and refuses to donate anyway.</li><li> The Workers Comp people in "Hank's Back". They at first relentlessly assume that Hank's faking his injury or, when they can't anymore, try to pressure him into suing Strickland. And when he recovers, the agent who handled his case deliberately took out-of-context pictures to make it seem like he was faking the entire time, and plans to have him dragged to court for fraud. Oh, and she gets no comeuppance.</li><li> Lucky's lawyer, Edward Johnson. He's the driving force behind the frivolous lawsuits that Lucky uses to stay afloat, but after an accident renders Dale the target of his latest one, the lawyer realizes Dale has nothing worth suing over, and uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">Insane Troll Logic</a> to blame <em>Strickland Propane</em> for it. Lucky realizes that the lawsuit would sink his and Hank's shaky friendship and likely sink Strickland Propane, so he tries to call it off. The lawyer <em>refuses</em> since he wouldn't be able to make a profit that way. It's only through some shenanigans on Lucky, Hank, and Dale's part that they're able to get him to back down.</li><li> Everyone besides Hank in "The Accidental Terrorist." Hank finds out his dealer has been manipulating him into overpaying for his cars for years, and in retribution tries to organize a peaceful protest. He enlists the aid of some teenagers, and for his part places flyers on all the dealership's cars...while the teenagers, later on and without Hank's knowledge, <em>firebomb</em> them. Everyone in the episode is utterly convinced Hank did it, from the dealer to the police to the lawyers to even his own friends and family. At no point does Hank successfully convince <em>anyone</em> he was innocent; the only reason the plot is resolved is because the prosecution decides Hank could drag the case out longer than it's worth and lets him off the hook.</li><li> Willie Lane, the ex-Dallas Cowboy who was briefly Hank's neighbor. Though Hank and the others are starstruck at first, when Willie hijacks their usual spot and Hank politely inquires, Willie responds with smarmy hostility, and it only gets worse from there; worse, because of his celebrity status, he's able to do things like punch Hank and <em>flip a car into his lawn</em> and the police immediately believe it was Hank. Hank eventually succeeds in taking him down by blackmailing him with the imprint on his bruise being a perfect match for Willie's Dallas Cowboys ring.</li><li> The artist who humiliates Hank and invades his privacy by obtaining a picture of his colonoscopy from the earlier episode "Hank's Unmentionable Problem" and submits it to an art museum. When Hank politely <em>explains</em> that it's humiliating and an invasion of his privacy, the artist responds by harshly accusing him of censorship and having him banned from the museum. Even when he explains his case, nobody is on Hank's side; he's only able to get the picture taken down through a legal loophole.</li><li> Junie Harper, who wants to get Halloween banned for being a pagan holiday. She does so by spouting the most extreme, absurd strawman beliefs, and condemns anyone who tries to call her out on it. She briefly won Bobby over, but Hank was able to convince Bobby just how full-of-it she was.</li><li> <em>Everyone</em> in the episode "Jumpin' Crack Bass." Hank makes an honest (if highly circumstantial) mistake in buying crack thinking it was fishing bait. <em>No one</em> believes him; it's even made a point that the judge at his trial is familiar with Hank and knows what an outstanding citizen he is, but when he finds out what Hank is accused of, he's immediately ready to convict him for it. Hank only avoids prison by a legal technicality.</li><li> Mr. Holloway in "The Company Man". Hank is tasked by Buck to win over Holloway's business, but the man is a jerk who insists that all Texans are stereotypical hicks. When Hank tries to convince him otherwise, Holloway threatens to walk. Hank plays along, but when he's had enough of Holloway's antics, the latter leaves and takes his business to Thatherton's out of spite.</li><li> Bobby's meat team. They're willing to throw pepper in their opponents' eyes, <em>and even the organizer who sought Bobby agrees with the mentality</em>, and they all practically crucify Bobby when he makes a minor mistake during training. Their opponents are no better. They commit a busjacking, leaving Bobby and all of his teammates stranded in the desert, not caring if they <em>die</em>, all to cheat and win at a meat judging competiton.</li><li> Bill's second doctor in "Dia-Bill-ic Shock", who derisively tells Bill he'll never walk again and gives him a wheelchair. Later in the episode, he rudely told Bill, "Are you upset or something? I said you had diabetes, not cry-a-betes." This is in stark contrast to his first doctor, who is sympathetic to his plight and says that he can control his diabetes with diet and exercise.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint">Jerkass Has a Point</a>:<ul><li> In "How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Alamo", Hank butts heads with a man who has a less-than-flattering interpretation of the Alamo (namely, that the Texans involved were a bunch of drunken cowards). The other man points out the logic behind his views, such as citing Sam Houston's troubled life and documented alcoholism and pointing out that the only people who know exactly what happened at the Alamo are long dead so all they have to go off of is historical records. In the end, Hank is dissuaded from smashing up the stage when he realizes that it's wrong to censor someone else just because you don't like their message, but he insists on giving a speech to relate the bare facts of the battle before the play begins.</li><li> In &#147;The Arrowhead&#148;, Professor John Lerner&#146;s humiliation of Peggy, while undoubtably mean, isn&#146;t entirely unwarranted. She was walking around thinking that digging around in her yard with the professor for a week pretty much put her on the same level as the grad students who had been studying archaeology for years. While he certainly didn&#146;t need to be such a jerk about it, Peggy definitely needed to be taken down a notch.</li><li> In "Straight as an Arrow", Wesley Cherish, the new leader of the Order of the Straight Arrow, comes off as seeming overprotective and uninteresting because he doesn't allow the children to eat candy or perform outdoor activities. However, it's justified in that his two children that are in the group: one has ADHD and the other is hyperglycemic, and thus too much sugar can be dangerous to them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock">Jerk Jock</a>:<ul><li> Chane Wassanasong thinks he's the greatest thing the world has ever seen and has the hots for Connie. She can't stand him, but her parents keep trying to set them up together, mainly because they'd love any connection to Chane's father, Ted.</li><li> Hank was one when he was younger:<div class="indent"> <strong>Hank:</strong> Hey fatty! You are fat!</div></li><li> The gang's treatment of Eustice in "The Order of the Straight Arrow". They all call him "Useless" and this is also referenced in flashback.</li><li> In "Peggy Makes the Big Leagues", it seems at first that Peggy is dealing with one in David Kalaiki-Alii because he won't study. David, for the most part, isn't a jerk, but is just lazy and a little self-absorbed. He isn't happy when he learns that his mother is willing to pretend that he has a severe learning disability to get Hank and Peggy to stop inquiring about his grades, which they immediately believe. David admits that he deserves to have Peggy think of him as mentally challenged after neglecting all her attempts at making him better in math and explains to her it was a lie his mom made up.</li><li> Played straight with Willie Lane, the boorish, hard-drinking ex-Dallas Cowboy who moves into Rainey Street in "New Cowboy on the Block" and causes trouble for Hank and his friends.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassRealization">Jerkass Realization</a>:<ul><li> In "The Bluegrass is Always Greener", Kahn tells Hank he wants Connie to become a famous violinist so he can go back to his home village and rub her success in everyone's faces. When Hank scolds Kahn for using Connie like that, he realizes he was doing the same thing, using Connie to fulfill his dream of being a bluegrass star.</li><li> In "Now Who's the Dummy?", Peggy accuses Hank of using Chip Block as his ideal son. Realizing she's right, Hank remakes his new Chip to look like Bobby.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare">Jump Scare</a>:<ul><li> "Gone with the Windstorm" has a subplot of Bobby being terrorized by a classmate that just loves to give these.</li><li> When Hank, Bobby, and Bill are startled by the HDTV Peggy bought (and no one knows how to operate) when it gets out of Sleep Mode.</li></ul></li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder3');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K-O&nbsp;</div><div id="folder3" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KafkaKomedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KafkaKomedy">Kafka Komedy</a>: Bill's life is tragic enough to fall under this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Karma Houdini</a>:<ul><li> Peggy gets away with being an asshole to others a little too much.

Even worse, just about everybody except Dale knows, but nobody says anything to him. Karma did eventually creep up on her when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">she began to go bald after she ended the affair.</a></li><li> John Redcorn. He cheated on Nancy without being caught and he doesn't get called out on it. He would eventually receive a karmic punishment in being repeatedly denied a role in Joseph's life and having to watch an idiot raise his son. And there was also that time Dale mistook him for an intruder and whacked him in the face. Also, while he found some minor success being a children's entertainer, "Redcorn Gambles With His Future" shattered his dreams of becoming a famous rockstar and losing his Native American casino after investing thousands of dollars on it. While these unfortunate events may not be directly connected to his prior sins, it does go to show that not everything goes his way.</li><li> Kahn took a big risk showing Hank the top secret project he was working on and specifically told Hank to never tell anyone. Hank immediately told Dale, Bill, and Boomhauer and after Bill blabbed about it at work, Kahn was fired for treason. The only way he was able to get another job was to take one in Houston, three hours away. Hank blamed it on Kahn being an asshole, despite the fact that <em>he</em> was the one went back on his word and got Kahn fired in the first place. The only punishment Hank got was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a> from Peggy and doing some housework for Mihn, which he liked anyway. In Kahn's case, he did it purposefully to brag about his new promotion by luring Hank to his workplace under the pretense that they needed propane, then after showing off everything he did, revealed they actually had no need for propane <em>at all</em>.</li><li> Buck has gotten away with illegal activities several times. He's bet branches of his company <em>and employees</em> on poker games. He refused to pay child support for his illegitimate son Ray-Roy, and freely admitted that he would've planted evidence that Hank murdered Debbie Grund <em>in front of a Texas Ranger</em> and still gets off scot-free. The reason Hank works for him in spite of all this is that he believes somewhere deep down inside him, is the amazing businessman he used to be. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The only time karma ever really hit this man is when his emus attacked him in a parking lot since he was trying to have them killed to commit insurance fraud.</span></li><li> In "Junkie Business", instead of hiring the incredibly well-qualified and knowledgeable Maria Montalvo for the new Accessories Associate position at Strickland Propane, Hank hires Leon Petard, who later turns out to be a drug addict. While Anthony Page later giving Leon free run can be seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Laser-Guided Karma</a>, Hank committed two various obvious forms of discrimination as not only did he refuse to hire a woman but he asked her about her religious belief despite knowing it was illegal. Given the fact that Strickland could have been sued because of Hank&#146;s actions, Leon seems like a mild inconvenience. At least they're shown hiring her at the end.</li><li> In "Get Your Freak Off", Hank is flanderized to a level that would make the Amish look modern. Basically, Hank punishes Bobby for seeing him and his girlfriend do suggestive dance moves at a concert by literally stripping his room clean of everything except his bed, and when he leaves, he says something along the lines of: "Okay have fun!". Not to mention the fact that he forces Bobby to cut off all ties he has with his friends. Nobody bothers to call Hank out on his overreaction, not even Peggy says anything, and this episode had her portrayed as smarter than she normally was Post-Flanderization.</li><li> The hijackers from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> were never caught. Though Bobby's team acted like general jackasses, the opposite team went a little too far.</li><li> The three terrorists in "The Accidental Terrorist" never got caught after bombing the car dealership and leaving Hank to take the blame.</li><li> In "Bad News Bill", Bobby's new Little League coach tries an over-enthusiastic approach to encourage Bobby to do well in baseball and makes Hank look like a horrible dad for "giving up on Bobby" when he really was just being realistic, not wanting Bobby to feel disappointed if things go bad instead of giving him false hope. Nobody calls out the coach on his attitude towards Hank, even when his techniques eventually fail to help Bobby and only humiliate him, though Peggy says Hank knows what is best for his son. In the same episode Bill is given a position of authority and rubs it in Hank's face. He refuses to let Hank watch Bobby play without doing meaningless tasks, where he has to deal with hostile people who call him a bad father. Hank is eventually banned from watching Bobby play and Bill remains in his position. The only consequence Bill receives is Dale and Boomhauer agreeing with Hank that Bill is in the wrong and running off after Hank has enough of his attitude and threatens to kick his ass.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">Kayfabe</a>: In "Glen Peggy Glen Ross", when Peggy starts working for Sizemore Realty, she learns that Chris Sizemore has his employees do things like pretend to be married in order to improve their sales.

In "Rich Hank, Poor Hank", Bobby mistakenly thinks that his father is rich when he overhears Hank telling Peggy about his $1000 annual bonus from work but mistakenly gets the idea that Hank makes that much per day. At first, Bobby tries to get his father to spend his money, which backfires when Hank tries to teach Bobby the value of a dollar by showing how much money Bobby spent and suggests Bobby could make money by taking littered cans to the recycling center, but this only reinforces Bobby's misjudgment that Hank is being stingy. Bobby steals Hank emergency credit card and goes to the mall. After Bobby is caught and he tells Hank he knows he rich, Hank clarifies Bobby's earlier misconceptions &mdash; the $1000 check was an annual bonus and the strongbox of oil receipts was a collection of receipts what Hank has spent on the truck, such as oil changes. They return all of the items which Bobby had purchased, save for a nonrefundable jet ski. Bobby, feeling bad for the trouble he caused and learning of his family's real income, works hard at his punishment and adopting Hank's attitude towards the value of a hard day's work and an honest dollar. At first, Hank is happy and proud of Bobby, but when they try to sell the jet ski to a rich father buying it for his spoiled son Eric, Hank becomes uncomfortable when he sees that Bobby is too eager to please Eric, who treats him like garbage. This prompts Hank to decide not to sell the jet ski to Eric's father. As Hank and Bobby ride the jet ski to test it, he tells Bobby they're not selling the jet ski, they will sell it in a year and carry it on his credit card until then. The episode ends with Hank and Bobby talking about a responsible way to use a credit card and Hank happy that Bobby learned his lesson about earnest work and not behaving like that spoiled brat.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsHaveAnotherBaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsHaveAnotherBaby">Let's Have Another Baby</a>: Hank and Peggy get the urge to have another child after dealing the whole episode with Hank attempting to have Ladybird impregnated.

When Bobby inevitably quits, Hank reacts with anger and confusion.

Hank's so uptight because Cotton would scream at him any time he ever showed the slightest hint of emotion. It has been hinted numerous times that Bobby&#146;s n&iuml;evete is mainly due to the fact that Hank refuses to appreciate his other skills.

In one episode, Bobby becomes interested in growing roses, which Hank is against until he learned that there are Rose competitions, at which point he completely muscles Bobby out of the picture and takes over.</li><li> In "Soldier of Misfortune", despite being a gun club, Mad Dog is the only one who's serious about holding Hank, Dale, Bill, and Boomhauer hostage and torturing them for real:<div class="indent"> <strong>Earl:</strong> Twenty minutes ago, we were talking about ordering a pizza.

This complicates the episodes where Hank and Peggy are shown as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchoolSweethearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchoolSweethearts">High-School Sweethearts</a>. Not only that but Peggy's mother went from being older-looking version of Peggy, who was a bit critical of her, into a downright mean and verbally abusive bitch who never forgave Peggy for abandoning the family ranch, even after saving it. It also contradicts the episode "I Remember Mono" where she sends Bobby a gift and is all-but stated to be on good terms with Peggy.</li><li> Luanne's father. In the first episode, Luanne, then aged 18, is dropped off at the Hill residence after her mother stabs him. In later episodes, it is revealed that he is working on an oil rig just to stay safely away from Luanne's psycho mother, refusing to come back until Hank faxes him her death certificate and even visiting his and Peggy's family for Thanksgiving. All this is chucked out the window when he finally makes an appearance. He's introduced as a manipulative drunken bastard and Hank and Peggy decide to cover up the truth about him to his grown daughter. He claims that Luanne was five when he last saw her. He's a felon out of prison, rather than having been working on an oil rig (he used the "oil rig" story to keep Luanne from knowing that he is a felon). And he looks nothing like his sister Peggy. In an earlier episode, he was described as strongly resembling Peggy but with smaller feet.</li><li> Hank and his old Arlen High School football teammates challenged the team that they lost against in the state championship to a rematch that they eventually win. This one is made more glaring by the fact that Hank had come to terms with losing the game in an earlier episode.</li><li> Cotton's second starring episode deals with him going senile. Hank notices that Cotton has gone from being his crazy old self to just plain crazy and Cotton is portrayed as such. The only reason Cotton avoids being institutionalized is by having Didi be his caretaker. However, in all subsequent episodes, Cotton's senility is either toned down or abandoned entirely and Didi eventually divorces him (and is implied to take Good Hank with her, since we don't hear about Good Hank ever again following the divorce).</li><li> Dale's understanding of John Redcorn's sexuality. In "My Own Private Rodeo", the episode where Dale and Nancy renew their vows, Nancy asks Dale if he is truly OK with his dad being gay. Dale replies, "Why would have a problem with it? John Redcorn's gay and I've been friends with him for years".

In "Bobby On Track", Hank makes Bobby complete the 5K run at the school track as punishment for not completing the Fun Run charity race. The track and field coach turns up and wants Bobby on his team, puzzling Hank. It turns out that the coach is using Bobby's lack of ability to motivate the rest of the team. The coach has Bobby substitute for a player that misbehaved to embarrass them so they try harder so they won't be humiliated by being replaced by Bobby. At first it works, to Hank's disappointment, with Bobby seeing himself as a motivator. But when the team gets to the final it works a little too well when a player hyper-extended because he saw the coach talking to Bobby and was afraid he was going to get replaced. The coach has no one to replace him to run the relay, until Hank suggests using Bobby. The coach is unhappy because this was a situation where losing would hurt the team this time. The coach tries to motivate Bobby by telling him to imagine himself as a different person, Bobby 2.0; Hank tells Bobby to forget that nonsense, just to try. Bobby understands, and joins the race. At first he loses the lead, but the other runners trip, allowing Bobby to catch up and run past them. When the other runners catch up to Bobby, he still runs as fast as he can and wins the race.<ul><li> In "A Firefighting We Will Go", Hank and friends join the volunteer fire department, but the firehouse ends up burning down while they're on call. Dale unintentionally started the fire by plugging in a neon Alamo Beer sign with faulty wiring just before they left, but Hank ends up shifting the blame to Chet Elderson, the sign's original owner and a fellow firefighter who had died earlier in the episode.

In "Hank's Bad Hair Day", Bill offers to cut Hank's hair after his regular barber is forced to retire due to going senile, but Hank declines. Later on Bill tells Hank that the refusal feels like a massive insult ("It's like you're callin me an <strong>IDIOT!!</strong>") and actively dismisses Peggy's remarks on the matter &mdash; which, considering his massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">stalker-crush</a> on her, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OoCIsSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OoCIsSeriousBusiness">pretty shocking</a>.</li><li> Lawn care for Hank. The day Bobby was born Hank bought a whetstone, to be presented to him when he becomes a teenager. The whetstone is for sharpening mower blades, which is what Bobby is to do every Saturday until he has shown himself to be responsible enough to mow the lawn. In other words, a common chore assigned to teenagers is treated as a rite of passing and a privilege that must be earned. Another episode has Hank see Kahn using mowing the lawn as a punishment for Connie and being completely bewildered by it.</li><li> Beer is worshipped by the guys. Beer is so sacred that it even supersedes the lawn in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a> hierarchy, with Hank saying he wouldn't pour out a beer to extinguish a grass fire. Spitting out beer is to be avoided at all costs, so much so that when someone actually does it, it's for a serious reason. Even that which contains beer, the cooler, is treated with respect. When Cotton blindly drives his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">Cadillac Car</a> down the alley and nearly kills Bill, Hank's immediate concern is whether or not the cooler was dented.</li><li> That's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pong">Pong</a></em>, kiddo.</li><li> Boris is taking this class for the ninth time, and he is almost a clown.</li><li> Boggle.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexyPriest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexyPriest">Sexy Priest</a>:<ul><li> Monsignor Martinez from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Los Dias y Las Noches de Monsignor Martinez</a></em>.</li><li> Bill sees Reverend Stroup as this.

The mystery is solved in two minutes because ditzy Luanne blabs and Dale screams it for everyone to hear. The actors leave just as the train departs.
