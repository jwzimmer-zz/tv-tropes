But after his friends go through a lot of effort to help him get into the rangers, he quits because it's too much hard work, and he says that he now has a dream of being a jet pilot. Most kids Mikey's age can't handle that kind of responsibility and have new dreams of what they want all the time; if Mikey's friends had just waited, he would have gotten over it in time without them having to go through all that effort.</li><li> In "<img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.
