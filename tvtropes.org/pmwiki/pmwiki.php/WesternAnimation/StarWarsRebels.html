Also the paintbrush-style coloring of <em>The Clone Wars</em> is gone, and a more vibrant palette is used. The differences are probably best shown on the respective models of <a class="urllink" href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B9dDZFMCcAAYZed.jpg">Tarkin.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>, though really, this can apply to any previously established character featured in <em>The Clone Wars</em> that made it into <em>Rebels</em>, even accounting for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> in-between installments.</li><li> Vader appears subtly different from the way he does in the movies &mdash; specifically, his mask has more of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageHelm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageHelm">"angry" appearance</a> with more elongated features and the red of his eyes is more pronounced. This is because the show's art style is based on Ralph McQuarrie's original artwork, rather than the finished designs that appear in the films.</li><li> The Stormtroopers are an interesting case; while they're more or less given the same look as in the films, said appearance is far more cartoony in the show. Their facial features seem especially exaggerated.</li><li> Ahsoka's appearance in Rebels has various changes from her appearance in <em>The Clone Wars</em>, even accounting for age. The blue stripes on her horns and head-tails are thinner and wavy, the markings on her cheeks extend further up to be level with her eyes, her eye markings are extended to just below her eyes, and her forehead markings are wider. She also now has a long ovalish/rectangular face instead of a square face, something that age normally doesn't change. Her lips are also notably thinner.</li><li> The entire Ithorian race seems to have a much less bulky body compared to how they looked back in <em>The Clone Wars</em>.

While very flashy, the tactical advantages of this are outweighed by the flaws of the design. On the plus side, the spinning allows the user to quickly reorient the blade without adjusting their hands ("Fire Across the Galaxy"), hit with additional force (Ezra's dream sequence in "Path of the Jedi"), turn it into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDisc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDisc">Deadly Disc</a> when thrown (numerous examples), and create a shield of sorts ("Fire Across the Galaxy"). The <em>Rebels</em> Encyclopedia actually invokes this, explaining that the weapon is meant to unnerve inexperienced Jedi opponents, making them more vulnerable for the real deadly strike. The big flaw is demonstrated in the season finale when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kanan uses his lightsabers to break the ring while the sabers are spinning, causing both parts of the saber to fly out of the Grand Inquisitor's hand and spelling his defeat.

Cham stated that the Empire has become better at anticipating their moves, and that he underestimated the commander. It sounds like he is referring to Thrawn, and is immediately succeeded by Thrawn emerging from the shadows, but in the actual episode, he is referring to Captain Slaven. However, considering how incompetent Slaven seemed in the same episode, it is likely that he only did this with Thrawn overseeing him.</li><li> The trailers for the second half of Season 3 greatly hyped up that the forthcoming confrontation between <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Darth Maul and Obi-Wan Kenobi</span> would be an epic battle with a massive scope.
