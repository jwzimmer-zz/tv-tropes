Angry that she has to leave when she wasn't crying like them, Angelica stages her own circus in Tommy's backyard. Her circus features Tommy as a "lion trainer" and Spike as the lion, Phil and Lil as trapeze artists, and Chuckie as the human "candyball".</li><li> In the episode "Clown Around", Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, Lil, Kimi, and Angelica go to the circus. While the other babies have fun, Chuckie is afraid of clowns. Angelica tricks the babies into thinking that Chuckie is going to turn into a clown, and after having a red snow-cone, clown shoe souvenirs, and a run-in with a powder puff, Chuckie ends up looking like a clown. He even gets roped into the center ring to perform with the clowns.

The formula usually has Tommy suggesting they do something, Phil and Lil agreeing, Chuckie mentioning that it's not such a good idea, one of the three calling Chuckie a "big baby" and dragging him along. It's usually subverted when the adventure goes south, just as Chuckie said it would (but they still had a blast). In said early days, Chuckie's more temperamental attitude led him to point this out more frequently. In one episode he even lampshades how in every argument Tommy tricks him into following him and suggests to just skip it and go along with the plan right away.</li><li> An interesting subversion is the episode "Touchdown Tommy". The B-Plot has the dads watching a big football game, though Chaz wants to watch the chess tournament. They blow him off and he's stuck watching the game. Apparently, he knew what he was saying - because the dads were too busy watching football, the babies covered the living room in chocolate milk and Didi and Betty were pissed when they got back:<div class="indent"><strong>Chaz:</strong> I told you we should have watched the chess tournaments. <br><em>[the others glare at him]</em></div></li><li> At least a handful of episodes are devoted to something bad happening to Chuckie, or him finally drawing the line, at which point the others are apologetic, at least for a while (e.g. "Farewell My Friend", "Chuckie's Wonderful Life").</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nod</a>: Many, many instances.<ul><li> In the episode <em>Angelica's In Love</em>, a new kid that spends the day at Tommy's house tells him that he heard talk that Tommy "escaped" from Daycare, referencing an episode only a few prior where Tommy did just that.</li><li> During the episode "Driving Miss Angelica", the titular character accidentally locks herself in a closet while trying to get back a box of chocolates her father took from her. She pounds on the door from the inside while screaming "Daddy! Daddy!" Drew passes by the closet, but can't hear her because he has a Walkman on and is listening to a song heard in the episode "Reptar on Ice".</li><li> The episode "Feeding Hubert" introduces (what the babies believe is) a monster named Hubert that eats garbage&mdash; in reality, it's the neighborhood garbage truck ("Hubert" presumably being the name of the driver). In a later episode ("The Mattress"), the babies think that there's a monster in Grandpa's bed and attempt to feed him to "a bigger monster," at which point Hubert makes his second appearance (and Chuckie refers to it by name, confirming the continuity).</li><li> During at least one episode ("The Odd Couple"), Chaz is portrayed as writing left-handed. Chuckie is later revealed to have developed as a lefty as well.</li><li> At the end of an adventure at the Zoo, Chaz discusses with Stu on where to take the Rugrats next, hopefully where they won't get into trouble; his suggestions were the bowling alley, the mini-golf course and the pool at the community center. In each case Stu mutters "Tried it," referencing previous episodes ("King Ten Pin", "Ice Cream Mountain", and "The Big Flush", respectively) where Stu takes them on trips to these locations and they inevtiably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">caused mayhem</a> every time.</li><li> In an episode of the later seasons, the babies were eating watermelons. Chuckie worries about swallowing a seed again, and he even mentions how the babies went inside his stomach to try and retrieve it.</li><li> Certain events in <em>Rugrats in Paris</em> are alluded to in the first episode that aired after it, "Finsterella".</li><li> During the episode "The Big Flush", Chuckie goes on a rant, after being asked by Tommy "Have I ever got us lost forever?" Everything Chuckie says actually happened in previous episodes:<div class="indent"><strong>Chuckie:</strong> How 'bout the time you took us down in the basement and I got stuck in the mattress? And the time you got us locked in that toy store! And the time you made us go through that mirror into Mirrorland! And the time we chased after that wedding cake!

The babies often misintiprent things or believe something to be different from the reality (sometimes because Angelica makes it up to scare them), only for something to happen to support their theories. Sometimes, the lies Angelica tells them eventually appears to affect her as well (in "Family Reunion", when she mistakenly thinks her story about families trading kids at a family reunion is true, she tells the kids "I thought I was making it up").</li><li> Additionally, the babies might accidentally cause a happy ending or expose some kind of secret or fraud. In one episode, they wander into the basement and accidentally get Stu's invention to work properly. In "The Bank Trick", while wandering the bank for M&amp;Ms, they unintentionally set off a burglary alarm, and when the police show up, it turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the "bank examiners" are actually crooks the police had been after for years</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis">Cool Big Sis</a>:<ul><li> Susie tends to act as an older sister to the babies.</li><li> Angelica has her moments, too. See "Moving Away" and "New Kid in Town" for early examples. A later episode also focuses on the fact that Angelica, who by then is the lone remaining only child in the series, really wants a sibling. In fact, this popped up in the two-parter right before the first movie, where Angelica gets mad because Tommy and Chuckie don't see her as a big sister.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoordinatedClothes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoordinatedClothes">Coordinated Clothes</a>: Phil and Lil dress exactly the same, with minor exceptions&mdash; Lil wears a pink ribbon in her hair, pink shoes, and her top is a dress. Phil wears blue shoes, his top is a shirt, and he wears blue shorts (Lil wears only her diaper). Because of this, Phil and Lil can each easily impersonate the other, and are good enough at it to fool their parents. Phil can even perfectly imitate Lil's voice, as seen in the episode "Beauty Pageant".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorrupter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorrupter">The Corrupter</a>: Angelica, to Tommy, in "Rebel Without a Teddy Bear". She's also done this to Phil and Lil. Chuckie seems to be less susceptible than the other babies, possibly because he's the smartest and, at the same time, the most cynical. The other kids are naive to Angelica's false sincerity, and Chuckie often sees right through it, sometimes better than the adults.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoupleThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoupleThemeNaming">Couple Theme Naming</a>: Grandpa Lou eventually marries a woman named Lulu.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtroomEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtroomEpisode">Courtroom Episode</a>:<ul><li> In "The Trial", the babies do this to find out who broke Tommy's favorite clown lamp, with Tommy as the judge and Angelica as the prosecutor (although she says she's the "Persecutor").

This is possibly because Charlotte is constantly working, to the point where it wouldn't be a stretch to say that she's talking, on her cell phone or in person, to her executive assistant Jonathan (or a potential client) <em>in every episode she's been in.</em> Subtle hints indicate that Charlotte is threatened by the fact that the working world is dominated by men, and is a workaholic to compensate.</li><li> Subverted in "The Shot". Drew (by himself) takes Angelica to the doctor's office to get a booster shot, which is far from the first or last time he and Angelica are seen together without Charlotte.

Angelica can't understand what the babies see in an empty box. At the end of the episode, Stu decides to market a line of cardboard boxes for kids to play with.</li><li> "Kid TV" involves Stu throwing his half-finished invention at the TV after seeing a commercial from a competitor, breaking the TV as a result. The biggest box he has is just barely too small to fit the TV, so the babies make a TV out of the cardboard box and make their own shows, including a game show, a news program, and a soap opera.</li><li> A variation of this trope appears in "Momma Trauma," where a man is trying to sell some toy robots, but the kids are only interested in the ball which comes as an accessory.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingKongCopy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingKongCopy">King Kong Copy</a>: Thorg is a giant purple ape that acts as King Kong <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> counterpart to their mainstay <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Notzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Notzilla">Notzilla</a> Reptar.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll">Know-Nothing Know-It-All</a><ul><li> Dr Lipschitz.

Sometimes she gives the other babies wrong information on purpose in the hopes they'll believe her. Other times it's show she actually believes what she is saying.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLadette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLadette">The Lad-ette</a>: Betty enjoys football, working out, home improvement, and is said to be a very good mechanic. She's also much more outgoing, boisterous, and assertive (not to mention <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TinyGuyHugeGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TinyGuyHugeGirl">much larger</a>) than her husband Howard.

If it wasn't enough to smite her within minutes of whatever transgression(s) she committed in that episode, the mighty hand of karma seems to reach down and bitch-slap Angelica as hard as possible, usually in ironic or embarrassingly appropriate ways.<ul><li> In "Angelica Breaks A Leg," Angelica gets the idea to feign having a broken leg so everyone will cater to her, which works when the doctor mixes up her x-ray results with someone who did break their leg. After spending the whole episode tormenting Stu and Didi with ridiculous demands, the doctor calls and lets them know Angelica's leg is fine, while shortly after, it is revealed that Charlotte broke her leg for real, so Drew forces Angelica to help him cater to Charlotte.</li><li> In "Chuckie vs The Potty," she makes fun of Chuckie the entire episode for struggling with his potty training. At the end of the episode, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Chuckie successfully uses his kiddy toilet on his own, and Angelica comes in crying that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingDampSheets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingDampSheets">she wet the bed.</a></span></li><li> During the episode "Graham Canyon," Angelica taunts Tommy because she has chewing gum and Tommy can't have any because he's too young. She teases him with "You're too little. You'd just swallow it." Then the car hits a bump, and Angelica accidentally swallows her gum.</li><li> In "The Shot," Angelica guilt-trips Tommy into telling her his and Hector's plans to escape the doctor's out of fear of getting their booster shots, and then proceeds to snitch them out. After Tommy and Hector are discovered, they both realize shots aren't too scary and had no problem with them, while Angelica could not stop crying after hers.</li><li> In "The Alien," Angelica tells the babies that Chuckie and his father are aliens, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsPetty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsPetty">simply because she's jealous since she's too big to fit in the new playhouse Chuckie has</a>. She commits to the lie, and eventually tries to "melt" Chuckie by spraying him with the hose. When she does, Chuckie doesn't melt, and the babies no longer believe Angelica. As the kids join Chuckie in the playhouse, Angelica clutches the hose while screaming "YOU DUMB BABIES!" She then accidentally sprays herself with the hose.</li><li> In "Chuckie Loses His Glasses", Angelica steals Chuckie's glasses while the latter is counting in a game of hide-and-seek and has him searching everywhere for them. When Angelica puts the glasses on herself, she ends up getting dizzy and sick and vomits on her father's sweater, and he takes her home for both of them to get cleaned up.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Despite the fact that it turned out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a>,</span> Angelica STILL felt some karmic wrath when she attempted to make the seed in Chuckie's stomach grow. As she watered it and it began to sprout, the vines that came out of the seed grabbed her by the ankle and thrashed her around until she managed to free herself.</li><li> At the end of "The Trial," Angelica <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> admits to breaking Tommy's clown lamp, and then brags that the babies "Can't do anything about it, because [they] can't talk," <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">before victoriously shouting "I did it, I did it, I DID IT!</a>" Didi hears the entire confession, and Angelica immediately denies it. Didi doesn't believe her.</span></li><li> Subverted in the episode "Moving Away." The babies recall how the four of them and Angelica all met one another at a housewarming party for Stu and Didi. Before the occasion, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">Angelica tells each baby, in private, that the other babies are mean, selfish bullies,</a> for no reason other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">so she can see them fight for her own amusement.</a> At the party, her plans goes off without a hitch, and as she congratulates herself for being "a genius," she spots a box of cookies in the neighbor's yard. She then tries to fit through the bottom of a broken fence to get to them, and gets stuck. Soon after, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the babies realize that Angelica lied to them about one another, and Tommy somehow deduces that it's because she wanted them to be friends. Grateful towards Angelica, they go and help her get unstuck from the fence.</span></li><li> In "Chuckie's Wonderful Life", Angelica takes a CD from Chaz (after Tommy initially took it out of the case), and makes Chuckie think it's his fault it disappeared, right down to telling him that the world would be better off without him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAWonderfulPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAWonderfulPlot">Later, after Chuckie meets a guardian angel who shows what life would actually be like without him</a>, Drew discovers the CD, bringing it back and telling Chaz that Angelica will be grounded with no dessert for a week.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leitmotif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leitmotif">Leitmotif</a>: Angeilca has a noticeable one that accompanies all her lies and trickery.<ul><li> Reptar has one as well. It's used even when only his likeness is seen&mdash; dolls, cereal, even Tommy's night light.</li><li> In Season 1 (and possibly 2), when a moose is shown or talked about, the same sound plays in the background almost every time.</li><li> From Season 4 onward, Spike had a distinctive "goofy" synthesized theme of sorts, that was also sometimes used for Fifi.</li><li> In some earlier episodes, Boris and Minka had a distinctive Yiddish theme tune accompanying their arrival or some other scene featuring them.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedWardrobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedWardrobe">Limited Wardrobe</a>: Perhaps one of the few western hemisphere cartoons that averts this trope from time to time for no plot-related reason. Tommy wears an orange shirt instead of his standard blue in at least one episode (he also wears shoes and overalls in "Reptar's Revenge"), and Chaz, Chuckie and Drew sometimes wear sweaters as opposed to their more recognizable attires.<ul><li> Charlotte in particular seems to be the most frequent rebel to this trope. She wears numerous different outfits, and sometimes even wears curlers in hair despite the fact that her hair is never curly.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LineOfSightName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LineOfSightName">Line-of-Sight Name</a>: In order to con Didi into buying her two toys instead of just one, Angelica claims to have a sister. Seeing a boy playing with a ball across the store, she names her invented sibling "Ballina."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded">Literal-Minded</a>: Being babies, the main characters of the show are extremely prone to this trope. For example, Phil and Lil tell Chuckie that what we call a "watch" is called a "time," because when adults wear one, they tend to glance at it before exclaiming "Look at the time!"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingEmotionalCrutch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingEmotionalCrutch">Living Emotional Crutch</a>: The premise of the episode "Together At Last." Didi and Betty have coffee at Betty's house when they notice the twins arguing loudly. Coincidentally, this is right after Didi tells Betty that Lipschitz recommends separating twins every now and then to help them maintain independence. Betty at first is reluctant, but gives in and lets Didi take Lil to play with Tommy and Chuckie, while Phil stays at home with her. Both twins are miserable without each other and spend the rest of the episode trying to get back together.<ul><li> If you stop to think about it, Chas is the most tragic character in the whole show. Up until his and Kira's wedding in <em>Rugrats in Paris</em>, not only is he a widower, he is emotionally dependent on Chuckie. This is best exemplified in "Chuckie's Wonderful Life," where if Chuckie was never born, he would totally lose his mind, with only a sock puppet as his companion.

Phil and Lil also want worms, which is semi-unusual.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a>: Stu has a very apparent mad scientist streak, making dangerous and advanced toys that he insist <em>should</em> work properly and a seemingly absent sense of ethics when it comes to technology, even in one instance shrugging off the moral dilemmas of a time machine marketed towards children.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Malaproper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Malaproper">Malaproper</a>:<ul><li> So much so that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> used to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">an article listing the kids' mispronunciations of certain words</a>. Even 3-year old Angelica (and the 4 year olds she made friends with at a playground one day) would sometimes fall victim to this. In fact, in many episodes, the main plot point arises due to the babies misinterpreting something the adults say and assuming an alternate meaning:</li><li> Stu once designs a toy clown named "Mr. Friend." The babies mishear this as "Mr. Fiend" and assume that it is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown">hostile enemy</a>.</li><li> In another episode, the pilot light in Tommy's house goes out. The babies hear "pirate light" and come to believe that the repairman hired to fix it is a pirate coming to raid Tommy's house.</li><li> One of the most famous examples is in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JewishHolidays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JewishHolidays">Hanukkah</a> episode, when the babies mishear Grandpa Boris discussing "the meaning of Hanukkah" as "the <em>meanie</em> of Hanukkah" and assume that he is referring to a mean bully.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalevolentArchitecture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalevolentArchitecture">Malevolent Architecture</a>: In one episode, the lever that controls the sauna is right outside the door, and it's positioned in such a way that putting it on its maximum setting causes it to actually block the door, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaunaOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaunaOfDeath">trapping anyone inside.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MallSanta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MallSanta">Mall Santa</a>: In "The Santa Experience", Angelica cuts in line to see the Mall Santa, and after she tells him the large amount of presents she wants, he tells her he isn't sure he can get them for her. Angelica then rips off his beard and runs through the mall, screaming, "Santa Claus is a fake! Run for your lives!"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manchild">Manchild</a>: Stu and Drew occasionally lapse into this, particularly when they fight over things they did to each other as children. The puppet show they put on in "Tommy's First Birthday" is filled with examples.<ul><li> Most of the adults on the show are portrayed as more absent-minded than one would expect a parent with an infant to be. But Stu ranges from "immature adult" during arguments and short feuds with Drew, to what can only be described as "borderline mentally deficient" at seemingly random times. In "The Blizzard," he runs into the kitchen and screams "Yippee, school's been cancelled!" after a big snowstorm, at which point Chaz has to remind him that he's 35 years old. In another episode, he rushes to get Chuckie's kiddy toilet while Chuckie is in the bathroom&mdash; Didi tells him to "put it down," and Stu puts it down right where he's standing... outside of the bathroom. Even Chuckie probably realizes that the potty doesn't belong in the hallway.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears">Manly Tears</a>: Although none of the father figures (save for Grandpa Lou and, to a lesser extent, Grandpa Boris) are conventionally manly, they have their fair share of griefs, and no one mocks them for it:<ul><li> Stu in "Momma Trauma" is <em>sobbing</em> as he recounts how Drew would repeatedly pick on him.<ul><li> And let's not forget "Angelica Breaks a Leg," where he breaks into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearsOfJoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearsOfJoy">Tears of Joy</a> upon finding out that Angelica was faking a broken leg, because of all the hell he has been put through due to Angelica's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingPatient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingPatient">increasingly bratty demands</a>.</li></ul></li><li> In "Reptar on Ice," Grandpa Lou is clearly moved to tears by Reptar's romance with the female reporter.</li><li> In "Angelica's Birthday," Drew also sheds tears as he reads his mother-in-law's birthday card to Angelica, knowing that his dear daughter is starting to become a young lady. Angelica <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint">thinks he's crying</a> because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">there was no money in the card</a>.</li><li> The episode "Let Them Eat Cake" takes place at a wedding, during which Chas is weeping. Stu tells him to "get ahold of [himself]". One could argue that these are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenderTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenderTears">Tender Tears</a> given how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NervousWreck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NervousWreck">sensitive</a> Chas is, but given his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf">Papa Wolf</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchingMoronHiddenBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchingMoronHiddenBadass">Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass</a> moments, they also qualify as manly.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note47vn6');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note47vn6" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note47vn6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In hindsight, it's also possible that Chas was upset because the wedding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostLenore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostLenore">reminded him of his deceased wife Melinda</a>.</span><ul><li> Chas also sheds a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleTear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleTear">Single Tear</a> in the episode "The Smell of Success" when the doctor reveals that the effects of her latest machine, designed to unplug a stuffy nose, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">are only temporary</a>, which means that, since Chuckie has affected by the machine, he will soon be just as stuffed-up as he was before.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasculineGirlFeminineBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasculineGirlFeminineBoy">Masculine Girl, Feminine Boy</a>: Betty and Howard. To elaborate, Betty's loud and boisterous (generally friendly though unless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">you mess with her kids</a>), likes pro wrestling, is implied to exercise often, and even at one point runs a 10K marathon. She's good at things like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench">car repair, construction/home improvement, and plumbing</a>, and she's strong enough to lift Phil and Lil each with one hand, by their shirts, at the same time (she may be the only adult in the show's entire run to do so). Howard, on the other hand, is quiet and meek and has been seen more than once (or implied to be) participating in a "feminine" activity/chore. In "The Unfair Pair," Phil and Lil walk into the kitchen as Howard is baking cookies; in "Moving Away," Betty contemplates going to Stu's housewarming party by saying to herself "Well, Howard has a lot of laundry to do..."; in "The Stork," he's knitting and keeping to himself as Didi and Betty become immersed in watching a pro football game. Betty clearly wears the pants in their relationship, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">but they do love each other</a> as each is quick to defend the other (see the episode entitlted "Family Feud").</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassHypnosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassHypnosis">Mass Hypnosis</a>: When the adults go with Grandpa to a bowling championship, the kids are left with a (presumably) teenaged babysitter. When Angelica starts to act up, the babysitter turns on a Dummi Bears movie, which appears to literally hypnotize all of the babies present (except Tommy, who's off-screen when the movie is first turned on). They sing along with the movie in an eerie monotone and say things like "Must... stay... here..." and "Must... watch... bears..." Tommy eventually frees them from the hypnosis by violently shaking Phil, Lil, and Chuckie. He neglects to do so for Angelica, and it turns that she's still hypnotized <em>even after they all go home.</em></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Mega-Corp</a>: Charlotte's company, Merge Corp, apparently specializes in company takeovers, hostile and benign.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meganekko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meganekko">Meganekko</a>: Didi Pickles and Kira Finster.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenLikeDogsWomenLikeCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenLikeDogsWomenLikeCats">Men Like Dogs, Women Like Cats</a>: Tommy has a pet dog while his cousin Angelica has a pet cat.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight">Might Makes Right</a>: The entire basis of Angelica's relationship with the babies.

Just as an example, one episode featured a B-plot of the adults getting together and doing their taxes (Drew, being an accountant, gives Stu some very sound advice about why it's smart to file taxes properly.)</li><li> The episode "Touchdown Tommy" featured the adults watching the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl">Ultra Bowl</a>." While the team names are never stated (presumably for copyright reasons), it's clearly intended to portray the Houston Oilers (later the Tennessee Titans) vs the Dallas Cowboys.

Also, in that same episode, right before the game starts, Stu and Howard yell "Come on, Houston!" while Grandpa and Drew respond with "Go get 'em, Dallas!", further reinforcing the point that it does indeed depict Oilers vs Cowboys.<ul><li> "The Stork" depicts Didi and Betty watching, according to them, a game of football between Washington and Buffalo.
