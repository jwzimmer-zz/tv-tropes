The series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">quickly developed</a> into something far more interesting than a <em>Jonny Quest</em> parody as the characters gained depth and the show took a dark turn into deconstructing the entire "youth adventure" genre.

He routinely torments Rusty with dangerous experiments and adventures. When he's not completely neglectful, he's bringing Rusty along to orgies and publicly humiliating him in front of his team.</li><li> Although Doctor Orpheus is a surprisingly caring and domestic father, he keeps a dimension gateway in Triana's closet and mindwipes her every time she opens the door, leading to some cumulative trauma.<div class="indent"><strong>Dr. Orpheus:</strong> Well, you see, dear, I was just...Oh this is pointless.

On the other hand there's Hatred, the overweight has-been: he prefers lethal and immediate force over flashy duels, runs on the clock security measures and trains the boys so they can actively protect themselves; in the end he's actually a bigger menace to the Monarch than Brock ever was.

However, at the same time, we see what's been happening to Brock; his plot is told in <em>normal</em> chronological order, and is played in between segments of the Venture family plot.

Phantom Limb's debut episode didn't air originally until the week before "The Trial of the Monarch" when it was supposed to air earlier in the season. Similarly, "Assassinanny 911" originally aired as the third episode of season two when it was originally supposed to air midway through the season, meaning Triana's friend Kim was shown hanging around before she was to be officially introduced.

In this series, there's an official, sanctioned version of this from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdTradeUnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdTradeUnion">the Guild of Calamitous Intent</a>, which involves a full system of rules and laws for "arching", as it's called, that both the "antagonists" in the Guild and their sanctioned "protagonists" that they arch must follow. Some significant examples include:<ul><li> The Monarch is Dr. Venture's <em>de facto</em> primary arch-enemy throughout the series. In some seasons, he is also Venture's legal Guild-sanctioned arch, but in others, this is taken from him by other villains, much to his frustration, which leads to him actively trying to take out the competition so he can legally arch Venture again. Also worth noting that the feeling is not fully mutual, as the Monarch is much more passionate and Rusty much more apathetic about their rivalry.</li><li> In the earliest episodes, Baron Underbheit was considered to be Rusty's arch-enemy (though not Guild-sanctioned), much to the Monarch's annoyance. The original plan was for the Monarch to be Dr. Venture's more comical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain">Ineffectual Sympathetic Villain</a> nemesis, while Underbheit would be the serious, genuinely menacing nemesis. However, this was faded out as Underbheit's presence in the series was greatly diminished after the first season and Monarch fully grew into the role of Rusty's (albeit still fairly comical) main enemy.</li><li> Other Guild-sanctioned arches for Dr. Venture have included Sergeant Hatred in Season 3 and Wide Wale in Seasons 6 and 7. Both of them actually requested to arch Venture specifically to get back at the Monarch; in Hatred's case, he went out of his way to treat the Ventures kindly and ended up becoming in their bodyguard starting in Season 4, and in Wide Wale's, he subcontracted his arching of Rusty out to other villains.</li><li> The Order of the Triad, especially Dr. Orpheus, actually <em>wanted</em> their own Guild-sanctioned arch-enemy, to the point of hosting tryouts for the position in one episode. Torrid emerged as the winner by kidnapping Orpheus's daughter Triana, and the Triad are shown battling him a few times in future episodes.</li><li> Billy Quizboy, and by extension Pete White, have Augustus St. Cloud, who only joined the Guild in the first place for the sole purpose of being able to arch Billy.</li><li> Action Johnny (the grown-up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JonnyQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JonnyQuest">Jonny Quest</a>) has Dr. Z, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">Captain Ersatz</a> of Jonny Quest's arch-enemy Dr. Zin. He also arched Jonah Venture, judging by his relationship with Rusty.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">Arson, Murder, and Jaywalking</a>:<ul><li> From "Any Which Way But Zeus," various villains must submit to a power inhibitor for a joint hero/villain summit.

Not to mention "Sensuri" - or rather, "senzuri" - is itself another Japanese slang word for masturbation.

However, the others don't know yet and Molotov is still likely not an enemy of the Venture family, so they're safe for the time being; it also appears Sergeant Hatred might perform a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a>. However, Brock's experience with the whole situation convinces him to quit the OSI, thus he also quits being the family bodyguard. Finally, the attack on the Venture Compound by the Monarch left the boys' clones destroyed, but Dr. Venture may be likely to protect his boys more often (as he told Hank, "you only live once"). His cloning experiments (which are illegal) have been made public. Henchman 24 and H.E.L.P.eR are dead; the former now talks with his best friend, Henchman 21, from beyond the grave (he also helped said friend become a badass) and the latter had his head placed on a walking eye Dr. Venture made some time ago.</span></li><li> Season four's finale, similarly. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The episode balances out ending relationships while also starting some new ones. Dean is forced to give up on Triana again. Molotov leaves Brock for Monstroso and seemingly commits suicide with Monstroso rather than being captured. Henchman 21 is fully disillusioned with Dr. Girlfriend as well as the Monarch, quitting and flipping them off but opening the door for a full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a>, as well as being forced to finally face the fact that his best friend is truly dead and he's been hallucinating him this entire season. At the same time the Alchemist finally hooks up with Shore Leave and Sgt. Hatred is reunited with Princess Tinyfeet. Hunter Gathers is finally able to end the feud with OSI, but at the same time General Triester ejects himself to a possible death in search of an alien cure after being shown to be a really good guy.

For instance, there aren't any superhero comics, since there's actual superheroes. Well, as part of the "failure" theme, <em>The Venture Brothers</em> shows a world that's functionally the same <em>despite</em> the presence of superheroes, super-science, etc. Magic and mad science exist, but are in the hands of the same inept, petty people as everything else, and are thus no more successful.

Definitely an improvement over Dean's previous onscreen fight, where he just flailed wildly against Dermott. In the same scene his rape whistle seems to disable Mr. Impossible, or at least forces him to put his hands over his ears instead of using his stretching powers to subdue Dean. It takes Phantom Limb's "killer hand thing" to drop him. He's more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassPacifist">Badass Pacifist</a> now, who usually solves his situations through peaceful methods.</li><li> The Monarch has become more intelligent and sane in his villainy, even pulling off a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> &mdash; though it's possible he was always this way, since he became horrifically lethal the moment he was arching anyone other than Venture. His relationship with Doctor Girlfriend (now Dr. Mrs. The Monarch) has dramatically evolved, too.</li><li> Brock has become more moral over the course of the show, questioning things that didn't seem right when he looked closer, leading up to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">quitting in the season three finale.</span></li><li> The entire purpose of Dr Henry Killinger is to force this in characters. He's like a more affable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/WalkyVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/WalkyVerse">Mike</a>.</li><li> While still not all that smart, Hank isn't nearly as naive or childish as he used to be in early seasons now that he's older. The largest evidence came during his angry speech <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when 21 kidnapped him and his brother and accused them of killing 24. Brock's absence, while unfortunate, is actually having a pretty cool effect on his personality and actions.</span> Now he's a bit of an action junkie, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe">Casanova Wannabe</a>, and a relative badass being able to take down lower threats, and escape from almost any situation the O.S.I. could think of putting him in.

Hand in hand with this is him becoming less callous toward his sons (if more openly vitriolic).</li><li> Henchman 21, following <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">24's death,</span> has become one of the most competent people not just in the Monarch's organization, but in the Guild. He was actually capable of earning praise from Brock Samson <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">for their fight.</span> Compare this to earlier episodes where "Death by Samson" was a <em>regular</em> cause of death for the Monarch's henchmen. That 21 could fight Samson to a standstill was awesome, though one wonders if Brock had brought his A game.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn">Characterization Marches On</a>: The writers describe their characterization process as simply writing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">whatever was funniest at the time</a>, then modifying the character afterward so that it comes across as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">Hidden Depths</a>. An example is the change in Brock's personality over season 1 - in 'Are You There God, It's Me Dean' Doc Hammer had Brock attack the Monarch's henchman to cheer up the Monarch on his sad-excuse for a birthday, though, (as Doc explains in the commentary for the episode) at the time of writing, Brock had not shown such compassion before. Other examples are:<ul><li> Hank and Dean going from one step short of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleMindedTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleMindedTwins">Single-Minded Twins</a> to extreme opposites of recklessness (Hank) and cautiousness (Dean).</li><li> The Monarch going from joke villain to a bad ass villain with character depth to make him one of the most fully developed characters of the series.</li><li> They even do it to an entire organization. The Guild of Calamitous Intent is described in their first appearance by Brock as quick, efficient and no nonsense. He famously calls them "The only organization [he] still respects". A far cry from their later description where - while most of the guild members are individually dangerous - the guild itself is almost comically incapable and filled with red tape. The council of 13 bickers amongst themselves about anything and nothing, and even their shape-shifting leader can't keep his (assumed) identity secret from his minions.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatedAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatedAngle">Cheated Angle</a>: Dr. Girlfriend's hair in the early episodes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhov's Gun</a>: A bunch, some huge, some subtle, like Phantom Limb using a muscle accelerator to heal Brock Samson.

Originally Sergeant Hatred was just part of a throwaway gag; the Monarch idly mentioned he'd stolen some pieces of his Hover Tank. A whole season later, Hatred becomes Rusty's new arch enemy, thus stealing the Monarch's job. It turns out he planned this all just to get back at the Monarch for stealing his tank parts.

The twins own a pet dog, Scamp, to better match Jonny Quest (Scamp only shows up in the series in season 3, having died some time after the pilot). Dr. Venture is regarded as a brilliant scientist with a good reputation, while later episodes portray him as a no-talent laughing stock. He's also completely genre-blind to the military use of his invention, while in the series proper, he's is eager to produce inventions for whatever application will give him the most money, including the military.</li><li> Brock is far less of a father figure for the boys, in fact seeming quite happy to ditch them. His character design is also different. He sometimes looks like he has a unibrow, and his skinny legs are more exaggerated.</li><li> The Monarch's design is different. He has a larger crown and a furry collar rather than the black cowl, smaller crown and chestplate.</li></ul></li><li> The first season employed differing styles of choppy and limited animation.</li><li> The tone of the dialogue changes noticeably after the first season, as well, and it stands out on rewatches. For example, in the first episode (<em>Dia de los Dangerous</em>) where Doc and the boys are in Tijuana, Hank's first line is "This place it tits! Divvy this, we got these boss Mexican hats." and in <em>The Incredible Mister Brisby</em>, he is happy to point out an elephant's penis and accuse his father of being "on the rag". Even though he says some pretty outlandish things, it's hard to imagine Season 3 or 4 Hank talking this way.</li><li> In the first few seasons Dr. Venture's relationship with his father was more positive. While it was clear that his childhood adventures and living in his father's shadow was the source of Rusty's problems, Jonas Venture Sr. was seen to be caring and supportive. Rusty even had fond memories of his boy adventurer days. This is opposed to later seasons where Jonas and the rest of Team Venture are shown to be abusive and manipulative bullies who constantly traumatized Rusty by making him come along with them on their dangerous adventures.</li><li> In the title sequence, Hank has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlyRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlyRun">Girly Run</a> with his hands flapping around at his sides, while Dean has an exaggerated sprinter's gait. By Season 2, it's explicitly stated that Hank is "more athletic" than Dean.</li><li> In season 1, the Monarch also acts different. He clings way more to the Monarch persona, including in private (He for example sleeps with his crown on. When telling his origin story to Dr. Girlfriend he refers to being 8 years old as "still a caterpillar in the butterfly business"), and there's a running gag that he has a poor understanding of monarch butterfly biology. He's also, for lack of a better word, more quirky and less stable. For example he's concerned about Dr. Venture's lack of attention to Dean and Hank in the same episode where he was ready early to torture one of them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentCharacterDesignDifference" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentCharacterDesignDifference">Early Installment Character Design Difference</a>: Jefferson Twilight frequently fails to finish his sentences in his first appearance in "Fallen Arches."

Finally, as Brock has been established as being of Swedish heritage, it's worth noting that Swedish surnames are (or were) often literal - "Johansson" means "son of Johan," "Swenson" means "son of Sven," and so on. This would make Brock Samson the "Son of Sam," a possible reference to David Berkowitz, the Son of Sam serial killer. Given Brock's over-the-top violent predilections, this seems quite fitting.

Echo. November.</em> in Season 2, Hank remembers Billy operating on Dean to fix his testicular torsion in <em>Are You There, God? It's Me, Dean</em>, even though, as a Season 1 episode, this actually happened to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">their clones</span>, implying that Hank and Dean still have memory of this through their memory beds. However, in <em>All This and Gargantua-2</em>, when Billy brings this up, Hank doesn't remember it and asks when that happened, before concluding it must have happened to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">their clones</span>, suggesting they <em>don't</em> have memories of this.</li><li> Related to the above, Hank in the former episode mentions Billy operating on "your balls, Dean", which suggests that this happened only to Dean and ignores the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain">Here We Go Again!</a> moment at the end of the original episode that implies that Hank also got testicular torsion. Billy's words in the latter episode to Hank about fixing "you and your brother's" testicular torsion, however, do acknowledge this moment and apparently confirm that it happened to both boys.</li><li> In <em>Everybody Comes to Hank's</em> in season 4, Dr. Orpheus is among the people who finds out that Dermott's father is Dr. Venture. However in <em>Momma's Boys</em> in season 5, Dr. Orpheus doesn't seem to know, and is confused by the fact that he could hear Dermott's call for help as if he was one of the Venture Brothers.</li><li> In <em>The Unicorn in Captivity</em>, Dr. Venture states that he wants to have enough money to retire to "Spanakopita", clearly referencing the events of the episode of the same name. However, it was an actual plot point in that episode that "Spanakopita" was the name of the made-up holiday, which itself was named after a type of pie, and the name of the island itself is <em>Spanakos</em>. Rusty is essentially stating here that he wants to retire to the holiday or to the pie, rather than to the island like he presumably meant.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a>: Most supervillians take themselves very seriously. <em>Especially</em> the Monarch:<div class="indent"><strong>Jollyrancher82:</strong> I just thought, you know, "The Monarch," I thought you were into cosplay? <br><strong>Monarch:</strong> Real name.

Like Jonas Sr., Jonas Jr. is also a ladies man but is chivalrous and unlike his father wasn't trying to just get in their pants but truly cared about them and was interested in them as people.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalTeam">Supernatural Team</a>: The Order of the Triad</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SymbolicWings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SymbolicWings">Symbolic Wings</a>: The Monarch's minions have wings on their costumes as part of the theme.

Brock Samson was quite disturbed at this.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eschewed protecting his children in favor of letting them die to be replaced with clones, much to Brock's disgust</span>.</li><li> Allowed a young child to be killed on a tour of his compound and <em>returned a genetically modfied clone to his parents in his place</em> (although claiming that he was doing the boy a favor since his DNA made him "a ticking timebomb for cancer"). Again, much to Brock's disgust.</li><li> Dr. Killinger once attempted to make Rusty an official villain, only for him to back out at the last moment, horrified to know that he's potentially just that evil. Even Brock himself has some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">Even Evil Has Standards</a> moments with Rusty and is hesitant and answering Doc's question of whether or not he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">bad guy</a> (settling for a very dark morally gray area).</li><li> Trying to solve his money problems by stealing orangutans from the Amazon and teaching them to box. Brock (notice a pattern?) called this "a new personal low"&mdash;and not just because of the fact that orangutans don't live in the Amazon.</li><li> Using Sally's (Richard Impossible's then wife) love for him to get a crucial machine part for him.
