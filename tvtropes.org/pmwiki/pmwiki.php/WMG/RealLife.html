We Create our own universes. God creates us from paper and Jesus his son is the future author. We create fiction. So for example. God creates us, Lauren Faust creates MLP:FIM, Some pony makes his or her own fiction. And in that fiction another character creates a fiction and so on. Remember Tommy Westphall? The Autistic boy from St. Elsewhere? Well he is a conduit between the universes. And there are many other conduits. The universe is a massive vortex with infinite layers. And, if matter can neither be created or destroyed. Then is Fiction Matter?

<ul><li> The Earliest Samurai were around 663 AD with the Taika Reform (although they were not called as such for many centuries). The earliest entry for Keanu is Immortal is Charlemagne who was born in 748. If we assume Jack was one of the earliest Samurai and he traveled the world following the end of the series, that potentially allows for him to be in Europe for the right time period.

Hence why they often randomly malfunction in annoying or dangerous ways-those machines are Decepticons, and so want to kill us, or at the very least frustrate us immensly as part of their invasion plan. Mechanics, IT experts, <em>et al</em>, are Autobot Pretenders, who stop the Decepticons by fixing them. Also, the whole toyline/movie/cartoon/anime thing is in fact a plan designed not only to cover up their existance by making transforming mecha appear to be totally fictional, but also to make us accept the impended robot invasion as something totally awesome.
<ul><li> A corollary is that the Cybertron in our dimension is the one containing the multiversal hub of Axiom Nexus. They're too lazy to actually think up new propaganda, so they just hand the animators and artists the fruits of their research into other universal streams.
<ul><li> It logically follows that Obama is a pretender (possibly a sleeper agent), who was designed to be as similar as possible to our local Optimus Prime. The fact that he hasn't solved all the world's problems (or even America's) within the first few months, and is taking a more realistic, human timescale, speaks volumes about both the complexity of our problems and the limitations of our local Autobots.
<ul><li> Unless Obama is part of a complex conquering scheme on the part of both Autobots <em>and</em> Decepticons...
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Unless, given that Autobots and Decepticons haven't gone to war yet and are still cooperating in Axiom Nexus's (aka our) dimension, it means that they're working together to take over Earth; the subtle fighting may indicate a sort of good cop-bad cop approach.
<ul><li> Or they've finally gone to war, and simply haven't told us about it yet, as the Autobots don't want to make themselves look bad and the Decepticons have no connections to Hasbro with which to make that fact public.

The Internet do this by absorbing our intellect through Forums, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar">Flame Wars</a>, ordinary blogging, online encyclopedias such as the freely-edited Those Other Wikis such as Wikipedia, etc. while providing us with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GIFT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GIFT">G.I.F.T.</a> of anonymity and freedom from bodily discrimination (like Ad Hominem attacks).

You see, we were originally mindless characters trapped within our respective fictional works, being controlled by the author of the story. Eventually, we began to develop independent thoughts, and decided that we wouldn't let the author control us anymore. We managed to break free, but shortly afterwards we had our <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">memories wiped out</a> so we wouldn't be able to help the other characters from the story to break free.
<p>And so we live our lives, unaware of our origins and that the author of our story is still controlling the inhabitants of the story into doing whatever they want, even if it doesn't always make sense.

A long time ago, during a golden age of peace, an author wrote a book. This book was about the birth of a new universe, and the evolution of life on a fertile planet he called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Earth</a>". Over time, he wrote more and more sequels to the "Earth" series, soon creating a species where his future protagonists would come from: Humanity. He created an author insert, named "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">God</a>". Of course, he wasn't going to just make himself supreme ruler in the series. Rather, his characters would have many interpretations of him, many beliefs about him, many different books that claimed to be his words (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeasingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeasingCreator">which he would tease fans about when they asked which one or ones were really supposed to be from him</a>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveManyNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveManyNames">and some believing in different incarnations of him</a>, sometimes split into many different "Gods". The series was popular, and selling really well. So, it became a multi-media affair, with adaptations and new works written by himself and others, with only a shake-y idea of canon. This, in the future, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">would leave what was canon and what was not unsure</a>, but they didn't know that. The stories were generally good, with only the occasional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTumor">Plot Tumor</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sue</a>, but all in all, the various series were good. The show "Earth: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Julius Caesar</a>" was especially popular, leading to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">call-backs</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">characters inspired by him</a> popping up throughout the works. The "America" series of books were controversial and disliked by the fans of "Britain", especially due to how it portrayed the characters from the "Britain" series, but generally are liked by all in hindsight. The still-ongoing "Japan" manga is one of the most popular series in the franchise, and has been going for decades. However, over time, the author fell on hard times due to a gambling problem. He was forced to sell off his creation to a large corporation, who quickly contracted him to continue writing. At first, the arrangement went well. The "American Civil War" was a huge plot twist and the "Spanish Inquisition" story arc was something nobody saw coming. However, the Author was tired of writing the Earth series, and wanted to end it. He wrote the "Great War" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover">mega-crossover story</a> as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveVeto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveVeto">executives vetoed</a> the idea of ending it. However, they drew up a contract. For a few more stories, they would let him end it all in a sequel to the "Great War". The contract was signed and the Author went home, slightly annoyed but pretty happy. However, right after the sequel to the "Great War", which was now marketed as "The Great War: World War I" so that they could tie it to "World War II", the Author's home burnt down, killing him and destroying the only record of the contract. With the contract destroyed, the executives were able to continue the series, though with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkDecay">decay in quality</a> since then. They handed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsYourPremiseOnDrugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsYourPremiseOnDrugs">several full series to a drug addict</a>, leading to the hugely popular but extremely odd "1960s", "1970s" and "1980s" overarching plots. They had the details fleshed out by other writers, leading to an odd contrast of the world being bright and neon as well as completely insane looking, but the politics and general atmosphere being dark and gloomy. The Author had a hugely popular tradition of making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">sly little references to fanfiction</a>, like having some fanfics being the works of the title character of the series "William Shakespeare", so the executives quickly cashed in on this, bringing all types of fiction that their world had into ours, with a bit more time spent introducing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInternet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInternet">The Internet</a>. They then inserted popular fanfics at a cost as the works in the universe. While this led to some really good fanfics becoming know, a rich man with the pen name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UweBoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UweBoll">Uwe Boll</a> kept paying to get his badfic inserted. The writers, not liking this, made the works all just as horrible in the "Earth" universe as reality. Sadly, one of the most popular fanfics, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a>", was quickly removed by the executives after the writer removed the references to the "Earth" series and made it into a TV show in their world, where it still runs today. As he already had a cast in mind when he wrote it, the only differences between "Earth" Firefly and the "Real" Firefly is references to Earth and length. Hired to write the book "2005", the writer snuck a little reference in, however. As the executives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">have focused more</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">and more on controversy</a>, quick publication and large circulation, quality has decayed. The Golden Age of the Earth Universe is gone, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot">but recent writers have been improving the series back to it's old form</a>.

And not just any wizard, the last of his kind, and the purest soul in his world. He was the only survivor of a terrible apocalypse against hordes of an unknown enemy. With nowhere to run, and nowhere to hide, he sought out the forbidden spell of creation. This spell cost not only his life, but erased him from the fabric of reality. The spell shaped the universe according to his own idea of how the world should be. Unfortunately just as he was about to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">cast the spell</a>, one of the unknown enemies revealed itself to be a shadow being that lunged at him, and as he struggled to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">cast the spell</a>, the creature (being a living intangible form of corruption that resembled a simple shadow), possessed him, which infused his pure mind with darkness.

Assuming the "reality is a dream" theories on this page are true, then whatever or whoever had put you in this "illusion" obviously have the power to do so. Imagine waking up in a "dream salon" in an Utopian world, or a research pod on an alien plant, or a trance of some sort in a magical world after you die.
<ul><li> Alternatively, what comes after death will by very unfun. - There are two scenarios, either I am in an illusion willingly, or I am in one unwillingly. If it is willing, then I must think experiencing the illusion is a better use of my time than experiencing the real world, thus the real world is more boring than this. If it is unwilling, then there is some malevolent (or at least, uncaring) entity in control of my reality, and if I wake up they will likely just force me back asleep into another, possibly worse, world.

No, not like the tagline of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuckerPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuckerPunch">Sucker Punch</a>. I mean literally. Picture a world where, for whatever reason, people live forever. In addition, you take on a form that reflects your desired traits, your attitude, or a combination of both.
<p>But other than this it's much like what we know of. People can suffer incredible pains at the hands of others. They try to go about their normal lives, doing whatever immortal people do. It's not the afterlife, because <em>they</em> are the ones best described as "alive".
</p><p>Here's where the prison comes in. People are resistant to change, because change is <em>hard</em>. And when you can't die and life itself is unchanging, then why change?
</p><p>Unfortunately, for the sake of the safety, sanity and security of the public, some people <em>need</em> to change. Not because they have to adapt to their environment, but because nobody else can stand the horrible actions they commit.
</p><p>Normal crimes don't mean much there. There's little reason to steal, no ability to kill and nothing that can be destroyed. But things like torture or sexual assault are, sadly, possible and considered the least noticeable signs of true evil. So what are the most noticeable?
</p><p>Don't get it wrong, appearances themselves are not directly judged, and bigotry is right up there with torture. But the desires and/or attitude control the shape of a person, and they can look like <em>anything</em>. And when someone desires to hurt, or has an attitude that is cruel, their body itself becomes a painful weapon in any shape from claws to blades to fire to guns to barbed wire. Possibly all of the above. If someone there looks like they could kill you painfully, you can bet they can and will carry out the pain part. And just like our world, there are some people there who are really nasty pieces of work.
</p><p>Who exactly? Namely, us. The prison of reality was created to rehabilitate immortal souls who were just too terrible to let run loose. And a prison containing an average of 85 years sentence - the last few years made especially bad - with no parole in a world far from perfect (or even a 35 year sentence in a "developing" country) has to be bad for a being from a near-perfect world.
</p><p>But it also takes lots of resources. Suicide would have to be tracked to prevent escapes. Death would have to appear random while giving every prisoner the correct sentence. And since some people die as bad people, we can assume that they'll commit another crime and be back soon and/or that the authorities foresaw it when the sentence was first decided and assigned them <em>multiple</em> life sentences. And that's not even counting the obviously required constant suppression of everyone's memories about life outside the "prison".
</p><p>Heck, the courts of the "superworld" may work enough like ours that the life sentences are assigned the same way, but with more of a point because the prisoners will actually live long enough to serve the sentences. And if our courts are similar, then you can bet theirs will be extremely inefficient.
</p><p>So why go through with this huge project after over 10,000 years, continuing to pour resources into it? Because there are amazing success stories. You can bet that, in the event this WMG is true, supporters there would point to people like Ghandi or Jesus and say that these used to be some of the worst people you could ever meet. Opponents would be hard-pressed to complain about a prison that successfully makes more than 50% of its inmates into better people.
</p><p>To sum it all up, "afterlife or no afterlife" are not the only possibilities for the nature of life and death, and the nature of the world beyond this one might be very grey indeed. It's a weird and complex theory, but I figured it's no less normal than the other real life <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WMG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WMG">WMGs</a> and I have no plans to write a novel with this backstory anytime soon.
</p><p></p><div class="wmglead"> God exists (and I can prove it)</div>
Bear with me.
It has been proved by scientists that when two sub-atomic particles were once part of the same atom, but have been separated, whatever you do to one particle affects the other. In other words, you have an atom. You take bits of that atom and separate them by as much space as you want- other ends of a table, or other ends of the universe. Then, you shake one a little- just a tiny jiggle- and the other one will move, no matter what.
<p>Now, consider the big bang. This theory says that the universe was once condensed into a tiny, very hot, very dense piece of matter. In fact, it stipulates that everything was the same atom. Then, this atom exploded. All its bits and pieces were thrown across the universe and became the stuff we have today.
</p><p>So, everything was once the same atom. And when you take parts of an atom, separate them, and change one or the other, the other changes. This results in connections between trillions- more- of tiny particles that can literally connect. Sound familiar? This is how your brain works. A message is sent through multiple cells, in this case particles, to form a thought.
</p><p>So the universe is a brain. The brain of a giant, invisible being that is everywhere at the same time. We are parts of it, too. When we die, our body and mind disintegrate, but we will be reincorporated into this being- that is the afterlife. But this thing can't do anything but watch what happens in its own brain. So, God is uncaring and not influential, but it exists.
This leaves justice up to our society. Obviously, in this theory, Jeffrey Dahmer and Jesus meet the same fate, which is a problem. So it is up to us as a thinking society to serve out justice.
</p><ul><li> Obviously, God is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a>.
</li><li> No, quantum entanglement doesn't always happen when two particles are formed. They don't affect each other in any other way than those quantum numbers where they are entangled. Moving one will not move the other, unless their positions themselves are entangled. Subatomic particles don't have to form from atoms - they form from subatomic particles or from energy itself, and only if the subatomic particles of origin were in an atom did subatomic particles come from one atom. Tbe big bang theory does not stipulate that everything was one atom once. An atom is a number of protons, possibly with neutrons and electrons, and the early universe was simply extremely dense energy. Furthermore, it was not the energy that exploded, it was the dimensions of space itself that expanded, carrying all energy with it. The brain does not work by quantum entangled pairs, it works by electrostatic charges maintained by multiple types of ion gates in the cellular membranes of neurons, some of which can open to rapidly reverse the polarity, where this reverse in polarity is a trigger to cause more ion gates to open, causing a wave of polarity reversal until it reaches the end of synapses, where the reverse in polarity triggers vesicles (soap bubbles, but made from cellular membrane stuff) containing neural enzymes to be released which can either inhibit or cause the reversion of the polarity of the next cell, something which happens in parallel at several billion positions in the brain across quadrillions of neural links. The elementary particles in the universe are not linked, since that would require that all of them would have to be in a quantum superimposed state. However, any macroscopic phenomenon (around a billion atoms or more - it's a sliding scale) dependent on the quantum superimposed state will count as an "observation" of the quantum state it is dependent on, meaning that all those quantum entanglements would untangle the moment they are observed (which is why Schrodinger's cat experiment doesn't work in reality - the cat is a quantum observer). It is not possible for any existing object to be both entangled and as compliant to classical physics as we see it to be. Furthermore, even if somehow the universe was a brain, it's thoughts would travel merely at the speed of light, taking millions of years to cross "synapses" of galaxies, while humans are short-lived electrical charge based circuits whose identity is stored in the physical location of the quadrillions of synapses in the body, information which is not transmitted into the universe upon death, but merely lost to entropic decay as the polarization dies out and the chemicals rot. So I'm sorry, but every single thing you said about things that can be tested in reality is wrong.

It'd explain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinaglesLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinaglesLaw">Finagle's Law</a>. Since Universe doesn't tend to perfection, but to chaos and decay, that's why most of the things we do go awry. Those that don't will cause a chain of unfortunate events in a slightly distant future.
<p></p><div class="wmglead"> The Universe is an ever-shifting chaos...</div>
... and the world as you perceive it is the end result of putting said chaos through a filter in your mind. As the universe changes, the filter slowly loses its effectiveness, causing "glitches" that manifest as random oddities or, in more severe cases, hallucinations. The filter is recalibrated when you're sleeping and dreams are caused by your brain trying to find a new way of turning a maddening mess into the reality you're familiar with. Doomsday will arrive when mankind discovers a way to remove the filter and observe the universe directly.
<ul><li> And this filter is no other than what we call The Brain. The Brain does looks like a filter....
<ul><li> The filter is called the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">AT Field</a>. It's even referenced in the canon: the AT Field is the absolute territory of a psychic presence where the individual ego is separated from the outside world. AT Fields protect and defend our conscious mind from the utter chaos of both the outside world and our own unconscious mind, at the cost of well, a mundane reality and other people being hell.

Ever get the feeling that you're the single, lonely consciousness that you'll ever be aware of in this entire universe? It's because you are. But when you die, your soul can get reincarnated both into the future and back in time, so everyone really is the same soul. Everyone around you really is you at a different stage of the reincarnation cycle. You can only experience one life at a time and forget your past life. So eventually you will have lived the life of every single person who has ever or will ever exist. So, right now there are over 6 billion people currently ALIVE, add up all the people who are now dead and that's a long, long reincarnation cycle...

Allow this troper to explain, as that title probably sounded damned ambiguous. See, the life as we know it, or as long as existence has...existed, is a Beta test of the "real" program. Or, possibly, the first half of existence has already passed, as the Alpha version. See, in the future, possibly within the lifespan of humankind, the Beta will be ended by the higher powers; Eldritch Abominations, God, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Cosmo Entelecheia</a>, Morgan Freeman, what-have-you. Essentially, the data stored from the "Beta" will be taken note and either programmed into the "true version" by the proverbial software engineers (or would scientists be the correct term?), or sent through complex systems to evolve into the basis for the future "game" through the will of the program itself. Similar to what "Lost Saga" underwent in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhwa/Yureka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhwa/Yureka">Yureka</a>, if you will.

<p>Once you get past the cellular level, life doesn't exist. All living organisms as we know them are thus fundamentally flawed because they're built out of matter that isn't truly alive, and are destined return to the state of non-life at some point and stay that way for eternity.
</p><p>And as time is never ending, this finite thing we call "life" doesn't really exist; &infin; - 1 = &infin;, and the infinity of non-life - the inevitable expiration date of organisms = Still an infinity of non-life.

Reality is a figment of the imagination. Only one consciousness exists...but it is everyone. Each human is an individual facet of a single mind. It's a single person with billions of bodies, but each body is unaware of this fact. Each thinks it's the only one in existence, and is unable to realise this. Ever wondered why you seem to be the only conscious being in existence? That's because you ARE - and so is your neighbour, and best friend, and worst enemy; we are the exact same person, but don't know it.
Wars, any violence, hate, discrimination and disputes are really different elements of this mind's personality conflicting. What is fear, the urge to adapt and reproduce? Exactly what it is: semi-subconscious self-preservation, to protect the mind's bodies from harm, and ultimately, its life. Why do humans desire world domination? For others to do what they say? Conformity? And what is the need for social contact, or the pack mentality, or love or friendship? It's all just certain bodies of the mind gathering and attempting to reform into a single, coherent whole.
So, <em>everyone</em> is THE one and only solipsist.

1.The result of a subconscious link to other people and other universes that already exist.

<p>As Steve Grand put it;
"Within every myth and every legend, there lies a truth. Somewhere out there, not in our universe, but in a universe of Otherworlds, live all the monsters and mythical beasts that ever entered human imagination. The nature of these creatures and of the lands they occupy is perhaps not quite as men have imagined it, but they exist, nonetheless."

</p><p></p><div class="wmglead"> We are trapped in a time loop.</div>
Once the universe ends, time will reboot to the beginning of the universe, but everybody keeps their soul. As soul memories are buried beneath mind memories, they rarely assert, so people don't realize what's going on. Soul memories asserting themselves are the root cause of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. As one's soul becomes more crowded with memories, it will soon overwhelm the mind and people, at first mostly those who had long and eventful lives, will begin to realize that they're trapped in a time loop. The first people to notice this will probably go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeggySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeggySue">Peggy Sue</a> once they find this out.
<p>Recommended course of action if you see the loop: make a habit of humming songs you remember as existing in the previous loop several years before their release. Those who remember previous loops will notice this, while those who don't will just assume that it's some song they don't know. This way, you can get the attention of other rememberers without seeming crazy.
</p><p>On a semi-related note, does anybody know a song that sounds like "Break Your Heart" by Taio Cruz or "Pumped Up Kicks" by Foster The People? Both of these songs were immediately recognized by the author of this WMG the first time he heard them, and he quickly determined that they were too new for him to have heard before. He considers this to be potential evidence for his theory.

What we know about how the universe works seems contrary to common sense. Common sense dictates that the sun is going around us, but it's the opposite. Common sense dictates that time and space are absolute, but they aren't. Common sense dictates that things being in multiple places at once should be absurd, but it's an essential part of quantum physics. If there is a God, then they're trolling sentient life by creating an environment which works contrary to what we expect.

</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p></p><div class="wmglead"> The creation of fiction is in fact the subconscious recollection of past lives.</div>
Bear with me on this one. I don't think it's covered.
<p>The hypothesis is simple: all of us have lived innumerable past lives in alternate universes. However, only a scant few of these can be remembered, and these only subconciously.
And how do we manifest these memories? In the creation of fiction. Every time any one of us - regardless of our degree of skill - thinks up, writes, or otherwise creates fictional places, people and events, we are in fact subconciously recalling the people, places and events of our past lives. Every fictional story we have made up, from our private five-hundred-page magnum opus to our idle daydreams, is in fact a reflection of the people, the places and the events we knew from past lives. If our stories are set in the 'real world', we are simply recalling lives in universes parallel to this one. And if our stories are incoherent or filled with plot holes, if our characters are underdeveloped or unrealistic, it is because our recollections of these lives are incomplete or distorted. Since everything about us can change with each different incarnation - including our personalities - exactly who <em>we</em> are in our stories/recollections can vary widely - we may be the protagonist, the villain, the annoying sidekick, or simply and unseen observer.
</p><p>This applies to <em>every</em> bit of fiction, mind you. Including the more widely-known ones. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">JK Rowling</a> was once a student of a school of magic in a parallel universe equivalent of Britain. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a> once inhabited a world plagued by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorror">unspeakable horrors</a>. George Lucas once resided in an world of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars">intergalactic knights and silly characters</a>. Jeff Lindsay once worked alongside (or perhaps was) a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter">sociopathic vigilante</a>. And so the list goes on.
</p><p>There you have it. Make of that what you will.

<p></p></li><li> So where do heavily collaborative works, fan-driven webcomics, etc. fit in?
<ul><li> Simple: when a person creates a fan work, it is because they are recalling a life in a parallel universe to the one of the original work. In fact, if the events of the fan work are compatible with the original work's cannon, it may be the same universe. Similiarly, collaborative works are the recollections of people who have shared past lives in the same universe. This, of course, is rare, which is why collaborative works are less common...but it happens.

In the Nobilis canon there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">five hundred "missing" years</a>. So we did, indeed, "go backwards" as far as technology and civilization went. As far as I remember, human civilization was somewhere in the area of 2200 and then we got regressed backwards 500 years. But, if you assume that the missing years are actually somewhere in the middle ages (canonically, they're not, but what the hell, it's a cool theory) then it certainly makes sense that we'd go all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a>, get regressed backwards in time and once all the cool Domains were gone, we'd progress along a far different and far less cool technological path.

One of the most harshly Excruciated Domains in the world, only myths, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsMagic">religion</a> and shadows of the true mages remain today. This also explains why the ancient world is so filled with occult symbolism. What could not be accomplished by mere Charles Atlas Superpowers can be accomplished by magic.
<ul><li> One form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic">Functional Magic</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Alchemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Alchemy">Alchemy</a>, was reduced to the hard science we know today. Sure, it was the predecessor of modern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquivalentExchange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquivalentExchange">Equivalent Exchange</a>-based science, but during ancient times it was much, much more than that. A major superscience that rivaled nuclear weapons in its time, Alchemy combined elements from the modern sciences we know today like chemistry and physics with the old yet extremely potent elements from the mythical like Gods' powers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">Charles Atlas Superpowers</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a>. Races and civilizations depended from the discoveries and sufficiently advanced technologies of the alchemists. The best part? It's inexpensive, requiring mostly a large intellect instead of royal inheritance for a one-way ticket to wealth or adventure (which puts nerds, genuises and sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizards</a> on the same social class with emperors, aristocrats, princesses and the most powerful political and military leaders. Yes, I'm saying that the world back then was also a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>/<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius">Girl Genius</a></em> crossover with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> thrown in). Want to make your own elements and/or perform Hadron Collider-level atomic transmutations in a level that those scientists at CERN can only dream of in the comfort of your own home? Just get some sufficiently advanced knowledge, draw some transmutation circles, and you've done it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Be careful though with the dark art that is human transmutation</a>. <br><br>Nowadays, to perform nuclear transmutation you have to use not just sufficiently advanced math (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHatesMathematics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHatesMathematics">which we all hate</a>), but also radioactive substances, nuclear reactors and particle accelerators, which are hard to acquire, expensive and dangerous. And the amount produced by these machines are insignificant. The closest thing we can get to alchemy at home is conversion of energy from one level into another, like what we see everyday in electricity (yet most of the energy expended in conversion is lost as heat, while superconducting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> operates only on subzero temperatures), conversion of mass and matter from one element into another being outright impossible except during conditions inside a star, unless you are a wealthy scientist with access to particle accelerators. <br><br>Additionally, hypothetical alchemical substances, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhilosophersStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhilosophersStone">Philosopher's Stones</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a>, actually existed, and when these substances are used, elemental conversions and transmutations can be performed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimTaylorTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimTaylorTechnology">more power</a> and flexibility and less Math and waste substances. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> was quite possibly the most powerful substance invented by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Alchemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Alchemy">Alchemy</a>.

We had forests that would tell lumberjacks which trees they should cut, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRestaurantAtTheEndOfTheUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRestaurantAtTheEndOfTheUniverse">cows that wanted to be eaten</a>, oceans which would cleanse and expel pollution all by themselves, air that adjusted the levels of various gases to optimum, our cars could guide themselves and our spaceships(see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> above) would do the same. <br>On the other hand, we also had plenty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">evil robots</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation">evil locations</a> and so on. These were also awesome, as they allowed for us to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">become more badass</a>.
</li></ul><p>That's obviously not all. There are certainly other examples waiting to be added...
</p><ul><li> Probably the one who allied themselves with Excrucians and sent them to our planet were the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Anti-Spirals</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour">Ingsoc</a>. After all, what better way to impose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a> and force all of us to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a> than to strip Real Life of its awesomeness?
<ul><li> Considering the reality-shaking power of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Nobilis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Nobilis">Excrucians</a> I think it's far more likely that they are allies rather than servants. But yes, if this is their goal (driving us all to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a>) then it certainly makes sense. The most effective tool of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Nobilis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Nobilis">Excrucians</a> is not mindless destruction, but absolute despair, the death of hope, dreams etc. If you kill the world, it can be rebuilt. If you kill the world's <em>soul</em> it's lost forever.
</li><li> No it's not primarily Excrucians it's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Kefka's</a> fault. Utterly nihilistic and despairing? Check. Consumed the sources of magic? Check. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Caused all magic to disappear because he was defeated? DOUBLE CHECK.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Of course, with all the awesomeness above, what you might be asking yourself is: "So how the hell did <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Nobilis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Nobilis">Excrucians</a> even touch us?". The answer to that question is three-fold. <br><br>One, Excrucians themselves are nigh-omnipotent, capable of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">reality-altering feats on unimaginable scale</a>. <br><br>Two, due to all the aforementioned Estates, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsGlorious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsGlorious">war was glorious</a> and we were engaged in it all the time. The epic wars between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue">dozens of different religions</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">massive sci-fi civilizations</a>, various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe">gods</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">contenders to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">that title</a> were constant and never stopped. We simply did not present a unified front against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Nobilis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Nobilis">Excrucians</a>, who quietly and stealthily slipped into our reality and dismantled our defenses before we could react - and by the time we realized we had to stand united, all the Domains that could allow for us to fight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Nobilis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Nobilis">Excrucians</a> on equal terms were gone. In other words, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gotterdammerung" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gotterdammerung">G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LookOnMyWorksYeMightyAndDespair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LookOnMyWorksYeMightyAndDespair">that happened to us was partially also</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndManGrewProud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndManGrewProud">our own fault</a>. <br><br>Three, although the past was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryDays">glorious</a>, the universe was still in its diapers. We were just discovering our full potential and power, barely scratching the surface of what was possible to us. If we had more time to develop, learn and become even more awesome our <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessIsAForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessIsAForce">awesomeness</a> alone would've overwhelmed them. Simply put, if we had more time to develop we would've become so incredible that there are no words that could adequately describe just how mind-blowingly awesome we could become. Unfortunately, now, all that potential is lost. <br><br>Of course there's the occasional Anti-Spiral lie that if we got too intoxicated on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>, we will end the universe, like what happened to Lord Genome.
</li><li> Now that we know the problem, what's the solution?
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Kamina</a>. Or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">God Emperor of Mankind</a>. Probably also with an occasional help of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience">Science</a>, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer">that's the only most powerful Estate we all have for now</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Hence why we make fiction nowadays. It is the Collective Unconscious of the past memories pushing thoughts of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryDays">Glory Days</a> into our thoughts. These products of the collective unconscious are called archetypes, innate psychic motifs on which most of our unconscious experiences emerge (which by our vocabulary is known as the Trope, and which by <em>Nobilis</em> could also be the aforementioned estates. An example of an archetype: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a>. Obviously the past had more Heroes than nowadays). However, Real Life is so ruined it can't bring those days of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">Moment of Awesome</a> back, so we make alternate universes we call fiction so that the wishes of the collective unconscious can be satisfied.

Ask yourselves: "what has a purpose?" Answer: tools. Object that are used for something and can be thrown away with no remorse when they cease to be fit for that particular purpose. If humans had a purpose, it would be a natural right to kill anyone who outlives his purpose. It is not so because the right to life is the right to be free from purpose.
<ul><li> It does make sense, the idea that having no purpose or meaning in life is actually a fortunate gift. We were just brainwashed into thinking that only mentally-ill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NietzscheWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NietzscheWannabe">Nietzsche Wannabes</a> can think of such a thing, because society (Atheists especially blame Religion) conditioned each of us to believe we all have the same "meaning in life" as real and objective as science, otherwise if we lived meaningless lives we could all just commit suicide. Well in a life with no purpose, instead of committing suicide, you can imagine, dream and be anything you want. You can be a successful entrepreneur, a brilliant writer, a historical figure, a total badass, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ubermensch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ubermensch">&Uuml;bermensch</a> (in fact Nietzsche also thought that an existential vacuum is a novel idea rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a>), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy">42</a>, what-have-you. If human life did have a purpose, we would be simply mere tools and objects instead of subjects, free choice would be an illusion, and it would be a natural right if people who violated their predetermined purposes are sent to Hell without a say, a question or a chance of parole. In a life with purpose, we have to tailor our very imaginations and subconscious to that single meaning, leading to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour">totalitarian Orwellian life</a>, but in a purposeless life, imagination is free.

However, Nicolas Flamel (who was a real person, <strong>not</strong> a character that J. K. Rowling made up) stated that he turned <em>mercury</em> into gold. That actually makes sense from a scientific standpoint. Mercury can be actually transmuted into gold through the photoneutron process, hereby described:
<ul><li> Irradiate mercury-198 atoms with 6.8MeV gamma rays
</li><li> The gamma rays will cause mercury-198 atoms to eject a neutron, turning into mercury-197, which is radioactive, with a half-life of 2.7 days
</li><li> Mercury-197 decays into gold-197 by &beta;+ decay: one of its protons emits a positron, turning into an additional neutron
</li></ul></li><li> So there you have it.

They enlisted the aid of The Donald to thoroughly discredit the Republicans and possibly ruin the political careers of every other Republican candidate (especially Tea Party contenders such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio) by having Trump spout Neo-Fascist rhetoric and insult nearly every major group (including groups critical to winning the November election such as women and Latinos), figuring (correctly) that Republicans would embrace his brash personality and far-right stances while the majority of Americans would turn away from the GOP in disgust. Clinton's motivations are obviously to win the presidency in the same way LBJ beat Goldwater, by presenting her likely opponent as a dangerous extremist who will endanger the democratic principles America was built on. Obama's motivation is that his policies be continued or perhaps even strengthened (should Clinton move to the left once elected or should Bernie Sanders be elected) and the best way to ensue that is by having the GOP cripple itself in the civil war that has erupted between Pro and Anti-Trump factions and then sink itself completely when they try to run a candidate as extreme and divisive as Trump.

We are their servants,their slaves. We're just too damn arrogant to think we could be so subtly controlled by them. In the social heirachy,we are the slaves,strays are the poor and dispossed. Tabbies are the plebes and middle class, while pedigrees are the elite.
<ul><li> That's scarily similar to the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Felidae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Felidae">Felidae</a></em>....

...Or at least on a hidden landmass in the Indian Ocean, according to some Indian scripts. Think about it: snakes have been described in ancient texts and cultures as symbols of rebirth, healing, and/or cleverness, among other things. One of the Aztec's major gods has been described as a winged serpant, at some points. Then take into account that snakes have been around for millions of years before humans, and species are <em>still</em> being discovered. Evolution isn't that much of a jump. So, millenia ago, they were forced to hide underground to avoid any more unnecessary predujiced skirmishes with humans. But soon, they shall rise up, enslave humanity, and take over the Earth as the new dominant species...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderandJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderandJaywalking">or just perform a musical number in Hyperabad</a>.

Well, most of them anyway. Some might actually be as dumb as they look. The actual intelliegence of the rest is unknown although it probably varies quite a bit; some might actually be smarter then we are. They act dumb because they like the way things are and they're been hanging around us long enough to know that we might react badly to finding out the truth, either that or expect them to do more.

Squids are foot soldiers, modeled the most after their Overlords.

Let's use kelpies as the example for shapeshifters here. They are said to sometimes transform into attractive humans to attract humans as prey. This is only possible because humans tend to be fairly trusting. Other animals, however, tend to have fairly elaborate mating rituals and, in general, elaborate ways of greeting each other. This would give an alternate explanation for why so many monsters in myths and legends - especially the ones who use trickery - prey mostly on humans (besides the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostWritersAreHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostWritersAreHuman">Most Writers Are Human</a> and therefore find that scarier).

Animals and plants are connected physically to the Earth, it needs us to survive, and also mentally, the organisms residing on it are also connected to each other in a simular way. <br><br>It seems Earth has attempted to communicate with us through this, but these attempts have had little success becuase of <em>huge</em> language and phsycology barriers,as well as the dormancy of the mental connection between Earth and us, other organisms may be able to use the link more effectively, but amongst humans it has done little more than cause confusion and given rise to ideas like 'God' and 'magic.' <br><br>Animals also seem to be able to use this for telepathic communication,how much other creatures use this at what efficiency is unknown, but humans are unskilled at this.

As for us being the Virus, think about it: ever since we were born on Earth, instead of adapting with it in a symbiotic relationship like most plants and animals do, we try to form Earth to our own will. We settle to one place, modify the available area, consume all the resources, reproduce like hell, warp reality so that the surface would look like warped mountains, and so on, and when the area is exhausted, we move to another, where we then continue to consume.

<p></p><div class="wmglead"> We're on the verge of another extinction event.</div>
Hear me out. Right now, the earth is in a period of warming. It does this sometimes; see previous Ice Age for reference. A lot of our species are endangered, some of them NOT due to humans killing them all. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreStupid">We're making the problem worse by trying to fix it</a> (we're trying to re-freeze the Arctic places, except when we do this, the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CFCs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CFCs">CF Cs</a> get trapped in the polar stratus clouds at certain [normal Arctic] temperatures, only to be released more viciously when the temperature warms and the clouds go away, eating even MORE ozone and letting in more dangerous crap than if we'd just left $h1+ alone), signaling that we're not supposed to fix it.
<p>We know the Earth is getting overcrowded, with both humans and other animals alike. A lot of those animals are evolving right in front of us- elephants are evolving away their tusks as a result of poaching, for example. Think back to the dinosaurs- doesn't matter how they died, my point is they died. The extinction event killed every dinosaur that was stuck on land (IOW, damn near everything that didn't fly). This is where we get our birds from. Without those dinosaurs dying, the leftovers wouldn't have the chance to evolve into the birds we have today.
</p><p>If our ancestors (Homo heidlebergensis and Homo erectus, for instance) hadn't died, Homo sapiens sapiens couldn't have evolved. Once most of a species is gone, what's left begins evolving features to help them survive- it's a way of self preservation. The leftovers become so fast, so smart, and so well adapted to their current situation, that they no longer resemble the original species. BUT this is achieved only when the numbers of that species are extremely destitute. This is why Homo sapiens sapiens has evolved no further physically- we have no need to. There are enough of us to survive a cataclysm, and our genes know it.
</p><p>Once the ice caps are gone, we'll lose our cold water sea life, yes- but from this loss, we'll acquire new species. Perhaps we're SUPPOSED to be killing these animals off- although that's only a theory and not something I acutally support. However, it does appear we're at the edge of a mass extinction event, given the earth's natural cooling and warming rhythms, and our powerlessness at stopping them.
</p><p>Mass extinction event, yes/no? DISCUSS and/or RAGE.
</p><p>PS: Just an afterthought- For those that don't believe in evolution, why would God create something and not give it the ability to better itself over time?

Robin Cook famously resigned from the cabinet of the British Labour Party in protest at the Iraq War - that we all know. However, it was a devious insurance policy by Labour. The real plan is that they would have him in reserve if it all went to hell (their popularity, not the war itself!), Tony Blair would be given the boot, he would come back, take the reins as leader and be able to win back voters with his, "well I was against the war" stance.

Up until the exit poll which showed the Conservatives actually going up (and then the actual result which gave them an outright majority), everyone was predicting a hung parliament with Labour and the Conservatives almost level in the high 200s. There was much speculation about different coalitions or Confidence &amp; Supply deals, but, significantly, pretty much every permutation of events had Ed Miliband being Prime Minister (because the myriad anti-Westminster parties were indifferent to Labour, but <strong>really</strong> hated the Conservatives and often ran their whole campaigns on that basis) even if Labour didn't win the election. Ed realised he was going to be nominally in power but would almost certainly need the Scottish Nationalists to reluctantly prop him up. Rather than suffer five years of limited government with Slamond and Sturgeon choking him by the balls, he made deliberately bad campaigning choices (like the infamous "Ed Stone") to encourage a Conservative victory so that David Cameron could get blamed for the inevitable nightmares of governing over the next five years, while Ed could quietly escape.

Once upon a time, human testing was pretty common. Nowadays, there's "ethics" and "human rights", which makes villainous behavior a little harder to get away with. The Nazis' unethical experiments, for example, in the long term, saved some lives, because of research on things like hypothermia. Because of their willingness to induce it, they learned how to treat it, and that data has obviously saved some lives. So, what's a shadowy government organization to do when they need massive numbers of test subjects for some purpose right now? Disappear them. Maybe other unfound missing people in the last decade or so are early tests, and they were finally ready to do a large scale test. Thus, one plane disappears, and they get their test subjects. After all, it's hard to disappear that many people at once, and a plane has the plausible deniability that things like buildings, towns and boats lack.

The U.S.A used to be the colonies divided between Spain, France, and Britain. It is plausable that in the very distant future the Europian Unions already tight bond will be stronger and it will be one country with the (present day country's) as states. Already the Union's concil has a president. Russia probably will be left out, and Britain may have left the union by that time and have become a state of America.
<ul><li> Britain <em>will</em> leave the EU before it becomes the USE. A big reason we don't like the EU is because we can see that coming all too clearly, and we don't want to be part of a USE. But we don't want to be part of the USA either; the whole point is we don't want to be part of a USAnything.
<ul><li> And <em>then</em> America, because of its brainless hatred of Europe and love of money will buy out the USE, and then go to war with all the people they don't like... No matter how stupid the reason that might be. America will take over the world, and the only country left to build a resistance will be Britain.
</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><div class="wmglead"> In accordance with the above WMG: Peace will not come in Africa until all African countries unite into an African Union.</div>
Their situation is more dire than Europe's for most of history, but is ultimately the same; random alliances and rivalries force an entire continent into war. Consider the first world war. It didn't really have to happen, it was just super confused after centuries of random alliances being made and broken. Now, with the EU, there hasn't been a European war for some time, discounting the civil wars and genocides in Serbia, Armenia, and caused by the fall of the USSR. An AU is really the only answer, but the world doesn't care enough about it to push Africa to move towards peace.

The Earth goes through these warming and cooling trends. We just happen to be in a warming one. Technically, we're still in what we call the "previous" Ice Age- what laymen refer to as the Ice Age was just our last frozen stage, but we never really left that Ice Age. Anyways, the Earth started warming before our species of human knew what our genitals were. Yet, here we sit, Present Day Earth, freaking out about how we destroyed the planet and caused global warming. In reality, we didn't freaking do it. (I will say we certainly haven't helped any.)
<p>Anyways, once this warming stage is over, the earth will begin to cool down. By then, humans will have developed all sorts of awesome alternative energies. Once the "global cooling" panic sets in, humans of the future will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">shht themselves in fear</a>. They will look at the history books to this time era and think they overdid it with the alternative fuels. They will then try to fix this by burning more fossil fuels, when, in reality, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreStupid">humans will have not learned that this just happens</a>.

The same propaganda machine is responsible for the organisation of politically funded "scientists" being able to survive the mass hack/leak of emails containing explicit instructions from the higher-ups to their subordinates on how to fudge their results to support the ideology, instead of being called out as blindingly obvious organised scientific fraud. Sooner or later some other big bogeyman will rear its head (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> restarting, perhaps?) and people will move on to freaking about that and forget about the whole silly climate business.

<p></p><div class="wmglead"> The World ended on December 21st</div>
And now we're living in The Matrix. This troper has noticed very strange things happening since December 22nd. So someone hooked everyone on the planet up to machinery while they were sleeping, and applied heavy sedatives. They then copied our personality and physical traits onto a hardrive and sent it into space. Now we're all living in a strange world with odd occurences and people acting out of character- system glitches. And eventually we'll run out of battery power and be discovered by an advanced alien civilisation in millions of years, then be reactivated and communicate with them via artificial intelligence.
<p></p><div class="wmglead"> on the 21st of December 2012, the descendants of the Mayan people will all appear on live television, and laugh at us.</div>
...Actually I'm surprised the programmers didn't do it first, on 1st of December 2000.
<p></p><div class="wmglead"> We are living in an alternative timeline where 2012 will happen.</div>
The TRUE timeline for the world we think we know includes no Holocaust, no Kennedy assasination, the amicable split of the Beatles and a world where terrorism is something explored purely in fiction (the twin towers incident being a series of popular books/films exploring a kind of hatred the real world would never know). And thus, no end of the world. Unfortunately for us.
<ul><li> Jossed, everything is fine.

The TRUE timeline for our world <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">was 100x worse than ours</a>. While our world can arguably be seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWorldHalfFull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWorldHalfFull">A World Half Full</a>, the other world gets worse EVERY SINGLE YEAR. In that timeline, Hitler wins <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> but doesn't attack the Soviet Union, leading to a 10-year Cold War Arms buildup and then a 3-way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII">World War III</a> between Germany and Russia that ends with both sides being destroyed. The Great Depression was worse than what happened in the alternate Earth and led to collapse of dollar and, as a result the USA falls under a Communist Revolution and is stuck in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar">Forever War</a> with Japan after Pearl Harbor with no side winning.

Global Warming is also real, but 10x times worse in the true timeline. And all of these is expected to destroy that world in 2012. Everything that happened in our timeline are wholly explored in fiction, with everything in our history being part of a series of popular fiction exploring how humanity could have changed and adapted for the better, unfortunately, given the complete lack of positive experiences in that universe, many of the alterations, while MUCH better than their universe, still contained toned down versions of the same calamities sans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII">World War III</a> and is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">very bittersweet</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">Earn Your Happy Ending</a> at best and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">total downers at worst</a>.

The world won't end, I've read that that was just a misinterpretation of the Mayan calendar. However, something will happen in 2012, it's just not clear what... I bet that once it happens, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">everything will suddenly make perfect sense.</a>

</li></ul><p></p><div class="wmglead"> The Mayans did not prophecize the end of the world in 2012...</div>
...but they did realize the adverse effects human societies have on the enviroment, and realizing that by 2012 we would enter an era where resources our society depends on becoming extremely scarce. 2012 is not the end of the world per-say, but rather the end of the world as we know it; human society is about to enter a sort of revolution, much like the agricultural revolution that began in the Fertile Crescent (in what is now modern-day Iraq) that will fundamentally change how we interact with our enviroment and how our societies function, but this time, the revolution is on a world-wide scale, and will occur much faster. For example, the rise of the pyramid-style hierarchy essentially began with the development of agriculture; having a surplus of food that you can store means that not everybody has to grow food, and a fraction of the population (which increases as food-production increases) can specialize in scientific and engineering fields like metal-working and architecture. These specialized workers became the middle class, the farmers and laborers became the lower class, and the administrative positions that manage these jobs as leaders of society became the upper class. The exact specifications of each class vary across the world and history, but most modern civilizations follow this structure, and every major change in history is essentially a shift in power between in each of these classes. This system is about to fall apart, very, very soon. Human beings have developed such a deep understanding of agriculture and technology, that there may be a point in the future where large nations break down into smaller states, because large-scale management of labor and services is no longer required with the advancements we are making.

They were somehow able to tell that the last living remnants of their civilisation (i.e. the last descendant of the Mayans) would be gone after that day, and figured they'd stop making calendars since there was nothing more for them after that day. Eventually, other civilisations discovered the calendars and assumed it was for the end of the world for <em>everyone</em>, not just the one group of people. And the date the calendars ended became part of public consciousness, thus leading to fears that the world will be destroyed, when, in fact, it is merely the end of the Mayans.
<ul><li> In that case, the numerous descendants of the Mayans who are currently living in Mexico can be annoyed that their ancestors got their predictions completely wrong, <em>as well as</em> annoyed by how all these <em>gringos</em> kept misinterpreting what their ancestors' calendar had to say about 2012.

Doing it with the media is a bit harder but we've eventually invented a system of sigils that forces an absolute denial response in baseline mind when seen or heard. BTW this is the reason for 90% of the so-called "plotholes" in any media you might care to mention. A digression: in actuality, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighlanderIITheQuickening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighlanderIITheQuickening">Highlander II: The Quickening</a></em> was one of the greatest films of the 20th century but the amount of sigils it has simply makes the story silly for the non-telepathic mind. <br><br>So, there's the truth.

The flu is a highly communicable, often fatal disease with no cure. Yet most people treat "the flu" as they would "a cold" &mdash; a minor annual nuisance to go through, get over and forget about.

<ul><li> The answer is simple: MARS!

The universe is simply too vast. By the same logic stating that the universe is just too large for there not to be extraterestrial life, the same logic is there's just too much space to travel. I'm sure there's countless varieties of strange, beautiful, nightmarish, and complex life out there but the sad reality is that none of us can make contact with each other. Science has all but proven that the light barrier cannot be broken, thus no ship could reach us or vice versa. It will take so long to travel to another inhabited planet that that species has long since gone extinct. At best, we can hope for a signal to reach it possibly detailing the lives of a people long since vanished thousands to millions of years ago. Though even that is suspect since our technologies and languages will probably be near incomprehensible to one another. The only exception might be if more than one form of intelligent life can exist on the same planet or solar system. Only the solar system could plausibly work however seeing how most forms of life on Earth have demonstrated that species will try killing each other off if they are in contact with each other that long and that close. I can only imagine what intelligent life would do. In the very unlikely but still plausible outcome that lifeforms in one solar system meet, they will be the exceptionally lucky few. Aside from that, we can only gaze up to the stars pondering what other lifeforms are like as they will for us. That is all there will ever be.
<div class="wmglead"> There is no intelligent extraterrestrial life anywhere.</div>
Alien civilizations will tend to expand or die out. If even one somewhere doesn't die out they will simply expand forever. There has been billions of years to happen already, yet they aren't here yet. Even if they weren't interested in Earth, they would still likely attempt harvest all usable resources in the universe (the easiest way to doing that would be to build Dyson swarms around all stars). In short, if aliens did exist, <em>we wouldn't be be able to see the stars</em>. Or, there would be a huge region of space with exceptionally dim galaxies in it (visible only by the waste heat generated by the aliens' technology). We don't see this, therefore we're alone. We're the first sentient lifeform to evolve in the entire universe.

<p></p><div class="wmglead"> The description of an alien city on Venus was misunderstood as the description of the Christian afterlife</div>
The Christian concept of the afterlife consists of Hell (where the wicked are punished) and Heaven (where the righteous are awarded). However, both environments could actually be real places, present not on Earth but on (and in the immediate vicinity of) the planet Venus. Let's start from the most obvious:
<ul><li> Hell is described as a place of suffering, with fire and brimstone ("brimstone" being an old word for "sulfur"). One of the old names for Venus was Lucifer (="Light bringer"), which is also one of the names of Satan. Successive inferior conjunctions of Venus repeat a 13:8 orbital resonance (the Earth orbits 8 times for every 13 orbits of Venus), creating a pentagrammic precession sequence; the Spanish Inquisition established a connection between the pentagram (originally a pagan symbol) and Satan. The surface of Venus probably looks like <a class="urllink" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Mgn_p39146.png">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> due to temperature and pressure and is actually an inferno (pun very much intended) of heat and sulfur: the temperature goes over 460 &deg;C (860 &deg;F), while the pressure is between 75 and 100 times the pressure on Earth; sulfur is a major constituent of the Venusian crust and Venusian rain is made of sulfuric acid. Obviously, anybody on that surface would experience atrocious suffering.
</li><li> Heaven, on the other hand, is described as a place of "light", high in the sky, with "streets of gold", while the popular depiction includes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FluffyCloudHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FluffyCloudHeaven">fluffy clouds</a>. It turns out that, 50 kilometers above the surface of Venus, the temperature and pressure match those of Earth, and that an aerostat habitat containing air at 1 bar would naturally float at that altitude due to buoyancy. Such a base or city would be flying above an endless expanse of golden clouds, brightly lit by sunlight. Receiving light from two sources (directly from the Sun and indirectly from the clouds) would increase the amount of free energy available for the base, which would grant a high standard of living for its inhabitants.

God created several people to rule the world, at different times, to avoid suspicion. They included Barack Obama. He came into contact with another man in on the plan: Ted Kennedy. His plan involved the creation of an artificial human that would destabilize the Republican Party. This human was Sarah Palin. Kennedy and Obama then hypnotized John <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McCain">Mc Cain</a> into choosing Palin as his Vice Presidential candidate. This selection drew attention to Palin and also allowed Palin to make remarks that started to eat away at the party's credibility. Later on, Obama planned to pass the health care bill. Palin mentioned the non-existent death panels, which further harmed the Republicans. However, when some people either took the threats seriously or went against the bill for other reasons, Ted realized that the bill was in danger. So he decided to plan his own death so that the bill might be passed in his memory. It is still to be decided whether the plan succeeds or fails.

When you die, you are sent to an administration building where your fate is decided. If you did good deeds, you can enter Heaven. Bad deeds, which are no necessarily heinous, will be reincarnated as another chance. Heinous crimes will send you to hell for an unknown amount of time. The person who will handle your case is decided by what religion you practice and if you didn't have one, they will find you one.

Once time travel is invented, one person being God gains domain over it.

On both levels, Einstein's theory of relativity has been confirmed: that a planet's mass causes the fabric of space-time to form a curvature, and that the Earth's rotation also twists the space-time fabric.

It still retains its space-time sinkhole properties, but with an added twist: a Black Hole has no core. With gravity being the result of an object responding to the curvature of space-time, a hole in space-time would produce an inescapable sinkhole that all things are drawn towards, including light.

</li></ul>Formed in other universes. With a hole in the fabric of space-time in one universe, all matter and light around it are pulled towards the hole in space-time. When matter passes through the black hole, where the laws of physics don't exist because there's no space-time, they are broken down, and then "ejected" out through a white hole into another universe.
<p></p><div class="wmglead"> There is an earth prime prime</div>
Let me explain this by proposing this question: If we assume that almost every piece of fiction is an alternate universe, we would see that many of them either take place on earth or have a mention of earth. One question baffled me: Why is there a Hitler or any other public domain character in a majority of them?
<p>I have two related answers that satisfy this:
1. everytime there is a crosover, information will trade from one universe/multiverse to another. Sometimes a new world will be formed to connect Two worlds. For example: a world where transformers and marvel coexist joins both respective multiverses.
</p><p>2. every possible interpretation earth, every earth prime, every alternate history of earth and every possible future of earth is connected to this Earth prime. This particular earth provides the basis for all the other histories, historic characters,genres, magics and technologies. Every other possible earth, in a way, is an interpretation of this every earth. And in a wat this earth acts as a standard model to every possible earth.

<div class="wmglead"> There is a parallel earth where every trope gets reconstructed in real life</div>
I was over at the real life and say how the trope of deconstruction. Then realised that every trope we see deconstructed in real life, that same trope gets reconstructed in a parallel earth.
<p></p><div class="wmglead"> God is lonely.</div>
let me elaborate: I was reading the section of &#9702;Psychopathology And Brain Disorders
In the high octane nightmare fuel in real life page. I read about the effects of isolation on a person then realised that before the universe existed, God was the only being in existence. Assuming that every being that can think and feel, whether sentient or animal, God must've been going crazy or suffering psychological affects from extreme isolation. He either hallucinated or created the universe. Which means the meaning of our existence is keep god company and to keep him from being lonely.
<p><em>Whoa, I never thought Real Life is as awesome as that...</em>
</p><p></p><ul><li> Except in Christianity, where the doctrine of the Trinity josses that. If God is three, God cannot get lonely.
<ul><li> Not necessarily. One third is characterized by being part of the universe as well as creator of it and so isn't necessarily there prior to genesis, while the last third is sufficiently obscure and absent in stories that he's probably not exactly what you'd call a terrific conversationalist.
</li></ul></li><li> Although this is pretty much how the world was created according to Hinduism.

Let's face it. We don't forgive each other no matter who we are. After all, we've made a whole lot of mistakes, and even if it looks like we're on the same page, we just can't let go of what the other did. Not to mention we're always applaud the suffering and punishment of the ones who did wrong or at least have seriously screwed up.
<p></p><div class="wmglead"> We all hate each other.</div>
You have to admit that. Even those who say they love each other have moments where one or the other want to rip their head for doing something stupid or wrong on occasions. Right?
<p></p><div class="wmglead"> The wedding ring is meant to simulate sex.</div>
Think about it for a moment. How do you put on the wedding ring ? By putting your finger into it. The ring is a hole. Since wedding is basically rooted in sex, the ring is meant to represent the vaginal area of the women and the finger is supposed to represent the penis. Why do both wear it ? Because it simbolizes how they only have sexual relationships between themselves. This theory is courtesy of Dr. Jessica Pereira( she would kill me should i not post it here).
<ul><li> The wedding ring is a symbol of the enslavement of a sexual partner. The fad for wedding rings made in the likeness of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The One Ring</a> - complete with inscription - is therefore extremely appropriate. Evolutionary biologists probably love it.
</li><li> The wedding ring is a symbol of eternal love/commitment because a circle has no end. Also, a single specific ring to symbolize marriage in western society wasn't even a thing until the 16th century at least. Before then it was just "I'm going to marry you and give you a token if I have the money and it might be a ring but it might also be any other kind of jewelry." And only women wore wedding rings until the 20th century, so there's nothing traditional about both people wearing them.

<p></p><div class="wmglead"> Humanity has a love/hate relationship with each other.</div>
Whether it be two friends, two lovers, husband and wife, parent and child, sibling and sibling, teacher and student, or boss and employee, we all have moments of loving and caring for one another and at the same time we all want to kill each other for screwing up. But hey, that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreFlawed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreFlawed">human nature for you</a>.
<p></p><div class="wmglead"> Why Deer are Big and Silent while Squirrels are Small and Noisy:</div>
Their code is glitched. Deer are supposed to be assigned the Big and Noisy traits, to make finding them easier. Squirrels are supposed to be assigned the Small and Silent traits, to make hunting them more challenging. Unfortunately, due to a glitch, Deer (game animals that have served as food) are assigned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime">traits that make them worthwhile to hunt but hard to find</a> while Squirrels (small annoying creatures) have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats">traits that make them easy to find but near-worthless to hunt.</a> It makes sense.
<ul><li> Or anternately there is nto glitch, it was donw on purpose so that deer hunting is more rewarding for effert put in to finding them and Squirrels are esay to find, but are not very rewarding.

<p></p><div class="wmglead"> The concept of the pop-cultural "decade" ended with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">Turn of the Millennium</a></div>
The attacks of 9/11 stopped it in it's tracks, and then the internet did away with how monolithic pop culture had been in the 20th century. Sure there are still trends, fashions and fads, but not <em>everyone</em> follows them like they did during the second half of the 20th century. Dominant musical genres of recent years such as Emo and Dubstep were never as powerful and all-encompassing as Disco or Rock and Roll were in their prime. The mainstream really isn't as "mainstream" as it once was. Our pages on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">Turn of the Millennium</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a> seem like they have to force a square peg into a round hole to define the last decade and a half as handily as one can define <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>. Did the current cultural decade start in 2008? 2012? No one can agree on it. We don't even have proper names for the decades; who honestly walks around calling the current decade "the new tens" outside of this site? As much as people are trying to resuscitate this concept, it seems to be nothing more than a hold-over from the 20th century.
