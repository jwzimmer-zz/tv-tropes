Each round, a Hero is chosen at random and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch">both players must play as that Hero</a>. The first to win five rounds wins the match. A variation of this mode, <strong>Limited Duel</strong>, allows each player to pick from a small pool of permitted Heroes every round.</li><li> <strong>Elimination</strong> is another elimination mode, this time featuring two teams of three or six, although unlike in Mystery Duel each player is allowed to choose their Hero. There is no respawning until the beginning of the next round. First to three rounds of winning wins the match. A variation of this mode, <strong>Lockout Elimination</strong>, has Heroes used to win a round disabled for the round-winning team for the remainder of the match. Custom games of Eliminations can use Control maps.</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptureTheFlag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptureTheFlag">Capture the Flag</a></strong> has two teams of six going at it in a traditional CTF mode, reusing most Control maps. The flag can be taken instantly, but using any movement abilities causes the carrier to instantly drop it, requiring a delay before anyone can pick it up, including enemies, who can return it to its base by standing on it for a few seconds<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note30t60q');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note30t60q" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note30t60q');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In its first year, movement abilities were not restricted, but it required 2.5 uninterrupted seconds for anyone to pick it up</span>. This mode was introduced with the 2017 Year of the Rooster update as a limited-time mode, using a "winner determined by first to three captures or whichever team has more captures when time runs out" ruleset, but it was popular enough to be made into an Arcade mode, made available for custom games, and became a Lunar New Year mainstay.</li><li> <strong>Deathmatch</strong>: Much like Elimination the goal here is to just kill your opponent. In Free For All mode 8 individual players fight each other battle royale style and the first player to 20 kills wins, though all 4 top players will be counted as a winner toward Arcade Loot Boxes. In Team Deathmatch, two teams of 4 players go head to head and the first team to 30 kills wins. Mercy's Resurrection Ability in this mode will remove kills.</li><li> <strong>No Limits</strong> uses the four standard formats, but allows teams to each have more than one of the same Hero.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3180n0');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3180n0" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3180n0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">During the betas and in the first few months of the game's release, there was no restriction on how many of the same Hero could be on one team, but player concerns regarding balance led to "Hero stacking" being banned in Competitive Mode and later Quick Play, with the update that banned stacking in Quick Play introducing this mode.</span></li><li> <strong>Total Mayhem</strong> uses Escort and Hybrid formats, with ability cooldowns sharply reduced, faster ultimate generation, and health points doubled.</li><li> <strong>Low Gravity</strong> uses the standard formats, with less gravity, resulting in higher jumps and slower falls for all heroes.</li><li> <strong>Mystery Heroes</strong> uses the standard formats, but randomizes Hero selection for each player. When a player dies and respawns, they have a new Hero randomly picked for them.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note327pec');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note327pec" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note327pec');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Only counts on deaths registered as being from enemy attack; suicide always results in respawning as the same Hero.

It would seem that all of the beauty, all the circumstances that led to these interesting characters and their contrasting philosophies, all of these had consequences. On top of that, with all the turmoil and factions that an enterprising hero could fight, there's one thing made clear: The world isn't safe, no matter how beautiful it looks.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAestheticsOfTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAestheticsOfTechnology">The Aesthetics of Technology</a>: While individual characters come from all around the world with their own cultures, each of them has enough of a 'technological' aspect in their design that it unifies the art style as a whole. As an example, Hanzo is <em>mostly</em> a traditional samurai, but both his boots and his bow are teched up. McCree is 100% traditional cowboy, except for his cybernetic hand.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">A.I.

However, the four playable omnics are a childlike and peace-loving amnesiac mobile artillery unit (Bastion), a not-quite-Buddhist robot monk (Zenyatta), a refurbished defense unit who protects Numbani (Orisa), and an omnic specifically created to be a hero who joined the Overwatch team (Echo).</li><li> The Anubis AI featured in <em>Mission Statement</em> isn't too fond of humans.</li><li> Null Sector is an entire Omnic terrorist organization.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a>: Much like Valve with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>, Blizzard develops the unfolding lore outside of the actual gameplay.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateRealityGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateRealityGame">Alternate Reality Game</a>: The "Sombra ARG" lasted from Ana's initial announcement up until her eventual announcement (June to November 2016), taking the form of several videos, screenshots and website descriptions containing incredibly well-hidden encrypted codes hinting at her presence within the world. The decoding process has been extremely complex, and a summary of fans' findings can be seen <a class="urllink" href="http://wiki.gamedetectives.net/index.php?title=Sombra_ARG">here.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou">An Adventurer Is You</a>: The heroes are split into three different groups, forming a typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamagerHealerTank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamagerHealerTank">Damager, Healer, Tank</a> structure:<ul><li> Damage: These heroes excel at dealing damage and securing kills, whether by actively pushing objectives and making power moves against the enemy team, or to oppressively defend objectives and kill those straying near the holdout.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note40553s');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note40553s" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note40553s');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Prior to June 2018, this was split into "Offense" and "Defense", but has since been consolidated into a single role.</span></li><li> Tank: These heroes are large, and that's the point. With lots of shields and armor, tanks soak up bullets for their team by being all up in their foe's crosshairs, and can also be capable of making disruptive engagements to set up for massive enemy team wipes. Tanks are often also more close-ranged than ranged-oriented.</li><li> Support: These heroes take on a number of supporting roles, most focusing on all-important healing to keep their team sustained in their constant battles. Some can contribute further with their unique buffs such as damage or speed boosts, while others can actively take part in assisting with damage and crowd control themselves.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndroidsArePeopleToo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndroidsArePeopleToo">Androids Are People, Too</a>: The story of Overwatch is set after the Omnic Crisis and the world is shown to be recovering from the war. Omnics are robots that came from the Omnium factories but there is prejudice between them and humanity, as humans blame the Omnics for the crisis. Kings Row shows this tense segregation in its entirety.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsClothes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsClothes">And Your Reward Is Clothes</a>: You can earn loot boxes by leveling up.

Ana, Hanzo, McCree, and Soldier 76 take on the roles of the four heroes who repelled Junkenstein's forces. Mercy plays the Witch, who can bring people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>, Junkrat plays the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> himself, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Dr. Junkenstein</a>, with his bodyguard Roadhog playing his Frankenstein's monster and Reaper playing an undead monster under the control of the Witch (who had been friends with 76 and Ana's "characters" in his former life).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotifs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotifs">Animal Motifs</a>: The Lindholms have connections to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews">bears</a>. Torbjorn's name means "Thor Bear" and his "Viking" skin has his claw resemble a bear; you can also make the claim that his white, fur cloak is in reference to a polar bear. Brigitte's "Shieldmaiden" skin also features a bear and a bear paw print.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animesque" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animesque">Animesque</a>: The Doomfist origin video looks like a high-quality <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">anime</a>, in contrast to the CGI shorts being more Pixar-esque and the previous non-CGI shorts being stills.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiArmor">Anti-Armor</a>: Torbj&ouml;rn's reworked Molten Core deals increased damage-per-second to enemy heroes with Armor<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note41r9cs');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note41r9cs" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note41r9cs');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">190/s if Armored, 160/s if not; having your armor destroyed will reduce the DPS burn to its lower threshold</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeature">Anti-Frustration Feature</a>:<ul><li> All heroes have infinite reserve ammunition (the magazines still have a finite capacity, so reloads are still necessary) for their primary weapons (D.Va's mech, Hanzo's quiver, and Moira's, uh, hands all have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines">Bottomless Magazines</a>), and have relatively quick reload times. This is so players won't have to scour for ammo packs, something that will take them out of the fight, as well as to put focus on a hero's abilities. What's more, Torbj&ouml;rn or Mercy can switch between their weapon and tool, and when they equip the latter, their unequipped weapon will automatically reload itself after a short time.</li><li> No matter how high a place you fall from, you will not sustain fall damage, although some maps have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit">bottomless pits</a> and edges that will kill you if you fall into them... even if your character can fly, and the 'pit' is grass 40 feet below.</li><li> Characters who build devices or place traps (namely Symmetra, Torbj&ouml;rn, and Junkrat) have indicators on their screen that show roughly where the devices are placed and their status, namely when they're being triggered and when they're destroyed. Oddly enough, in Junkrat's case, it applies to his trap and not his concussion mine.</li><li> Some characters have built-in mechanics to avoid wasting their ultimates:<ul><li> Ana can't use her ultimate unless there are valid targets within range (any ally within line of sight), so she doesn't waste her ultimate by accident.</li><li> Before Symmetra's rework, if the spawn rooms change while she has a Teleporter/Shield Generator active, it will disappear and she will get a boost to her ultimate charge proportional to the number of unused teleports remaining, or a complete charge for the Shield Generator so she can immediately rebuild it.</li></ul></li><li> You will get warned by either your own character or a teammate in various critical situations, including if someone spots a sniper or a turret, if someone starts capturing the objective, if they are revived, and if you get attacked from behind.</li><li> In the first few years of <em>Overwatch</em>, the game would dump the player into an open-map team skirmish if the wait time went over a minute, so players had something to do. A later patch offers players an option called "While You Wait", allowing players to immediately drop into skirmishes, the practice range, a custom game, a deathmatch, or simply chill with the Finding Game screen without having to wait 60 seconds.</li><li> If you get disconnected in a Competitive match, you can re-enter the match when you reconnect as long as it hasn't ended in the meantime.</li><li> Because the game is essentially non-stop team fighting, things can get extremely hectic. To properly alert players about Ultimates, the game plays a voice line for each hero globally so that everyone on both teams knows who's ulting. The game also accounts for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch">Mirror Match</a> situations, and has the enemy teams voice lines play in their native tongue to help with differentiation. If the character's main language is English, then the game plays a more distinct and aggressive-sounding voice line, such as Reaper shouting "Die, die, die" on the enemy team and "Clearing the area" on an allied team.</li><li> If someone leaves in a Competitive match but doesn't return (either due to doing it on purpose or disconnecting and failing to rejoin in time), remaining players of the affected team are allowed to leave one minute from the time the offending player left with a loss but no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiRageQuitting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiRageQuitting">quit penalties</a> to make up for the high chance that the team will probably take a protracted defeat otherwise anyway.</li><li> When you drop into the middle of a game (usually because somebody quit partway through), <em>Overwatch</em> may give you an XP "backfill bonus" to make up for lost opportunities for other awards and bonuses. In addition, if this game ends with your team losing (which is likely), this defeat won't be marked on your career record.</li><li> Characters announce when they are supporting allies, such as Mercy saying "I'm taking care of you!" during a healing stream and Symmetra announcing her Teleporter is set up, so players will know that they are being given support.</li><li> If an ally dies during PvE events (e.g. Uprising, Retribution, or Storm Rising, etc...), you have a few seconds to revive him or her. If you fail to do so, you fail the mission. Since one of the modes of this mission can be done with any hero, it may lead to situations where someone dies in a place other players can't reach. If that happens, the body is teleported to a more accessible location nearby, so you still have a chance to revive them.<ul><li> Formerly, reviving is manual; however, as of Retribution, all revives now only require a teammate to stand within proximity to a downed ally until the counter ticks back up to full. This is due to the default lineup for the Retribution event (Reyes, McCree, Moira, and Genji) not including any tanks, which means that actively reviving an ally would leave a player completely exposed with no possible cover.</li></ul></li><li> In the first week of the Retribution event, the mission would only be complete if all four players had entered the dropship. This meant that if one player decided to, at the end, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">ignore the objective and continue racking up kills in waves of enemies designed to be eventually unwinnable</a>, the other three players would be forced to wait or even die themselves if that player were to die in the middle of enemy lines. An update introduced in the second week allows the rescue plane to depart if at least one party member is in the plane and the rest of the party is dead, awarding everyone a victory.</li><li> As a deterrent for players constantly leaving in quickplay and requeuing for matches they like, the game will hit you with a -75% XP gain "leaver's penalty" if you have left too many in a row, usually 5 out of the last 20, and will stay like that until you've finished a certain number of games without quitting. Formerly, there was no way to tell if one is back in the "green"; however, a counter has been added under the playercard on the main menu to show how many matches left the player has to complete before their XP gains return to normal, and a giant warning label will appear on the lower left corner if you're close to receiving a penalty. It only applies to quickplay, however, as Competitive has its own penalty measures (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiRageQuitting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiRageQuitting">Anti-Rage Quitting</a> below).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiGravity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiGravity">Anti-Gravity</a>:<ul><li> Very few vehicles have wheels. Instead, they have some anti-gravity device in their place which keeps them afloat in midair.

Each of the villains therefore has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">story behind how they became who they currently are</a>, which leaves each of them &#151; some, admittedly, more than others &#151; with some measure of sympathy.<ul><li> Symmetra is the straightest example. She is a fundamentally well-intentioned person who is motivated by a legitimate desire to make the world a better place, and she appears to be genuinely regretful for her actions in <em>A Better World</em> when they lead to worsening the situation. Unfortunately, thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">environment</a> in which she was raised, her definition of "better" is inflexibly rigid, regimental, and unquestioning order in all things, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">come hell or high water, she intends to have it</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">Downplayed</a> a bit more with Reaper and Widowmaker.

Of all the Talon agents, her intentions are the least heinous, being more of a thief than a murderer or warmonger, and she has the most relatable motivation for her actions: she's on the run from a vast global conspiracy, and she's using the resources Talon provides her to covertly investigate it. She's also, far and away, their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">most</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">obnoxious</a> member, she's implied to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">possibly</a> not have the best interests of anyone but herself in mind, and she has no problem with being an accomplice to Talon's destructive ways even when it doesn't immediately service her ends.</li><li> Roadhog's homeland was sold out by his own government, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">hardships</a> he endured in leading its ultimately futile defense, coupled with witnessing its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">degradation</a> first-hand, led him to becoming a bitter, angry, hateful, and selfish man who believes the world has spurned him. Thus, he thinks the harm he chooses to inflict is just what the world deserves. This also fits partner-in-crime Junkrat, but not quite to the same degree. Both are presented as products of their environment, but Junkrat's grievances are not as explored in-depth, and his actions are portrayed more like the fevered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughablyEvil">shenanigans</a> of an irresponsible madman out for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">his own amusement</a>.</li><li> Even the coolly aloof <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Moira</a>, who at first glance appears to be an aversion of the trope, has clear and realistic motivations. She doesn't have a tragic backstory, which arguably makes her the least sympathetic character in the game, but she isn't evil for the sake of being evil.

In turn, Tracer played a role in botching her and Reaper&#146;s museum heist, which signaled the beginning of Overwatch&#146;s return and makes her partially representative of the first real opposition that Talon has had to face in years.

Zarya and Zenyatta in particular are quite strong, the former because the AI uses Zarya's barriers as well as any human can and the latter because the AI has perfect aim despite the travel time on Zenyatta's projectiles.

As seen in the Uprising comic, most of Genji's body was replaced with cybernetic implants, following Overwatch's acquisition of him, with only his torso, left arm and head being left organic. Genji's current body is potentially even more cybernetic in nature. Doomfist's non-gauntlet arm is a prosthetic with built-in knuckle shotguns.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Artificial Stupidity</a>: The bots in the offline mode make for very poor practice. While they always make sure to group up, they lump themselves together in such a manner that it is ludicrously easy to rack up eliminations without having to worry about your safety, and they only ever march towards their objectives, only splitting up when they get there or if a player intervenes. Depending on whether or not the bots are attacking, they might pick a hero that's extremely unsuitable for the situation, such as an attacking Bastion when playing on an easily defensible map like Hanamura. Furthermore, you'll only ever see the AI play as Soldier: 76, McCree, Reaper, Bastion, Torbj&ouml;rn, Roadhog, Zarya, L&uacute;cio, Ana, Mei, Zenyatta, and Sombra. The AI isn't programmed to handle Pharah's and Genji's use of mobility, or Tracer's abilities. Hanzo and Widowmaker's sniping abilities are useless because of the above-mentioned pathing. Junkrat's positional defenses can't be utilized. Reinhardt and Brigitte can't use their shield in order to keep up the pace, Winston's gun isn't accurate and his shield is useless for bots on the move, and the AI can't play as D.Va because it's basically two different forms between her MEKA and herself. Mercy requires the player to hold down the fire button (as do Mei, Moira, and Symmetra) and rapidly change between players to keep them healed. Symmetra's entire concept is useless, again, because of the pathing. Orisa's anchor shield is useless for bots that constantly move, and the AI is unable to utilize the biotic orbs that Moira uses. Mei was eventually programmed into the AI, and she's very quick to use her Cryo-Freeze. That said, the remaining characters do use their abilities properly, and will use their ultimates when they see the right moment.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseGeography" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseGeography">Artistic License &#150; Geography</a>:<ul><li> The game takes liberties with maps based on specific real-life locations; for example, anyone who's been to Hollywood in real life can tell you that there's no major studios within a five-minute walk of Hollywood Boulevard, unlike its in-game counterpart.

It was also rendered in-engine, instead of using the Pixar-esque style the other cinematics used. The "Rise and Shine" short confirmed that this change would not be permanent.

Overwatch was formed to fight what no one else could, and later made a better world with peacekeeping, science, and exploration. However, it's also <em>very</em> militaristic in nature, which created tension. Later, the covert "Blackwatch" unit and all of its dirtiest secrets were revealed to the public, demonstrating how corrupt it had become. The United Nations decided to revoke their charter and shut them down, and not without good reason. However, the world <em>clearly</em> still needs an organization of heroes like Overwatch, as there are many problems that the UN, nor individual nations, can't solve.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines">Bottomless Magazines</a>: D.Va and Moira can fire nonstop without reloading.

Pushing enemies into pits on purpose is a legitimate (and rather annoying) tactic that heroes with knockback (D.Va, Pharah, Junkrat, L&uacute;cio, Brigitte) or drags (Roadhog, Orisa) can employ for easy kills. Subverted with L&uacute;cio, thanks to his wall-riding ability, if you're skilled enough. Very high-skilled players can use the one in Ilios as a method of avoiding enemies.

However, most marginalized groups in reality have neither the numbers, firepower, or capital to stage a full-scale uprising.</li><li> While most refugees come from conflicts restricted to a particular region, the Omnic Crisis was a global war.

Even if you know in your heart that your Omnic friend wouldn't hurt a fly, they can still be hacked and turned against you. While Widowmaker proves that humans can also be brainwashed into committing cold-blooded murder against their will in the <em>Overwatch</em> universe, it took weeks of brainwashing and psychological torture for Talon to make Am&eacute;lie Lacroix into their sleeper agent after they kidnapped her, whereas a God AI such as Anubis can take control of a nearby Omnic in the space of a few minutes.</li></ul></li><li> The message the lore repeatedly tries to hammer home about having hope and taking the initiative to make a difference in the world starts to feel like this when you tally up the achievements of the heroes and villains and realize that the former have made almost <em>no</em> difference despite over two years of story development<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note53twa4');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note53twa4" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note53twa4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Aside from a handful of isolated incidents that either have no bearing on the greater conflict or have yet to appreciably pay off</span>.

Those items end up being the cargo on the payload for the map Junkertown, as part of a heist to get revenge.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassicVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassicVillain">Classic Villain</a>: In the proud tradition of the game&#146;s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWearingTights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWearingTights">inspi</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Disneyesque" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Disneyesque">rations</a>, the villains fit many of the criteria, being overtly visually and methodically distinct from the heroes, achieving their goals early on, often acting as foils for their good counterparts, and embodying at least one sin:<ul><li> Reaper: <strong>Envy</strong> and <strong>Wrath.</strong> Gabriel Reyes' resentment and frustration over the lack of recognition for his work embittered him to the point of outright hostility with his comrades, leading to a confrontation that left him in grievous condition for him to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">what</a> he is today. Now, as Reaper, he takes an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">inordinate amount of pleasure</a> in violence, and his campaign of extermination against former Overwatch agents seems to be motivated at least in part by a desire to vent his frustrations against those whom he considers to have neglected him<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note586yzf');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note586yzf" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note586yzf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">If he&#146;s put into play on Watchpoint: Gibraltar, he may comment "Overwatch&#133; I&#146;ll put an end to your sad story." with a delivery that is <em>seething</em> with subdued rage and bitterness</span>. For comparison, his former comrade and current foil Jack Morrison/Soldier: 76 was also presumed dead in the same incident, also wears a mask, and is also motivated by a desire for retribution, but where Reaper presents himself as an otherworldy wraith, dons a dark attire, and pursues personal vengeance, Morrison presents himself as just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSoldier">a</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatManIsDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatManIsDead">man</a>, wears a bright red and blue jacket, and pursues justice for his fallen organization.</li><li> Widowmaker: <strong>Lust</strong> and <strong>Pride.</strong> Not even just for her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic">appearance</a>, but rather for the way she luxuriates in her actions and treats killing like an indulgence, one for which she&#146;s always eager for more. She is one of Talon&#146;s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeavy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeavy">most effective agents</a>, and she seems to be aware of this given her mannerisms, which convey a condescending disdain and tendency to belittle those around her. She's particularly fond of mocking those she's triumphed over in the past, indicating that she likes to bask in her accomplishments and feel in control, especially at the expense of those she has hurt. To compare with her primary nemeses, she's a coldblooded assassin equipped with a dark, form-fitting wardrobe to contrast the vibrant Tracer's warmhearted hero and the practical Ana's family-minded protector. She is the direct cause for a substantial amount of grief in both their lives, being responsible for a murder that sparked mass unrest in Tracer's hometown and the shot that forced Ana into hiding and ruined her life, rendering the conflict both heroes have with her much more than professional.</li><li> Sombra: <strong>Sloth</strong> and <strong>Greed.</strong> She's a thief, a liar and a manipulator who seems to like nothing less than a fair fight. Her array of skills, which includes invisibility, long-rage teleportation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHacking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHacking">"hacking"</a> which acts as a nullifier for the skills of others and &#151; in gameplay &#151; the ability to track down critically-injured opponents, all mark her as an opportunist whose entire style of fighting revolves around using every dirty trick at her disposal to get what she wants with as little effort and risk to herself as possible. She's motivated largely by her own self-interest, having proven that she&#146;s fully prepared to withhold or fabricate information to even her own allies if the result would be a net gain for herself and herself alone. As a deceiver, she has shown herself to be a liar and a manipulator who engages in blackmail and threats against those who have something she wants in order to leverage them into benefitting her. The closest she has to a nemesis is Zarya, who strikes an immediate contrast by being a muscular, straightforward frontline fighter who is explicitly motivated by a desire to protect others and her homeland.</li><li> Doomfist: <strong>Pride</strong> and <strong>Wrath.</strong> Having cultivated himself through violence, Akande Ogundimu views war and conflict as the world's ideal state in order to allow the strong to thrive and the weak to be culled. As one of Talon's inner circle, he is one of the most powerful and influential characters seen thus far, and his considerable resources leave him with all the means necessary to make his ideal a reality with restrained, precise fury. He has made little effort in dispatching whatever opposition has come his way, and his return marks an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightOfCerebus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightOfCerebus">indicator</a> that Talon's influence on the global scene is likely to soon become far worse, which his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">demeanor</a> would indicate he knows very well. Aesthetically, his eclectic mix of machine elements and warrior&#146;s markings is unlike anything else exhibited in the cast, distinguishing him from both his dark, Talon compatriots and the bright, more orderly heroes. His brutal, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinist">Social Darwinist</a> philosophy contrasts sharply with the ideals of both Winston, a <em>literal</em> animal who has dedicated his life to the prosperity of mankind through science and peace, and Efi and Orisa, who have dedicated the use of their talents and strengths to defend those who cannot defend themselves.</li><li> Moira: <strong>Pride.</strong> With nobody's approval but her own, she's decided that she alone has the authority and the vision to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilutionaryBiologist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilutionaryBiologist">chart the course</a> for humanity's future, regardless of what it, ethics, or nature<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note59z8mm');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note59z8mm" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note59z8mm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">As per the precepts of biology, evolution does not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoalOrientedEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoalOrientedEvolution">"improve"</a> a species, but rather just helps it adapt and survive in its <em>immediate contemporary surroundings</em>. There is a reason chimpanzees are still around, and that same reason is also why they rarely share a habitat with <em>Homo sapiens</em>. By declaring she knows best, Moira is effectively imposing her own will onto science itself, which just might make her <em>the</em> most prideful character in the whole cast</span> have to say, and she&#146;s perfectly willing to be an accomplice to a warmongering terrorist organization in order to do it. Her behavior exudes a mocking condescension for those around her, and although she does not yet have a direct nemesis among the heroes, she does possess many qualities that make her look like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">dark reflection</a> of Mercy. Both operate as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatMedic">healing support</a> for their respective teams who want what they think is best for humanity, but Mercy's worldview is built around cooperation, selflessness, and peace, and she has organized her own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldAndWhiteAreDivine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldAndWhiteAreDivine">bright attire</a> to carry out this goal almost exclusively to help others at the cost of offense. Meanwhile, Moira has outfitted her own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilWearsBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilWearsBlack">dark attire</a> with just as many means to hurt and harm others as to help, and her own concept of "helping" revolves around holding all of humanity to <em>her</em> twisted ideals. She even stands out compared to the rest of the cast: in this cutting edge cyberpunk world, Moira's appearance, tactics, and mannerisms make her come across like an evil sorceress who would be more at home in a place like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Azeroth</a>.</li><li> Symmetra: <strong>Pride.</strong> She's convinced that her way is the right way and doesn't appear to understand why anyone would willingly resist the changes she wants to bring into peoples' lives, changes she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">genuinely believes</a> are for their own benefit. Her response to anything that challenges her views is to dismiss it as either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourTerroristsAreOurFreedomFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourTerroristsAreOurFreedomFighters">radicalism</a>, ignorance, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessaryEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessaryEvil">necessary</a> for the world's own good; whatever it takes to keep herself convinced that she's in the right. She is the order to L&uacute;cio's chaos, being very terse, clinical and matter-of-fact in her mannerisms and declarations (the announcement for her ultimate? Just a calm, straightforward "Teleporter online.") to contrast his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunPersonified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunPersonified">boisterous</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">enthusiasm</a>. Her sleek and painstakingly ordered corporate attire strikes a chord against his dreadlocked, rollerbladed "urban freedom-fighter" look, which holds true even if you take their optional skins into account, as L&uacute;cio gets a hockey outfit while Symmetra gets a business suit.</li><li> Junkrat: <strong>Lust.</strong> Of the "personal enjoyment at the expense of others" variety. His love for chaos and destruction is unbridled and motivated less by anger or malicious intent and more by the childlike glee it brings out in him. Junkrat doesn't <em>hate</em> you, he just thinks the wanton chaos he leaves in his wake is fun, and he wants to have as much "fun" as possible. And unfortunately for you, he also thinks explosions are fun, and you're standing right where he wants there to be one. He and his partner Roadhog have a (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandDownUnder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandDownUnder">fittingly</a>) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MadMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MadMax">Mad Max</a></em>-style scrapyard aesthetic that immediately distinguishes them from the rest of the more obviously organized civilized cast, and their motivations are rooted more in watching out for their own skins than any kind of mission or ideology.</li><li> Roadhog: <strong>Gluttony.</strong> He's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard">big guy</a>, and considering that the portion of Australia from which he hails is an irradiated, likely resource-strapped wasteland, he probably didn't get that way by sharing. His unique highlight intro from the 2017 Lunar New Year event even shows him in a food coma surrounded by dozens of empty plates. Even outside of his eating habits, he exhibits a very self-centric attitude with voice lines like "what&#146;s mine is mine," and he tends to view Junkrat less like a friend and more like a client. This even extends to gameplay, as he's the only tank class character with no defensive ability that benefits or extends to his teammates (aside from Wrecking Ball); all of his abilities are geared towards helping just himself.</li><li> Ashe: <strong>Pride</strong>. Growing up with only the silent and unquestioningly obedient B.O.B. for company likely taught her to expect the same level of obedience in all of her relationships. And though she cares for her accomplices in the Deadlock Gang, it's clear that her regard is entirely dependent on them following her &#147;my way, and my way <em>only</em>" mentality. Even those who serve her without question can get mistreated; in the epilogue for ''Reunion&#146;, Ashe takes out all her anger on B.O.B. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard">despite the fact that he just saved her life by blocking McCree&#146;s bullets with a traffic sign</a>). This is in sharp contrast to McCree, who, despite now being on the opposite side of his former partners in crime, offers a peaceful compromise before the shootout, defeats them non-lethally, sends them back to their hideout instead of killing or arresting them, and is affable enough throughout the whole conflict to even apologize to B.O.B. for dismantling him. And, considering that she could have been extremely rich for life had she not run away from her wealthy family, all her crimes are likely committed with infamy and self-satisfaction in mind rather than personal gain.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyAquaticLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyAquaticLife">Clingy Aquatic Life</a>: The supplemental web comic <em>Binary</em> starts with Bastion rising out of a pond with a kraken stuck on the side of his head.

Bullets and most abilities are also colored red or blue/white, so you can easily tell if it's either a teammate firing behind you or if it's an enemy flanker.</li><li> Almost all healing abilities have yellow effects, while anti-healing or damaging abilities have purple effects.

Some are able to both support and fight independently (such as Ana, L&uacute;cio, and Zenyatta), but some require directly taking part in combat in order to support the team (such as Moira or Brigitte). Mercy is the closest to a "pure support" there is, but she can whip out her still-effective blaster if she <em>really</em> has to.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComebackMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComebackMechanic">Comeback Mechanic</a>: Overtime.

On the other, she's explicitly part of a specialized military response force slapped together in order to fight a giant robot.<ul><li> Symmetra is about as direct a take on this trope as you can get. She's some type of specialist or infiltrator who operates at the behest of her employer, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Vishkar Corporation.</a></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a>:<ul><li> The Vishkar Corporation mentioned in Symmetra and L&uacute;cio's backstory is slowly revealed to be this trope. They took Symmetra away from her parents when she was revealed to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy">Child Prodigy</a> in light-bending architecture and prevented her from going back so they can use her talents for their own gain, without considering the emotional impact it might have on Symmetra and her family. They also took over L&uacute;cio's poor neighborhood with the promise of improving their way of life, only to impose strict regulations, punishing what they perceived as "lawless behavior", and exploited L&uacute;cio's friends and neighbors as a source of cheap labor. In the comic short "A Better World", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when the people in Brazil oppose the Vishkar Corporation's plans to tear down their homes to make way for one of their buildings, they secretly send agents to blow up and set fire to a Favela in order to force the people to accept their changes, resulting in several civilian casualties and many more wounded</span>.</li><li> In the webcomic "Going Legit", a wealthy CEO hires Junkrat and Roadhog to rescue his workers from Omnic terrorists <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but actually he wanted them to take the fall for an insurance fraud scheme he was doing.

Once Sombra revealed his dealings via hacking, the public was so outraged that they revolted, causing the CEO to step down.

Unfortunately, hope for a brighter tomorrow is meaningless without a dark today, and some days are darker than others.<ul><li> <em>Alive</em> goes out on a pretty bleak note. Mondatta, who only wanted to peacefully spread tolerance and acceptance in a volatile area, is dead, and along with him so are any hopes of peace in the area where he was speaking, which just so happens to be Tracer&#146;s home. Tracer herself is devastated and desperately pleads for just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodCannotComprehendEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodCannotComprehendEvil">an explanation</a> from Widowmaker, the perpetrator, who laughs in her face and escapes, using her grappling hook to throw Tracer into a wall in the process. Tracer ends the short lying defeated and injured in an alley, having suffered likely the most crushing defeat in her life within her own home while Widowmaker walks away completely unharmed and smiling. And as if that weren't enough, later materials such as <em>Masquerade</em> reveal this to all be a calculated move on Talon's part to stoke tensions between humans and omnics into a new world war. The only comforts that can be taken are that Tracer, though beaten, survived and that the whole sordid affair might have indirectly contributed to a more uplifting turn of events in the long run. Talon may have gotten their way for now, but after years of running amok unchecked, murdering a peaceful religious leader in cold blood combined with the assault on Watchpoint: Gibraltar as depicted in <em>Recall</em> may have proven to be the final straw and served as the impetus for Winston to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">galvanize Overwatch's comeback</a>.</li><li> <em>Legacy</em> doesn&#146;t fare any better.

Ana is presumed dead and driven into hiding for years, which, as additional materials expound, snowballs into Reinhardt&#146;s forced retirement and the eventual total collapse of Overwatch itself. Fun times.</li><li> In <em>A Better World</em>, the Vishkar Corporation decides to stop messing around and bombs a favela they had previously been trying to negotiate with over a new construction project. Symmetra is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">shocked</a>, and although she manages to save the young girl she had befriended earlier from the fire, her face is disfigured, and she&#146;s likely lost all of her trust for Symmetra and her company forever. We then skip ahead to the opening ceremony of Vishkar&#146;s new project, with company representatives going on about how it will improve the lives of everyone in the area right in front of an attending crowd of the very survivors displaced by the bombing, including the little girl. It ends with Symmetra looking absolutely miserable while trying to convince herself it&#146;s all for the sake of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">a better world</a>.</li><li> <em>Masquerade</em> serves as this for <em>everything in the main conflict</em> that has happened up until the point of its release. Doomfist's breakout negates everything Winston and Tracer accomplished in the cinematic trailer, and Reaper is revealed to have acquired a substantial amount of information from the Gibraltar terminal, retroactively applying a degree of this to <em>Recall</em> as well. All of the heroes' efforts we've seen are invalidated as Talon regains one of its leaders and sits down to work toward its main goal of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarForFunAndProfit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarForFunAndProfit">plunging the world into a cataclysmic new conflict</a> while Overwatch remains just as broken and disenfranchised as ever. We even get a one-panel flashback that shows us the aforementioned assassination from <em>Alive</em> at a different angle like some kind of "Talon's Greatest Hits" mixtape.</li><li> <em>Retribution</em> has the Blackwatch strike team technically succeed in their objective to avenge their fallen comrades and G&eacute;rard's injuries. But in doing so, they've exposed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyBusiness">Blackwatch</a> to the public and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfAnAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfAnAge">set the stage for Overwatch's decline</a> from the inevitable backlash.

On payload maps especially, it's not entirely uncommon for the defending team to be in an over-extended 6v5 brawl and fail to realize one of their enemies have quietly pushed the payload to the objective until it's too late, a practice nicknamed "back-capping". Even high-division competitive players and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6BHCxlBjRg">professionals can fall victim to this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureHero">Failure Hero</a>: Let's face it: Overwatch has a commendable in-story pedigree, but their on-screen track record has been less-than-stellar. Cumulatively, their efforts have had little to no impact on the greater scope of the conflict, and all of their actions have been either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins">ineffective</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyEndingOverride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyEndingOverride">short-lived</a> in both achieving their own goals and in preventing the villains from achieving theirs. They always try their best, but ultimately Overwatch is still in ruins, its legacy is one of futility, their losses outnumber their gains, Talon has come out ahead in each of their encounters, and its agents have been left broken as shells of who they once were, twisted into outright villainy or struggling just to stay above the rising tide. Examples include:<ul><li> Jack Morrison was unable to keep order even among his close friends as the organization he founded and led collapsed and fell apart. Most of his screentime during this period of his life tends to show him waffling on how to handle a dilemma until someone else effectively decides for him. Meanwhile, he's been reduced in the present to an old, bitter vigilante who is also a wanted criminal, and both times we've seen him in action as Soldier: 76 have ended with his quarry escaping and him not really achieving anything.</li><li> Gabriel Reyes technically achieved his goal to exact retribution on the Talon commander who bombed Blackwatch HQ, but, out of anger, he did so in the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestinationDefenestration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestinationDefenestration">needlessly conspicuous</a> way possible, which gave his team away and turned Venice into a war zone as a simple extraction became a mad scramble for survival. In the process, Blackwatch was exposed to the public and outrage mounted against Overwatch, signaling the beginning of the end for both the organization and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero">own</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">humanity.</a> Which means the dire situation he and everyone else now find themselves in is at least in part due to Reyes being unable to control his temper at the worst possible time.</li><li> Tracer failed to prevent a murder in her own neighborhood, which undid her previous success with resolving the London Uprising, and her only other victory in the cinematic trailer was also undone by the release of Doomfist, whom she along with Genji also failed against during the incident that led to his initial capture.</li><li> McCree basically let the Talon agents have what they came for on the train, even if he did so for the right reasons.</li><li> Ana's hesitation with Widowmaker failed to save either of them and ultimately resulted in the complete ruination of her life, the failure of a mission that likely cost the lives of several hostages and, ultimately, Overwatch's initial collapse (which was due more to its own internal problems than external sabotage).</li><li> Symmetra is more of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a> than a hero, but she's largely sympathetic for the purposes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">A Better World</a></em>, in which she doesn't accomplish anything other than witnessing a disaster, having the image of the people she works for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">shaken</a>, and saving a single girl from a fire, which still leaves her scarred and likely fearful of both her and the company she works for. She ends the comic trying to convince herself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">it's all for the best</a>, but judging from the look on her face, she's failing at that, too.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamedInStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamedInStory">Famed in Story</a>: All of the Overwatch heroes are famous, as evidenced in one animation featuring a museum dedicated to them. However, D.Va and Lucio are also celebrities on top of being heroes. They exchange requests for autographs as their pre-game patter, and Reinhardt will also asks for D.Va's autograph, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveThisFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveThisFriend">for a friend</a>." Their likenesses on products and ads for their works can be seen in several maps and sprays.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">Fanservice</a>: Overwatch is filled to the brim with attractive men and women and does not shy away from emphasizing their aesthetically pleasing qualities in both their default and unlockable outfits.

Her default attire is the most obvious example, consisting of a skin-tight bodysuit with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteCleavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteCleavage">Absolute Cleavage</a>, but she also has her "C&ocirc;te d'Azur" skin, which is basically a two-piece swimsuit with sarong.</li><li> Mercy's default skin emphasizes her bust due to how form-fitting it is, but her "Winged Victory" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotWitch">Witch</a>" skins really dial up the fanservice, drawing attention to the doctor's long legs in particular.</li><li> D.Va also has a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormFittingWardrobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormFittingWardrobe">form-fitting</a> outfits in her wardrobe, including her default skin and the "B.Va" / "Junebug" skins. Her Junker and Scavenger outfits have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareYourMidriff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareYourMidriff">bare midriff</a> and her cat outfit gives her a positively fetishistic black schoolgirl outfit with ponytails. Her Play-of-the Game animations are all sexualized in some form.</li><li> Tracer isn't as blatantly sexualized as some of the others, but she does have a very well-maintained athletic figure that we can observe very nicely through her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintedOnPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintedOnPants">leggings</a>, and one of her victory poses accentuates her backside while her legendary "Sprinter" and "Track and Field" skins put her in tight runner's clothes that show off her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShesGotLegs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShesGotLegs">legs</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareYourMidriff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareYourMidriff">midriff</a>.</li><li> McCree's "Lifeguard" skin, which shows off his pecs and torso.</li><li> Doomfist, who is perpetually topless and very muscular.</li><li> For those in the community who are into older men, Soldier: 76 and Reinhardt both have skins that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilverFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilverFox">remove their headgear</a>, and 76 in particular has a few skins that roll up his sleeves to show off his well-kept forearms, not to mention <em>his</em> 2017 Summer Games skin which gives him the same kind of treatment as McCree.</li><li> Who is the male character with the most squealing fangirls (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim">boys</a>)? Why, it's Genji! Yes, even though he's partly machine, encased in a metallic shell and keeps his face sealed away behind a visor at all times (and the few glimpses we've caught of what's underneath <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredInScars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredInScars">do not offer a pretty sight</a>), he still has a very toned musculature which is defined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormFittingWardrobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormFittingWardrobe">even through his armor</a> and complimented nicely by his graceful body language. His sympathetic backstory and identity as someone earnestly trying to make peace with himself and those around him also go a long way.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a>:<ul><li> Anti-Omnic sentiment is a major theme present in the game's world, bleeding into some heroes to varying degrees, namely Zarya, Torbj&ouml;rn, Junkrat, and Roadhog. King's Row is especially tense about this (with bits of hate graffiti sprayed around), as it was built on Omnic labor and Omnics are still being treated as second-class citizens, not helped by the Uprising event and Null Sector years ago and the assassination of a major Omnic figure in the present.</li><li> The comic short "Going Legit" implies that some people use the excuse of an Omnic threat to cover up their own wrongdoings <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as Junkrat and Roadhog found out</span>.</li><li> In the animated "Hero" teaser (featuring Soldier: 76), a group of thugs are seen assaulting a lone defenseless Omnic, and they try to coerce a young girl who happened to be walking by into joining in.</li><li> In a non-Omnic vein, Reaper constantly mocks Winston for his appearance and refers to him as a "monkey" in a pejorative manner.

Talon wouldn't have become the power they are today, Overwatch would still be around in its glory, and the two of them would still be on the good team, not better known by their new codenames &mdash; Widowmaker and Reaper respectively.</li><li> In a more humorous example, Talon's plot to eliminate all former Overwatch agents for good was foiled all due to one Talon operative making a little mishap.

This enabled Winston to escape, and then defeat the invading Talon forces, including Reaper.

This makes them good for defending against ultimate abilities that deal their damage in a single massive explosion, like Junkrat's Riptire and D.Va's Self-Destruct. The latter does 1000 points of damage to an unprotected target, but if there's even 1 hp worth of barrier in the way, it does nothing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLastOfTheseIsNotLikeTheOthers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLastOfTheseIsNotLikeTheOthers">The Last of These Is Not Like the Others</a>: One of Mei's notes in Ecopoint: Antarctica give three possible guesses as to what's causing the weather anomaly.<div class="indent">What's causing the anomaly? <br>-Global Warming <br>-Unexplained Phenomenon <br>-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys">Aliens!!!</a></div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">Leeroy Jenkins</a>:<ul><li> An unfortunately common practice with many players, referred to by the community as "trickling." Many players' first impulse upon getting killed and respawning is to immediately dive back into the exciting battle alone, instead of waiting to group up with their team for full-on teamfights, usually getting themselves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViciousCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViciousCycle">killed all over again</a> simply due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DividedWeFall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DividedWeFall">numbers disparity.</a></li><li> Bad Reinhardt players can be notorious for this. His skill Charge has a chance to instantly kill someone, but also very easy to miss. It's very often that Reinhardt players forego their role as the team's shield and instead choose to Charge attempting to kill a target, fail, get shot down to death, and then their team members die unprotected.

The ability to turn a random person into an utterly loyal living weapon, and one of the worlds most dangerous people, seems like something that would be useful more than once. The <em>Retribution</em> mode, however, shows that Widowmaker wasn't the first person to undergo the procedure, as the three Elite units (Sniper, Heavy Assault, and especially Assassin) are all brainwashed and programmed as well, though it left them psychotic, laughing mad, and hungry for carnage. Widowmaker is the first 100% successful result of the procedure.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlotNoProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlotNoProblem">No Plot? No Problem!</a>: The game shelves the lore of <em>Overwatch</em> in favor of PVP gameplay, so those wanting to know more about the characters and the world will have to look into the rest of <em>Overwatch</em>'s media to scratch that itch. At the very least, knowing the lore will help shed some light on some of the more specific character interactions that the game provides (such as Soldier and Reaper, or L&uacute;cio and Symmetra).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPoweredCostumedHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPoweredCostumedHero">Non-Powered Costumed Hero</a>: Played with.

D.Va has a slight hint of an accent at times, but mostly speaks with an American accent.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWearingTights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWearingTights">Not Wearing Tights</a>: The characters have yet to explicitly be called superheros, probably because they use guns and have mostly technology-based abilities.

You'd be hard-pressed to find a friendship more unlikely than one between a hyperactive lesbian fighter pilot who's been displaced from her own timeline and an intelligent, talking gorilla scientist from the moon, yet they're remarkably close and have one of the strongest friendships of any two characters in the game.</li><li> Reinhardt is a sexagenarian German body builder who fashions himself as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote">quixotic</a> modern-day knight errant, complete with a suit of armor and a massive hammer, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscoDan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscoDan">his</a> <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

D.Va is a trash-talking Korean teenager whose career is split between being a celebrity gamer and a mech pilot, but they still get along great in-game, with the former outright asking the latter for her autograph.</li><li> Bastion is a traumatized, semi-amnesiac <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot">Killer Robot</a> whose struggle to adapt in a world it finds unfamiliar is aided by its best friend: an ordinary songbird called Ganymede. In-game, it also has a pretty chummy rapport with L&uacute;cio, a bombastic celebrity musician who champions the cause of society's disadvantaged.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffhandBackhand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffhandBackhand">Offhand Backhand</a>: During the firefight between McCree and Ashe's group in <em>Reunion</em>, McCree shoots the sniper omnic without even looking at it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a>: There are two official couples among the main cast: Tracer and her girlfriend, Emily; and Torbj&ouml;rn and his wife, Ingrid. In the past, there was also Ana and Sam (Pharah's father) but it's unclear if they still have feelings for each other.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome">Offscreen Moment of Awesome</a>: A meta example: since the "Play of the Game" kill cam is restricted to the player's viewpoint, for characters with indirect source of damage like Torbj&ouml;rn, their play can consist of, say, their construct getting a triple kill while the cam shows your dead body. Patches have allowed the Play of the Game to use other cameras for a better view of the action, but it still happens sometimes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSoldier">Old Soldier</a>: Most of the founding members of Overwatch are in their 50s and 60s, but still kick ass. And of course, this is Soldier 76's whole shtick.<ul><li> Reinhardt is the largest member of the whole cast (larger than the <em>gorilla and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">Mini-Mecha</a></em>!), wields a gigantic hammer which he can use to let off blasts of fire or cause small-scale tremors, and is capable of taking lots of damage with his "Crusader" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor">Power Armor</a>.

He's 57 years old.</li><li> Soldier: 76, too. Like Reinhardt, Strike-Commander Jack Morrison was one of the members of the original Overwatch team 30 or so years ago during the first Omnic Crisis. Morrison volunteered for the US Soldier Enhancement Program when he was 18 years old, meaning he should be pushing 50 now. Despite that, he's still able to hold his own with the rest of the cast.</li><li> Gabriel Reyes (Reaper) co-founded Overwatch with Jack Morrison and inducted McCree into Blackwatch. He's likely a similar age to Soldier: 76.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMessWithGranny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMessWithGranny">Never Mess with Granny</a>: Ana is the second oldest character behind Reinhardt, being 60 years old as opposed to his 61, and she hasn't aged quite as well as he has either. She's also one of the world's best snipers and was doing combat operations well into her 50s before she lost her eye to Widowmaker, and even that hasn't slowed her down.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOlympics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOlympics">The Olympics</a>: The annual "Summer Games" originally debuted and ran during the same time as the real deal, using a lawyer-friendly Olympics-esque logo and loot that have country flags and sports themes. It also features the Brazilian character L&uacute;cio prominently on the title screen, and a special 3 on 3 brawl mode called L&uacute;cioball, which is basically ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RocketLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RocketLeague">Rocket League</a> with everyone playing as him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">One Steve Limit</a>:<ul><li> Averted via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus">Bilingual Bonus</a>. We have <em>Aleksandra</em> Zaryanova, and from the "Hero" short film, a little girl named Alejandra. Both are female forms of Aleksander (Russian) and Alejandro (Spanish), respectively, and equally related to the Greek name Alexandros. Lampshaded in the "Searching" comic when the two meet.</li><li> Also averted via a gendered variation. There is Gabriel Reyes, now known as Reaper, and the minor/currently unseen character Gabrielle Adawe, who was responsible for the formation of Overwatch.</li><li> Additionally averted by Hana Song, the playable character D.Va, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">Hanna</a>, a minor character in "Dragon Slayer."</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyChildSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyChildSyndrome">Only Child Syndrome</a>: With the exception of Hanzo, Genji and Brigitte, none of the other heroes are mentioned to have any siblings.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness">OOC Is Serious Business</a>: Most characters have a defined personality, so when they act differently from what you'd expect, it's serious.<ul><li> Tracer is normally one of the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">most</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist">upbeat</a> characters, but she takes her commitment to protecting the world <em>very</em> seriously, which tends to be most evident when lives are at stake, especially when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Widow</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller">maker</a> is involved. The most notable examples are the ending of <em>Alive</em>, which shows her visibly overcome with grief upon realizing her failure and reaching her lowest emotional point, and <em>Uprising</em>, in which she gives a short but impassioned speech to Commander Morrison about her reasons for enlisting when she sees nothing being done about the titular uprising in London. Her voiceover that leads into the event proper is a somber overview of what's at stake in which she sounds gravely concerned and anxious to do something.</li><li> Widowmaker herself has a few small but noteworthy moments where her humanity resurfaces from beneath her sadism, such as taking offense to hearing her husband G&eacute;rard be insulted, sighing his name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">upon being revived</a>, and visiting his grave to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasLovedOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasLovedOnes">privately mourn.</a> One of her emotes also has her practice ballet, which she used to perform as a civilian. It's here that we see she has retained some of her former identity and isn't as unfeeling as she appears, at least as far as her own grief is concerned.</li><li> D.Va has a voice line on Eichenwalde and Volskaya Industries where she takes the situation seriously.<div class="indent"> <em>The destruction caused by the omnics here, it reminds me of home.</em></div><ul><li> D.Va's animated short, "Shooting Star," highlights the contrast between her "in-character" gamer celebrity persona, and her "out-of-character" persona, where she obsessively prepares for the next fight, motivated partially by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran">shell-shock</a>.</li></ul></li><li> Reinhardt laments the sacrifice of The Crusaders on Eichenwalde, in a tone that sounds nothing like his normal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">self</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpposingCombatPhilosophies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpposingCombatPhilosophies">Opposing Combat Philosophies</a>: Many of the Heroes have differing approaches to both combat and how to improve the world.<ul><li> Perhaps best demonstrated with Mercy and Reinhardt.

In the time since the release of <em>Recall</em>, it has been referenced primarily through a few background easter eggs and some sparse lines of dialogue. It took seventeen months of real world waiting for <em>Rise and Shine</em> to confirm Mei as the first agent other than Winston or Tracer to acknowledge the recall order, and <em>Honor and Glory</em> added Reinhardt to the list a couple months after that.

For example, when Soldier: 76 uses his ultimate, he says "Tactical Visor activated!" if he's on your team, and "I've got you in my sights!" if he's on the opposing team. The biggest example of this shows with Ana's ultimate callout. Since Nanoboost targets one ally, she has four different ultimate voicelines: Two for the enemy team<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note61q6yt');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note61q6yt" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note61q6yt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the line has a minor pronoun change depending on the gender of the ally targeted</span>, one for her teammates, and another for the specific ally who is being buffed.</li><li> Some characters who aren't native English speakers will say their ultimate lines in their native language - but only if you're either the person playing them or on the opposing team. If you're on their team, they'll say it in English. Hearing a loud line in a non-English language is your cue to get far away from whoever said it as fast as possible. (As some fans put it: "If you hear angry Japanese shouting, run away.")</li></ul></li><li> Every hero produces distinct, unique sounds, and recognizing what heroes are out-of-sight but nearby through sound is an important gameplay element. This is especially highlighted with flankers: Enemy footsteps sound much louder than ally footsteps, and as pointed in the tool-tips, the more dangerous heroes tend to have heavier footsteps. Some heroes can get around this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchAndProne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchAndProne">by crouch-walking to mute their footsteps</a> (Zenyatta just silently floats), but others can't (Roadhog's chain and heavy breathing can still be heard, and D.Va in her mech is incapable of crouching), and knowing who's capable of hiding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithCatlikeTread" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithCatlikeTread">and who isn't</a> is an important thing to learn.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsSlowMotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsSlowMotion">Space Is Slow Motion</a>: In the "Horizon Lunar Colony" map, there's an airlock you can use to leave the colony and explore the surface. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanCanBreatheInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanCanBreatheInSpace">Doing so doesn't cause any actual damage</a>, but it does gradually slow your movement speed to a crawl.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringsSpringsEverywhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringsSpringsEverywhere">Springs, Springs Everywhere</a>: Jump pads were found on Est&aacute;dio das R&atilde;s, a map only played during the temporary L&uacute;cioball brawl, allowing players to boost themselves up to high altitudes (they were also present on Sydney Harbor Arena and Busan Stadium which had different locations, aesthetics, and time of day but were functionally identical). Later on, a single jump pad was made a permanent fixture in the Oasis map, with Blizzard saying it's an element they wish to experiment with, as it has meta-changing potential for several heroes.

Thus, in a real match, it's almost impossible to take into full account exactly how much damage it will take to put down a character, which is why high level players generally opt for "burst" damage, as it has the highest chance of killing a character before they can be healed or protected.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoolPigeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoolPigeon">The Stool Pigeon</a>: Sombra acted as this when she was with the Los Muertos gang.

As pointed out in tooltips, the more dangerous heroes to be flanked by such as Reaper (who wears heavy boots) and Winston (who's a giant gorilla) tend to have louder footsteps to alert their enemies, but this can be negated by crouch-walking (Zenyatta, who simply floats, has no footstep sounds at all, though he should usually use this more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">for getting away rather than setting up ambushes</a>).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfBadass">World of Badass</a>: Goes without saying that the world of <em>Overwatch</em> is populated by badasses, and they come in a variety of different ways.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfHam">World of Ham</a>: Glory be! <em>Overwatch</em> has the heart of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar">Pixar</a> movie and the soul of a comic book, and it revels in its two-fisted inspirations. The presentation all around is deliciously grandiose, with the visuals, sound design, the cast and even the direction, framing and choreography of the story materials all engineered to wrench as much emotion from the characters and the audience as possible. From the young lady who will happily dance and flip her way through a hail of live gunfire on foot while giggling to the old knight who will rally his comrades at the top of his lungs as he roars across the battlefield in his <em>rocket-propelled armor</em>, every character is bombastically over-the-top, and each of them is brought to life through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneySchoolOfActingAndMime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneySchoolOfActingAndMime">lovingly exaggerated, cartoonish animations</a> and some very enthusiastic voice acting. Even the stoic Widowmaker has an air of sinister, breathless melodrama about her, and the ever-tranquil Zenyatta somehow manages to be theatrical about wishing peace of mind upon his friends. The only character who doesn't really mesh is the professional Symmetra, who speaks very clinically and never even raises her voice. On the other hand, you could argue that her fixation with order is so extreme that her dedication to pursuing it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb">comes across as ostentatious in its own right</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">Would Hurt a Child</a>:<ul><li> The Vishkar Corporation wants to bring order to the world, not caring if even children get hurt because it's all done <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeedsOfTheMany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeedsOfTheMany">for the greater good</a>.

Racial animosity is so bad that it has escalated into outright urban warfare on at least one occasion, and the assassination of a prominent peace advocate has caused tensions in the present to once again reach a boiling point. Even disregarding the race issues, the place appears far from accommodating.

However, the changing dialog during subsequent playthroughs can add a great deal of humor. Some examples:<ul><li> The Blackwatch members apparently infiltrated as servants. It turns out that McCree got fired from his cover job because he started sassing a woman.</li><li> Apparently Reyes' original plan for sneaking in was to disguise themselves as the band.</li><li> Reyes can play an instrument, but whatever it is he can't play it well.</li><li> We get to hear McCree try an Italian accent. Moira tells him to never do it again.</li><li> There is one interaction which isn't humorous on its own, but can be pretty funny due to timing. McCree mentions that their intel was a little spotty and Genji says that they could have sent him into spy. However, it is very likely that this interaction plays when the Heavy Assault first shows up, so Genji is bragging about how stealthy he as as he's getting shot at by double machine guns.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">Obvious Rule Patch</a>: On initial release, the mission didn't end until everyone boarded the dropship at the very end, which was unfortunately prone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Griefer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Griefer">griefing</a> as one uncooperative teammate who simply chose not to board it would pointlessly extend the mission, possibly going off alone to fight the endless enemy horde and die, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCannotGoOnWithoutYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCannotGoOnWithoutYou">thus losing everyone the entire game</a>. Blizzard has since made it so those who end up incapacitated are simply left behind, completing the mission.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplayValue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplayValue">Replay Value</a>: As with Uprising, winning more matches of this mode will result in new dialogs between the four.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveConnections" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveConnections">Screw the Rules, I Have Connections!</a>: Antonio tells Blackwatch what was originally stated in the "Retribution" comic: It doesn't matter if he's arrested or imprisoned, because he has deep-rooted connections throughout the government that would get him out in no time.</li><li> <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelDifficultyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelDifficultyDrop">Sequel Difficulty Drop</a>: Compared to Uprising, Retribution is easier, as there are fewer enemies at a time, you only have to worry about your team (instead of having to defend an area/payload), there is no timer either, and enemies don't quite have the firepower of the the Null Sector Bastions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleStrokeBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleStrokeBattle">Single-Stroke Battle</a>: True to form, Genji can have one with enemy assassins when they sprint at each other. Unless the assassin is heavily wounded, she won't be killed, but it will keep her from pouncing on Genji and give the rest of the team a few seconds to finish her off.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a>: The whole mission could serve as one for Gabriel Reyes (Reaper), considering his choice to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JudgeJuryAndExecutioner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JudgeJuryAndExecutioner">execute</a> Antonio in cold blood rather than capture him as per the plan, the fallout of the operation leading to Blackwatch being exposed and the organization taking a big hit to its credibility.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">Tempting Fate</a>:<div class="indent"><strong>Reyes:</strong> It should be smooth sailing from here. <br><em>Heavy Assault shows up</em> <br><strong>McCree:</strong> You just HAD to say it, didn't you? <br><strong>Reyes:</strong> I withdraw my previous comment.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TravelingAtTheSpeedOfPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TravelingAtTheSpeedOfPlot">Traveling at the Speed of Plot</a>: No matter how long the restaurant defence lasts, the Blackwatch aircraft doesn't show up until all the minibosses are defeated.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">Video Game Cruelty Potential</a>: The restaurant at the end is manned by a single omnic waiter.
