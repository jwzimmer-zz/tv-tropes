But then there was fire, and with it disparity: heat and cold, life and death, light and dark. From the dark came the four lords: Nito, the First of the Dead. The Witch of Izalith and her daughters of chaos. Gwyn, the Lord of Sunlight, and his faithful knights. And the Furtive Pygmy, so easily forgotten. Aided by Seath the Scaleless, a traitorous dragon, they brought an end to the dragons, and ushered in a golden age called the Age of Fire. But now the flames are fading. The world suffers through endless nights, and mysterious brands called the Darksign curse humans with eternal undeath. These immortal undead are doomed to eventual madness as they lose their humanity, and thus are locked away in an asylum in the north to await the end of the world.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Players take the role of one of these undead, as they break out of the Undead Asylum and begin a quest through the huge, non-linear world of Lordran to ring the twin Bells of Awakening, prophesied to reveal the fate and true purpose of the undead.</p><p>The game is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionRPG">Action RPG</a> very much like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls">Demon's Souls</a></em>, and reuses many elements, such as the combat, online mechanics, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> difficulty.</p><p>The game was released for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3">PlayStation 3</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XBox360" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XBox360">Xbox 360</a> on September 22, 2011 in Japan and October 4 and 6, 2011 in North America and Europe.

While standing up.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">Anti-Frustration Features</a>:<ul><li> Accidentally made an NPC hostile towards you? Pay Oswald of Carim a visit so he can absolve your sins and make said NPCs peaceful again. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">Unless you make Oswald hostile as well</a>, in which case you'll have to wait until your next playthrough.)</li><li> Certain enemies in the game have especially rare and valuable drops. However, not all of these enemies respawn. The way to counter this is that any enemy of which there is a finite amount in the game will <em>always</em> have the very last one drop whatever you haven't gotten from the others yet, so you won't need to go through another playthrough.</li><li> Fell off a ledge into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit">Bottomless Pit</a>? Thankfully, you'll still have a bloodstain, near the location you fell from.</li><li> The Ring of Favor and Protection gives quite a few powerful bonuses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse">at the expense of breaking should you ever remove it</a>. Trying to switch it out causes a pop-up window to appear, warning that it will break and thus preventing players from ever accidentally removing it.</li><li> If you defeat the Four Kings prior to obtaining the Lordvessel, you can still warp out of the Abyss using its bonfire.</li><li> There are two spots in the world where a player could get stuck (without going out of their way to break things). So in the very rare event that you get stuck and also are out of teleport items? You can still rub your Darksign to kill yourself and get out.</li><li> <em>Remastered</em>, while largely just a release with better graphics, did add a few of these. Among them, the ability to switch covenants at a bonfire, the ability to hold the cycle inventory button to go back to the first item like in <em>Dark Souls 3</em>, and the password system to make summoning your friends easier.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiGrinding">Anti-Grinding</a>: While the campaign itself doesn't punish grinding, raising your level leaves you vulnerable to being invaded by higher-level black phantoms. If you raise your level too high in the earlier areas, you'll likely end up regularly being invaded by hostile players equipped with powerful weapons and armor <em>way</em> above anything you have access to at that point. A similar punishment is that if you raise your level too high compared to the average level range for an area, you'll have a harder time finding players you can summon to help you. If you go too high, it might become near impossible to find other players.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a>: The game as a whole lacks a real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, but it still has villainous characters.<ul><li> Seath the Scaleless for much of the main game. He's certainly the most openly villainous of the bosses you face in the main game, being directly responsible for many of the various abominations you fight as well as kidnapping people to be experimented on. And unlike most other bosses in the game, he's fully lucid and in control of his own actions, though he has apparently gone mad.</li><li> Manus, Father of the Abyss for the DLC content, who is responsible for the corruption of Artorias and the fall of Oolacile. Though you kill him thousands of years before the main game, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousLegacy">he casts a long shadow over the rest of the series</a>, with the main villain of <em>Dark Souls 2</em> being one of his descendants.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtCourse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtCourse">Art Course</a>: The Painted World of Ariamis is one of the optional areas of the game. It is an entire world hidden inside a painting in the Royal Palace of Anor Londo. It manifests in the form of the dilapidated ruins of a castle covered in snow, made to be a cold, dark, but comforting place where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IslandOfMisfitEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IslandOfMisfitEverything">things that don't belong anywhere else can find respite</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Artificial Stupidity</a>: This shows up from time to time, especially in areas with precarious footing like Blighttown. You'll be travelling along when you'll randomly gain souls from some enemy that accidentally fell off a ledge to its death.<ul><li> Likewise, in some areas, it's easy to cheese an enemy into a spot where it will walk endlessly, allowing you to whale on them with impunity.</li><li> Sif is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a>, and constantly repositions himself around the map by jumping. Occasionally, he'll jump on top of you, one of the few safe places in a fight against him, and allow you to attack his legs before hopping away.</li><li> Rats in particular seem to have bugged attack priorities, where they'll often simply run away from the player, even when they outnumber you greatly and are almost always placed in corners they'll run against fruitlessly. It takes a few seconds for them to turn around, in which time you will have ample opportunity to kill them. This is particularly noticeable in the Painted World, where you can easily walk through swarms of rats with no problem.</li><li> One of the best ways to grind souls in the early game involves taking advantage of this with the NPCs just past the gate in Darkroot Garden. They are far too tough to take on at early levels, but if you stand in just the right spot on a certain ledge, they will try to jump down to you, bounce off your head, and fall straight off the cliff, granting you 1000-2000 souls a pop.</li><li> Special mention goes to the bat-winged demons of Anor Londo. Despite having a fierce thrusting attack, their evasive maneuver will often send them plunging backward to their deaths.

The fact that the majority of special weapons simply cannot be buffed with resins or spells at all makes them even worse. While special gear will usually be stronger if you're not bothering to upgrade or buff your equipment, once you do, you'll <em>always</em> get better damage/protection for weight out of ordinary stuff like the Zweihander or the Ragged Set than you will out of fancy gear like the Dragonslayer Spear or the Lord's Blade Set.</li><li> The combination of a spear and a good, stout, medium shield.

You can farm it if you're good enough, but the fight can be difficult without being knocked off the bridge by the creature.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoulderBludgeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoulderBludgeon">Boulder Bludgeon</a>: The giant round boulder-wielding Infested Barbarians are much more dangerous than the regular club-wielding kind, thanks to their extended move set, which includes slamming you (repeatedly) into the ground with the boulder, charging you from a distance by rolling the boulder in front of them, or just throwing their boulder at you from range (and immediately summoning another one into their hands).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathWeapon">Breath Weapon</a>: Several enemies, such as the Gargoyles and Seath the Scaleless.

No words are shared between you and her, you just enter her arena and she proceeds to attack and try to kill you. However, if you then talk to her sister with the Old Witch's Ring equipped, you find that she thinks you are her sister. Also, the reason Quelaag attacked was to try and steal humanity from you in order to provide comfort to her agonizing sister. Knowing this can make subsequent playthroughs a bit heartbreaking, knowing she's just trying to save her sister from her pain and yet you have to kill her anyway, all the while her sister has <em>no</em> clue that Quelaag has died. Granted, you <em>can</em> sorta atone for this by joining the Chaos Servant covenant and giving her as much humanity as you possibly can.</li><li> If you manage to complete the DLC before visiting Artorias' grave in Darkroot Garden, then entering the boss arena will have Great Gray Wolf Sif actually recognize you as the brave hero who saved his life in the past, and he howls mournfully before taking up his master's sword as he is bound to protect it from <em>anyone</em>... including you. A rare case of this trope applying not only to the player, but to the boss as well.</li><li> A very aggravating example of this is when you make it to the Duke's Archives. You fight through a handful of rooms with multiple dangers, including Channelers and the especially dangerous Undead Crystal Soldiers, and make it to the boss room...only to discover that you cannot damage Seath at all, due to his immortality and immunity to attacks as a result of the Primordial Crystal, which is elsewhere. This is required, however, as you have to die here to be placed in the cells elsewhere in the Archives...which means all the souls you gathered prior to this point are in danger of being lost, as the cells are a <em>long</em> way away from this room. Better hope you still have a Ring of Sacrifice on hand...or better yet, a Rare Ring of Sacrifice just in case the Curse kills you first.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallToAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallToAdventure">Call to Adventure</a>: Having a dead body dumped into your prison cell and meeting the knight who dumped it as he lays dying kind of sets the mood.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanisMajor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanisMajor">Canis Major</a>: <a class="urllink" href="http://i123.photobucket.com/albums/o312/oracrest/Dark%20Souls/14-noscale.jpg">Great Grey Wolf Sif<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> is just as intimidating as the more gruesome monsters.

Twice!</span> He also uses one of the most low-risk builds in the game, carrying a greatshield and a spear so that he can poke at you while hiding behind his shield, putting himself in minimal danger in battle.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">Disc-One Nuke</a>: There are several powerful weapons available early on in the game if you know the special conditions required for obtaining them.<ul><li> The Drake Sword is the most famous because of how easy (if somewhat time consumingly) obtained it is for new players via buying a bow and about 50 cheap arrows in Undeadburg, then shooting off the Bridge Wyvern's tail from the complete safety of standing <em>under</em> said bridge. It doesn't scale with stats or get much from upgrades (which it needed rare Dragon Scales to do), and requires 16 Strength to wield, but it's still a 200 damage one hander that can carry the player pretty far. It even has a ranged attack! Its only downside, besides the not scaling, is its moveset - all swings, no thrusts. Makes it annoying to use in cramped quarters.</li><li> If a player starts with the Master Key and spends their souls to level up appropriately they can start Undead Burg with the Astora's Straight Sword, a weapon that does about 180 damage when using it at the lowest level possible (compared to the 80ish damage from the usual starting weapons) and the Dragon Crest Shield, which blocks 100% of physical damage, is really good against fire damage and has fairly high stability, especially for a starting shield. That is, if they don't mind either doing a suicide run to steal treasure from an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dracolich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dracolich">undead dragon</a> that can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">one shot</a> them, or spamming it with arrows from a fair distance. This is a good alternative to the Drake Sword because the damage from Astora's Straight Sword scales with your stats, and you're prepared to go into the Catacombs if need be. Especially good for starting up a Faith build, since it only needs 14 Faith plus the usual 10 Str and 10 Dex to wield, something that most of the starting classes can get in about 6 levels or less.</li><li> Players that don't start with the Master Key can get the Uchigatana relatively easily in the Undead Burg by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> attacking the Undead Merchant</span>. This weapon inflicts bleed build up for massive damage and has an enormous reach (unlike the daggers that inflict bleed). It also scales with Dexterity and doesn't require the investment of stats that Astora's Straight Sword does. Be careful, though, as it has low durability and so must be repaired often to prevent from breaking.</li><li> Starting as a Pyromancer gives you access to the equivalent of a regenerating pile of firebombs to throw at enemies. It's a while before you can find and rescue the first pyromancy trainer, but just starting out you'll be able to waste small groups of zombies in one hit or seriously damage Black Knights at a distance (provided you keep dodging their counterattacks). Killing Black Knights often gets you powerful weapons and armor so one Disc One Nuke can lead to another and another.</li><li> The Black Knight Sword, especially post Patch 1.5 where the drop rate was significantly increased, meaning players can very possibly get the weapon from one of the three early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniBoss">nonrespawning Black Knights.</a> The stat requirements are comparatively high (20 Strength, 18 Dexterity), but easily attainable. While the weapon only has mediocre scaling, its base damage makes it very powerful throughout the entirety of the first playthrough and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, and it is extremely easy to fully upgrade (easily possible to do so before ringing the Second Bell of Awakening). It also has a very good, versatile move set with both wide sweeping attacks for attacking multiple enemies and a nice vertical combo when fighting a single opponent/tight areas. All black knight weapons also have a hidden stat that deals bonus damage against anything classified as a "demon," including the very tough titanite demons.</li><li> Speaking of Black Knights, there's also a single chance of getting the Black Knight Greatsword from the non-respawning one in Undead Parish. Actually obtaining it requires some considerable favor from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">Random Number God</a>, but should you luck out and invest the stats to use it (32 Strength and 18 Dexterity, or just 22 Strength if you two-hand it), you have a weapon that, once fully upgraded (like the Black Knight Sword, it upgrades with Twinkling Titanite so you can max it out fairly early) is literally capable of defeating <em>the Capra Demon</em> in two swings, and virtually every basic enemy you encounter in one. With the proper build, the Black Knight Sword is quite able to carry any player through the entire game.</li><li> If one starts with the Master Key it is possible to get to the Darkroot Basin from Firelink Shrine, where there is a Black Knight that has a chance of dropping the Black Knight Halberd. Killing the knight can prove a bit difficult with weak gear but it is entirely possible to backstab him off the cliff for an easy kill. The Halberd is not only the strongest Black Knight weapon (much more powerful than the sword), it is arguably the strongest PVE (player versus AI/enemy) weapon in the game. Its moveset is not particularly good, but it has pretty great reach and absolutely insane damage. Its requirements are much higher than most of the other Disc One Nukes (32 Strength and 18 Dexterity), but if you forgo a shield and two-hand the weapon, only 22 strength is required. If you begin the game as a warrior, you only need 14 levels to be able to use the weapon, which can take a little bit of time, but it's well worth the investment because the Halberd make every single boss in NG a joke.</li><li> Another extremely powerful weapon that a player can get from the very start is the Gravelord Sword, one of the rewards for joining Nito's covenant. It takes some smooth moves and some tricky jumps. You'll have to dodge several skeletons and make an almost fatal leap of faith, including dodging the attacks of a giant demon that can one-shot you in order to grab the items that will let you join the covenant. But, your prize is a sword that can last you the entire game, even into NG+.</li><li> Speaking of the graveyard, bum-rushing it, avoiding the skeletons, and getting to the end of it grants you the Zweihander. If you have the right strength/dexterity combo to wield it, it's generally considered one of the better <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">greatswords</a> out there, it takes down any enemy early on in a single hit, it hits like a truck against bosses (especially with a plunging strike), and it can last you the entire game potentially (especially with that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gamebreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gamebreaker">Gamebreaker</a> build with the shock enchantment).</li><li> Yet another extremely powerful weapon that a player can get from the very start is the Titanite Catch Pole, a rare drop from the non-respawning Titanite Demons in the Catacombs or Undead Parish. If you do get it, you have a lightweight halberd that has a very low stat requirement, deals both physical and magic damage, and upgrades with Twinkling Titanites. The fact that it deals magic damage allows you to hit enemies through their metal shields. At higher levels (40 Strength and 30 Dexterity), it becomes a tool primarily for dealing riposte damage (882 damage), surpassing the Black Knight Great Axe (862 damage).</li><li> The Zwei and GLS are great for builds which use strength, but for dexterity characters, the Great Scythe is located on the same Catacombs shortcut as the GLS and is actually found before it, meaning that while you do have to dodge some fireballs and kick a few skeletons into the chasms, you don't have to make the jump or get past the powerful demon.</li><li> Dumping your first few levels into Faith, along with some clever dodging, can allow you to completely ignore the Hellkite Dragon and join the Warrior of Sunlight covenant immediately after beating the Taurus Demon. The player gets the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">Lightning Spear miracle</a> from this. Along with being a spell that can be obtained rather early, it decimates bosses up to the mid-game and can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> most standard enemies. Investing some more points into faith and helping other players in co-op also ranks you up in the covenant, earning you an improved version of the miracle. Unfortunately, both have a low amount of charges, making them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse">Too Awesome to Use</a> if you're not certain about finding nearby bonfire locations.</li><li> A lesser example, but the absolute easiest weapon to get early on is the Estoc, which you can find on a corpse just sitting out in the open in the first part of the New Londo Ruins area. Literally all you have to do to get it after you arrive at Firelink Shrine is run down to the elevator, travel down to the Ruins and go pick it up- the only enemies between you and it are a bunch of hapless Hollows more concerned with bemoaning their fate than attacking you. The Estoc is the largest thrusting sword, meaning you can use it to stab from behind a raised shield, it has very modest stat requirements to use one-handed (10 strength and 12 dexterity), and it has the longest reach of all the thrusting swords, allowing you to skewer early game enemies with ease using its two-handed stabbing attacks.</li><li> The blacksmith in New Londo Ruins sells a Soul Arrow, a Heavy Soul Arrow, and Wooden Catalysts. With some grinding and soul items, any build has access to some sorcery to lay waste to enemies from a safe distance. With sorcerers, this effectively triples their magic damage output right from the start. And with the Master Key, a sorcerer has more than enough spells to take out the Zombie Dragon and grab the powerful goodies it was guarding.</li><li> The biggest of all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">BFS</a>, the absolutely monstrous Dragon Greatsword, is obtained by traveling to the very far end of the very ground floor of the world and attacking the last of the Everlasting Dragons... but with the Master Key, you can do that within ten minutes of getting to Lordran, before fighting a single enemy. (Amassing the strength and stamina to <em>use</em> it is another story, but.)</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalWeapon">Crystal Straight Sword and Crystal Greatsword</a> play this trope straight. You can obtain these weapons once you meet Domnhall in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySpaciousSewer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySpaciousSewer">Depths</a>, sold for 4000 Souls - that's all you need to do to obtain them, and you can buy them in bulk. Their high power for their weight and requirements make them very appealing as boss-slayers for the next few areas, but they also cannot be repaired or upgraded at all. The further you make it through a playthrough, the more they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp">start to get outclassed by other weapons you've invested more resources in</a>, and they may even be outclassed from the start if you've found yourself one of the other examples.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressedDamsel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressedDamsel">Distressed Damsel</a>: The rescue Rhea arc after she gets <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">betrayed in the Tomb of Giants</span>.

Way of White and Princess's Guard in particular are generally considered absolutely useless- the only thing you get for joining the Princess's Guard is the right to use a pair of special healing miracles, which you don't even earn by advancing in the covenant as it has no ranks, and a useless ring, while Way of White gives you basically nothing except slightly higher co-op priority. While Chaos Servant is popular, it's also extremely limited as it's the only PvE-exclusive covenant, meaning you only use it for one part of the game to take advantage of its rewards (two powerful pyromancies that you can continue to use even after leaving the covenant, and a useful shortcut), then have no reason to remain in it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">Fake Difficulty</a>: Usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averted</a>; one of the game's main selling points is that it's hard but fair.

In some cases, this is presumably to stop them from harming people should they turn Hollow &#151; however, Petrus (when initially spoken to) doesn't seem too keen on the player for being Undead and requests that the player keep their distance, and some of the game's cut content outright states that the Way of White admonishes the Undead. This doesn't come up much in the rest of the game, as the majority of the cast is Undead.<ul><li> Humans in general get a lot of grief from the native inhabitants of Lordran.

This does <em>not</em> limit your later development in any way and you can potentially take up any role regardless of your starting class choice, but keep in mind that some classes are optimal towards a certain style of play:<ul><li> Warrior: The Warrior is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> &#151; starts with excellent armour and a metal shield, and with a good longsword and high enough stats to use many of the other better weapons immediately, and they have decent mobility to boot. Magic stats are relatively low to start, but with some patient investment basic spells and miracles can become an option later. A superb choice for a new player or otherwise an optimal choice for a player who wants to focus on physical combat.</li><li> Knight: This is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> class, the most durable of all starting classes with the most robust armour and highest starting Poise and Vitality, and will soon be casting miracles due to their rather high Faith. However the heavy plate armour also makes the Knight slow and limits how they can evade attacks. The Knight is a very forgiving class for mistakes and thus perhaps the best choice for a new player to learn the game.</li><li> Wanderer: The Wanderer's scimitar has excellent reach and speed and their light armour allows quick rolling and evasion, and they can pick up sorceries quite quickly as well to become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a>. However they cannot take as much punishment as the other "physical" classes. A relatively forgiving class to start with, but still, watch yourself.</li><li> Thief: A relatively challenging start as the Thief is a bona-fide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a>, the Wanderer taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> &#151; generally poor physical stats (except Dexterity which is very high) and limited to lighter weapons and armour due to low Strength, forcing them to rely on parrying and backstabs with their dagger to deal effective damage. The Thief starts with the Master Key gift as standard, so take another gift; two Master Keys is a waste.</li><li> Bandit: The Bandit hits really hard and is proficient with many heavier weapons like axes and swords, but their starting axe is already powerful enough to carry you through half the game. That said the armour and shield are nothing to write home about. The high Strength of the Bandit is also converse to a low Dexterity, and magic potential is also very poor. A decent choice for an intermediate player and an optimal physical combatant.</li><li> Hunter: The Hunter has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">fairly average stats all-round</a> and high Dexterity, proficient at melee or range with bows and lighter weapons. Use the bow to "kite" and soften up enemies before you close, ducking in and out and striking true with the shortsword. A versatile class that relies on tactical thinking and weakness exploitation to make up for a lack of raw power, this one is for intermediate players.</li><li> Sorcerer: Magic is the Sorcerer's bread and butter; they start with the Soul Arrow sorcery and can pick up sorceries very quickly. They have fantastic damage potential and can command a lot of useful magical effects eventually, but their limited physical stats and lack of armour will make them poor fighters and thus very easy to die in direct combat, so perhaps this is a choice best left to experienced players.</li><li> Pyromancer: The Pyromancer starts with a decent axe and the Fireball pyromancy, giving them a reliable way to deal with tough bosses and groups early on. Though poorly armoured, they are quite resistant to fire and poison. As pyromancy scales with upgrades to your Pyromancy Flame and not your stats, you can allocate points into physical areas and be a decent fighter as well. Overall a beginner-friendly start offering a lot of offensive power.</li><li> Cleric: Clerics can use miracles, a slew of defensive and support magic which makes a difference in keeping a run between bonfires going, and they can hit fairly hard with their maces and hammers as well, but they start with only robes and a wooden shield.

Granted, the Undead Burg has been abandoned as a city for a long time but the different in luxury enjoyed by the gods compared to their subjects was extremely vast.<ul><li> Even among the lower stata of undead society, there is a great deal of disparity. From the Undead Burg, you descend to dilapidated slums housing a criminal underclass, and from there to the Depths where those banished from the Undead Burg dwell. And then it's on to Blighttown where even the cursed occupants of the Depths would fear to tread.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell">Useless Useful Spell</a>: A lot of the Sorceries, Miracles and Pyromancies are interesting, but ultimately worthless due to a variety of flaws.<ul><li> Undead Rapport is a Pyromancy that turns undead enemies to your side for a while. Unfortunately it has to be cast from such close range that you could spit in their face and it has a slow cast time, so it's almost impossible to actually use without being hit.</li><li> Acid Surge projects a cloud of acid fog that degrades the equipment of anyone caught within it. Unfortunately, this is completely worthless in PvE, and even in PvP the effect is so miniscule (it only does 8 points of equipment damage, when most equipment has between 200 and 400 durability on average) that it'll basically never do <em>anything.</em> It DOES actually work effectively against opponents using crystal katanas (katanas have low durability to start with, and converting them to crystal reduces this further to 10% of normal in exchange for monumental damage)... except there's no way of knowing whether that opponent's katana is crystal or not just by looking at it.</li><li> The Poison Cloud Pyromancy is more useful than Acid Surge at least, but even in PvP poison just isn't that effective, not to mention the fact that even trying to cast it can make you very vulnerable if your opponent just charges through the cloud and hacks you down. Toxic Cloud is <em>marginally</em> more effective, but still not very popular, especially as it's not hard to avoid, yet only comes with <em>a single cast</em>.</li><li> The Iron Flesh Pyromancy used to be a <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>- until the developers nerfed it <em>savagely</em> hard. Now while it's active you move as if you're encumbered (over 100% encumberance level), meaning you plod around like a statue and literally cannot backstep or roll at all. While it still gives your body automatic deflection, it doesn't boost your actual defence even <em>nearly</em> enough to make up for how easily opponents (in PvE or PvP) will absolutely run rings around you. You can't cancel it until it wears off on its own, either.</li><li> A lot of Sorceries and Miracles replicate the effects of fairly common or easy to find items (e.g Remedy heals Poison, Toxic and Bleed buildup, Homeward warps you back to your last bonfire just like a Homeward Bone, Hush silences your footsteps like the Slumbering Dragoncrest Ring). Since one of the biggest restrictions on magic use is the number of slots you have available to equip spells in, these are generally extremely difficult to justify using.<ul><li> Undoubtedly the worst of these is the Resist Curse sorcery. Contrary to its name, it doesn't grant you Curse resistance (which might be <em>slightly</em> useful), nor does it actually cure Curse once it's been inflicted on you (which kills you instantly then locks you in Hollow form with 50% of your health reduced until you cure it). No, what it does it remove the buildup of Curse you've accumulated before it becomes fatal. Since status condition buildup fades over time as long as you're not receiving more of it, the only way this would be any use is if you stop to cast it <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">while you're actually in a fight against a Curse-causing opponent</a></em> (like Seath the Scaleless or a pack of Basilisks).
