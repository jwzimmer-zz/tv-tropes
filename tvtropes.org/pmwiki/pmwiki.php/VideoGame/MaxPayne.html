Three years later, Max has transferred to the DEA and gone undercover with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">Punchinello crime family</a>, intending to bring the Valkyr drug ring down once and for all. Then one night, as New York settles into the worst snowstorm in decades, Max's partner is murdered, Max is framed for it, and his cover is blown. With the police hot on his trail, Max wages a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">one-man war</a> on the mafia and a shady corporation, killing everyone in his way as he gradually unearths the truth behind the creation of Valkyr and the death of his family.</p><p>This 2001 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdPersonShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdPersonShooter">Third-Person Shooter</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RemedyEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RemedyEntertainment">Remedy Entertainment</a> was an attempt to break video games into an untapped genre, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir">Film Noir</a>. A mixture of both the film and graphic novel treatments of noir, it featured such stalwart elements of the genre as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardboiledDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardboiledDetective">hard-boiled cynical hero</a>, the capable and mysterious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale">Femme Fatale</a>, and the complex plot with myriad linear and tangential echelons of villains, all played under a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateEyeMonologue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateEyeMonologue">gravel-voiced narration</a> laden with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GothicHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GothicHorror">gothic imagery</a> and twisted arthouse metaphors. There are even a number of references to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a>. The cutscenes were told in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GraphicNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GraphicNovel">Graphic Novel</a> form, made by photographing the scenes and altering them digitally to resemble watercolor drawings.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The game's biggest selling point, however, was the use of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix">Matrix</a></em>-style <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime">Bullet Time</a> (despite the game being in the works before the movie came out), which allowed the players to slow down key points of the game while letting them aim and react as usual. This gave Max an edge over the bad guys as well as looking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">darn cool</a>, especially since the game was one of the first to use projectile modeling for each and every bullet rather than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hitscan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hitscan">hitscan</a> technique. Slowing down time slowed down the bullets as well, letting you see every bullet you dodge. The game also impressed with its highly interactive environments, deep soundscape, and interesting aspects of gameplay such as playable dream sequences.</p><p><em>Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne</em> came out in 2003, in which Max investigates a highly organized and well-funded group of assassins who are wiping out the powerful syndicate The Inner Circle, while becoming entangled with the Circle's possibly-trustworthy-who-knows hitwoman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Mona Sax</a>. This second featured better physics and graphics, actual in-engine cutscenes with new animation beyond the standard AI movements, more varied gameplay (including having Mona appear as a playable character for several chapters), and an <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzsiE44Lz_w">original song<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> by the newly-formed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PoetsOfTheFall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PoetsOfTheFall">Poets of the Fall</a>. It also rewarded patient players with several additional stories they could choose to watch; if Max stopped at the various televisions scattered around the game, he could catch the latest episode of the obnoxious animated series <em>Captain Baseball Bat Boy</em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfParody">self-mocking</a> cop show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blaxploitation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blaxploitation">Dick Justice</a></em>, the amusing period soap <em>Lords and Ladies</em> or the surprisingly creepy, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks">Twin Peaks</a></em>-like psychodrama <em>Address Unknown</em>, all of which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalBallScheduling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalBallScheduling">seemed to revolve around Max's life somehow</a>.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Due to a combination of <em>Max Payne 2</em> selling poorly and Remedy getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">bogged down</a> working on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlanWake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlanWake">Alan Wake</a></em>, it took eight years for <em>Max Payne 3</em> to be developed and released in 2012. It was developed entirely by Rockstar, with no design work but constant feedback from Remedy. Set eight years after the end of <em>Max Payne 2</em>, the third game finds Max, still unable to get over the death of his wife and child, continuing to drown his sorrows with painkillers and booze in Hoboken, New Jersey. Approached by academy buddy Raul Passos, Max is offered a fresh start as a private security guard for the wealthy Branco family in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaoPaulo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaoPaulo">S&atilde;o Paulo</a>, Brazil. Unfortunately, he hardly gets started when a band of favela <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangBangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangBangers">Gang Bangers</a> try to kidnap patriarch Rodrigo, before successfully capturing and ransoming the employer's young wife, requiring Max to set out to get her back. However, things get complicated fast by paramilitary extremists hostile to both sides, and what's the deal with the infamously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality">Brutal Military Police</a> special forces? As things go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">From Bad to Worse</a>, Max has to kick his addictions, sober up, and pick up the thread before it's too late for his charge.</p><p><em>Max Payne 3</em> received quite favorable reviews from critics and fans, though it didn't sell quite as well as expected. Early reports indicated it was doing well despite being released on the same day as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII">Diablo III</a></em>, but it was later indicated that it had underperformed in brick-and-mortar sales. This doesn't account for direct-download purchases on Steam and elsewhere, though, so it can be assumed that the game has been at least a mild success if not the overwhelming one that Rockstar had hoped for.</p><p>As a promotional effort for the third game, three short digital comics were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip">slowly released</a>. The comics are in order, <em>After the Fall</em>, <em>Hoboken Blues,</em> and <em>Fight and Flight</em>. The comics are published by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a>, co-written by Rockstar's Dan Houser and Max's creator Sam Lake, and deal with Max's early life, his courtship of his wife Michelle, the aftermath of the second game, and the period between the second and third games.</p><p>A movie based on the characters was released in 2008 to poor critical reception, but modest commercial success.

We get the answer in Chapter 4, when control is switched to Mona: as she moves along she gets Max's "hardcore professionals" comment, which immediate precedes her opening a door to watching some cleaners standing around laughing as one of them is prancing around and strutting it like a runway model.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">Broken Bird</a>: Mona Sax.

With all of these horrible events happening to him and Max refusing to get any help aside from becoming a barely-functioning drug addict and alcoholic, who shuts everyone out of his life and dives deeply into work, whether or not he was stable enough to be working in the first place, he becomes a reminder that depression does not go away without a fight, drugs and self-pity do not replace professional therapy, and that being Max Payne would <em>suck so much</em>; it is a miracle he hasn't contemplated suicide at all during all this.</li><li> In the second game, reality ensued all over <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">poor Vinnie</a>, a mob lieutenant with more enemies than friends and such an incurable fanboy for a cartoon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero">Kid Hero</a> that he'll cosplay without hesitation.

It is also likely to do with Max's worldview becoming considerably more tainted and jaded after <em>2</em> (Rockstar was playing with the idea of changing the actor to give Max an older and more world-weary tone).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalDissonance">Vocal Dissonance</a>: Max's voice <em>really</em> doesn't fit the facial expressions Sam Lake uses in the first game.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVoice">The Voice</a>: Vinnie's boss in 2.

One level and probably a few off-screen painkillers later, and he's fine.</li><li> More to the definition of the trope, the third game features health regeneration in both modes. It is featured in single-player in a limited fashion (it kicks in, at least on hard and below, when more than 80% damage is taken, and regenerates only up to that point), while multiplayer has full health regeneration, with the speed of regeneration inversely proportional to the weight of your character's loadout.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasntThatFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasntThatFun">Wasn't That Fun?</a>: Subverted in <em>Max Payne 2</em>.

The story is set during the worst blizzard in the history of New York, which parallels the Fimbulwinter that starts off Ragnarok. It begins with the murder of Alex Balder, who represents Baldr. Jack Lupino explicitly identifies himself as the Fenris Wolf at one point, and runs a club <em>called</em> Ragna Rock. Alfred Woden (Odin), a one-eyed and secretive man who apparently knows all the secrets in the world, dispatches the lone mortal hero against the forces of the duplicitous Nicole Horne, who has already ensured the deaths of everyone in Woden's circle except himself. The drug Valkyr is also a reference to Valkyries, who transport the dead to the afterlife.</li><li> The second game includes a number of references to <em>Paradise Lost</em> and <em>Genesis,</em> with Vlad representing the serpent/Satan, Woden representing God and Max &amp; Mona representing Adam &amp; Eve. The final level includes wall art depicting the Garden of Eden.</li><li> The third game, amusingly, is filled with symbolism of Max's drugged up state (appearing as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintingTheMedium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintingTheMedium">video game "glitches", oddly placed stark lens flares, and television static</a>). It's just not mythological in any way. There's also a lot of cultural symbolism, though that might be easier to pick up for someone familiar with the area.</li><li> The third game also has the moment where Max is visiting his family's grave and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">gets attacked by a bunch of italian mobsters who want revenge on him. The first thing he does? Take cover behind his wife and daughter's grave which is then shot to bits as it offers him protection, something that Michelle and Rose have been doing for Max through out the entire franchise.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldntHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldntHitAGirl">Wouldn't Hit a Girl</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith">Played With</a>.
