Taking place in the Second Era roughly 1,000 years before the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a></em>, you play as a hero attempting to stop the Daedric Prince <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Molag Bal</a> from taking over Tamriel and recovering your soul that was taken by him. Things are also complicated by the fact that the Imperial throne has sided with the evil Prince, and now Tamriel is in an all-out war between Cyrodiil and three alliances vying for control of it.</p><p>It was released on April 4th, 2014 for Mac and PC (with a 3-to-5-day early start for preorders), with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PS4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PS4">PS4</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XBoxOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XBoxOne">Xbox One</a> versions set for a June 9, 2015 release date. On March 17, 2015, the payment model changed to only require the initial purchase, with an optional premium account system offered as well.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>When playing the game, you must choose one out of three alliances; unless you have a special account upgrade, the alliance depends on which race you choose. However, after the "One Tamriel" update, the alliance chosen no longer is a big deal outside of Cyrodiil, and you can move to another alliance's starter zone to do its story arcs instead. Races, likewise, do not have a big role after <em>Wrathstone</em>, even if some are better suited to stamina or magicka than others.</p><p>The Alliances and the playable races are as follow:</p><ul><li> The <strong>Ebonheart Pact</strong>, consisting of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings">Nords</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreBetter">Dunmer/Dark Elves</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">Argonians</a> as they work to strengthen their fragile alliance. Which is easier said than done when the Argonians have been the favourite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveRace">Slave Race</a> for the Dunmer for generations, and Nords not being exactly the best diplomats of peace, along with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a> of their own.</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> The <strong>Daggerfall Covenant</strong>, consisting of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Bretons</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryBlackMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryBlackMan">Redguards</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent">Orcs</a>. Like the Pact, they work on keeping peace due to the peoples' history with each other. Namely, that the Bretons and Redguards have attacked and discriminated against the Orcs for a long time, and they are still working on just accepting them as people. Not to say the Bretons and Redguards' relationship is any better.</li><li> The <strong>Aldmeri Dominion</strong>, consisting of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreBetter">Altmer/High Elves</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannibalTribe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannibalTribe">Bosmer/Wood Elves</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFolk">Khajiit</a>.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamagerHealerTank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamagerHealerTank">three core roles</a> are tanking (taking damage so others do not have to), healing (patching others up), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">damage dealing</a>. The game makes a point that all classes can be utilized for each role, though there are some typical classes for certain roles.<p>Additionally, while there are only a few classes of weapons available to be equipped in the game (one-handed weapons like swords and daggers, two-handed weapons like battle axes and mauls, bows, and the various classes of magic staves), each class has certain 'thematic weapons' inherent in the design of some of their abilities.</p><p></p><ul><li> Templars &mdash; Followers of Stendarr who use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightEmUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightEmUp">light magic</a> in both melee combat and ranged spells. They are typically seen as healers, but can use their shields and buffs to mitigate damage, and can use their Aedric spears and Sun magic to deal damage. Templars' thematic weapon is an Aedric spear that manifests in their Aedric Spear skill line.</li><li> Dragonknights &mdash; Having learned hidden fire arts from the Akaviri, Dragonknights shield themselves in fiery armours and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">battle with fire</a>. They are usually seen as tanks with their massive shields and self-healing, but can also be used to heal and buff their allies' damage. Dragon Knights' thematic weapon is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhipItGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhipItGood">a molten whip and/or chains</a> from their Ardent Flame skill line.</li><li> Sorcerers &mdash; Formidable magicka-users who invoke the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">power of storms</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic">summoning</a> in battle. They are usually seen as magicka-damage dealers, but can use their self-preservation and self-buffing as tanks, and has one summoning pet that can heal multiple targets. Sorcerers' thematic weapon is their fist from the Storm Calling skill line; being sorcerers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">they themselves are their greatest weapon</a>.</li><li> Nightblades &mdash; Assassins that use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingAShadow">shadow magic</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic">life essence manipulation</a>, they are mostly used as stamina-damage dealers. However, by stealing life energy from enemies and occasionally themselves, they can also heal themselves and allies, as well as making it harder to get hit. Nightblades' thematic weapons are daggers manifested in the Assassination and Shadow skill lines.</li><li> Wardens (added in <em>Morrowind</em>) &mdash; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureHero">Servants of nature</a>, they summon animals and plants temporarily to aid in battle, as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson">huge spikes and sheets of ice</a> to protect themselves. This class was introduced as a hybrid class that balanced its role-capabilities in ways the base-game classes had not yet, with each skill-tree specializing in one class with some mixing. Wardens' thematic weapons are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeastmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeastmaster">the creatures they call</a> in battle.</li><li> Necromancers (added in <em>Elsweyr</em>) &mdash; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">People who raise the dead</a> to aid in battle, they also use the remaining souls of the dead to their advantage and are able to draw upon all elements in their attacks. Like the Wardens, the Necromancers are supposed to be hybrids with a skill-tree for each role, with some mixing. Necromancers' thematic weapon is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">a scythe</a> from the Bone Tyrant skill line.</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Downloadable Content&nbsp;</div><div id="folder1" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">The game has as a goal to release one major update every quarter of the year; most of these updates comes in the form of a DLC that contains either two group dungeons or a small zone with a story in it. These DLCs can be bought with Crowns, or will be available for ESO Plus members. Once a year, there is also released a Chapter, which you must buy separately with money, which has a large zone and a new features like skill lines or crafting. So far, these zones in chapters are made DLCs a year later, with the special features being purchasable in the Crown Store.<p>Due to the majority of DLCs being based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusEnvironment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusEnvironment">Player Versus Environment</a>, assume all contents are this unless stated otherwise.</p><p></p><ul><li> <em>Imperial City</em>: Adds a new zone, the titular Imperial City in the heart of Cyrodil, as a unique hybrid of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusEnvironment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusEnvironment">PvE</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusPlayer">PvP</a>. You must constest with both the forces of Molag Bal and other rival players, as well as introducing two new group dungeons; The Imperial City Prison and the White-Gold Tower. Due to being the last post-launch content to feature Molag Bal, it is considered the end of the Five Companions arc. It was made available for free 5th of September, 2019.</li><li> <em>Orsinium</em>: Adds the zone of Wrothgar with the titular city, as well as the game's first and only solo-arena, Maelstrom Arena. You are called to Wrothgar to assist Kurog, the King of Orcs, in rebuilding Orsinium and bring all the Orc Strongholds together under one leader, though not everyone agrees with King Kurog's vision. Gives small hints of stories and zones to come.</li><li> <em>Thieves Guild</em>: Adds the zone of Hew's Bane in Hammerfell, the Khajiit-centered trial Maw of Lorkhaj, and allows players to join the notorious titular faction, which had its own questline and skill tree. Along with this pack came an update that reintroduced the Crime mechanic from the main series, now called the Justice System, allowing players to steal, murder, commit robberies, fence goods, et cetera.</li><li> <em>Dark Brotherhood</em>: Much like <em>Thieves Guild</em>, it introduced the infamous Dark Brotherhood to the list of joinable factions, with its own questline and zone called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAThe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAThe">The Gold Coast</a> in Cyrodiil. Most notably, it reintroduced stealth take-downs, which can be performed on humanoid enemies with the Blade of Woe for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a>. Further hints of things to come.</li><li> <em>Shadows of the Hist</em>: An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">Argonian-themed</a> dungeon pack containing two group dungeons set in Black Marsh: The Ruins of Mazzatun, where you must help save enslaved tribes from the Mazzatun tribe, and the Cradle of Shadows, where you help a Dark Brotherhood assassin find her companions. Further hints of things to come.</li><li> <em>Morrowind</em>: The Chapter released in 2017, becoming a DLC in 2018, and the start of the Daedric War arc. You travel to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind">Vvardenfell</a> to assist Vivec in maintaining his power, and prevent a coup from an unknown traitor. The expansion added a new player class; the Warden, a nature themed character that fights with flora, fauna and ice. It also added new PvP content in the form of the Battlegrounds, a 4v4v4 arena type game-mode, which would later become base-game, and a new trial, the Halls of Fabrication.</li><li> <em>Horns of the Reach</em>: A Nord/Minotaur-themed dungeon pack containing two group dungeons set in southwestern Skyrim: Falkreath Hold, where you help the people of Falkreath against a siege by the minotaurs, and Bloodroot Forge, where you must stop the minotaurs by destroying an ancient forge.</li><li> <em>Clockwork City</em>: Continues the Daedric War arc. Added a zone and questline taking place in Sotha Sil's eponymous mechanical realm.</li><li> <em>Dragon Bones</em>: A dragon-themed dungeon pack containing two group dungeons: Fang Lair, where you must stop necromancers from reanimating a dragon skeleton, and Scalecaller Peak, where you help an alchemist stop a plague from spreading due to the skeleton dragon's former Dragon Priest.</li><li> <em>Summerset</em>: Released in 2018, becoming a DLC in 2019, and the conclusion of the Daedric War arc.

Prior to CP 160, which is the level cap for gear scaling, having a lot of gold doesn't mean much since there's not a whole lot of meaningful stuff you can (or need to) get with it, outside of housing, therefore you likely will not notice the rather slow rate at which it is gotten. After CP 160, suddenly, you'll find yourself needing a <em>lot</em> of it to repair your stuff and buying rare materials from the guild market to upgrade your gear, due to the absolutely miserable drop rate of those items, and then the low gold income starts to rear its head. Legendary-tier upgrade materials can cost a small fortune <em>per unit</em> due to how rare they are, especially Chromium Platings for jewelry crafting, so unless you have a dedicated gold-farming character focused solely on farming things to sell, buying just one of those can set you back a good while of earning. That being said, as long as the meta doesn't change, once you've managed to upgrade all of your items to Legendary quality, this stops being a problem, and you can start invoking it on <em>other players</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal">Added Alliterative Appeal</a>: The description of the random "Swan-Satin Bathing Thong" item you can get as loot when stealing things. <em>"Sleek and sensuous singing-swan style satin string sporting silver sequins, from Snip &amp; Stitch, Skywatch."</em></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdjectiveAnimalAlehouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdjectiveAnimalAlehouse">Adjective Animal Alehouse</a>: "The Sleepy Eaglet" in Skywatch, and "The Screaming Mermaid" in Port Hunding.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventurerArchaeologist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventurerArchaeologist">Adventurer Archaeologist</a>: Tharayya from Volenfell and the <em>Wrathstone</em> dungeons.

While this can be understood as these locations need to be expanded in size to accommodate a large amount of players, the changes made to them are usually dramatic, such that they don't look the least bit like how they did in games that chronologically succeed <em>Online</em>, and some dungeon placements don't make any sense (e.g. Windhelm and Riften look nothing like their <em>Skyrim</em> counterparts, Winterhold is just straight-up missing from the game map, and <em>Stonethorn's</em> Castle Thorn sits exactly where Markarth is supposed to be). A disturbing amount of locations that show up in <em>Online</em> will just magically vanish several thousand years later during the Third Era without the least bit of acknowledgement from anyone.</li><li> Downloadable content is supposed to work on their own without playing the base-game first, so any recurring characters have usually no big role in the base-game.

It does not, however change dialogues in Morrowind if you finished <em>Clockwork City</em> and <em>Summerset</em>.</li><li> When Mulaamnir offers to let you and Abnur Tharn go in <em>Elsweyr</em>, it makes more sense if you played the prologue quest first, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">where you technically helped Abnur Tharn free the dragons</span>, than if you did not, in which the dragons will let you be just because they think you would be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWorthKilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWorthKilling">annoying bug they would rather not put effort in</a>.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">Brother&#150;Sister Incest</a>: More like Twin-Brothers-Incest in <em>Elsweyr</em>.

Turns out, she's a believer of the Nerevarine Prophecy (which was foreshadowed beforehand) and in order to make sure that the Nerevarine will show up, sells her soul to a Dremora in exchange for immortality. The Dremora states that he will return for her in disguise as a mortal man, hence her banning all men from living in Tel Mora.</li><li> During the temporal displacement shenanigans in Nchuthnkarst, Kireth Vanos mentions suddenly finding herself in Morrowind, but Vivec City is a smoldering crater and the larger part of Vvardenfell had already sunken below the sea, foreshadowing the events of the Red Year that would take place about a milennium later during the Fourth Era.</li><li> While adventuring through the Depths of Malatar, you can come across a letter that mentions Umaril the Unfeathered, whom the Hero of Kvatch will fight in the same location during the finale of the Knights of the Nine questline in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a></em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a>: Quite a lot:<ul><li> Sheogorath, naturally, references all the previous games during his questline including name-checking the Staff of Chaos and Numidium.

Some of the random factions you come across in ESO are named after one of those teams, and the team names in the Morrowind expansion's battlegrounds also come from there.</li><li> The dragon Nafaalilargus, one of the bosses from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsAdventuresRedguard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsAdventuresRedguard">The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard</a></em>, returns in <em>Dragonhold</em> under the new and more proper name in Dovahzul, <strong>Nahfahlaar</strong>.</li><li> Dragons, essentially mobile world bosses fought in <em>Elsweyr</em> or <em>Dragonhold</em> zones, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout">will periodically attack you</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">using their Thu'um</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap">Cap</a>: There are several ways in which this will manifest in the game.<ul><li> Your character level is capped at 50, and you'll start gaining Champion ranks beyond that point (Veteran Ranks prior to the <em>Dark Brotherhood</em> update). Champion levels are respectively soft-capped at 810 at the time of writing, where you <em>can</em> surmount it, but it won't do you any good since you can't get any more points to spend. Accordingly, your gear stops scaling at CP 160, so that's the safe point where you can start worrying about getting the best endgame sets as they can't get any better stats-wise.</li><li> The two forms of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageReduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageReduction">Damage Reduction</a>, Spell and Physical Resistance, are capped at 50% and represented by the total Armor value of your gear. At level 50, the hard cap for both Resistances is around 33,000 Armor score for 50% damage mitigation. While it is possible to go beyond 33,000 with buffs and some skills, any excess value will be disregarded.</li><li> Your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding">Bag of Holding</a> has a finite carrying space, of course. While it can be upgraded, the maximum bag space is 200. Your bank works similarly, but caps out at 240 slots instead.</li><li> You are limited to how many furniture items you can have in your home, and of them how many of each type. Generally, these caps change depending on the size of your house, with larger homes allowing for more types of furnishings and more articles of each category. Having an active ESO+ subscription will further double this limit, allowing you to place even more things in your house.</li><li> Some currency types have rather low upper limits to how many of them you can carry with you at any given time. Event tickets are limited to 12 units, tops, and you can only have a maximum of 100 Transmutation Crystals on you at any given time, increased to 200 with an active ESO+ subscription. The other currency types don't seem to have a hard cap, especially gold, but considering how <em>Online</em> still uses a 32-bit memory system, one can make an educated guess that it maxes out at a staggering <em>2,147,483,647g</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">Card-Carrying Villain</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nocturnal during the Daedric War arc.</span> The dragons in <em>Elsweyr</em>.<ul><li> While the Alliance War is meant to run on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrayAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrayAndGreyMorality">Gray-and-Grey Morality</a>, whenever a rival Alliance member or group is an antagonist in your current Alliance's quests, nine times out of ten they'll be portrayed as almost cartoonishly evil.

Other skills are more specific, like Focused Aim, which increases damage received through bow attacks only.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamagerHealerTank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamagerHealerTank">Damager, Healer, Tank</a>: While the usual MMO trinity of roles is present in the game, it offers a bit of malleability as the classes are not bound to a specific role and, due to how the combat system works, a party is much more effective if every member can deal damage, cycle through utility buffs and sustain themselves in some way.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory">Damn You, Muscle Memory!</a>:<ul><li> For those used to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a></em>, anyways - in <em>Skyrim</em>, power attacks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnblockableAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnblockableAttack">break through block</a>. In <em>Elder Scrolls Online</em>, power-attacking a blocking enemy will get you stunned. Additionally, landing a power attack restores your Stamina (Magicka if using a staff); in previous games, using a power attack depleted Stamina.</li><li> In <em>Skyrim</em>, vampires who don't feed regularly will advance in stage and become more monstrous. In <em>Online</em>, it's the opposite, so players who habitually fed on NPCs to maintain their early stage vampirism in previous games will actually <em>advance</em> their corruption this time around and be slapped with the drawbacks that befall a late-stage vampire, which is very hard to get rid of without waiting for several hours at a time, or consuming a high-level and difficult to produce drink that's not readily available. Furthermore, feeding on NPCs will invariably kill them, whereas it did not in previous games, so players trying to get a quick snack from a sleeping citizen may suddenly find themselves with a bounty for murder.<ul><li> If anything, the current state of vampirism can also cause muscle memory issues with those infected prior to <em>Greymoor</em> as well. Pre-<em>Greymoor</em>, vampirism behaved much like it did in <em>Skyrim</em> except for the sun damage, where you'll gradually advance in stage and must feed regularly to stave off the negative effects if you don't like them, and feeding simply stunned the victim instead of killing them.</li><li> Speaking of vampirism, being a vampire can seriously mess with your muscle memory if you're already a member of the Dark Brotherhood, as feeding and using the Blade of Woe are bound to the same key, and their prompts are triggered in roughly the same positions. As such, a vampire player might accidentally feed upon their would-be assassination target and increase their corruption level and have to deal with the hassle that it brings.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil">Dark Is Not Evil</a>:<ul><li> The Fang Lair dungeon makes a point to discuss how the necromatic arts are not inherently evil, which is further discussed in Northern Elsweyr where there are both good and evil necromancers, and you yourself can be one.</li><li> The Nightblade class use shadow magic and are usually previewed in dark gear.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove">Death from Above</a>:<ul><li> The bow-ability Volley has you shoot an arrow in the air, and have multiple arrows fall down in your chosen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AreaOfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AreaOfEffect">Area of Effect</a>.</li><li> Templars have the abilities Backlash, where a spear of light slowly falls upon the enemy to deal damage, and Spear Shards, where you throw a spear of light up and has it land in your chosen location.

Their magic is indeed advanced, but they are afraid that other races are catching up to them and there are strict politics in magic. The people there are indeed beautiful and smart, but that is because they cast out anyone with any disability.

With the release of <em>Morrowind</em>, you can find a warning from the Ordinators outright threatening heretics - which explicitly spells out worship of the Divines, Malacath, the Aldmeri Gods, and especially Daedra Worship - with "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaximumFunChamber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaximumFunChamber">re-education</a>" or execution if they practice their faith openly or proselytize. Also, if you are an Argonian, expect to get treated poorly by the locals, with interactions ranging from dirty looks to outright <em>death threats</em>.</li><li> The Orc chiefs practice polygyny, and when you get the option to question this there is often someone who is unhappy by it but still stays due to traditions. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a> is also addressed from time to time, with some Orcs justifying why polygamy applies to men but not to women. It is also a big deal in Wrothgar when a chief might be a woman, and she has to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">pose as a man to even be considered</span>. An Orcish historian also states that even <em>theorizing</em> that a certain legendary Orc hero may have been a woman is considered scandalous.</li><li> The Bosmer typically uphold the Green Pact, which maintains that plant life is sacred while animal and humanoid lives are expendable. Not following the Pact is considered the highest sacrilege, aside from one faction of Bosmer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">Combat Pragmatists</a> who do not uphold the Pact due to wartime rules. The tenets of the Pact also impact Bosmer diet, making them strict carnivores and at times even cannibals.</li><li> The Khajiit and Bosmer both have a positive outlook on theft, with there even being a common law about it called the Right of Theft. This law dictates that if a theft were clever or skillful enough, the thief may demand some sort of payment or boon from the victim. The victim's debt even applies to a new thief, if they take the item from the original one, as this is a plot point in a questline.</li><li> The Khajiit celebrate casual drug use through Moon Sugar, a narcotic substance which is a key ingredient of skooma (although they look down upon skooma itself due to being <em>too</em> addictive and an appropriation). Several important rites of passage or ceremonies for ascension into positions of power involve going on Moon Sugar-induced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisionQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisionQuest">Vision Quests</a>.</li><li> The Altmer, even at their most tolerant, are proud eugenicists with other elements of fascism. In particular, it is considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CategoryTraitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CategoryTraitor">betrayal</a> to marry or breed outside of their race, as they consider themselves the last "pure" example of the original Aldmeri. Less extreme Altmer may oppose the slavery, oppression or dehumanization (so to speak) of other races, but they still see them as unevolved, impure or child-like.</li><li> In the House of Reveries in Summerset, you can read a play that's the Altmer version of Cinderella (a poor serving girl gets dressed up for a ball, hoping to woo a noble). However, the happy ending is that the noble has no interest, courts someone of his own class instead, and the serving girl realizes her folly in trying to rise above her station in life.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a>: The entire Western Skyrim hold of Falkreath is restricted to merely being a group dungeon instead of playing any part in the <em>Greymoor</em> storyline. In fact, it seems to have been excluded from <em>all</em> of Skyrim as far as the world map is concerned, being accessible from Craglorn of all places, which is part of Hammerfell. Likewise, the hold of Whiterun is similarly reduced to bit part references and doesn't make an actual appearance, even though there's still a huge whopping gap on the world map between Eastern and Western Skyrim where it should be; Dawnstar is similarly snubbed and isn't even mentioned as much as Whiterun is, even though a good portion of Western Skyrim's map also contains parts of the Pale, and the entire landmass that makes up Winterhold is just straight up <em>missing</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DetectiveMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DetectiveMole">Detective Mole</a>: In <em>Summerset</em>, the Russafeld quest involves you investigating a recent murder. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After investigating the situation with two Jurisreeves (Lorne and Soravil), finding more bodies, learning about Lorne and Soravil's shared past, and realizing that there is more than one murderer, you and Lorne eventually discover that Soravil's behind the whole thing; he wanted revenge against Lorne for rejecting him when he tried courting her after their spouses had an affair and subsequently died.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">Difficult, but Awesome</a>:<ul><li> The Nightblade class is capable of outputting obscene levels of damage to even large and boss enemies...if you know how to play them.

Even on its own, this class requires very precise skill rotations to reach optimal DPS, so your fingers have to constantly be dancing around on the correct buttons that you need to develop a tight muscle memory on. Good sets and buffs also make or break a Nightblade, especially Stamina-based ones, making Nightblade a very demanding class to play right on <em>so</em> many different levels compared to other, naturally-strong kits like Magicka Templar, Necromancer, or either flavor of Sorceror.</li><li> If you have <em>Elsweyr</em> and <em>Dragonhold</em>, then going dragon hunting can be a very profitable job. Each dragon drops a sizable cache of valuables that can be sold for a small fortune, as well as unique alchemy ingredients you can't find elsewhere. The catch is that dragons are a force to be reckoned with, boasting somewhere in the range of <em>fifteen million HP</em> each, compared to a world or trial boss that typically has only about one to two, maybe five million tops, and possess very powerful attacks that can make very short work of a lone player. As they are designed for groups, it is basically impossible to hunt dragons alone, and even in large crowds, a given player can be expected to die several times throughout each fight, so it's both a very demanding <em>and</em> resource intensive venture, but if you manage to consistently pull this off, you'll be finding yourself much richer in due time. Most players know this, therefore you can expect to always find a group every time a dragon is spotted, and they also respawn basically constantly within walking distance of wayshrines, so you can just hop around the map repeatedly to make big money without much trouble.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishingOutDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishingOutDirt">Dishing Out Dirt</a>: As a Dragonknight, the Earthen Heart skill line allows you to manipulate the earth under your feet to aid you in battle, either to provide you and your allies with shields formed out of rock, or immobilize enemies by encasing them in dirt.

The first DLC, <em>Imperial City</em>, is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusPlayer">Player Versus Player</a> zone with two dungeons. The second, <em>Orsinium</em>, is a big zone which was always a DLC, whereas other big-zones began as Chapters bought with real money that were later made into DLC.</li><li> Craglorn is a base-game zone that was introduced post-launch and has nothing to do with the Planemeld overall. This is because it was introduced while the game was subscription-based, and they planned to regularly introduce new zones for free. This was changed when the game went buy-to-play, but it can still feel weird to go from a five-zone-long Alliance arc and simultaniously save the world from Molag Bal, to a self-contained zone about the Celestials.</li><li> The first post-released story arc "Daedric Wars" took a long time to complete, going from previews in Orsinium, the Dark Brotherhood, and Shadows of the Hist DLC to Morrowind to Clockwork City to Summerset, with two self contained DLC Dungeons between the three.

That being said, their unique resource gains allow them to play mage roles as well, if only not as strong as dedicated Magicka-based races.

Considering that Daedra usually do not even care if another of their kind tries to manipulate mortals, it is quite surprising that one will go out of her own way to help a mortal with nothing to gain.</li><li> One quest in Summerset has you helping out both an Altmer/Maormer couple stop the latter&#146;s old crew from taking over a keep. Depending on your choices, both of them will decide to renounce their allegiance to their provinces in order to run away and be together.

The Daggerfall Covenant's capital city is not Daggerfall itself, but rather Wayrest, which is in Shornhelm. Similarly, the leading forces of the Ebonheart Pact are the Nords, who are based out of Windhelm, and their capital is Mournhold, not Ebonheart. Less egregiously, the Aldmeri Dominion really <em>is</em> chiefly commanded by Queen Ayrenn's Altmeri forces, but their base of operations is in Grahtwood, which is Bosmeri land.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonMammalMammaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonMammalMammaries">Non-Mammal Mammaries</a>: The Argonians, who are <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardPeople">Lizard People</a> but still have breasts like humans.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">Noodle Incident</a>:<ul><li> On the Aldmeri Dominion side, Queen Ayrenn and Razum-dar's backstory seems to be full of these, often in reference to the time they adventured together.</li><li> Some crafting skill lines have the Hireling passive, which makes you receive letters every day that contain crafting materials. The letters themselves usually recount the hireling's adventures while retrieving your materials, and can sometimes veer into this trope.</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Gavin Gavonne:</strong> A word of wisdom from one who learned a thing or two in his travels: no matter how much your drunken companion might encourage it, never, under any circumstances, should you moon a werewolf.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sell</a>: Sometimes when you attack an enemy - usually a boss - you will get a message at the top of the screen saying it is too powerful for effects like knockback or poison.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaLevel">Nostalgia Level</a>: Many of the playable areas of Tamriel would count since the game is largely an even mix of nostalgia locations and new areas.

All three traveled across Tamriel before becoming rulers (Ayrenn was an adventurer, Emeric was a caravan guard, and Jorunn was a traveling skald) and something unexpected caused their rise of power and the creation of their faction (Ayrenn returned and claimed her birthright after her father's death and brought her two adventurer companions to help, Emeric married Maraya instead of Rayelle and created a trade alliance with Hammerfell and the Orcs, the death of Jorunn's sister and mother during an Akiviri invasion made him next in line as Skyrim's High King and teamed up with the Dunmer and Argonians to drive them away).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a>: Many last bosses have this in trials, in particular on veteran.

In Murkmire, a dossier talking about the player character, written by the antagonists, recommends sending a force of at least 20 soldiers to take them down, and that even that may not work.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyOneName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyOneName">Only One Name</a>: Few cultures in Tamriel actually have family names; usually they are reserved for nobles or really important families.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreBetter">Our Elves Are Better</a>: High Elves (Altmer) are stuck-up fascists, Dark Elves (Dunmer) are religious fanatics and slavers, the Wood Elves (Bosmer) love the forest so much some are cannibals rather than eat flora. The other elf races are Sea Elves (Maormer), who have chameleon-pale skin and are constantly at war with the High Elves; Dwarves (Dwemer), who are not shorter than the other races and were atheist underground-dwellers, as well as eventual slavers of the Snow Elves (Falmer), who have yet to appear in the game, while the Ayleid (also called Wild Elves) are extinct and were slavers of humans.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurFairiesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurFairiesAreDifferent">Our Fairies Are Different</a>: Though there are fairy-creatures not yet seen in the game, there also are the nixad, small critters that like to cause mischief.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhostsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhostsAreDifferent">Our Ghosts Are Different</a>: You can summon ghosts of the deceased back from the afterlife by summoning magic, which in some cultures are more normal than abnormal.

They are native to Summerset Isles, but were not created in-game until the <em>Summerset</em> chapter. They apparently sometimes do cross the ocean to the mainlands, though, as you can find some of them in Northern Elsweyr. That, or they are (perhaps illegally) imported due to the Aldmeri Dominon alliance.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent">Our Orcs Are Different</a>: Originally elves, they were changed to a race of their own due to their patron god Malacath.

Whereas typically, a vampire would burn in sunlight and therefore has to stay indoors until dark or go outside with headwear, vampires in <em>Online</em> can freely go about their business during the day without being hurt. They also don't need to feed, and feeding actually <em>increases</em> your vampirism stage instead of lowering it, like it did in <em>Skyrim</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent">Our Werewolves Are Different</a>: In the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jNT5cMwxw0">Alliance trailer<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, one part of it features a trio of Ebonheart warriors fighting a group of <em>zombie werewolves</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent">Our Zombies Are Different</a>: There are various types of zombies depending on the magic used to bring them back to life.

In many of these cases, characters who canonically died or are otherwise removed from the story will still somehow be alive and well in zones that chronologically precede their "deaths". This is even more of a problem if you decide to skip Coldharbour at the character creation screen, since the game will then prompt you to start your new playthroughs from the most recently-released chapter zone, all of which imply more or less that the Planemeld had already been stopped.<ul><li> The Daedric War arc begins with <em>Morrowind</em> and ends in <em>Summerset</em>. Should you decide to play through <em>Summerset</em> first, the events of <em>Morrowind</em> and <em>Clockwork City</em> will still assume that the larger threat is still present, even if you've technically defeated them already.</li><li> Playing through <em>Dragonhold</em> before <em>Elsweyr</em> will still have the characters (and yourself) be utterly surprised that the Dragonguard are still around to some extent near the end of the Anequina arc, even if you've already reformed the order, and mission dialogue will refer to Sai Sahan as some kind of mysterious figure, despite the fact that you already knew him beforehand.</li><li> And speaking of DLC chapters, you can play them immediately after Coldharbour and meet up with important characters from the main questline despite the improbability of it all. Abnur, Lyris and Sai Sahan will accompany you on your quests, and the game will treat it as if you already knew who they are, regardless of whether you've actually met them in the main story proper. One can play through the entirety of the Dragon War arc and then get the mission to rescue Sai from Coldharbour, or meet up with Abnur who's alive and well despite having seemingly perished at the end of <em>Elsweyr</em>, which makes no sense on a continuity level.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhotographicMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhotographicMemory">Photographic Memory</a>: The player character can gain the ability to recall any piece of literature they have read, via a magical ritual as a reward from Shalidor after completing the Mages Guild storyline.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PillarOfLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PillarOfLight">Pillar of Light</a>: Skyshards have one above them, and the Keen Eye crafting passive makes it so a similar effect appears on gathering nodes, making them harder to miss.

Missing a day doesn't mean you miss the next reward, but it means that it's delayed until the next day you log in, and it means you may miss the last (typically biggest) reward.</li><li> Various zones and questlines have a quest you can complete daily; you can earn achievements which can unlock things like dye colors or crafting stations for completing a certain number.</li><li> Events in the game are relatively frequent, and during them you can earn a number of Event Tickets per day.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonedWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonedWeapons">Poisoned Weapons</a>: Alchemists can make several kinds of poisons to use for any sort of weapon.

Naturally, <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> comes into play when one considers that even the shots of a magical staff can be imbued with the same poison a regular sword uses.<ul><li> Some weapon and player skills can also involve poison.

You see some of her past: She has remarkable powers, able to raise land and grow vines right out of the ground, but she also is not able to control it. She destroys an entire ship on accident by raising a rock out of the ocean.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecautionaryCorpseDisposal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecautionaryCorpseDisposal">Precautionary Corpse Disposal</a>: Argonians in Murkmire put a grave-stake through the body of the dead to keep them from rising as a bog blight (essentially a zombie).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphetEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProphetEyes">Prophet Eyes</a>: The, well, Prophet has them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Warrior Race Guy</a>: Many Redguard, Orcs and Nords you meet are this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudScholarRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudScholarRaceGuy">Proud Scholar Race Guy</a>: The High Elves put a big emphasis on education.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunctuatedForEmphasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunctuatedForEmphasis">Punctuated!

In terms of their overall usefulness, suffice to say that a clueless player will often put several of their preferred role's most obvious skills on the skill bar and then use two or three, wondering why the game's enemies take too long to kill.

Normally, a player with an AoE footprint trained on them should try to move away from the team to prevent it from splashing onto others and causing unplanned deaths. Here, you need to run <em>towards</em> the group, as that damage is spreaded out evenly across everyone in the highlighted area, so the more group members are in that zone, the less damage each member will take, capped at 33% across three players.
