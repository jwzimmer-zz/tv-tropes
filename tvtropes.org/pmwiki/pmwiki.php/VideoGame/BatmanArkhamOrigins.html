Some of the most glaring examples are:<ul><li> The 'Worst Nightmare' challenges due to predator rooms not respawning after completing them in the main story. The most frustrating of these is the exotic takedown challenge, which requires you do an explosive gel, vent, hanging ledge and corner takedown. It can only be completed in the Merchant's Bank because it's the only location with both heavy walls for an explosive gel takedown, and ledges that can be used for hanging ledge takedown. There is a second predator encounter here as part of a side quest, but not only is it harder to pull off, but if you destroyed both walls already or popped off all the vents, it becomes impossible because they don't respawn. As a fun added bonus, the game tells you to perform a ledge takedown, but only a <em>hanging</em> ledge takedown counts. Finally, if you manage to complete an encounter, then discover you missed the challenge, you can't just reset, because the game autosaves.</li><li> The final rank of 'Gotham Protector' due to no Crime in Progress spawning on the Pioneer Bridge except for one point VERY early in the story where players would definitely not have reached that point in the challenge yet if not on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>. If you want to do it after that, you have to go into a neighboring area, beat up most of a gang, and lure the last guy into an area that's considered part of the "Pioneer Bridge" sector.</li></ul></li><li> One of the Gotham Communication towers originally could not be completed without glitching, because Batman could not climb up a critical vent. This has since been fixed in a patch.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny">Actually Pretty Funny</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When Batman reveals that he just temporarily stopped Bane's heart instead of killing him in order to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note041n6');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note041n6" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note041n6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Actually a <em>fourth</em> option. The first option was to kill Bane, the second was to let Bane kill him, the third was to take too long deciding and the Joker dies.</span>, Joker scowls and deems it not funny. When he's being taken away in the ending cutscene, however, his opinion on the matter changes and he laughs it off.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation">Adaptation Distillation</a>: The story incorporates parts of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanYearOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanYearOne">Batman: Year One</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLongHalloween" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLongHalloween">The Long Halloween</a></em>, <em>Legends of the Dark Knight</em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke">The Killing Joke</a></em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExplanationExtrication" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExplanationExtrication">Adaptation Explanation Extrication</a>: At one point, Bane tells Batman that with him dead he'll finally find peace. Part of Bane's backstory is that as a child, he was tormented by nightmares of a giant bat, one of the reasons he went to Gotham. The other mercenaries have taken up the bounty for the money, a chance to cause havoc, or to test Batman, but the game never explains why Bane seems to take his conflict with Batman more personally than the other assassins do.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalEarlyAppearance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalEarlyAppearance">Adaptational Early Appearance</a>: In the comics, Black Mask, Bane, Bird, Anarky, Lady Shiva, and Deathstroke all came into conflict with Batman and/or his allies after at least Dick Grayson became Robin (and in the case of most of them, after he became Nightwing, too) and Barbara Gordon became Batgirl. Here, they're among Bruce's earliest enemies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalJerkass">Adaptational Jerkass</a>:<ul><li> Ferris Boyle in the "Cold, Cold Heart" DLC. In the original "Heart of Ice" story, he was willing to let someone die because of the bottom line, but overall the story had him as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victim</a> you had to save from Freeze's revenge. In this version, he was a lot more sinister in motives and the backstory reveals he recruited Victor Fries for weapons development in exchange for helping <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle">his wife</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILied">which he had no intention of actually doing</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In addition, Boyle had his wife captive, and retrieving her is Freeze's real motivation in this story. After Batman subdues Freeze, Boyle restrains Batman in ice and tries to kill Freeze to leave no witnesses, thus the final moment is escaping the ice and taking down Boyle before he can finish the job</span>.</li><li> Kirigi from the "Initiation" DLC is a mild example. While the DLC has him an indifferent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> at worst, his comics counterpart was one of <em>the</em> most pacifistic mentors Batman ever had (Denny O'Neil's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Knightfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Knightfall">Knightfall</a></em> novelization mentions he stopped training Bruce because Bruce <em>refused to forsake violence forever</em>).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy">Adaptational Villainy</a>: While closer to his comic book counterpart than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BewareTheBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BewareTheBatman">Beware the Batman</a></em>, this depiction of Anarky is still an insane terrorist who doesn't value people's lives.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a>: Riddler is <em>far</em> more courteous as Enigma then he is in <em>Asylum</em> and <em>City</em>. He even seems to consider Batman a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>. That said, we can see the shapings of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a> that likely led to his Riddler persona in the previous (chronologically later) games, especially later in his storyline.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs">All Your Base Are Belong to Us</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Near the end of the game, Bane deduces Batman's identity and attacks the Batcave.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor">Almighty Janitor</a>: Basically what Alfred is. He basically does <em>everything</em> in this game from synthesising cures to pinning locations on your map, to sending the flying batcopter for you.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousTimePeriod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousTimePeriod">Ambiguous Time Period</a>: Par for the course for comic adaptations due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime">Comic-Book Time</a>. But Origins is even more noticeable than usual because it is a prequel to Asylum and City and yet technology seems to be more advanced than ever. Barbara Gordon even lampshades this trope at one point by sarcastically asking the cops "What decade do you think we're in?"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusementParkOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusementParkOfDoom">Amusement Park of Doom</a>: Joker makes a makeshift one in the penthouse of a hotel he's taken over.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowForSomeoneCompletelyDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowForSomeoneCompletelyDifferent">And Now for Someone Completely Different</a>: For a small flashback scene, you play as the Joker.

However, Bane's followers do say that laying down their lives for Bane's cause is an honor, so that might lessen his position under this trope.</li><li> The closest anyone gets to a good boss is Commissioner Loeb, if only because he condones the cops' illegal activities. Of course, he also wants to kill Gordon just for <em>not</em> being corrupt, but still.</li><li> To be fair, Gordon is on the fast track to the boss&#146;s chair, and is probably the straightest arrow in Gotham.

During this session, we actually get to see how Joker perceives his origins, and they seem to be exactly how he describes them to Hugo Strange (who dismissed his story as a lie) in <em>Arkham City</em> (a version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke">The Killing Joke</a></em>).</li><li> Likewise, the scene in which Flashback!Joker fights his foes in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DanceBattler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DanceBattler">Dance Battler</a> way is a nod to the Melee Challenge Map fights in the PlayStation 3-only Joker DLC, while the scene where the pre-Joker Red Hood walks across contorted walkways at the Ace Chemical Plant (and the following hallucination walkway that Batman walks through in the Batcave) is a nod to one of the Scarecrow's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a> segments in the main story, all from <em>Arkham Asylum</em>.</li><li> TN-1, a permanent, super-enhanced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade">Deadly Upgrade</a> version of Venom that deteriorates memory in the process of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HulkingOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HulkingOut">Hulking Out</a>, is the formula that is ultimately perfected into Titan, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoSerum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoSerum">Psycho Serum</a> enhanced version of Venom created from Bane's blood in <em>Asylum</em> and continuing to affect the world in <em>City</em>.</li><li> Scribbled on the wall in Calendar Man's cell in Blackgate are references to the holiday murders he'd remind Batman about whenever he visited Day in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity">Arkham City</a></em>. His absence in the main game is presumably due to him hunting down and killing Judge Harkness, the judge who slated him for execution even after Day had been declared insane. (Or rather, was so desperate to slate him for execution that Warden Joseph pressured Harleen Quinzel to change her evaluation of him to "sane," so that they could legally give him the death penalty.)</li><li> In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus">Freeze-Frame Bonus</a>, it's shown the GCPD's walkie-talkies come from military contractor / equipment manufacturer TYGER.</li><li> Dr. Penelope Young, still just a practicing psychiatrist, has an office in Lacey Towers.</li><li> The hallway in Wayne Manor where you first gain control of Bruce in "Cold, Cold Heart" is very similar in appearance to the hallway in <em>Arkham Asylum</em> which becomes "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew">Wayne Manor</a>" to kick off the second Scarecrow hallucination.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">Continuity Snarl</a>: When adapting Branden from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanYearOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanYearOne">Batman: Year One</a></em>, he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamedByTheAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamedByTheAdaptation">given a first name</a>, which wasn't revealed in <em>Year One</em>, its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Adaptation</a>, or in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheDead">his brief appearance in</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkVictory">Dark Victory</a></em>.

It initially appears that the fight with Copperhead will take place after Batman recovers from his poisoning, since it's so deadly, akin to the Titan poison segments in <em>City</em>. However, Batman <em>does</em> fight Copperhead before he can get his antidote, albeit with frequent pauses due to his deteriorating condition.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyEmptyBuilding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyEmptyBuilding">Conveniently Empty Building</a>: Invoked by the Joker.

He does, however, assure that the next building he plans to blow up isn't empty.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopyAndPasteEnvironments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopyAndPasteEnvironments">Copy-and-Paste Environments</a>: Subverted. The northern half of the map consists of the same area that Batman explored in <em>Arkham City</em>, but with major structural changes as the villains obviously have yet to make a home there.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmeticallyAdvancedPrequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmeticallyAdvancedPrequel">Cosmetically Advanced Prequel</a>:<ul><li> Batman's suit is visually more impressive than in the previous games, ditches the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderwearOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderwearOfPower">Underwear of Power</a> (or, in the series' chronological order, he decides to wear them once he gets older). This was done to show a less refined Batman, wearing a heavily armored and bulkier suit to deal with threats in a more direct manner. It is also intended to look like he is kit-bashing his equipment together, thus the more complex look is actually intended to represent a <em>less</em> technologically advanced Batsuit than the simpler, smoother, sleeker, fabric-like version seen in previous games.</li><li> Deathstroke as well, considering his appearance in <em>Arkham City: Lockdown</em>. His character model was essentially reused from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatVsDCUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatVsDCUniverse">Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe</a></em>, meaning it looked identical to his classic comic appearances. Deathstroke's design here is given a true "Arkham-style" makeover, featuring him with sleek, hard-edged armor. <em>Lockdown</em>'s canonicity is disputed, however.</li><li> Some gadgets like the remote claw and glue grenade are incredibly useful in gameplay and don't appear in later canonicity, but the developers commented that it is well established that Batman has so many gadgets he doesn't take all of them out every night, explaining their absence. The remote claw is useful but not as versatile as the line launcher, as he most likely used the reel from the remote claw to perfect it, the grapnel boost has mild differences to the grapnel accelerator, it's stated in <em>Arkham Knight</em> that Batman eventually turns the shock gloves into the police as evidence, while things like the "scrubbing mode" for Detective Vision is pure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a> since he <em>can</em> do it in later games but the fine controls are not available to the player. (He does use it again in <em>Arkham Knight</em>, albeit only once). The glue grenade chemical compound disintegrated before the events of "Cold Cold Heart" according to Alfred, further suggesting a constant evolution of gadgets rather than conveniently not having them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoverChangesTheMeaning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoverChangesTheMeaning">The Cover Changes the Meaning</a>: Apparently, the Joker's version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HankWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HankWilliams">Hank Williams</a>' "Cold, Cold Heart" (performed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TroyBaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TroyBaker">Troy Baker</a>) has turned a brokenhearted love ballad into a crazy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObsessionSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObsessionSong">Obsession Song</a>.

None of the thugs have the Heart Monitor system that immediately alerts their colleagues that they have a man down, the rooms are very big and easy to traverse with very little of the multi-tiered clutter that forced players to move around the room rather than stay perched on a gargoyle. The Remote Claw also makes it possible to string up mooks on vantage points without you directly standing above them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The final Bane TN-1 boss fight, which uses similar design as the Mister Freeze fight, i.e. attack Bane with different predator tactics as he will adapt to your variation, is harder than earlier challenges due to Bane's speed and the insane amount of damage he can cause, but it's still easier than the Mr. Freeze fight because you only need four or five moves to defeat Bane.</span>.</li><li> Certain rankings on the Worst Nightmare track can only be completed by means of in-story predator challenges, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">something the game itself doesn't explain</a>.
