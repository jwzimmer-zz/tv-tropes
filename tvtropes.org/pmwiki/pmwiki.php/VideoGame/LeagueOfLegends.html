The lore has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">developed in a massive way since then</a>, employing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot">Continuity Reboot</a> that wrote out the League entirely in favour of focusing upon the living tales of individual characters and entire nations that populate Runeterra. The ongoing lore is now primarily communicated through <a class="urllink" href="http://universe.leagueoflegends.com">Universe<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, an extensive encyclopedia website; as well as written stories, artwork, comics, animations, and special character interactions.</p><p>Unlike the Champions who start each match at Level 1, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> Summoners are persistent and gain experience with every battle.

However, <em>LoL</em> has many distinct differences from <em>DotA</em>, most of which simplify the game to some extent. Riot Games pushed it heavily as a professional e-sport, and it has long since eclipsed the original <em>DotA</em>'s popularity. Like we said: <a class="urllink" href="http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/728786/league-of-legends-is-the-most-played-video-game-in-the-world/">most played game in the world<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</p><p>The game has two playable game types, each between two opposing teams of up to five players:</p><ul><li> <strong>Classic:</strong> The standard mode of play as described above. The two maps available for this mode are Summoner's Rift, a 5v5 three-lane map in the same style of DotA's map, and Twisted Treeline, a smaller two-lane map for 3v3 matches.</li><li> <strong>ARAM</strong>: "All-Random, All-Mid", which was originally a fan-made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseRule">House Rule</a> of Classic Mode where players would agree to use random Champions, only employ the central lane and were not allowed to return to their base until death. This created a highly-aggressive game based more around direct combat than map control. It was later canonized into an official mode and given a unique map: the "Proving Grounds", later revised into "The Howling Abyss".<p></p><div class="indent"><em><strong>Thirty seconds until tropes spawn!</strong></em></div></li></ul><p>On top of this, in November 2013, Riot started releasing "temporary game modes" that are only available for a limited time. Riot has a "Rotating Game Mode" queue that opens at a somewhat sporadic schedule from Fridays to Mondays, with specific game modes being available for play on a rotational basis. These game modes include:</p><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotating Game Modes&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><p></p><ul><li> <strong>Definitely Not Dominion:</strong> Known simply as <strong>Dominion</strong> in its original incarnation. A capture-and-hold game where players must fight over control of five "capture points" on the map. The Nexus is not attacked directly, but damaged over time depending on how many points are controlled. Champions start at Level 3 and gain gold and experience far more quickly than normal, leading to a more action-packed match. The dedicated map for this mode is called "The Crystal Scar". This was originally one of the three main game types alongside Classic and ARAM, but was discontinued after four years in February 2016 <a class="urllink" href="http://eune.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/retiring-dominion">due to a lack of interest<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">Ironically</a>, fan outcry about its removal eventually saw its inclusion in the Rotating Game Mode queue. Riot remastered the assets, did a few tweaks, and added it to the rotation.</li><li> <strong>One for All:</strong> A mode that operates exactly like Classic, except each team is made up of five copies of the same champion. Only three champions were permanently vetoed: Karthus (five of his ultimate ability hitting at once would be unbeatable), Syndra (so many orbs), and Teemo (so <em>many</em> mushrooms).</li><li> <strong>The Showdown:</strong> A 1v1 or 2v2 skirmish on a modified version of the Howling Abyss map. The winner is the first player/team to draw First Blood, destroy a Tower, or kill one hundred enemy minions. Oh, and whoever wins <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">dances as Victory is declared and the whole bridge floods with happy Poros.</a></li><li> <strong>Hexakill:</strong> A 6v6 war that completely upends the standard meta of the game. As of autumn 2014, has been played on both Summoner's Rift and Twisted Treeline.</li><li> <strong>Ultra Rapid Fire</strong>, or <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms">U.R.F.</a></strong>: Announced on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay">April Fools' Day</a> 2014 as "the future of LoL", this mode grants a global buff to all players that allows them to spam abilities to a ridiculously overpowered degree. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>. This game mode made a return in 2015.</li><li> <strong>One for All Mirror Mode:</strong> A variation of "One for All" that pits <em>ten</em> of the same champion against each other on the Howling Abyss map.</li><li> <strong>Doom Bots of Doom:</strong> A Co-Op vs. AI mode which pits regular players against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposelyOverpowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposelyOverpowered">Purposely Overpowered</a> bots. These "Doom Bots" not only have incredibly unfair versions of their regular abilities, but gain randomized bonus abilities taken from other Champions or made exclusively for this mode. A later remake turns this into a sort of survival mode, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigRedDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigRedDevil">Little Devil Teemo</a> as the final boss.</li><li> <strong>Ascension:</strong> A modified version of the Dominion map, where two teams of five must move through an even thicker fog of war to capture relics. At the center of the map is the boss, a stationary Xerath with a high level of health; whoever kills him Ascends themselves, becoming highly buffed until the enemy team manages to kill them. Points are awarded for champion kills and relics captured; first team to 200 wins.</li><li> <strong>Legend of the Poro King:</strong> A Snowdown-exclusive 5v5 skirmish on the Howling Abyss where the usual Summoner spells are replaced by two poro-specific abilities: firstly, the ability to throw a companion poro at enemies (and to dash to an enemy afterward) and secondly, to dash to the side of the Poro King, whom you will summon once your team has landed 10 poro hits on enemy players. The Poro King is a giant poro who proceeds slowly down the map, healing your team and doing damage to your enemies (tanking turret blasts and thrown enemy poros too) until he is dispelled.</li><li> <strong>Nemesis Draft:</strong> A variation on Summoner's Rift Draft Mode, where instead of picking your own champion's, you pick the enemy team's. Cue a <em>complete reversal</em> of the usual tactics, as players try to ban out the perceived worst champions and give the enemy team the most awkward champions and comps they can come up with.</li><li> <strong>Black Market Brawlers</strong>: Originally added as a part of the <em>Bilgewater: Burning Tides event</em>. In this game mode, many different items from the "black market" are also available for sale, some with very dramatic effects. Additionally, you can spend Krakens, a currency unique to the game mode, on Brawlers, unique mercenary creatures that follow minions down a lane. Subsequent Krakens spent can upgrade your Brawlers to give them unique effects. After it ended, one of the unique items, the Dead Man's Plate, was added to regular gameplay to memorialize the event. It has yet to pass through the Rotating Game Queue, but it's on it's way.</li><li> <strong>Nexus Siege</strong>: A time-attack competition where the Attacking team attempts to destroy the Nexus of the Defending team as quickly as possible. The two teams then switch sides, and whoever gets the best time wins. Both teams can buy special Siege Equipment to help their side, such as tower-destroying cannon placements for the Attackers and tower-buffing super-lasers for the Defenders.</li><li> <strong>Hunt of the Blood Moon</strong>: A deathmatch gamemode where only very aggressive and squishy champions, mostly Assassins, are playable. The first team to reach 350 points wins, and points are gained by killing enemy champions, hunting enemy spirits in their jungle, or killing the Demon Heralds that spawn in the Baron and Dragon pits. If one champion gets three kills in a row without dying or returning to base, they gain Demon Brand, which turns them invisible and causes their next attack to deal true damage. It's a huge deathmatch where everyone is a glass cannon.</li></ul></div><p>On June 25th, 2019, Riot released another mode, <strong>Teamfight Tactics</strong>, inspired by popular <em>Autochess</em> mod to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dota2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dota2">Dota 2</a></em>.

While SKT's original stomping of Royal Club at the end of Season 3 in 2013 was at least considered novel as a demonstration of exactly <em>how</em> far ahead of everyone else SKT was at the time, seasons 7, 8 and 9 in 2017-19 all being 3-0 thrashings have resulted in the Grand Final often being considered the most-disappointing match at Worlds, particularly after all the hype leading up to the China vs EU matchups in '18 and '19<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1wrsi');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1wrsi" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1wrsi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the first time since Season 1 that at least one of the finalists, if not <em>both</em> of them, <em>wasn't</em> a Korean team</span> saw the Europeans go down with barely a squeak in both years.

You're still stuck with a lower max number of players, but it can prevent a cheap death by standing idle in front of an enemy turret. (<em>DOTA 2</em> took notice of this and upped the ante by having an AI-controlled bot take control of the disconnected player).</li><li> The First Win of the Day bonus resets every 20 hours rather than the normally-expected 24 hours, giving you much more leeway in getting the bonus every day without having to worry about schedule slipping.</li><li> The in-game shop has an undo button to fully refund purchases within a limited window of time. This handily eliminates the age-old dilemma of buying the wrong item and having to choose between being stuck with the wrong item or losing valuable gold selling it back for less.</li><li> Season 4 introduced a new item system allowing people to pick up a free trinket to either gain free wards, scout out an area of the map from far away, or disable stealth. This combined with the 3-per-person limit on wards alleviated the all-too-common problem of the support player being the only one on the map placing any wards at all (of course players can still neglect to use their trinket but at least one player isn't expected to shoulder the burden anymore).<ul><li> Similarly, Season 4's attempts to improve the game play for support characters involved adding three new, upgradable, starter items which increased gold income. Only one of the three starter items may be purchased, and each items effects were carefully designed to ensure that they would only be a useful source of gold to support characters (mostly by making the effects stop working temporarily if a character actively kills a minion, the usual method of gold income). While supports will never make as much gold as other characters, these items give them a steady gold stream, this partially addresses a standard complaint that support were less fun because the inability to buy upgrades made them less dynamic and less useful during the final team battles.</li></ul></li><li> You can choose your attack-move behavior to either target the enemy closest to where you clicked or the first enemy that steps into your attack range.</li><li> You can also have Smart Cast show your skill's targeting reticle. Pressing the key will display the reticle, and releasing it will cast the skill.</li><li> As of pre-season 6, player vision wards now automatically upgrade, since players often forget anyway. Also, all players receive the "Homeguard" enchantment at 20 minutes, rather than having to buy it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a>: Any champion with an ability that Silences enemies (incapable of using abilities, cancels currently channeling ones, etc.) can do this. No crowd control lasts for more than a couple of seconds, but casters are rendered nearly helpless for the duration, making it feel very long indeed. Naturally, the few specialized <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MageKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MageKiller">Mage Killer</a> champions have this in their arsenal plus other abilities to capitalize on this vulnerable period.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a>: The League is host to several of pairs of champions who would love to see each other dead.

So, using only the abilities of the champion that one is playing as that does not utilize their autoattack allows a player to damage the enemy champions while their allied minions won't care at all. Avoid autoattacking the enemy champion if there are many minions nearby, and make sure the times you do autoattack an enemy champion have a superior payoff from the damage you'll take from those minions.<ul><li> The towers do the same. In fact, they will conspicuously <em>avoid</em> enemy champions, picking off the minions first - until you target or do any damage to an enemy champion.

When Riot decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">start over</a> with the lore and make a clean slate, things changed. Blatant Fanservice, while still continues in fun skins, was toned down in base champion appearances.

These champions arguably are a bit different from most ranged attack-damage-carries due to them needing to close the gap to hack away at you somehow, but their build paths are a bit more varied as they can also build tanky if needed or all damage they feel like it and are doing well because of it. But naturally, being close up without enough items to sustain said damage output carries some risk compared to the ranged carries.<ul><li> Indeed, there exist a few amount of DPS ability power champions as well, but instead of auto-attacks they revolve around a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpamAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpamAttack">Spam Attack</a> spell that deals fairly low damage, but also has a low cost and low cooldown.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOrGloryAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOrGloryAttack">Death-or-Glory Attack</a>:<ul><li> Knockback abilities tend to work like this. Successful uses put the enemy in places they <em>really</em> don't want to be in.

You can block off your enemies from escaping... or do the same to your own allies.

If the enemy team is trying to take the objective in large numbers, this will almost certainly be death for the instigator (since most abilities that might be used to escape are used to get close in the first place). If the gambit succeeds though, it's more than worth it since the enemy team will obtain 450 gold (Split across the team) for one kill while the player's team will get the bonuses for slaying Dragon or the Baron.</li><li> Tower-diving, especially when it's early on the game and <em>very</em> risky. If it can be pulled off, the diver gets a kill and demoralizes the enemy by showing that they can just walk into their safe zone and finish them off.

It's main passive is that every kill or assist adds a few stacks of Glory, which increases the AP of the item by a significant amount per stack. At max stacks and with a Rabbadons Deathcap, Mejai's gives the player a whopping 371 AP in addition to whatever AP they current have, allowing them to punch a hole through anything that moves, even cutting tanks down to size. However, after a single kill, <em>10</em> stacks of Glory are lost, which means the scaling power you got is cut in half, if not outright dropped. This incentivizes getting a huge kill streak and increases the penalty for dropping it, but as any player can tell you, getting max stacks of Mejai's is borderline euphoric and allows you to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> just about anyone that isn't a tank.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiminishingReturnsForBalance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiminishingReturnsForBalance">Diminishing Returns for Balance</a>: Why it's a bad idea to stack too many of a any role on a single 5 man team. Too many carries results in less gold and EXP for all of them and a squishy team, while an overly-tanky team cannot dish out damage fast enough, etc. Like any unconventional strategy, it can still work, it will just probably be harder.<ul><li> Armor and Magic Resistance plays with this. After a certain point the percentage of protection both offer to Attack and Magic Damage, respectively, will increase more and more slowly, though this slow in increase is misleading: effective protection still increases at a linear rate. The rule of thumb is, the effective HP you would gain from armor/resistance always increases at the same rate: having 100 armor is like doubling your HP to physical attacks and 200 is like tripling it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilityImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilityImmunity">Disability Immunity</a>: Averted. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindWeaponmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindWeaponmaster">Lee Sin</a> can be Blinded, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMute">Sona</a> can be Silenced, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiliconBasedLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiliconBasedLife">Malphite</a> can be Petrified, etc. despite the lack of sense that it makes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDominoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDominoes">Disaster Dominoes</a>: Perhaps not the most unforgiving game in the MOBA genre, but even small mistakes in the beginning can set off a chain reaction.

In general, if you ever get into a fight where you're outnumbered by the enemy, you're about to die.</li><li> There is one circumstance when lone-wolfing it can be effective: if you're going to "jungle". The jungler, instead of laning, goes through the forested areas in the middle of Summoner's Rift, leveling by fighting the neutral creeps that live there. In addition to freeing up his (meant-to-be) lane partner to gain his share of G and EXP, he also gets to create ambushes, or 'ganks' with his (in-lane) teammates. The jungler can also 'invade' or initiate incursions into the jungle on the side of the enemy, to steal resources from the enemy jungler.</li><li> Illaoi is also a possible aversion thanks to her ult, which spawns a tentacle for every enemy it hits. Since her tentacles can put out massive amounts of AoE damage (and heal her with every strike) Illaoi is the one champion practically <em>designed</em> to fight large numbers of enemies at once (she was the first character designed in the Juggernaut category after it was properly codified). Of course, she'd still <em>prefer</em> to have backup, but a fed Illaoi <em>can</em> potentially fight almost the entire enemy team at once on her own if they lack the burst to kill her quickly enough or the CC to lock her down.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a>: Averted. Although several items are very powerful in the right hands, there is no one strongest item in the game, or even a strongest set build of 6 items.

Most smart players will not use these abilities at the start of fights but rather will make a beeline for you if you're low, making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalWithdrawal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalWithdrawal">Tactical Withdrawal</a> a smart option in these cases.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Instant180DegreeTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Instant180DegreeTurn">Instant 180-Degree Turn</a>: Champions can run in one direction, near-instantly turn around to deliver an autoattack, then resume running, which allows things like "kiting" to be feasible. This is rather noticeable compared to DOTA and its more direct derivatives (which have a delay for turning around) and like all deviations from the original, whether this is a good thing or not depends on who you ask.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathRadius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathRadius">"Instant Death" Radius</a>: This tends to be the defining aspect of "hyper carries" other than item dependency. Once fed, entering the attack range of a Kog'Maw, Jax or similar champion <em>will</em> result in death even if there are three of you and the carry is alone. The only way to avert this is to lock it down with so much CC that it never even gets to attack.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">Insistent Terminology</a>: The characters are <em>champions</em>, not heroes. This was a move by Riot to distance themselves from DOTA and its more direct clones though some players (and even professionals on-camera) still refer to them as heroes for familiarity and brevity. This also extends to the classes; while Riot has the term 'Marksman' to represent champions who deal physical damage from range, players called them all ADCs after doing so for years, but you'll rarely see a Rioter use the term, always using the term 'Marksman.'</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition">Instant-Win Condition</a>: Knock down their Nexus and that team loses.

Items are bought using gold and have useful effects in and of themselves, but once you have the right combination of them, you click a button, pay some more gold, and turn them into a <em>new</em> item. The reason the <em>interface</em> is awesome is that it shows and allows you to purchase not only your current item's ingredients, but displays what items it goes into as well, allowing you to simply bring up the item you are ultimately planning to build, and just buy the pieces one by one as you gain the necessary cash.</li><li> Outside of the battlefield, there's a Hextech Crafting system that allows players to get champions and <em>skins</em> just by playing the game. How it works is that you get Hextech Chests by playing games and earning at least an S- rank (this can only happen 4 times a month and only with different champions), and they can be unlocked using Hextech Keys, which can be formed using 3 Key Fragments that randomly drop with every win (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">or you could just buy both of them</a>). Once unlocked, the chest will give you "Shards" of a random champion or skin (legendary and ultimates are possible!) along with "Essence." From there, you can either permanently gain the champion/skin Shard using Essence, "disenchant" it for Essence, or re-roll 3 Shards of the same type into a new one. There are also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareRandomDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareRandomDrop">"Rare Gems"</a> that drop... well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">rarely</a>, and with those you can purchase skins such as Hextech Annie or Soulstealer Vayne which are only obtainable through this system.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Joke Character</a>: Urf the Manatee, who attacks with a spatula. There was some debate as to if he'd actually be in the game since he was launched as an April Fool's joke, deleted, then brought back, and deleted yet again.

Worst of all is the carry or assassin who gets tons and tons of kills but plays so overconfidently and recklessly that they also have tons and tons of careless and needless deaths, meaning they're taking the lion's share of your team's kill gold and <em>taking it off the battlefield</em> while they respawn.

Some champions stand out, though, for having their skills arranged in a different way than the usual "3 active abilities on Q, W, and E, one ultimate ability on R, one passive" formula. Some have a second passive that you need to slowly rank up as you would a regular skill, and other shapeshifting champions have upwards of 6 or 7 abilities that change depending on what form the character is currently in.</li><li> There are also more champions being released now who are designed to be unusually functional to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metagame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metagame">Metagame</a>.

Standard operating procedure for mid-to-late game is capitalizing on kills and won fights by pushing towers while the enemy team is unlikely to defend successfully then plundering the enemy jungle to deny the enemy team further gold (in a kind of scorched earth tactic). This includes the highly-important Baron and Dragon camps.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">Poor Communication Kills</a>: One of the most avoidable ways to lose a match is to fail to communicate with your team. Your lane opponent went missing? Let everyone know. About to initiate a fight? Ping your target so everyone can follow up. An unguarded tower is being sieged? Speak up! Riot has taken note of how cumbersome it is to type some important messages (particularly if one is already under attack) so they implemented "smartpings" so calling "missing", asking for help, etc. can be done much faster.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep">Power Creep</a>: In a constantly-updating game with an already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">staggering roster of playable champions</a> with the design intention to make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes">each one play and feel unique from each other</a>, newer champions are usually given new mechanics that can help distinguish them from others, but may also seem scary to introduce simply due to their mechanical value in the form of utility that may counter a few existing characters (such as Cassiopeia and Poppy being able to block dashes or Yasuo being able to block projectiles), or their design to be a counterpick to a vast amount of what the current <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metagame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metagame">Metagame</a> suggests (such as Talon and Zed being AD melee assassins <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MageKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MageKiller">in the midlane typically occupied by AP caster mages</a>). This trope has always been kept in mind during champion development as to prevent unstable balance (hence Riot's tendency to nerf strong champions rather than buff weaker champions), but typically when a champion with meta-challenging mechanics are introduced, they will almost assuredly not be considered adequately balanced until the next patch <em>at the very least</em>.<ul><li> Perhaps the most notable case of this was the balance controversy of Irelia, who was designed to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">mobile assassin-bruiser,</a> which during the time of her creation, when most champions were either straight tanks or burst mages, was something risky to design for, but necessary for the game to evolve. Riot's solution was to overload her kit with an absurd amount of elements which would be considered excessive even by today's standards (Innate tenacity and lifesteal, an easily-to-reset gapcloser/damage nuke, true damage and point-and-click crowd control), which not only ended up frustrating players having to play against her due to how initially overpowered she was (as she could easily build into a tanky DPS who dealt massive damage and was unkillable), but also frustrated the balance team due to her kit now being a numbers nightmare. She wasn't considered balanced until a plethora of nerfs during Season 1 (hence the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Memes/LeagueOfLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Memes/LeagueOfLegends">"better nerf Irelia" meme</a>), and she now exists as a reminder to as to never design such an innately overloaded champion again.

Ever since the meta-game pretty much mandated a jungler on every team, there's an ever-present fear of being ganked at any time during the laning phase (unless the enemy jungler is visible and likely attacking someone else). Even junglers themselves are not exempt from this- there is always the real possibility that the enemy jungler will sneak in to steal buffs and pick a fight when least expected.<ul><li> Some champions have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibilityCloak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibilityCloak">Invisibility Cloaks</a>, like Teemo, Evelynn, Shaco and Twitch: they are <em>always</em> missing, and you have no idea why.

It generally only takes one time for players to get ganked while at Baron for them to never make that mistake again.</li><li> Similarly, most players know that if the entire enemy team is missing, <em>do not</em> wander off by yourself into an area with zero vision.

This was eventually retconned to make Tristana and Poppy yordles as well, with female Yordles having a "Megling" appearance and male ones having a more furry or hairy appearance.

This became less prevalent later in the game's history, to the point where any given female champion is just as likely to be dressed sensibly as skimpily. More modern female champions such as Kalista, Illaoi, and Taliyah, as well as their skins, are dressed and proportioned without fanservice in mind, as well as a number of modest skins like Barbecue Leona and Warden Karma. These are alongside pure fanservice skins, such as Blood Moon Elise, Pool Party Fiora and Bewitching Morgana, and now also extends to male champions like Pool Party Taric.<ul><li> Riot's come under fire for this again around the release of Kai'sa, a woman who entered the Void and emerged not only unscathed, unlike other Void-humans Kassadin and Malzahar, but as if she found a makeup kit and got a boob-job while within.

The Leona-Diana ship also took damage as well by making them complete strangers to each other, only meeting in the first place during Diana's slaughter.

It probably won't work by the late-game if the ranged carries are farmed up though and the teams are well-positioned, since spending your time and abilities to target the people which don't do much damage while ones that do <em>a lot</em> hit you with impunity is likely suicidal. Since healers in general have much more impact on the game early on before having their health restoration outstripped by increasing damage outputs, the bottom line is don't bother with this tactic later on.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a>: See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ShoutOut/LeagueOfLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ShoutOut/LeagueOfLegends">this page</a> for the exhaustive list.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillinessSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillinessSwitch">Silliness Switch</a>: Several comedic skins (especially the ones with a different voice) are this.

On one hand, newer champions (including ones with visual updates and new voice clips) can interact with one another with specific emotes to other significant characters relevant to their lore, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">sometimes referencing past events within the lore itself.</a> On the other hand, you can still have 2 allies fighting against each other or 2 rivals fighting alongside each other for no adequately explained reason. That said, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlotNoProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlotNoProblem">the gameplay is now intended to be completely separate to the continuing lore and is completely inconsequential,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra">so it's probably best not to question things.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallGirlBigGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallGirlBigGun">Small Girl, Big Gun</a>:<ul><li> Tristana is almost more gun than Yordle Gunner.

This is exceptional compared to its competitors. That said, most are lightly-built carries, marksmen, assassins, or supports.

In contrast to Demacia (which has a strict hierarchy for its leadership and military), basically <em>anyone</em> can rise to power if they are strong enough, which explains the assortment of somewhat unsavory characters that are allowed to be champions. Exemplified in its extreme form by Darius who declares things like "Strength above all!" and is on a mission to eradicate the corrupt Noxian nobility on the grounds that they've done nothing to earn their positions of authority, and in its more realistic form by Riven who believed that individuals with merit have a responsibility to lead those that do not (at least prior to being broken).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SockPuppet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SockPuppet">Sock Puppet</a>: A special form exists in this game. There are people who not only make accounts to keep at a permanently low level so they can beat newbies very easily, but also to sabotage other games because they won't lose anything if they get banned (though Riot can and <em>will</em> identify main accounts doing this and ban them too).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason">So Last Season</a>: It's almost inevitable that champions will have increasingly more and more impressive kits than their older counterparts despite Riot's best intentions to keep every champion balanced. Whether or not this makes them more <em>viable</em> for gameplay is debatable (and fans do debate it very often) but the undeniable fact is that many champions released have more utility or options in their abilities. Riot is countering this with remakes of champions with comparatively flat kits that are completely outmatched by newer ones.<ul><li> A more literal example are champions/team compositions that reign supreme one season then fall out of favor the next because of the cycle of nerfs. A good example is the "Holy Trinity" of ADC's (Corki, Graves, Ezreal) that dominated season 2 but have been equaled or surpassed by other carries' popularity in season 3. This isn't necessarily because of power-creep but more of Riot wanting to keep their game dynamic instead of falling into <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

Several traits of the realm:<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSpiritsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSpiritsAreDifferent">Spirits from it come in all shapes and forms</a>.

While described as largely nonphysical and abstract (and as such has never been canonically visualized), it's also said to have several distinct "locations" where certain spirits take up residence over others. Just for a few examples, the same plane of existence contains Bandle City (a mythical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage">Hidden Elf Village</a>, home to the nomadic, cheery yordles) and Mitna Rachnun (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnderworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnderworld">a kingdom of undeath</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Mordekaiser</a> is attempting to drag the land of the living into).</li><li> Magic is abound where the spirit realm touches Runeterra.

Some are also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecompositeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecompositeCharacter">Decomposite Characters</a> from DotA heroes; for example, Sniper's "canon" successor is Caitlyn, for having the counterparts of Headshot and Assassinate (Ace in the Hole) and his sniper motif. However, his skill Shrapnel went to Miss Fortune (Make it Rain), and Take Aim went to Tristana (Draw a Bead).</li></ul></li><li> Heck, competitive and in-game metawise, some of the newer champions are this to the older champions and vice versa due to the constant shifts of the meta and patch changes.

There's also summoner spell <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">Ignite,</a> the jungle Red Buff, the Deathfire Touch mastery, and any items with the "Immolate" passive, such as Sunfire Cape.</li><li> Stun: A <em>ton</em> of champions, mostly tank or support champions have some form of it. Aside from a vanilla stun that prevents the target from attacking or moving, it comes in a few similar variants as well.<ul><li> Root/Snare: It makes the target unable to move, but they can still attack.</li><li> Knockback: Stuns the target but also forces it move in a certain direction based on the ability's nature.</li><li> Airborne/Knockup: Stuns the target in place by knocking them directly upward. Typically, they can't be countered by Tenacity and the amount of time stunned cannot be reduced, but the durations don't last very long.</li><li> Pull: Some champions such as Blitzcrank, Thresh, Nautilus, Kled and Pyke have "hook" abilities that not only stun the target, but usually brings them towards them in some manner.</li><li> Suppression: Effectively the same as Stun, but can only be removed using Quicksilver Sash. Additionally, while the target is affected, <em>so is the user.</em></li><li> Stasis: Usually a self-inflicted buff/debuff that causes the user to be unable to attack/move, but will become completely invulnerable. This exists in champions such as Bard, Lissandra and those Devoured by Tahm Kench, as well as from the Zhonya's Hourglass item and its component Stopwatch item.</li><li> Entangle: Exclusive to Amumu's ultimate, which causes the target to be unable to move or auto-attack, but they can still use abilities.</li><li> Sleep: When applied on an enemy, it first marks them as "drowsy" for a moment, gradually slowing them before they properly fall asleep.

Rumble's passive makes him do this <em>to himself</em> if he overheats.

When the page refers to a Champion getting "fed", it means that s/he was the beneficiary of this vicious cycle... and because it only has to happen two or three times for the advantage to become insurmountable, the match can be all but over within ten minutes. However, a small relief is that champions on a 3+ kill spree will yield an extra gold bounty upon being killed (referred to as being "shut down" by the announcer). It's not much- it caps at 200 bonus on top of the usual 300 for really, really fed enemies- but it helps.<ul><li> Later, to help with the balance, the bonus is increased to 432 for champions with 3 consecutive kills, and 500 for 4+ kills.<ul><li> And to help further, while base kill gold only goes to the killer, everyone on your team gets a bonus if one of you shuts down an enemy, and if you die multiple times without getting kills you start giving less gold to the enemy, normally 250 but can be dropped to 150 at 3 consecutive deaths.</li></ul></li><li> In general, when a team has a large gold lead collectively (more kills, farm, and objectives) or controls more of the map (more towers destroyed and more wards placed) the game is very much in their favor. While mistakes do happen that can turn the tide of battle (a common example being getting caught out of position then getting yourself if not your teammates, allowing the enemy to counterattack while they have the numbers advantage), they are less and less likely the higher one goes up the ELO ladder. Most high-tier teams will capitalize on leads as hard as they can so that there's a little room for error as possible, making many games a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">Foregone Conclusion</a> as to who will win after seeing the gold counts as early as 12 minutes in.

In 2012, however, the stealth mechanics for Evelynn were fully revamped so that she's visible at close range, making it more of a sneaking mechanic than an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invisibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invisibility">invisible</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntangibleMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntangibleMan">Intangible Man</a> and the long-term stealth on Twitch was removed entirely.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUsualAdversaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUsualAdversaries">The Usual Adversaries</a>: It seems many champions got where they are because of Noxian generally-underhanded actions either for or against them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">Video Game Cruelty Potential</a>: Some champions are allies with each other or at the least on friendly terms in the lore. And of course if they're on opposite sides you can force them to kill each other over and over again. Go out of your way as Shyvana to have her kill her first friend Jarvan? Go ahead. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard">You Bastard!</a>.<ul><li> Though some champions, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Vi</a>, have dialogue that suggests they enjoy the chance to have a good all out fight with their friends without the risk of consequences.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense">Violation of Common Sense</a>: Some champions fit a particular role or archetype but have playstyles that directly contradict some cardinal rules of playing the role. Graves is a ranged carry whose kit encourages him to get <em>closer</em> to his enemies, Singed is a fighter who does the most damage running <em>away</em> from enemies or even running circles around them, Karthus is a mage who can get away with <em>intentionally dying</em> so that he can cast his spells uninterrupted, etc. Doing this on most other champions of the same type is likely suicide.<ul><li> Other champions get stronger as their health gets closer and closer to zero such as Olaf (or at least become more difficult to kill like Volibear). Most of these champions' potentials are wasted by doing the sensible thing and fleeing from losing situations; instead it may be smarter to fight it out and possibly come out on top.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualPaperDoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualPaperDoll">Virtual Paper Doll</a>: Skins put Champions in different outfits, sometimes with a hint of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf">What If?</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkItOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkItOff">Walk It Off</a>: Everyone regenerates health naturally... but to varying degrees of usefulness.

However, nearly all of them are genii that develop some impressive gear that specializes in bombarding the enemy with lots of ranged attacks then disengaging if they try to get in close. This is exemplified by the fact that they have <em>four</em> marksman champions that fight for it (five if one counts Jayce), which is far more than the other factions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakTurretGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakTurretGun">Weak Turret Gun</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">Double Subversion</a>. Towers will kill low level champions in only a few hits, and to stay relevant at higher levels they deal additional damage for every consecutive shot they land on you. However, champions outscale them, and by the end of the game a champion can solo a tower without dying. There's also the art of "tower-diving"&mdash;pursuing a limping enemy into tower range and securing the kill before the tower can kill you&mdash;which, with experience, can be done before ten minutes have passed.<ul><li> It was changed, towers were made substantially sturdier with no minions around. Very few champions can solo a tower even with 6 items, however a duo of tank and damage dealer will have zero problems.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeNeedADistraction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeNeedADistraction">We Need a Distraction</a>: See that guy? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitAndRunTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitAndRunTactics">That teammate who just ran into a crowd of enemy champs, provoked them into chasing him across the map, and then died</a>?

And if the enemy is chasing him, not only did your team gain a boatload of free time to knock down a turret or three, but they're likely not too intelligent. Why? Well, Singed LEAVES POISON GAS BEHIND HIM.

Ionic Spark, as the magic resistance/ability power hybrid item, plays with this: it punishes nearby enemies by zapping nearby enemies when they cast a spell, but also reduces their magic resistance.</li><li> Set 1 had the Dragon origin bonus, which granted full immunity to magic damage before being nerfed to 83%.</li><li> Sets 2, 3, and 4 have the Mystic trait, which instead grants team wide magic resistance depending on how many you have.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack">Armor-Piercing Attack</a>: True damage ignores enemy resistances, and some traits can grant either that or reduce enemy resistances.<ul><li> The Void set bonus from Set 1 and Set 3 causes all Void champions to do True damage.</li><li> In set 2, the Desert class reduces enemy team armor by 40 or 100%.</li><li> The Last Whisper item reduces the target's defense by 75% if hit by a critical hit for 3 seconds, while Ionic Spark reduces the magic resistance of nearby enemies by 40%. The burn items (Red Buff/Sunfire Cape and Morellonomicon) apply true damage over time as a burn.</li><li> Urgot in Set 3.5 deals repeated true damage when he manages to reel enemies into his belly, until they die.</li><li> Divine in Set 4 grants bonus true damage on top of the user&#146;s normal damage upon either falling to less than half health or making 6 attacks. Sett&#146;s unique trait in Set 4 is The Boss: after falling to 40% or less health, he leaves combat to do sit-ups, healing up. If he manages to reach full health again, all his attacks become true damage.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker">The Berserker</a>: The Berserker class in Set 2. Berserkers start each round by leaping at the closest enemy (as opposed to Assassins, who leap to the back of the enemy team) and have a chance of each of their attack splashing to hit enemies behind their target in a manner similar to Titanic Hydra.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeSpam">Blade Spam</a>: Blademaster synergy grants all their attacks a chance to strike up to four additional times.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargedAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargedAttack">Charged Attack</a>: Unlike in main game, mana meter in <em>TFT</em> is more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargeMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargeMeter">Charge Meter</a> that fills whenever unit deals or takes damage.

In Set 4, all of them gain the innate ability to critically strike with their spells.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquippableAlly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquippableAlly">Equippable Ally</a>: Yuumi was in Set 1, but not as a champion - she was an item made by combining a Spatula with a Needlessly Large Rod that makes the champion that equips her count as a Sorcerer (though she ended up making a proper debut in Set 4). The consumable "Neeko's Help" item is implied to work by having Neeko shapeshift into an extra copy of one of your allies (though Neeko herself also appears in Set 2 and Set 3).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatheringSteam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatheringSteam">Gathering Steam</a>: A trait of some characters, items, and traits.<ul><li> Units with Guinsoo's Rageblade, the Set 1 Wild synergy buff, or the Set 4 Duelist synergy buff gain extra attack speed with every attack. Wild and Duelist grant more speed per attack, but it's capped to a set number of attacks, while Rageblade starts slower but can scale until the battle ends. Set 3's Chrono bonus granted attack speed over the course of the fight&#151;initially as big &#147;jolts&#148; of attack speed every 4 seconds, before being reworked to grant a small amount of attack speed every X seconds (with X decreasing as you get more Chrono units.)</li><li> Some units have some innate in-fight scaling, whether finite or infinite.</li><li> Sets 3 and 4 play with this trope a bit more.</li></ul></li></ul>grants all your allies a bigger jolt of bonus attack speed every 4 seconds, making your entire team behave this way. Several champions also behave this way on an individual level&mdash;Shyvana in Set 1 gained attack damage and attack range after using her ultimate to transform into a dragon, Jinx in Sets 1 and 3 needs to get two takedowns to reach her full power each fight, Olaf from Set 2 gained attack speed, lifesteal on basic attacks, and immunity to crowd control upon using his ultimate, Syndra and Aurelion Sol from Set 3 gain increasing damage instances with each time they cast their ultimate each fight, and Kayle from Set 3 gains damaging waves of fire on her basic attacks for the rest of the fight after using her ultimate. Somewhat uniquely, Zed from Set 2 had the potential to form armies of copies of himself (since his clones could also make additional clones through their own ultimates), provided he and his clones weren't focused down before that could happen. Set 3.5 Urgot took a different track: his ability WILL kill its target, and reduces its mana cost each time he does so.<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWorkAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWorkAlone">I Work Alone</a>: Set 1 and 4 Yasuo's unique "Exile" trait triggers only if he's not adjacent to any ally when battle starts, giving him a shield that essentially doubles his health. Set 4 zigzags this by adding a trait bonus for having 2 Exiles&#151;if you control both Yasuo and his brother Yone, both of them gain bonus lifesteal from the Exile effect as well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaBurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaBurn">Mana Burn</a>:<ul><li> Set 1 Kassadin's passive skill drains some mana from enemy champion every time he attacks, and turns it into shield for himself. Averted for Set 3 Kassadin, who instead Disarms enemies with a pulse of energy.</li><li> Set 1 Demon synergy grants all Demon attacks a chance to drain opponent's mana pool for themselves.</li><li> Sets 2, 3, and 4 averted this for their spell-countering mechanics, instead preferring to stop mana from gaining entirely (Set 2 Hush and Soraka ultimate) or increase the targets' mana costs (Set 2 Poison, Set 3 Mana-Reaver and Shroud of Stillness, Set 4 Sylas, Kayn, and Shroud of Stillness).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyMultiplier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyMultiplier">Money Multiplier</a>: Set 1's Pirate synergy is the only one that doesn't provide in-battle boost; instead, it spawns a treasure chest with some extra gold after every fight with other player. Space Pirates in Set 3 instead grant a 50% chance for Space Pirates to grant 1 gold from champions they kill, with the 4-piece bonus letting them occasionally loot item components instead. Set 4 Fortune grants bonus orbs at the end of a victorious combat, akin to the ones you receive from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PvE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PvE">PvE</a> mobs&#151;the longer you went without a payoff while having the trait, the stronger the orbs you finally get on a victory become.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">More Dakka</a>: Set 1 Gunslinger synergy gives their attacks a chance to strike multiple targets at the same time. Set 3 Blaster synergy instead causes every fourth attack to fire multiple bonus targets at once. Set 4 Sharpshooter plays similarly, but is themed differently aside from Jinx.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsTheSameAnyMore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsTheSameAnyMore">Nothing Is The Same Any More</a>: Each new season of the game massively overhauls the roster and mechanics of the game&#151;the core mechanics remain the same, but the rest is subject to change.<ul><li> Season 2 of <em>Teamfight Tactics</em>, <em>Rise of the Elements</em>, completely overhauled almost the <em>entire</em> game. All of the origins were replaced with new elemental-themed ones, most of the classes (except Assassin, Blademaster and Ranger) were replaced as well, almost the entire champion lineup was replaced, several of the handful of champions who <em>weren't</em> replaced (such as Rek'Sai, Yasuo, or Volibear) were totally redesigned, and the items were shaken up considerably. Additionally, an extra row was added to the map to make it larger overall, and a new mechanic was added where certain squares on the map would manifest an elemental fountain which could be used to buff any champion placed on them at the start of a round.</li><li> Season 3, <em>Galaxies</em> (starting in March 2020), does the same, completely upsetting the champion lineup to a new set themed around the sci-fi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> skin lines (Odyssey, Star Guardian, Dark Star etc). It also replaces the elemental hexes with variant modes called Galaxies that appear in some games.<ul><li> Averted with Season 3.5, which merely replaced some champions and traits with others while reworking a few other traits.</li></ul></li><li> Season 4, <em>Fates</em> (starting in September 2020), replaces the sci-fi look with a spiritual one, with the Chosen mechanic (2* champions in the shop that have bonus stats and one double trait bonus) replacing Galaxies.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a><ul><li> Set 1 and 2 Veigar's <em>Primordial Burst</em> instantly kills its target if they're at lower star level than Veigar, unless they're protected by Kayle's <em>Divine Judgement</em> or Kindred's <em>Lamb's Respite</em>.</li><li> In season 2, if you could get a copy of Lux to 3 stars, her <em>Final Spark</em> would do 99999 damage to all enemies hit, which is a guaranteed kill (and Kayle was removed, while Kindred uses a different ability for their spell this time around). Fortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">this is really just in the game for laughs/bragging rights as it's (almost) completely impossible to get a 3-star version of Lux</a>, who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeTheRatingScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeTheRatingScale">Tier SEVEN</a></li><li> Many Set 3 4-cost and 5-cost champions approach this when three-starred&mdash;every fourth basic attack from a 3 star Jhin deals 4444% damage every fourth basic attack he makes, Cho'gath can deal 2000*AP magic damage that can become true damage with a set bonus, a 3 star Miss Fortune deals 999% max HP as magic damage over its duration, a 3 star Ekko deals 2000*AP magic damage to ALL enemies during his timestop, and Gangplank's ultimate deals 9001 damage in a very wide area he can make bigger with certain shop upgrades. (Other 4-costs and 5-costs tend to lean more towards much higher sustained damage or absurd utility effects.)</li><li> Urgot already does this!</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PercentDamageAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PercentDamageAttack">Percent Damage Attack</a>:<ul><li> Sets 1 and 2 Vayne's <em>Silver Bolts</em> work just like in the main game, dealing true damage based on her target's max health on every third attack.</li><li> Red Buff and Morellonomicon both apply "burn" status on opponents hit with, respectively, basic attacks or spells, causing them to take percent-based damage over time and reducing their healing. Set 1 Pantheon's <em>Grand Starfall</em> behaved similarly, dealing percent max HP magic damage and applying a healing-reducing percent-based burn. Set 3 Miss Fortune deals (rather high) <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AoE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AoE">Ao E</a> percent magic damage with her ultimate, while Set 3.5 Viktor deals percent magic damage on the first hit of his ultimate. Set 4 Kalista and Sett also have percent magic damage on their ultimates.</li><li> The Giant Slayer item caused your basic attacks to deal an extra 12% of the target's remaining health on hit. It formerly dealt 5% max HP true damage on hit. At present it averts the trope, though it still fills a similar role as an anti-HP item.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerEqualsRarity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerEqualsRarity">Power Equals Rarity</a>: Higher-tier champions only start appearing in mid-to-late game and almost always have higher stats than their low-tier counterparts, but they're also much harder to upgrade.<ul><li> Chosen in Set 4 are rare, snap picks that you can obtain that come as two stars, get bonus stats, and have one of their trait bonuses count double.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposefullyOverpowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposefullyOverpowered">Purposefully Overpowered</a>: In Season 3, tier 5 units have their abilities spike to <em>impossible</em> levels of power if you can get them to 3 stars, such as Xerath's Abyssal Bombardment going from a duration of 8 seconds and a damage of 440 to a duration of <em>45 seconds</em> (longer than an entire round) and a damage of <em>2500</em> (before AP scaling), or Thresh pulling <em>your entire bench</em> onto the battlefield to join your forces. This is because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">getting a tier 5 unit to 3 stars is basically completely impossible</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareRandomDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareRandomDrop">Rare Random Drop</a>: The Spatula is an item that has a small chance of dropping during PvE rounds and sometimes on special carousels. On its own, it does nothing, but it can be combined with another item to create unique equipments that grant additional traits to champions wielding them, mirror their attacks against another target, or allow them to bypass the unit limit.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetBonus">Set Bonus</a>: One of the core concepts of this mode. Each champion possesses two or three traits, describing their race or origin (Demon, Noble, Yordle, etc) and their gameplay role (Assassin, Guardian, Sorcerer etc). Deploying several champions sharing a trait grants a unique bonus that can apply to either one of them, all of them, or the entire team (even champions without said trait).<ul><li> There are two Set 1 origins that each only appear on a single unit and are therefore effectively extra passive abilities for them: Robot (Blitzcrank, gives him full mana at the start of the battle to let him open up by using Rocket Grab) and Exile (Yasuo, which gives him a shield equal to his HP if he starts the battle not adjacent to any ally).</li><li> In Set 2 there is one single-unit class<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1464kw');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1464kw" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1464kw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Lux's Avatar class is also unique to her, but rather than giving her an extra ability it instead causes her to count as 2 units towards her elemental origin, which is randomly selected from the elemental origins that other players haven't bought yet when you roll her in the shop and kept as her current element if you've already bought a copy of her</span>- Alchemist, which appears only on Singed and causes him to play like he does on Summoner's Rift, running around blindly spreading poison gas over everyone instead of attacking.</li><li> Set 3 Starship works like Singed's passive, but with a different AI (and mana gained over time that Aurelion Sol uses to launch a fleet of warships in a manner vaguely resembling a Protoss Carrier.) Additionally, Gangplank and Miss Fortune had the unique Mercenary class (which allows you to spend 8 gold to upgrade their abilities, similar to how you can spend Gangplank&#146;s Silver Serpents on Summoner's Rift), while Janna has the unique Paragon class, which does nothing for her directly, but instead enhances her entire team to cause Star Guardians to deal true damage with their basic attacks and all other allies to deal magic damage instead.</li><li> Set 4 has a number of unique traits at Tier 5&#150;Sett&#146;s The Boss, Azir&#146;s Emperor, and Kayn&#146;s Tormented, with Yone having a pseudo-unique he shares only with his low-cost brother Yasuo. It also features the Chosen mechanic, which allows Lux-style super versions of a trait by letting you occasionally find stronger versions of a champion with a double trait.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenDeath">Sudden Death</a>: If any fight lasts more than 30 seconds, the "URF Overtime" kicks in, granting all units massive damage and attack speed buffs, while also reducing crowd control duration and effectiveness of healing. However, if battle is stil going 15 seconds later, it simply ends in a draw and both participating players take damage.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Took a Level in Badass</a>, <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay">Badass Decay</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep">Power Creep, Power Seep</a>: Champions that appear in multiple sets are not guaranteed to have the same abilities between them, meaning some can become higher tier and some can become lower tier.<ul><li> A couple of champions who made the transition from Set 1 to Set 2 were remade to be more powerful than before-Kha'Zix was promoted from Tier 1 to Tier 4 and Zed was promoted from Tier 2 to Tier 5. Possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverted</a> with Ashe who, despite being promoted from Tier 3 to Tier 4, was made arguably weaker by her origin changing from the overpowered Glacial to the initially underpowered Crystal and her ability changed from her ultimate, Enchanted Crystal Arrow, to her basic steroid, Ranger's Focus. Some champions saw this inverted&mdash;Yasuo went from Tier 5 to Tier 2, for example.</li><li> Some champions from Sets 1 and 2 saw similar changes in Set 3 incarnations, whether playing it straight or inverting it. Malphite went from a 4-cost using his ultimate to a 1-cost that gets his passive, while Kassadin went from a 1-cost unit to a 3-cost one. Thresh went from a 2-cost unit that granted an <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AoE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AoE">Ao E</a> shield to a 5-cost that can pull allies 'from your bench', while Lux went from being a 7-cost god capable of giving incredible damage and synergy bonuses to a 3-cost regular Sorcerer with an <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AoE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AoE">Ao E</a>, damaging stun ability. Miss Fortune is a unique case&mdash;while she remains a 5-cost in Set 3, she deals %max HP magic damage instead of flat damage this time, and has much more synergistic set bonuses than her Pirate synergy in set one.</li><li> Set 4 sees even more&#151;Yasuo becomes a 1-cost unit, Aatrox and Ahri are promoted to Tier 4, Azir is promoted to Tier 5, Vi is demoted to Tier 2...</li></ul></li></ul><p></p></div><p></p><hr>
