It is loosely based on the Russian novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RoadsidePicnic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RoadsidePicnic">Roadside Picnic</a></em>, as well as the visually stunning Russian film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stalker">Stalker</a></em> by Andrei Tarkovsky, which was based on the novel. The game is somewhat of a combination of the two, taking the novel's general premise and combining it with the atmosphere of the movie to create a truly haunting game experience.</p><p>The game takes place in the Zone of Exclusion (known simply as the Zone) around the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chernobyl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chernobyl">Chernobyl</a> Nuclear Power Plant, a bleak and terrifying "Man-Made Hell" following the nuclear accident that originally created the Zone, as well as a mysterious second explosion in 2006 which resulted in the creation of bizarre, seemingly impossible space-time anomalies and homicidal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mutants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mutants">mutants</a>. The Zone is full of dangers, from lethal pockets of radiation, to packs of dangerous mutants, and a wide assortment of violent, body-crushing anomalies. Nonetheless, fortune-hunting trespassers known as "Stalkers" make a living exploring the Zone and seeking out the miraculous "artifacts" created by the Zone's anomalies.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Tales among the Stalkers tell of a legendary artifact known as the "Wish Granter", located at the very center of the Zone inside the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant itself. The legend goes that the Wish Granter will grant a Stalker's heart's desire. However, no Stalker has managed to reach the center of the Zone, as the path is blocked by a powerful barrier known as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Brain Scorcher</a> which melts the minds of any humans who attempt to penetrate into the Center.</p><p>In <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl</em>, players take the role of the Marked One, a mysterious amnesiac Stalker who awakens in the Zone with nothing except a strange "S.T.A.L.K.E.R." tattoo on his arm, and the knowledge that he has a mission... to kill someone or something known as "Strelok" (Marksman). The Marked One's search for Strelok, and his interaction with the various inhabitants of the Zone and conflicting Stalker factions, will eventually lead him on a path to the Center of the Zone, the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, and the legendary Wish Granter itself.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p><em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky</em> is a prequel to <em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em>, with the player taking the role of a veteran Stalker mercenary named Scar who is recruited by a secret faction known as Clear Sky to investigate the cause of mysterious emissions from the Center of the Zone that pose a threat to all of the Zone's Stalker inhabitants. Besides an assortment of graphics and gameplay tweaks and improvements, <em>Clear Sky</em> features a new Faction Wars system, where the various competing factions in the Zone struggle for power and control via assaulting and defending various capture points (sort of like a single-player version of the <em>Battlefield</em> series, with an RPG game world thrown in on top for good measure). Players can join a faction and help them fight their way to victory, or ignore the Faction Wars completely and progress through the game's main quest.</p><p><em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call Of Pripyat</em>, the third game in the series, is a sequel to the original game. Unsurprisingly, the Russian-language version (which came out several months before the EU and US versions) was almost immediately translated by modders. It takes place a few days after <em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em> with the player taking the role of SBU (&#1057;&#1083;&#1091;&#1078;&#1073;&#1072; &#1041;&#1077;&#1079;&#1087;&#1077;&#1082;&#1080; &#1059;&#1082;&#1088;&#1072;&#1111;&#1085;&#1080;/Security Service of Ukraine) Major Degtyarev who is charged with investigating the attempted military takeover of the Zone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">Gone Horribly Wrong</a>. <em>Call of Pripyat</em> is notable for taking place in a completely different part of the Zone from the other games in the series - <em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em> and <em>Clear Sky</em> take place fairly close to the Zone's southern edge, while <em>Call of Pripyat</em> takes place deep within the Zone's northern half.</p><p>All three <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</em> games are highly renowned for their incredibly atmospheric setting and realistic gameplay, but be warned; they're not for the faint of heart - all three games are brutally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a>, and are also known for being extremely creepy at times. Other than that, the games are also known for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">hilariously buggy</a>, almost to memetic levels.</p><p>The first proper sequel, <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em>, was <a class="urllink" href="http://www.1up.com/news/stalker-2-announced-gsc-game">announced<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> at GamesCom. However, on December, 2011, it was announced that GSC had been forced into closure, though the team promised that the development would continue. The game was indefinitely put on hold in January 2012. In its stead, a majority of the development team broke off to create a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a>, called <em>Survivarium</em>, but the rights of the franchise remains with GSC. Another outfit, West Games, which also claims to employ some of the original team, announced their own follow-up called <em>STALKER Apocalypse,</em> but <a class="urllink" href="http://www.pcgamer.com/areal-devs-are-back-want-money-for-stalker-apocalypse/">questions surrounding its legitimacy<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> quickly came up, including some calling it an obvious scam. GSC, meanwhile, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2014-12-10-its-a-hard-time-for-ukraine-but-a-good-time-to-be-a-proud-ukrainian">has reopened<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, and has released <em>Cossacks 3</em> in 2016.</p><p>GSC announced in May 16th, 2018 that they were working on S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 once again and were planning to release the game in 2021. Not much is known about the game, other than that the X-Ray engine used by previous installments in the series has been replaced with Unreal Engine 4, since most of the devs who had experience working with X-Ray had moved either to Vostok Games or 4A Games after the collapse of GSC. After a long period of silence, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 was finally announced as a temporary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxSeriesXAndS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxSeriesXAndS">Xbox Series X (and Series S)</a> exclusive on July 23, 2020.</p><p>Similar to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1">Half Life 1</a></em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanRemake">Fan Remake</a> of <em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em> titled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/LostAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/LostAlpha">Lost Alpha</a></em> has been released. Like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackMesa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackMesa">Black Mesa</a></em>, <em>Lost Alpha</em> is big enough in scope that it's a standalone game all on its own. It is available for free on ModDB <a class="urllink" href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/lost-alpha">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

There are literally hundreds of friendly and hostile NPCs in the game world. Precisely two of them are unkillable. As for the rest, <em>every single one</em> can be killed off at any point in the game, including story-important and mission-important characters. It's not at all uncommon to be given an assignment to meet with a certain character to obtain information, only to find a pack of wild dogs picking over his corpse and being forced to scavenge the info from his PDA.<ul><li> A few missions that threaten your relationship with different factions can be completed just by waiting for the environment to kill off the person you've been asked to assassinate.</li><li> Even <em>Sidorovich</em> can be killed.

In Shadow of Chernobyl, the Loner Petruha is the guy who gives you the information on where Nimble is being held. Due to bandits constantly spawning nearby, it's highly likely that he'll get killed by the end of the game.

A special forces Vintar BC sniper rifle loaded with SP-6 rounds can take down even a mighty Exosuit Stalker (who can normally soak 2-3 mags of assault rifle fire) with just 4 torso shots. Also, NATO weapons actually deal less raw damage than AK weapons, but are listed as having higher damage in the weapons stats because their 5.56mm ammo has significantly better armor penetration and thus are noticeably more effective against human enemies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmsDealer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmsDealer">Arms Dealer</a>: In <em>Call of Pripyat</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nimble becomes this.

All occurring independently while the player is off doing their thing. Tactically, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameAI">combat A.I.</a> is pretty damn good too, being able to flank, use cover, circle around the player through buildings and behind obstacles, and even silently follow you from behind to shoot you in the head when they got close enough.<ul><li> The camps themselves are pretty good looking too. Some NPCs patrol the border, while most sit around a campfire, drinking coke, eating sausages, or playing the occasional guitar tune. Some go to sleep when night appears, making the transition between day and night all the more realistic.</li><li> <span style="display:none">invoked</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> states the A.I. actually had to be <em>toned down</em> because in early builds, it would regularly and consistently outsmart the player, to the point that the game became outright frustrating - and eventually completely unplayable. The original pre-release A.I. apparently would have been more than capable of beating the game <em>entirely without player intervention</em> if it hadn't been dialed back. Digging around in the game's files reveals that much of their behavior is strictly limited to keep the game playable - in <em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em>, for example, they are unable to heal each other, loot bodies, throw grenades, or intelligently avoid environmental hazards, not because the programming isn't there, but because the devs were worried that if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance">Artificial Brilliance</a> got <em>too</em> brilliant it would stop being fun. These abilities, and others, were gradually reactivated in later games. If you play a mod or a later game where they can throw grenades it becomes obvious why that was removed, as they're pinpoint accurate with them and even in the best situations they can kill you in one shot.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Artificial Stupidity</a>: As mentioned, the A.I. does not recognize environmental hazards, and as a result traveling NPCs will often walk right through Anomalies, leading to their death by crushing/eruption/electrocution/etc.<ul><li> Fixed in <em>Call of Pripyat</em>, at least with NPCs who are part of your squad. They will deliberately and exactly follow the player's path through anomaly-filled areas in order to stay safe.</li><li> In <em>Call of Pripyat</em>, some NPCs will continue to enjoy a relaxing, slow-paced stroll, during an emission. Or inexplicably decide that the current safe building about five meters away isn't safe enough after just starting a patrol to have it interrupted by a storm, and run off in a random direction instead.</li><li> As discussed below, one of the biggest A.I. bugs in the original <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</em> was the AI's tendency to end up mysteriously dead around fireplaces. Community research discovered that the AI kept spawning <em>inside</em> the fireplaces and burning to death; it wasn't uncommon to find entire camps bereft of life. Although later sequels avoided this issue, it was never fixed in the original and modders were forced to compensate by rendering the AI immune to fire damage, or force spawnpoints to keep them away from the firepits.</li><li> In <em>Call of Pripyat</em>, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">nearly impossible</a> to get the best result for one mission due to the friendly NPCs throwing grenades while inside a building, completely ignoring the walls and the ceiling. Despite being outnumbered two to one, they'll likely kill themselves long before the enemies would have. There are some serious consequences if they get killed so your best bet is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">save scum</a> your way through.</li><li> The A.I. in general has real trouble dealing with large numbers of weak mutants. Even a mighty Master Stalker in exosuit armor can often fall to more than 3 or 4 dogs at once.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseNuclearPhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseNuclearPhysics">Artistic License &#150; Nuclear Physics</a>: Radiation is treated as evil mud that will kill you if you forget to wash it off, either with magical anti-radiation pills or drinking enough vodka. Obviously, gameplay-wise, this beats dying a slow, hideous death for going the wrong way.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtShift">Art Shift</a>: The characters in the ending <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cutscene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cutscene">cutscene</a> of <em>Call of Pripyat</em> are played by actual humans (the same people who their in-game faces are modeled on) instead of computer-drawn characters like in <em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em>. This is most glaring when comparing all the new characters to Strelok, who (being based on his <em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em> appearance) is computer-drawn instead of played by a live person.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>:<ul><li> Most of the artillery a player encounters is necessarily left right where it's found: The Chernobyl periphery is a big place, and though it's <em>possible</em> to take on an extra ten kilograms of equipment, it will diminish your capacity to travel at any rate faster than a hobble, and that way lies madness. The best armor in the game supports its own weight and lets you carry an extra five kilograms above even that, but it also prevents you from sprinting, so one may be left wondering why he bothered in the first place.</li><li> In <em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em>, there comes a time in the story where the player's quest becomes a linear and steady approach towards its conclusion, with a minimum of backtracking and plenty of formidable enemies in the way. It's not difficult to anticipate this section of the game, even on a first-time playthrough, so before embarking, a player may calculate that sprinting will be a negligible asset. If you make that decision, you're destined to be a tank: The Exoskeleton will give you another twenty kilos to fill with explosives, and since you won't be running anyway, it's literally no problem to overload yourself with an additional ten kilos of sniper equipment. It's a good way to keep the admittedly weak endgame feeling fresh with a little bit of destructive variety.</li><li> The rocket launcher comes with a severe deficiency of ammo and a weight that could singlehandedly push you from comfortable to immobile. It is, however, extremely useful for taking out the squad of mercenaries that attacks the rookie village - a single well-placed rocket will kill all six of them, which is good because that one rocket is pretty much all you're guaranteed.</li><li> In <em>Clear Sky</em>, you can upgrade the exoskeleton to make yourself nearly bulletproof, and the extra weight capacity makes it practical to use a light machine gun, turning you into a walking tank. This is a tremendous investment though, and requires you to play nice with Duty.</li><li> In <em>Call of Pripyat</em>, one of the final upgrade tiers for the exoskeleton removes the inability to sprint, making it essentially the best armor of the game. In the same game, it's possible to buy large quantities of grenades and rockets after completing the right sidequests<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0jo98');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0jo98" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0jo98');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">although you need to have a certain amount of money in your inventory before traders will start stocking them</span>, which makes them a lot more useful.</li><li> First-generation night vision sounds useful, but all it really does is apply a green filter over everything - in some cases making it <em>harder</em> to see in the dark. Second-generation night vision averts this by applying a lot more contrast to the picture.</li><li> There is no reason anyone should need to use a Desert Eagle in the Zone, given how impractical it is compared to the other .45 pistols. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">This doesn't stop anyone</a>. (At least the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICallItVera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICallItVera">Big Ben</a> has the excuse of shooting much, much bigger bullets.)</li><li> The RG-6 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeLauncher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeLauncher">Grenade Launcher</a>. It's a weapon powerful enough to take on most any enemy in the Zone, as it uses rifled grenades (duh). But there are several drawbacks that severely limit its usefulness: 1) it has the worst reload speed out of any weapon, 2) the grenades have a rather steep arc, which can be very precarious at close range and forces you to aim carefully, 3) the splash damage can hurt or kill any neutral or friendly NPCs that might get caught in the middle of a firefight, 4) its ammunition is quite rare and expensive a piece, and 5) the weapon itself is extremely rare, quite expensive to repair and impossible to upgrade in the later games. You're probably better off using your under-barrel grenade launcher instead, if you can find it. Or better yet, the OTs-14 Groza's or FN F2000's integrated under-barrel grenade launchers.</li><li> Most of the higher-level NATO weapons are highly accurate, fast-firing, and hit like a bus.

The Ukrainian Military frowns upon these activities, yet ironically, a few of their superiors have been known to be involved in the trade thanks to their willingness to accept bribes from other people, and, in accordance to one particular superior in <em>Clear Sky</em>, also because of the crappy payroll the Military makes in the Zone thanks to the country's shifty, uncaring government.

Also, the lethality of headshots depends upon the weapon you're using.

If you really want to turn your weapon into an accurate headshot machine, you'll have to pay the resident mechanics in their respective maps for upgrades, and, depending on the weapon, it can cost you an arm and a leg for a full service. To make things more complicated, the upgrades are separated into tiers, and once a particular upgrade is chosen, the other gets locked out forever. This turns painful once you realize that a few certain weapons you might stumble upon can only be obtained once, and thus, you must choose your upgrades wisely.

So naturally in the former slot assault rifles are dominant, with their large magazines, high rate of fire and fair-to-good performance over all ranges. <em>Call of Pripyat</em> lifts the restriction to allow two slots for any weapon to be taken, but assault rifle/pistol or assault rifle/shotgun are still the most common choices. A fully-upgraded AK-74 and a pump shotgun can be picked up within the first hour of play and can see you through to the very end of the game.</li><li> Don't forget most of the early-mid game weapons, like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KineticWeaponsAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KineticWeaponsAreJustBetter">MP5, AK-74, AN-94, Walther P99, Browning HiPower, Colt 1911, and TOZ-34.</a> None of them are flashy in any way, but all use common ammo types and perform well enough to get the job done.

The vast majority of the firepower you come across will be Russian-made (as is only logical since you're near Chernobyl) and while they aren't very accurate, they also are <em>very</em> sturdy and cheap, and their late-game cousins like the Storm or the AS VAL hit like freight trains.

Once the unnamed stalker does indeed stumble upon one (i.e. you, the player character), both he and Sidorovich are astonished to see a stalker still alive among the corpses of the destroyed Death Truck. Even more surprising is the fact that he is the only stalker to ever come out alive from the Death Truck with the marked tattoo on his arm. He is then given the moniker "Marked One", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who later becomes prophetically influential to the game's and its sequel's storylines</span>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> To elaborate, the Marked One is actually a veteran stalker named Strelok. In his backstory, he actually managed to reach the CNPP with a miniature band of other stalkers before thanks to finding a map which reveals a secret pathway that would bypass the Brain Scorcher and lead them to not only Pripyat itself but the power plant. They only failed to get to the main area of the CNPP because of a door that was code-locked by the C-Consciousness to prevent any stalkers from revealing the true secret of the Zone. Strelok and his group were forced to retreat from the power plant because of this impasse, but not before the C-Consciousness unleashed an emission in an attempt to assassinate them. Strelok and his group were somehow able to survive it, but he managed to get wounded in the process. They then dragged themselves to a secret bunker known only to them and managed to create two decoders (one which would be given to Strelok) in an attempt to unlock the door they couldn't open. However, once they attempted to go back to the CNPP, they found themselves being chased by the Clear Sky faction and Strelok's group disintegrated in order to save themselves from the new threat. Strelok continued on to the CNPP until he was incapacitated by Scar, and one of his comrades, Fang, hid in an abandoned hotel in Pripyat and stored his goods, including one of the decoders, in a safe before he got gunned down by a Monolith sniper. Then the gigantic emission at the end of <em>Clear Sky</em> came and wiped out the Clear Sky faction. Strelok happened to be caught in the blast and he was knocked unconscious. The C-Consciousness, finding a host for their ulterior motives, attempted to program the now unconscious stalker caught in the emission to kill the very stalker that had been trying to dig too deep into the secrets of the Zone, unaware that the stalker that they've brainwashed is the same stalker that they're trying to assassinate. The decoder that Strelok had in his possession was then taken by C-Consciousness and destroyed off-screen. This concludes the events of <em>Clear Sky</em>. And thus, the events of <em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em> began to unfold.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight">Developers' Foresight</a>: In <em>Call of Pripyat</em>, if you buy and receive a weapon from Nimble, the resident special <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmsDealer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmsDealer">Arms Dealer</a> in the main <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaharanShipwreck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaharanShipwreck">Saharan Shipwreck</a>, a shady stalker will stop you from going out and claims that the recently purchased weapon of yours belongs to him, believing it to have been stolen from him. If you try entering or exiting out the main entrance, this scripted event will occur. However, if you choose the alternate entrance by getting aboard a wrecked tugboat conveniently moored next to the ship with a wooden plank and/or not have the supposedly stolen weapon in your inventory, he'll be unaware of it and act as any normal NPC would.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Dirty Coward</a>:<ul><li> Professor Semenov, who throws a hissy fit when he's asked to go get samples and refuses to go until Marked One comes along to change his mind. When a blowout knocks Marked One out, he argues with Sakharov over leaving him.</li><li> Magpie, a rookie in <em>Call of Pripyat</em>, chickened out during a Chimera hunting expedition and ran off with the supplies of the team he was with. Gonta, one of the expedition's members, has sworn bloody vengeance over him, and finding the chickenshit is an actual quest line.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">Disc-One Nuke</a>: All three games have their own.<ul><li> <em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em>:<ul><li> There's a Merc Suit hidden in the attic of one of the houses of the Rookie Village. Getting there requires some roof-jumping, but as the best Tier One armor, it'll go a long way until you can fork over the cash for a Stalker suit or get lucky with stashes.</li><li> The <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OTs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OTs">O Ts</a>-14 5.45mm is often sold by Sidorovich in the early game (before you speak to Wolf and after you've rescued Nimble) for 20,000 RU. Needless to say, it's highly unlikely you'll get this amount in time. You'd need to gather all of the loot in the first map and maybe some of the second to amass the amount needed. However, it's a <strong>very</strong> useful gun in the early game, as it is a high tier assault rifle chambered for an ammo type common throughout the entire game. The only other way to get it is to loot it off a dead Duty stalker, Barin, and that has the problems that either A) you have to kill him yourself and make an enemy out of the faction that controls the Bar area, or B) you have to wait until he's killed by bandits or mutants, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a> at best.</li><li> A lesser (but still unusually overpowered) nuke is Strelok's fast-shooting AK-74. You can pick it up in the tunnels underneath Agroprom, where you need to go for one of the first big missions anyway; it's placed so close to the objective that it seems like it was <em>meant</em> to be found by starting players. It fires 50% faster than the standard AK with substantially reduced recoil when fired on auto (which makes it seem unnaturally accurate), uses common 5.45mm ammunition, and is just as supremely reliable as a regular Kalash. When loaded up with armor-piercing rounds, it's useful throughout the endgame.</li><li> Picking up a couple of Flash or even Moonlight artifacts is ridiculously easy if you know where to look in the Agroprom underground, and wearing two Flash artifacts or one Moonlight artifact makes your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SprintMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SprintMeter">Sprint Meter</a> recharge faster than it depletes, meaning infinite sprinting provided you aren't overburdened. With those equipped, the game world opens up dramatically and the fairly heavy energy drinks are irrelevant unless you go over the initial weight limit.</li><li> As soon as Sidorovich's mission in the Agroprom is done, the road north is open. From there, it's child's play to pick up a VSS in <em>perfect</em> condition, left abandoned on the floor of a dormitory in the Freedom base. A box on the roof immediately above it contains a lot of good ammunition for it. With it, you're free to pummel <strong>any</strong> group of stalkers out in the open even before you talk to the Barkeep. It makes the Dark Valley missions absurdly easy. For reference, the VSS is a silenced sniper rifle that fires as fast as a semi-auto pistol, and with the right ammo can kill even Exosuit Stalkers in just 4 torso shots or 1 headshot.</li><li> In the same vein as the Vintar above, a savvy player can net a whole lot of good gear by heading from the entrance of the Bar straight into the Army Warehouses. The initial Freedom squad killed by Skull's team yields a few decent NATO guns; if you tattle on Skull to Freedom and head with them to ambush the invading Dutyers, you can net yourself an AS Val for when the VSS scope is too unwieldy and lots of high-level guns and grenades (<em>without</em> pissing off Duty as long as you don't shoot at Skull's squad); the next mission from Freedom is an opportunity to nab yourself a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunsAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunsAreJustBetter">SPAS-12</a> for a step up from the sawn-off; and finally, in the Barrier defense mission, at least one Freedomer is bound to be killed and leave a juicy G36 for you to swipe, along with all of the gear from the dead Monolithians.</li><li> One not-so-powerful nuke that depends heavily on luck but isn't exceptionally hard to get is a stash location at Agroprom that nets you a universal silencer. A rifle with it attached is way more flexible for stealth than the Noiseless PB1s pistol, and makes the military outpost in the same area a breeze to clear if you're the violent kind.</li><li> Between the Rookie Village and the crashed truck in the Cordon, there's a box that, when broken, yields 400 9x18mm rounds, way more than you need early on. At the entrance of the vehicle graveyard near where you enter the Garbage from the Cordon, a similar thing happens: two boxes on top of a tower with a broken ladder can be shot open, containing over a thousand high quality 9x19mm rounds, just in time for the player to score a MP5. Keeping this ammo equals never having a dry sidearm, and seeling it earns you a tidy little profit early on.</li></ul></li><li> <em>Clear Sky</em>:<ul><li> Scar's old VSS is up for grabs in the Great Swamp, near the train tracks. It's totally broken, but putting together the cash to repair it is not as difficult as it may seem at first, and ammo for it is not too hard to collect if you trade with the right stalkers. Given that the VSS is an endgame-level weapon, being able to acquire it on the first map if you know where to look is really something.</li><li> There's a hidden stash at the top of the Swamps that requires some exploration to reach as well as dodging a heavily irradiated spot. Reaching it rewards you with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PixelHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PixelHunt">well-hidden</a> Veles detector, making artifact hunting a trivial affair.</li></ul></li><li> <em>Call Of Pripyat</em>:<ul><li> Inside the Skadovsk, the first real hub of the game, Nimble has set up shop. You can place special orders for high-quality weapons and armor, including the vaunted Exoskeleton, from him at <em>any</em> point in the game. The prices are somewhat steep early on and he demands an initial pay, but judicious artifact and gun trading with Beard and Owl quickly makes cash a non-issue.</li><li> Within the first hour, you can go to the sawmill and one of the zombies will always carry an AN-94. While in poor condition, it is easily repaired for cheap (very easy if you grab tools while at the sawmill), but is very accurate, reliable, and uses 5.45mm ammo that is extremely common early on. Plus, you can get a scope added to it for cheap if Owl stocks one. It will more than last you until you can pay Nimble's prices for a Storm.</li><li> You can find a VSS in perfect condition right after the beginning of the game, provided you know where to look. It's on top of one of the burnt-out houses in the burnt farmstead. There's also an SVD up for grabs leaning against one of the trees on the northwest edge of the map.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDropYourWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDropYourWeapon">Do Not Drop Your Weapon</a>:<ul><li> Averted in that severely wounded human NPC characters (the guys rolling around on the floor in need of medkits) will drop their weapons. Of course, if they're not wounded, then they'll hold onto their weapons until they die. However, grabbing their weapon and then healing them can doom them, because they'll pull out their pistol and continue fighting. Most likely they'll get killed, so watch it if you pick up any weapon you see to strip it of ammo.</li><li> Also averted by the player: heavy melee hits and some psychic attacks can send your weapon flying halfway across the room. Which is sort of a bad thing, considering whoever tossed your weapon is presumably still right in your face and busy clawing it off. Fortunately, the knife is impossible to pry away from your hands.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotRunWithAGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotRunWithAGun">Do Not Run with a Gun</a>: The default movement speed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">contrary</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunDontWalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunDontWalk">to most first-person shooters</a>, is walking (or if you're packing light, jogging really slowly), and sprinting is the only time you actually run.

The mutant population (mostly large packs of Snorks and dogs, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">a lone Pseudogiant</a> near the local anomaly field) is thriving and there's radiation hotspots all over the place in <em>Clear Sky</em>. Monolith controls the area and set up several patrols and outposts, while assaulting on a regular basis the barricade Freedom set up to cordon off the area in <em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em>. On top of that, it's right into the range of the Brain Scorcher. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's also where it's control bunker's entrance is hidden</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedByCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedByCanon">Doomed by Canon</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">Dropped a Bridge on Him</a>:<ul><li> The player character of the prequel <em>Clear Sky</em>, Scar, is speculated by fans to become <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the brainwashed Monolith leader, Charon, that Strelok blows away in Pripyat during the first game</span>, due to his use of a VSS Vintorez - Scar uses such a weapon in Clear Sky's opening, which can later be retrieved, and one log in SoC mentions a man with a Vintorez doing a deed that Scar does in CS, further associating Scar with the weapon, while <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Charon is the only NPC to use the weapon in <em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em></span>. It's speculation at best, however, as this was never confirmed.</li><li> Some other minor NPCs, such as Wolf, are mentioned in passing in <em>Call of Pripyat</em> as having died. One or two you might have killed, such as Wolfhound, whose custom .45 "March" can be bought from Nimble. Wolfhound was a mercenary leader who was chasing after Kruglov, and ordered his men to fire on the Marked One; chances are he shredded Wolfhound without a second thought. Then there's Max, whose custom sniper rifle is also available from Nimble. Nimble mentions having bought the rifle from Max, but depending on how you played <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoC">So C</a></em>, you might have seen Max die at the hands of a Duty squad you were supposed to help take out, or you might have killed him yourself with the help of said Duty squad.</li><li> It's also inverted, in that some NPCs from earlier games who, owing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">the nature of the game</a>, might have ended up dead in your playthrough, will appear in <em>Call of Pripyat</em> alive and well. One in particular (Guide) actually plays a role in the plot (albeit a minor one), another (Nimble) is your main source of high-end weaponry in the game, and a third (Petruha) plays a momentary role that could go entirely unnoticed. In <em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em>, the first game in which these characters appear, it's entirely possible for both of them to die - in fact, it is actually fairly <em>likely</em> for all of them to die, as Guide sets up camp in a rather dangerous locale, Nimble stays at the rookie camp and will charge into battle against mercenaries and military with nothing but a leather jacket and a Makarov, and Petruha and his crew are at the auto park, where bandits constantly attack. Coming back to find Guide butchered by wildlife and Petruha being roasted over the fire at the bandit camp isn't uncommon.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a>:<ul><li> <em>Clear Sky</em> ends like this, in order to set up the plot for <em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em>.</li><li> All but two (three if you're charitable) of the endings to <em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em> are like this.</li><li> <em>Call of Pripyat</em> has a modular ending similar to the one in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em> consisting of some 20 static scenes.

It was likely cut simply for being too large and uninteresting, especially as story rewrites cut down the amount of quests in the game significantly. It has since been restored in both the Lost Alpha mod and the Oblivion Lost mod.</li><li> A map called "Generators" was cut from the game without having a clear purpose, much to the chagrin of players given its incredible, otherworldly design. It was placed somewhere near the CNPP but it got canned with the story rewrites. Once again, most mods restore it, although its remote location and lack of relevance to the rest of the Zone means that it won't be visited much.</li><li> Another map, "Dead City," was cut when the game's story underwent rewrites. It was going to be a plot critical location where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Marked One would rescue Doc, who would inform him that he is actually Strelok and set him on the journey to unlock the true ending</span>, and the city was split between Mercs and Bandits, both of which were hostile to the player. Strangely, despite being completely modeled, textured, mapped, and having been given proper spawns, the map was never used in any of the games. It was also home to several named NPCs, all of whom got cut with the map. Modders, however, typically add the map back in.</li><li> Some of the remaining code could cause serious issues; for example, the Yantar lab was still technically affiliated with the Duty faction in the final game, and this could cause a vital NPC to become hostile to the player after waking up from the Blowout if the player was Freedom-affiliated at the time.</li></ul></li><li> Many types of mutants were cut from the game at various stages of development:<ul><li> The ones that were nearly complete were the burers, cats, and chimeras, all of which had their models, textures, and relevant scripting. There's no word on why they didn't make it into <em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em> (altough <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry. It should be moved to the TRIVIA tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that GSC couldn't get the burers' AI to work quite right before release), but the burers and chimeras were re-added for <em>Call of Pripyat</em>, while the cats haven't been seen in any vanilla entries.</li><li> Zombies were originally going to behave more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent">Romero Zombies</a>, being shambling, desiccated corpses that required headshots to put down completely. They had a unique variant called the Izlom, a horribly distended zombie that would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningOnAllFours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningOnAllFours">run on all fours</a> towards the player, giving the Zombies are faster variant to keep players on their toes. When re-added by mods, it becomes clear why they were cut: Izloms didn't fill any unique role that boars, fleshes, and pseudo-dogs didn't already, and the slow bullet sponge zombies were pathetically easy to fight or bypass.</li><li> Early on in the development cycle, Lab X-18 was going to be inhabited by two races of mutant dwarfs, with the final boss being a "dwarf king." Said mutants were modeled and textured but ultimately never coded properly, and their basic design and combat functions were repurposed for the burers.</li></ul></li><li> A shocking number of weapons were cut from the game, at various stages in development, including a double-barrled hunting shotgun with ludicrous damage, a minigun, the FN P90, two heavy machine gun variants, the Browning High-Power Pistol, the MAC-10, and several enhanced variants of weapons that were already implemented. Of these, the hunting shotgun returned (with a serious damage nerf), as did the heavy machine guns and the Browning High-Power Pistol.</li><li> The Faction Wars mechanic that had been cut from <em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em> was reimplemented in the sequel, <em>Clear Sky.</em> However, it was notoriously buggy in the best of times and outright unstable at worst, and ultimately it didn't create the more lonesome, atmospheric gameplay experience that the games were angling for, leading to it being dropped for <em>Call of Pripyat.</em> As with almost all of the cut content, it is often re-enabled by modders.</li><li> Several mods unlocked the original game content - and eventually releasing an official "development build" patch (at least, for the Russian version). You think the game wasn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> enough? <em>You'll have to fight your way through a zombie assault right after exiting the bunker <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithThisHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithThisHerring">with a knife and a handgun</a></em>.</li><li> <em>Lost Alpha</em> is a complete reconstruction of Dev Build 1935, with some additions (such as a major story rewrite and a complete retooling of most of the levels to be larger, due to the presence of vehicles). It is released as a free stand-alone game that doesn't require a <em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em> install to play.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DwindlingParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DwindlingParty">Dwindling Party</a>: In <em>Call of Pripyat</em>, once you finally reach Pripyat, you'll rendevous with a platoon-sized group of allied military Spetsnaz soldiers, who serve as your allies for the 3rd and final act. Over the course of the Pripyat missions, this force of a few dozen special forces soldiers will gradually be whittled down by Monolith ambushes and mutant attacks to just 3 to 6 soldiers, plus you, Strelok, and the last member of your 4-man party (the other 3 members having left on their own to pursue their own agendas).<ul><li> Ironically enough, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Monolith faction</span> becomes this in the same game. If you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">choose to stay in the Zone after completing the final mission, they're down to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand">Last Stand</a> until you purge them of their existence.

Each tier of upgrades requires a higher-level set of tools, and the third set can only be found in Pripyat itself.

He also has the common sense of staying behind you and refusing to rush into an area that you haven't already cleared of hostiles, instead giving you covering fire from the rear and likely bagging a few kills of his own. "Third-rate fighter" my nuts.</li><li> <em>Call of Pripyat</em><ul><li> The finale, where you have to escort the Military survivors through the city fighting through zombies, mutants, and finally several waves of Monolith fighters.

The prequel <em>Clear Sky</em> added some more complex anomalies, even those that affect the ground. The sequel <em>Call of Pripyat</em> gives us Chimeras, Burers, and a lot more creative anomalies.</li><li> <em>Clear Sky</em> also has this as the premise of the plot &mdash; someone is making the Zone go crazy, spawning more blowouts that grow bigger and bigger and shutting off access to some well-travelled areas, and Clear Sky wants to find who's doing it, and end them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms">Fun with Acronyms</a>: <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</em> stands for "<strong>S</strong>cavenger, <strong>T</strong>respasser, <strong>A</strong>dventurer, <strong>L</strong>oner, <strong>K</strong>iller, <strong>E</strong>xplorer, <strong>R</strong>obber" according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">Game-Breaking Bug</a>: Enemy-thrown grenades in <em>Clear Sky</em> will quite literally <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">home in on the player</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Roboteching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Roboteching">actually changing direction in mid-air</a> to ensure that they always land at the player's feet.<ul><li> Also, <em>Clear Sky</em> applies the same firing randomisation rule to shots by the player that they do to shots from the enemy. That is, you have to <em>actually</em> hit your target, then the game essentially rolls a dice to check if you hit your target.</li><li> The infamous "permanent radiation sickness" in <em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em>: in places like the Garbage or Army Warehouses if one ventures too far up the hills or tries to leave the general "playing area" the radiation counter almost instantly jumps to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">eleven</a> in order to provide "incentive" for the player to turn back. Now, there are a couple of places in the Zone where the engine detects you as being out of the intended playing area, even though you are not, and afflicts you with the aforementioned permanently increasing rad-sickness that <strong>never goes away</strong>. If you save the game after getting it you're pretty much screwed. The only known solution is to reload an earlier save. Take note, people who save each game on top of the last one. Also - be extremely paranoid about this when venturing into the train tunnel at the Garbage.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">Game Mod</a>: A lot of cut content can be restored by tweaking the configuration files, and many mods use this to rebalance the game and fix various issues.<ul><li> The Zone Reclaimation Project (ZRP) is largely a bug fix mod designed to address the numerous issues not fixed by the final official patch. It also has a number of optional quality-of-life changes, including equipment repair, sleeping bags, improved NPC navigation, the ability to equip friendly NPCs with better weaponry, etc. Overall it's the best way to play a more polished version of the game without drastically changing the gameplay or plot.</li><li> Shaders MAX is a shaders pack designed to tweak the graphics without making any changes to gameplay. Some of the more noticeable features include bump mapping to textures, a more pronounced day/night cycle, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealIsBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealIsBrown">Real Is Brown</a> filter to make the in-game environments more closely match the pre-rendered cutscenes. Can be installed over ZRP or some other mods without issue.</li><li> <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Complete</em> is a mod designed to massively overhaul and modernize the graphics and also make adjustments to the gameplay, without drastically altering the story or mission flow like other major mods such as <em>Lost Alpha</em> or <em>Oblivion Lost</em>. However, it hasn't been updated in a while and is built upon an outdated version of the Zone Reclaimation Project, leading to it having quite a few bugs of its own. It also makes the game much easier (weapons are more accurate and deal less damage, the player has a higher carry weight, and NPC's eyesight and hearing range have been reduced significantly).</li><li> <em>Call of Chernobyl</em> is a free-play sandbox mod created by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamEPIC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamEPIC">Team EPIC</a>, with a focus on free-roaming rather than a linear plot (although you can still journey to the Wish Granter for an "ending"). It combines the maps from all 3 games into a full recreation of the Zone, and mostly uses the polished game systems from <em>Call of Pripyat</em>. Like <em>Lost Alpha</em>, it's a stand-alone game .exe. It features 32 explorable maps, reworked level design, A-Life Overhaul and much other changes upon the game. It had earned it's right place as Mod of the Year in 2015 &amp; 2016.<ul><li> A series of repacks and modifications built upon <em>Call of Chernobyl</em> have been released over the past few years, some of the most notable ones being <em>Last Day</em> and <em>Anomaly</em>. One of the most recent releases is <em>Demosfen</em>, which brings in several new maps, changes to existing ones (to name one, the Bar is huge now, with a very detailed underground), tons upon tons of new artifacts, and a trove of quests and missions to pursue, but you'll need some knowledge of Russian to play it, as there is no proper English translation for it just yet.</li></ul></li><li> <em>Lost Alpha</em> and <em>Oblivion Lost</em> are focused around creating an entirely new version of the game based on the original pre-release design documents, before GSC had to make major cuts to release the game on time and on budget. They feature significant gameplay, map, and graphics overhauls as well as a significantly expanded plot, and should be considered more of a dramatic remake rather than a remaster. <em>Lost Alpha</em> is a stand-alone .exe while <em>Oblivion Lost</em> is installed over the original game. <em>Lost Alpha</em> takes some liberties with the plot in order to "fill in the gaps", while <em>Oblivion Lost</em> is more true to the original GSC design documents, but is a native Russian release with a partial English fan translation.</li><li> <em>Autumn Aurora</em> and <em>MISERY</em> are focused on major graphics and gameplay overhauls to make the game significantly more atmospheric while also dramatically increasing the difficulty.<ul><li> Special mention has to go to the MISERY mod, a partial conversion mod that <em>drastically</em> alters the gameplay and pacing of the game, besides the graphical makeovers of using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealIsBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealIsBrown">Real Is Brown</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunPorn">introducing more weaponry</a> as well as many other things. This mod is also <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">crushingly difficult</a></em> for the uninitiated (as if the vanilla version wasn't already hard enough): imagine <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> in Hardcore Mode but dialing it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>.

NATO weapons are used heavily by Freedom and the Mercs, while Warsaw Pact weapons are used heavily by Duty and the Military. Loners use whatever they can find, and Monolith has access to the best weapons from both sides.<ul><li> This could be justified.

Freedom relies on guerilla attacks so the more accurate and powerful NATO guns are better for them, while Duty probably have a preference for Warsaw Pact weapons due to being mostly former Ukrainian army soldiers.</li><li> As of <em>Call of Pripyat</em> NATO guns are somewhat more accurate, pack more power per hit and tend to come with a wider range of accessories while Warsaw Pact weapons are more durable, less prone to jamming and easier to find ammo for.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGreyMorality">Grey-and-Grey Morality</a>: The Duty and Freedom factions, neither of which are particularly good <em>or</em> particularly bad despite being diametrically opposed to each other.<ul><li> Soldiers are usually trigger-happy, but most stalkers are indeed illegal trespassers on military territory.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>: <em>Call of Pripyat</em> demonstrates this trope with the "tools" you need to find in order to be able to upgrade your weapons and armor. Gear has 3 tiers of unlockable upgrades, and there are 2 main technicians in the game who can upgrade your gear, which means that there are 6 of these tool sets available in the game. For each technician, you need to find tools for basic work, tools for fine work, and calibration tools. The game tells you at the start that these exist, but it doesn't tell you ANYTHING about their location. Even if you were to come across them, they don't look like anything out of the ordinary, and can EASILY be mistaken as just some some random metallic rubbish lying around, like an old tin of tuna or similar. Seeing as COP takes place in 3 separate, large, open environments, which each have multiple well detailed areas and buildings to enter, many of which are filled with garbage due to being abandoned and rotting, finding these tools becomes highly unlikely without using a guide. Considering these tools are essential in upgrading your weapons and armor, which are extremely important in a game like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. where character upgrades exist in almost no other way, this can cause players a lot of grief, as they end up using under-powered equipment against difficult enemies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunAccessories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunAccessories">Gun Accessories</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunTwirling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunTwirling">Gun Twirling</a>: You actually do this when pulling out any pistol equipped in your weapon slot in <em>Call of Pripyat</em>, including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon">Black Kite</a>.

They never go out or even dim - at most, a low-tier NVG set will sporadically flicker a little. A few game mods aim to fix that by making them run on limited batteries; MISERY is one example.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">Infinity -1 Sword</a>:<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeLauncher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeLauncher">RG-6</a> in <em>Call of Pripyat</em>. It's the third most powerful weapon in the game and lacks the accuracy of the Gauss rifle or the splash damage of the RPG-7, but you can buy it from traders relatively early in the game and ammunition is a lot more common. Besides, with 6 grenades loaded it doesn't really matter if something survives the first one. On the other hand, it takes about an entire year to reload from empty, grenades can be tricky to come by in significant numbers before hitting Pripyat and getting good rep with the Stalkers in Zaton/Duty in Jupiter... and of course, like the RPG-7, it cannot be upgraded at all and is still quite heavy.</li><li> The RPG-7 also in <em>Call of Pripyat</em>. It deals the most damage out of any weapon in the game, being able to kill any human and any mutant that isn't a Pseudogiant in one hit (the Pseudogiant takes two shots to kill it). The major drawbacks of this weapon are 1) the rockets and the weapon itself are restrictively heavy to carry, 2) you'll hardly be able to find them in all but two locations in the game, 3) you won't find them in traders' stock until you meet certain achievements.</li><li> The Lightened L85 is dropped by Master, the target of the assassination given by Snitch in the Bar. Master has an Exoskeleton, but is neutral by default and you have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> attack of the knife. Kill him, grab the gun and run away before Master's unique shotgun and Exoskeleton-toting buddy reacts. This peculiar L85 deteriorates <em>far</em> less than the vanilla version, is way lighter and has an integrated suppressor, meaning it doesn't get damage and accuracy penalties for being silenced. If used with pragmatism, it will carry you to the end of the game.</li><li> The SSP-99 armor and L-R 300 rifle. The former, also known as the default Ecologist armor, has the best protection levels against anomalies (second behind it's armored variant) but piddly physical protection and can be obtained for free in stashes or, in <em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em>, if you save Kruglov and go to Yantar after. The latter is the default weapon of Mercenaries and, while having the lowest stats for a NATO rifle, is plenty common among Mercs and later Freedom and outperforms all Warsaw Pact 5.45mm weapons.</li><li> The Eliminator in <em>Call of Pripyat</em>. While not the most powerful weapon, it is quite lightweight for a shotgun, and is the only weapon of its class to mount a scope. It can easily dispatch any mutant that isn't a Chimera or Pseudogiant and even Exoskeleton-clad mooks aren't immune to the sheer power of this shotgun. With the right upgrades (especially with the full auto mod), you'll become near unstoppable, and it only gets better when shotgun shells are easy to come by and are cheap as dirt. The only thing to consider is its strenuous reload time. Of course, it's unlikely there will be anything left alive after using up the full magazine, and you can feed in a shell or two during the firefights. There's also only three or four places where you can be certain to find it, only two of which will be available to you before the halfway point. Some artifact hunting will get you enough money to pick one up from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmsDealer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmsDealer">Nimble</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">within a couple hours</a>.</li><li> Strelok's unique Sig 550. While somewhat heavy, by the time you pick it up, chances are you won't care as much about weight. When fully upgraded, it can match both top-tier NATO weapons for hitting power and while it is less accurate than the G36 and has a lower rate of fire than the F2000, it has better handling and unlike either of them can mount every NATO accessory, giving you a weapon that can act as a marksman rifle and an assault weapon, while still mounting a silencer, grenade launcher, and a variety of scopes. Finding it is relatively simple, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">once you know where to look.</a></li><li> Any of the guns that utilize 9x39mm ammo; they are more useful towards the later half of the three games due to their ammunition appearing more commonly at that time and they hit like a bus despite their subsonic velocity (which contributes to the bullets having a very notable arc after firing, thus lessening the chances of a headshot) and hefty weight per ammo carried.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a>: The Gauss Rifle, a hilariously powerful experimental semi-automatic rifle that can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> literally any enemy in the game and can only be obtained from Monolith troopers at the very end of the main story. Balanced out slightly due to ammo being virtually impossible to find before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoReturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoReturn">Point of No Return</a> and very low rate of fire. Game Mods often gimp it to be only useful against humans and weaker mutants, and it was changed to just that in <em>Call of Pripyat</em>.

Cardan will offer six homemade batteries for 2000 rubles each <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after you show him the rifle and complete the little miniquest in the lab located in the Iron Forest area in Zaton, which is located at the very southwest corner of the map</span>, and you can repeat the process for as long as you have the dough.<ul><li> The FN F2000 in all three games. A balance of above-average firepower, precision and reliability, comes out of the box with a grenade launcher and a scope integrated <em>and</em> uses the common 5.56x45mm ammo. You get it in <em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em> by looting the bodies of Monolith troops in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">the Sarcophagus</a> (or, iwth a <em>lot</em> of luck, in a stash in the Red Forest) and in <em>Clear Sky</em> after crossing all of Limansk-13, right before reaching <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">the Chernobyl NPP</a>. It loses this status in <em>Call of Pripyat</em>, where you can get one at the beginning of the game if you can give enough money to order an assault rifle from Nimble and some luck.</li><li> A bug in <em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em> means that the humble combat knife can kill every living thing and destroy every destroyable object - including <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUPR2WFRPxc">armored personnel carriers<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> - with just one strike. This is surprisingly useful against the psychic Controller mutant, who doesn't have a melee attack and is essentially defenceless at close range.

Between armor, medkits, anti-rads, a handful of artifacts, and ammo, you'll only have room left for two or three guns (which is all you should be carrying anyway) before breaking the weight limit, leaving little room for extra hardware.

Headshots from anything will still kill anyone not wearing an Exoskeleton, and even those can be brought down with one armor-piercing assault rifle round to the head.<ul><li> With late-game armour and health artifacts, the player is quite capable of shrugging off automatic gunfire, at least from a single enemy.<ul><li> In SoC, if you're lucky, you can encounter a bandit with <em>three</em> Meat Chunk artifacts in the Junkyard. Put these on together with anti-bleed and you're a freaking walking tank, because the artifacts' effect <em>multiplies</em> instead of adding. High instant damage, however, will still kill you, and since each Meat Chunk makes you 10% more vulnerable to damage overall, so your increased metabolism comes at the price of taking significantly more damage.</li></ul></li><li> Played straight in <em>Call of Pripyat</em> too.

Justified, since they're, well, brainwashed and ignoring damage.<ul><li> Averted by a large number of enemies though, especially depending on difficulty and weapon used. Most bandits are poorly armoured thugs that go down with little trouble.

On the other hand...<ul><li> You can use your knife to slay certain mutants, especially Burers, as they obviously can't use guns. Really, the only mutants that are too impractical to use the knife on are Chimeras and Pseudogiants, since they deal too much damage to even try. In a subversion, the knife can be useful against zombified stalkers, provided that you don't get in their line of sight and you approach quietly. Their reflexes are far slower than those of a normal human, making them valid targets.</li><li> In <em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em>, one arena match in Rostok forces you to use the knife against a Stalker clad in an Exoskeleton and brandishing an F2000. However, you also receive about four grenades in the match to hopefully get the drop on that guy.</li><li> It's also the best weapon to keep equipped when going stealthy. Why? Because the games have this irritating habit of having you draw your weapon when you load a save file, and when you have a gun or the binoculars as the last wielded item, that action makes enough noise to alert hostiles that something's up. And if you have grenades or bolts equipped, when you load a game the player character <em>always</em> switches to the noisy-to-draw binoculars. The knife doesn't have that problem.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewAgeRetroHippie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewAgeRetroHippie">New-Age Retro Hippie</a>: Ganja, Freedom's barman in <em>Clear Sky.</em> Comes complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reggae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reggae">reggae</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FzuK1SyaOY">music<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoner">and a fondness for the 'erb</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus">As an added bonus</a>, his name literally means <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">"marijuana"</a> in Indian.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!</a>: The "Good" and Canon Ending in <em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em>, as seen in <em>Call of Pripyat</em>.

To quote <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ZeroPunctuation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ZeroPunctuation">Zero Punctuation</a></em>, the average player will likely find themselves pressing quicksave and quickload more often than the Fire button.

This is especially noticeable with the 9x39mm weapons, which use a heavy subsonic round with limited range due to bullet drop. Sniping with a Vintorez, for example, is an affair with a learning curve. There is but one exception, and that is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticWeapons">the Gauss rifle</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCanonForTheWicked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCanonForTheWicked">No Canon for the Wicked</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The best ending of <em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em> is made canon in <em>Call of Pripyat</em>, so any chance of Marked One making a selfish wish is denied.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeDifficulty">Non-Indicative Difficulty</a>:<ul><li> The difficulty settings in <em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em> and <em>Clear Sky</em> pretty much only influence what percentage of NPC shots will "glance" and not hit the player, and how much damage they do to both player and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">Non Player Characters</a> when they hit. Due to a programming oversight, the player has the same resistance on all difficulties. Once you learn how to score headshots reliably, the enemies still have a harder time killing you than you killing them.</li><li> <em>Call Of Pripyat</em> averts this, removing the "glancing shot" system in favor of a linear damage scale to the player. This has the effect of making the game substantially easier than the other two installments due to the player's relative health being much higher on settings lower than Master difficulty.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHeroDiscount" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHeroDiscount">No Hero Discount</a>:<ul><li> Mostly averted, as doing quests for factions causes respective traders to give you better prices (for gear bought and sold). Additionally, in <em>Call of Pripyat</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a fellow military technician (you play an undercover government agent) repairs your gear for free. If you elect to stay in the Zone after the evacuation, this technician is replaced by Uncle Yar, who performs the same service</span>.</li><li> Also reversed... or something. Sidorovich pays you less for loot compared to Barkeep or Sakharov, mostly because he sells to newbies at lower prices and deals mostly in smuggling non-combat things <em>out</em> of the Zone.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver">Non Standard Game Over</a>: In <em>Call of Pripyat</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when Beard asks you to retrieve a strange glowing artifact in a wrecked ship east of Skadovsk, after retrieving said artifact from the ship, as you try to leave, a Stalker named Tuna stops you and asks for that artifact you have, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">claiming a friend of his is dying</a>. If you refuse to hand it him, either by telling him that you indeed have it but keep it for yourself, or lie to him that you don't know what that artifact is (highly recommended that you <em>don't</em> take that option), his two buddies will stop you at gunpoint and warn you to not make any sudden moves. You have about five seconds of free movement to attempt an escape (unless you took the third option, which means you won't get any free movement). If you just stand still and let Tuna walk to you, he angrily demands that you hand over that special artifact. If you still refuse to hand it over, you get a bad cutscene where Tuna stuns you with his rifle butt and tells his buddies to shoot you dead. If you do this, there's no way to control your character, as it's a scripted event. The only way to avoid this is by either handing over the artifact to Tuna or shoot him and his buddies down when you refuse the first time. The latter option is better because an important achievement is unlocked after doing this quest, which also contributes to one of the game's many endings</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoScope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoScope">No Scope</a>: It's not uncommon to see players laying in ambush with a sniper rifle at close range in multiplayer matches, as the sniper rifles are much better at piercing armor than the shotguns and the handling penalty doesn't factor in when you stand still for a couple of seconds. The VSS Vintorez in particular is used more often as an assault rifle than as a sniper rifle because of its great handling and full-auto mode with a high rate of fire.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheIntendedUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheIntendedUse">Not the Intended Use</a>:<ul><li> Mutants have a limited <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">MGS-style</a> area they can move in. You can actually shoot from outside this area. This makes killing even the most dangerous mutants like the Chimera and Burer a sniper's cakewalk. However, if you don't manage to kill them, one hit will cause them to run away from whoever is shooting at them until either they encounter another opponent or go back to loafing off when no one else is around attacking them.</li><li> The knife is the weapon of choice for a stealthy player, but not because it's capable of silent kills, not really. Its main attractive point is that it makes zero noise when drawn or holstered. Upon loading a save, thanks to an irritating bug, the player character will pull out either the gun (or the binoculars if you had it or the equally silent bolts) last drawn or holstered, and that makes enough noise to alert enemy stalkers. This doesn't happen if you save with your knife drawn.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoWomansLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoWomansLand">No Woman's Land</a>: You will be very hard pressed to find a single female character in any of the games of any kind.

Of course, actually getting close enough to do so is so difficult that this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell">practically useless</a> unless your target doesn't know you're there, and even then they <em>will</em> notice you if you're less than a meter away, so you have to rush and stab. It's also a surprisingly viable option when forced to engage a Controller or Burer up close - all weapons take too long to recock when pulling them back out after a psi attack or when you have to pick them back off the floor after a disarming psi-pull.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a>: Zigzagged. There are few places where you can go on alone and take out an entire base/lair full of heavily armed soldiers and/or mutants, and still come out alive. In other places you have to rely on numbers to complete your objectives.<ul><li> In the first game, right at the beginning, you can tell a group of stalkers to sit out and let you do your thing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Rambo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Rambo">Rambo-style</a> on a car park full of bandits that are holding a semi-important NPC, Nimble, hostage. The leader, Petruha, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellPlayer">will call you out on it if you do so</a>, and if you come back to his group without completing your objective, he'll mock you for being a wussy and won't give you any support. Complete the objective by yourself and he will be astonished at your success.</li><li> Played straight in <em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em>, and, depending on the skill of the player, can be taken to ludicrous levels. It's not impossible to rack up kills into the four digits, and keep in mind, <em>every man in the Zone</em> is dangerous. Even the rookies are competent with firearms, to say nothing of the well trained and well equipped military, the experienced and deadly Duty &amp; Freedom factions, and the other various Stalkers who come to the zone and face down terrifying monsters as part of their daily job. You can pick fights with all of these people. And win.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTimeDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTimeDungeon">One-Time Dungeon</a>: In <em>Call of Pripyat</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Pripyat Underground becomes inaccessible once you (and your four-man party, if you manage to have any of them survive the grueling trip) have reached Pripyat itself. After completing the hospital ambush in the map, you can talk to the guide to have you travel back to the train station. Once there, you can ask the mechanic about trying to go back to the Underground, to which he will say that once the elevator was activated while you and your buddies were on it, the power to that particular shaft went out for good as soon as it reached the bottom. However, there is nothing of particular importance in the Underground to think of aside from a couple of artifacts that you likely had picked up in some empty containers next to the control room that led to the unlocking of the door in the middle section of the Underground, so it isn't worth a bother to stress on</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OptionalStealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OptionalStealth">Optional Stealth</a>: You can either play the games by focusing on firepower and noise be damned, or go for the stealthy route with night movements, silenced weapons and a total lack of detection.

They still retain enough intelligence to fire and reload guns (with reduced speed and accuracy compared to a normal stalker), but they are unable to heal themselves and still shamble about, mumbling incoherent fragments of sentences. If you have mods that reactivate the dummied-out code for them, you can encounter more "traditional" zombies, but they're much more resistant to damage than regular zombies, requiring several good hits to the head (and then some) to take them down permanently.<ul><li> And some mod zombies are actually semi-transparent glowing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/HalfLifeFullLifeConsequences" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/HalfLifeFullLifeConsequences">zombie ghosts</a></em>.

They took numerous trips there in order to make the gameworld as close to reality as possible, with the only significant changes being that places of interest are put closer together, as trekking through the empty countryside for 5 hours in real time would be boring. The actual town of Pripyat and NPP are also amazingly detailed, from building exteriors to small things like old Soviet-era propaganda posters, foliage and sounds. And as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">Reality Is Unrealistic</a> example states above, they also managed to create one of the most realistic ballistics models ever with the X-Ray engine, with correct bullet drop calculation and real life firearm specs being just the icing on the cake. One example is the British L85A1 rifle, whose early models in real life had very poor reliability and so were pulled from mass production; STALKER's lore actually plays on this and states that the decommissioned rifles made it to the Zone via the black market. Of course this is reflected in gameplay as well, with the L85A1 having a ridiculously low reliability rating and starting to jam after the <em>third mag</em> of firing. Likewise, the subsonic 9x39mm rounds have fantastic performance against armor, but awful range as they start dropping much faster than their supersonic equivalents, just like real 9x39mm rounds.<ul><li> And that just begins to scratch the surface. Another good example is the drug "Vinca", which appears in <em>Call of Pripyat</em>. The in-game description lists it as "Ukrainian Vikasolum, the artificial equivalent of Vitamin K. The drug increases the blood's coagulation rate, causing small wounds and lacerations to close up faster." Guess what? Although the drug's in-game effects are (understandably) stronger than one would expect, the drug is real, and the effects and description are 100% accurate to its actual purpose.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterGeometry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterGeometry">Sinister Geometry</a>: The Monolith.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnipingMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnipingMission">Sniping Mission</a>: At one point in <em>Call of Pripyat</em> you are charged with sniping the local Mercenary leader and their employer representative during the meeting.<ul><li> Grab yourself a VSS Vintorez and every mission turns into this.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSoulless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSoulless">The Soulless</a>: The Monolith faction.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a>:<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metro2033" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metro2033">Metro 2033</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroLastLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroLastLight">Metro: Last Light</a></em> are considered by many to be the successors to this franchise.

They're not a huge threat due to their poor accuracy. They're still tough, but they go down easy enough if you hit them in the head. Oddly, they're smart enough to scavenge better weapons and more ammo off their zombified compatriots, but they're completely incapable of climbing ladders. They're also largely deaf and rather lacking in the eyesight department, to the point where you can get right up behind them simply by <em>walking</em> even whilst wearing the Exosuits, which are about as stealthy as a clown at a mime convention.

On top of being so remote and secretive many people doubted it's existence, the population was extremely distrustful of non-residents, mumbling to themselves and constantly praising the Soviet regime even during food shortages. In addition, the inhabitants of the smaller villages nearby always had violent headaches when they stayed nearby, something he blames the radio research center the city housed and their massive antenna for. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The research center studied possible applications of mind control via radiowaves, with the antenna being the first field test of their research.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruceZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruceZone">Truce Zone</a>:<ul><li> The Yanov train station in <em>Call of Pripyat</em>, out of necessity. It's the only building in the area that is safe from emissions, free from anomalies, and large enough to house a sizable population of Stalkers, so the Duty and Freedom detachments sent to that area of the Zone have agreed to treat it as neutral ground, allow each other to operate freely within the immediate vicinity, and work together to defend it. Once you're out of sight of the train station, however, the two factions are still openly at war, and it's implied that the main Duty and Freedom commanders (who are on the other side of the Zone) are unaware of the train station arrangement.</li><li> The Skadovsk wrecked ship in the Zaton map also serves as one for both Loners and Bandits, despite their mutual hatred of each other.

Of course, the "where the hell is the tail/eyes/jaw/feet/etc, I see them just fine" still applies, as it'll take you quite a while to start finding parts with regularity. Technically it's only <em>one</em> bear ass, since they only ask for one part at a time, but the principle's the same.<ul><li> Lampshaded and justified - most of the mission givers acknowledge it's inane, time consuming, and stupid, but they get tidy profits off of superstituous idiots/newbies, scientists wishing to study how mutants behave and perceive the world, and black market dealers who sell usable creature parts for money (supposedly, a whole line of illegal fur coats made of psuedodog tails are popular in Russia, and so on.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncertainDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncertainDoom">Uncertain Doom</a>: Scar becomes an example of this at the end of <em>Clear Sky</em>.

If the player goes up and interacts with them, they will have the option to give them a Medkit so that they can survive. The problem with that is that the people who shot them down in the first place may likely still be around, and so will only end up shooting them down again for good. So do you save the badly wounded individual crying out for help by killing his assailants (who may be nominally friend or foe) and healing him, or leave him to die? Ties in with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">Video Game Cruelty Potential</a>. If you think there might be baddies about, healing him and having another gun in the fight or a distraction could be useful. On the other hand, finishing him off and looting his corpse for ammo and gear is also a viable option. Or both, healing him, using him in a gunfight, and then shooting him in the back.</li><li> With certain mods, you can sell weapons to neutral or friendly stalkers, and they <em>will</em> equip it if they don't have a primary already. Try giving an Abakan and some ammo to a rookie loner that has only a puny Makarov <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodFeelsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodFeelsGood">and see if you don't get a smile on your face</a>. This can lead to some pretty awesome moments, as well: as mentioned above, Petruha and his buddy Awl wind up in trouble at a Boiler anomaly in Call of Pripyat. Save Petruha and they'll most likely wind up dead anyway because they've got awful equipment, but if you take the time and money to kit them out with some decent gear, you'll probably find them later kicking all kinds of ass.</li><li> Another jarring but subtle occurrence of this happens near the end of the <em>Call of Pripyat</em> main storyline. In one of the missions, you will be sent out with a couple of troopers to ambush <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and get ambushed by</span> a Monolith patrol. If you lose a few or all of them, the atmosphere back at base goes from lively conversation to solemn silence.</li><li> Also, you can find a group of mercenaries camping in a substation in Zaton.

If you manage to give them what they need, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> not only do they welcome you to their camp (and allow you to grab one of three important toolkits for an important sidequest), but later on, when another group of mercenaries have left their duty of guarding a scientist bunker in Yanov, you can even recruit these Zaton mercenaries to guard that bunker.

As such, anyone who survives in the Zone for any length of time is going to be pretty hardcore. Stalkers are people who venture out into a chaotic reality-warping hellhole of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation">Eldritch Location</a>, which is infested with dangerous mutants, deadly anomalies, instantly-fatal pockets of radiation, and heavily-armed hostile humans who want nothing more than to kill you and take everything of value you carry. They do this <em>for a living</em>. Getting into a massive firefight with a gang of bandits, running in terror from a pack of hideously mutated wild dogs, walking through a tear in the fabric of reality itself in order to unearth a mysterious glowing trinket, hiding in a grate to escape a head-exploding psionic storm, and running back to town with monsters hot on your heels are all in a day's work for the average stalker. And once they've sold the booty, patched up their wounds, and taken some time to rest, eat, and relax, they head back out and <em>do it all over again</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsNotReady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsNotReady">The World Is Not Ready</a>: C-Consciousness's reason for hiding the true origin and nature of the Zone.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWakeUpInARoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWakeUpInARoom">You Wake Up in a Room</a>: The beginning of <em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em> has you wake up in Sidorovich's bunker after the unknown stalker under his payroll manages to rescue you from the destroyed Death Truck in the intro.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourTerroristsAreOurFreedomFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourTerroristsAreOurFreedomFighters">Your Terrorists Are Our Freedom Fighters</a>: The Freedom faction has one defined goal: they want to open the Zone to the world because of its many wonders that could benefit humanity.
