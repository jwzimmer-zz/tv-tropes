The XCOM Project, Earth's last line of defense, was decimated by the invaders, and world leaders <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins">quickly ordered a ceasefire in the hopes of negotiating a surrender</a>. Now Earth exists under the rule of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VichyEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VichyEarth">ADVENT Coalition</a>, a seemingly benevolent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWorldOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWorldOrder">One World Order</a> ruled by the alien "Elders", which uses advanced extraterrestrial technology for the betterment of mankind.</p><p>But under this fa&ccedil;ade, the aliens rule with iron-fisted totalitarianism. Dissidents are made to disappear, soldiers are brainwashed and augmented beyond recognition, and only those on the fringes of society dare to think for themselves. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerspectiveReversal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerspectiveReversal">Now the roles are reversed</a>, and the shattered remnants of XCOM are the ones lurking in the shadows, seeking to overthrow the Earth's corrupt government.

Most missions put the player under time pressure and you are often expected, if not <em>required</em> to retreat from a map, making time and manpower as much of a precious resource as dead aliens or loot. Firaxis also included their own content editor and unencrypted code to provide deeper modding support for the community, with several mods commissioned to release on launch day.</p><p>The game was released for PC, Mac and Linux on February 5, 2016, with Xbox One and PS4 ports arriving later on September 6. A Nintendo Switch port was released on May 29, 2020, and came with four DLC packs and the <em>War of the Chosen</em> expansion.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Interquel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Interquel">Interquel</a> novel, "XCOM Resurrection", meant to bridge the gap between the first and second games.</p><p>Like the previous game, <em>XCOM 2</em> also has a version of the (in)famous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMLongWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMLongWar">XCOM: Long War</a></em> mod, <em>Long War 2</em>, which was first released January 19th, 2017.</p><p>A later expansion, <em>XCOM 2: War Of The Chosen</em>, was released in 2017. It features three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecurringBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecurringBoss">Recurring Bosses</a> known as "The Chosen", who adapt to the Commander's tactics. To even the odds, XCOM allies themselves with other resistance movements to unlock new classes.

There are also a host of other new mechanics like fatigue mechanics and battle bonds.</p><p>One DLC for the <em>War of the Chosen</em> expansion, called <em>XCOM 2: War of the Chosen - Tactical Legacy Pack</em>, was released on October 9th, 2018, free of charge for all <em>War of the Chosen</em> owners until December 3rd, 2018.

The Viper King is the only male of its species (as the Elders simply mass-clone female Vipers), and established a nest with a few other Vipers and started pumping out offspring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade">by the dozen</a>. Granted, it's not the end of the actual species when you destroy the nest and eliminate the King, as the vast majority of Vipers remain under the rule of ADVENT, but it's the end of the only brood not under the direct control of the Elders.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationInducedPlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationInducedPlotHole">Adaptation-Induced Plot Hole</a>: In <em>War Of The Chosen</em>, if the DLCs are integrated into the story, it means you do not do the special missions of <em>Alien Hunters</em> and <em>Shen's Last Gift</em>. This causes a few plot holes: Everyone still treats the Alien Rulers as Vahlen's creations, even though this never comes up in-story. Note that this only applies if you selected the "Integrated DLC" option. not selecting this has you play through the story missions for the DLC like normal.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAIIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAIIsACheatingBastard">The AI Is A Cheating Bastard</a>: Supply Raid missions in <em>War of the Chosen</em> work somewhat similarly to Retaliation missions - a fixed number of neutral objects (supply crates in this case) are spread across the map, and you're in a race against ADVENT to hit as many as you can before they do. This would be frustrating enough by default for a number of reasons, but it gets worse by the fact that, contrary to you, ADVENT doesn't need to move a unit into contact with a crate to mark the thing for retrieval. They simply <em>mark</em> them, presumably from orbit, two crates per turn, and if you can't reach them in time to re-mark them, they're gone. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a>: you're stealing resources by changing the digital mark on the crates to hide them from ADVENT and mark them for support to pick up later: the aliens don't <em>need</em> to mark the crates, they just need to activate the marks when they're ready to pick up the supplies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirborneAircraftCarrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirborneAircraftCarrier">Airborne Aircraft Carrier</a>: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAirship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAirship">The Avenger</a></em>, the XCOM base captured from the aliens, qualifies, as it houses the Skyranger.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AKA47" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AKA47">A.K.A.-47</a>: Averted by XCOM's standard weapons, but present in the three independent resistance factions.<ul><li> The Reapers' Vektor rifle is clearly based on the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalashnikov_rifle">Kalashnikov<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> rifle family, more specificially the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragunov_sniper_rifle">Dragunov<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> sniper rifle.

Others include all sorts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">grenades</a> and, unfortunately, alien plasma guns like the rifle that Mutons wield, so you'll (usually) end up on the receiving end of this at least as often as you dish it out whenever the AI decides to chuck a grenade at you.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">Anti-Frustration Features</a>:<ul><li> Instead of individually producing upgraded weapons, you now pay a flat fee for everyone to upgrade to the next tier.</li><li> Pistols are now a type of secondary of weapon for the Sniper class only.</li><li> Also, reloading a soldier's primary weapon costs them an action point, but does <em>not</em> end their turn as it did in the previous game. This saves you the trouble (and a good amount of resources) to upgrade everyone's pistol to the next weapon tier, and it spares you the awkward choice between "Waste a turn, and possibly this soldier's life, reloading" or "Draw an obsolete pistol and fire for ridiculously low damage (and still have an empty primary weapon next turn)".</li><li> If all other aliens in a Retaliation mission are killed, any Faceless hiding among the civilians will reveal themselves, so you don't have to hunt them down.</li><li> In a mission that requires you to neutralize all enemies, if you hack an AI unit or mind control an alien and kill all other aliens, the mission ends successfully without requiring you to gun down the controlled unit (even though you will lose control of the controlled unit).</li><li> The mission will also end if only turrets remain on the map.</li><li> Additionally, unlike the original you can directly target hacked or mind controlled enemies in order to gun them down before they break free rather than having to wait until they leave your control or using explosives (of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">having them drop a grenade at their own feet is still a viable and fun tactic</a>, and can be even helpful if there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">other enemies in the blast radius.</a></li><li> The UI puts an icon next to enemies when you move one of your characters, letting you know who that character can see from his potential destination BEFORE you decide to move, allowing the player to make more informed decisions and not move a character and find only too late he has no line of sight on a potential target. <em>War of the Chosen</em> expanded this: holding ALT on a movement space allows you to see exactly what enemies the character will be able to see at the new position.</li><li> Rather than requiring players to use the Experimental Ammo and Experimental Grenade projects to roll randomly for the strategically important Bluescreen Rounds and EMP grenades, you just need to complete one project for both before being able to mass produce them. This is good, because some of the game's scariest enemies are highly vulnerable to these equipment options.</li><li> For some important missions such as Avenger defense and the final level, where you can't actually wait for wounded soldiers to recover, the game will allow you to deploy injured soldiers to the field. However, wounded soldiers deployed this way will start slightly damaged, and in <em>War of the Chosen</em>, tired.</li><li> On "Protect the data tap" missions, while the game will spawn enemies within firing range of the data tap on turn 1, the alien pods will never use <em>all</em> their available attacks on the data tap each turns, guaranteeing that the player has enough time to reach and engage them and not lose the mission on turn one or two (generally, only one pod will actually attack per turn as well). They will also prioritize shooting your soldiers when they are in range, over further damaging the data tap (generally speaking).</li><li> You are still granted loot rewards if there are any still on the ground when you complete a mission that doesn't require your troop to do an evac to win, even if no unit is physically capable of reaching it before it self destructs.</li><li> You can go straight to the workshop to buy or build items from the mission loadout screen without cancelling the deployment. Just in case you just realized that the last set of Bluescreen ammo you had was on the Grenadier you lost last mission.</li><li> Aliens will only ever <em>purposely</em> kill one civilian a turn in Retaliation missions to keep things from being blatantly unfair. However, if they miss a shot at a civilian, it won't stop them from trying again until they succeed or run out of attacks, nor will it stop civilians from triggering overwatch. Still better than a true civilian slaughter, though.<ul><li> <em>War of the Chosen</em> nullifies this, because the game occasionally spawns special ADVENT pods in Retaliation missions that ignore XCOM units to kill as many civilians as possible instead. It's not uncommon to watch them gun down 3-4 civilians in one turn while being being unable to do anything about it. They're so frustrating that Central actively points them out when they appear.</li></ul></li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Central</strong>: Commander, ADVENT isn't backing down, they've got units in the AO that are ignoring our units just to get a better shot at the civilians. Take those bastards down!</div><ul><li> The Evac command is a free action, meaning it can be used after dashing. Quite helpful on forced extraction missions, since predetermined Evac points rarely have good cover.</li><li> If a predetermined Evac point is no longer viable (i.e. it was on a rooftop and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingBreaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingBreaks">that rooftop no longer exists</a>), Central will call in a new one for you. Unfortunately, sometimes the Evac point is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">too far away from the main objective</a>...</li><li> Codex aliens are immune to damage over time effects from fire, acid, or poison. This may seem frustrating, but since a Codex spawns a clone every time it gets hurt, it will prevent the commander from being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">swamped in Codex duplicates</a>.</li><li> Overwatch shots slow time and take a moment to give a cinematic view of the action, but multiple soldiers and certain abilities like Kill Zone would result in a rather long break in gameplay as each person slowly fires at each alien individually. Fortunately, once 3 or four aliens have been shot at, the game expedites the process, returning to normal gameplay with the aliens' damage applied offscreen.</li><li> Also on Overwatch, any damage dealt breaks Overwatch, unlike in the previous game where you had to Suppress, flashbang (hence worthless against mechanical foes), outright kill or use a soldier with Lightning Reflexes to spring it. While this can benefit the aliens sometimes, it's far more to XCOM's advantage.</li><li> Unfortunately averted with the Alien Hunter DLC weapons. If a unit carrying one of the 4 weapons is killed on the field and their body isn't retrieved, the weapon is lost forever. However, you <em>are</em> warned about this beforehand.</li><li> However, "Ruler" alien corpses from the Alien Hunter DLC will <em>always</em> be recovered, regardless if the mission normally allows for it regularly or not. This is to prevent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">Permanently Missable Content</a> from occurring and guarantee players can always research the Ruler Armors, in case the Rulers randomly appear on a mission which requires the squad to escape via an EVAC zone.</li><li> Similar to the above, any plot-critical corpses like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the first codex you encounter by Skulljacking an Officer, and the Avatar you fight once you Skulljack a Codex</span> will be extracted regardless of the mission type.</li><li> Skulljacking has a flat 70% chance to hit that can't be improved by bonuses to aim. Fortunately, unlike going for a melee attack with swords or Strike, if your soldier fails to do a Skulljack, she gets a move refunded to her so you can either shoot the ADVENT soldier in the face or beat a hasty retreat. The Skulljack will also succeed whenever doing so would fulfill a current objective, so despite showing the 70% figure, it will never fail <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the first time you use it on an Advent Officer or a Codex</span>.</li><li> Hacking enemies (yes, including Skulljacks) and sentry posts penalizes the soldier if they fail. Any mission-critical hacking objectives like chests or cells <em>cannot</em> fail outright; you can only fail to get the bonus reward.</li><li> In addition, you are <em>never</em> required to hack a target with a failure chance: if you start a hack request and don't like your odds, then you can back out without any penalty.<ul><li> This can actually work in some players' favor if the bonus reward is good and there are almost no other enemies left on the map. Even if the hack fails and ADVENT sends enemies to their position, it's more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain">free XP for XCOM soldiers</a>. And if it succeeds? Bonus.</li></ul></li><li> <em>War of The Chosen</em> includes several new campaign options, such as increasing the turn limit on Resistance missions, and making the Avatar project take longer, giving players a lot more breathing room on the battlefield and world map.</li><li> Also in <em>War of the Chosen</em>, when one of the titular Chosen shows up to play, most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">running mission timers</a> will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeYourTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeYourTime">pause until they're gone</a>.</li><li> The Chosen prioritize stunning your soldiers so they can interrogate them. However, they will never interrogate a soldier on the same turn that the soldier gets stunned, even if they have the movement/ability to do so. In addition, reviving a stunned soldier just requires you to stand next to them, and that soldier then immediately gets their action points back.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a>: Psionics.

It's probably easier to list the things psionics <em>can't</em> do.

If a Follower is the sole survivor of its pod, it will flee and join the pod of the closest Leader (provided it survives).</li><li> The game draws a line between your squad's average position and the mission's objective. If you go too long without seeing any aliens, the other pods will make a beeline to that line in order to catch you. This has the unfortunate side effect of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthRun">totally stealthy missions</a> being all but impossible to achieve; as with most cases, certain gameplay mods do away with this behavior in favor of entirely random patrols.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Artificial Stupidity</a>:<ul><li> ADVENT Troopers have been sighted making questionable tactical choices during firefights, such as taking cover behind a <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">burning vehicle</a> that was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto">about to explode</a>. This is justifiable by Tygan's in-game mention that removing the Commander from the alien's psionic network as part of Operation Gatecrasher has caused the ADVENT tactical data to degrade.</li><li> Sectoids tend to favor using their psychic powers, even when using their pistol would be far more advantageous to them and they are flanking an enemy. In particular since two of their powers don't have any direct effect until their next turn - raising a dead unit as a zombie, the zombie can't act on the turn it's raised, while mind-controlled units similarly can't act until the next enemy turn, this can be a waste of an opportunity. Both actions also end the sectoid's turn, and their effects end if it is killed. The third power induces panic in a unit, but panicked units are liable to just immediately turn around and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain">''shoot the sectoid''</a>.</li><li> Spectres from <em>War of the Chosen</em> have a similar problem, they nearly always go straight for Shadowbound attack if they can but neither the Spectre or the shadow clone can attack that turn and the rest of the XCOM forces can just kill the Spectre on their go which kills both of them<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1ver9');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1ver9" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1ver9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">if the clone doesn't have a sustain ability</span> before either of them can do any damage.</li><li> Same with the Codices. Their usual first action is a teleport and then an AOE vortex that drains all ammo of the affected subjects within. The teleport usually ends them flanking one or more of the XCOM soldiers so why they don't just shoot them dead is a mystery. It should be noted that the vortex will also implode on the enemy's next turn, dealing huge damage to anything stupid enough to either stick around or wander into the area. This turns interesting when the Codex's second ability, giving up half of it's remaining health to a clone when it takes damage, is <em>also</em> typically used to flank your troops by just spawning another Codex near them. In tight enough spaces, such as on rooftops, the Codex can, and more often than not will, drop its clone right in the middle of <em>it's own attack</em>, turning an otherwise extremely dangerous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitpoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitpoints">Cast From Hitpoints</a> ability into an assisted suicide.</li><li> Sectopods and Gatekeepers don't bother moving around obstacles in their path...they just stomp through. No matter what that obstacle might be. And some obstacles in the game do bad things when damaged. It's not uncommon to suddenly see a message during the alien turn that a Sectopod somewhere on the map which hasn't been uncovered yet has stepped into a chemical tank and is now getting its armor melted off by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAcid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAcid">Hollywood Acid</a>.</li><li> Even if their reckless environmental destruction doesn't directly damage them, it can still be detrimental to their cause, like when a Sectopod/Gatekeeper stationed inside a UFO walks over and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain">destroys the distress beacon it's supposed to protect</a>. It can also backfire on you if the thing it just accidentally stomped flat was the data access point or loot chest you were supposed to capture.</li><li> Gatekeepers don't care about civilian casualties when they unleash their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HerdHittingAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HerdHittingAttack">Gateway</a> attack... even if the VIP they're supposed to protect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">gets caught in the blast</a>. Unfortunately, this means that XCOM only gets some extra supplies instead of Intel and supplies if they complete the mission.</li><li> The Holy Warrior psychic power boosts the stats of a unit, at the cost of killing <em>both</em> units if the unit casting Holy Warrior dies. ADVENT Priests with 1 health point will gleefully cast Holy Warrior on full-health Archons and Gatekeepers, allowing you to nuke them both by gently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">poking the Priest with a pistol.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">Purifiers</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurpleIsPowerful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurpleIsPowerful">Priests</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakesAreSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakesAreSexy">Vipers</a> are not very bright at the best of times, and have no problems wasting their attacks on units that are immune to them. They'll quite happily try to set your fireproof SPARK units on fire, spit poison clouds at your medics <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">(who can't be poisoned, as simply carrying a medkit grants poison immunity)</a> or try to mind control units in the middle of a solace field. Vipers, and all other types of melee-heavy enemies for that matter, also have a hilarious preference for attacking (or moving past) Bladestorm-Rangers that can instakill them right back, even when there are other XCOM operatives nearby that would make easier targets.</li><li> Retaliation missions in <em>War of the Chosen</em> have been changed to include groups of enemy resistance fighters along with the unarmed civilians you're trying to protect, who will shoot at whatever alien attackers are nearby. The thing is, though, while enemy pods will still move around the map shooting any human they see, they still won't formally <em>activate</em> until they enter line of sight of <em>your</em> soldiers- meaning they won't even attempt to take cover from the resistance soldiers, who will blithely gun the aliens down as they stand cluelessly out in the open before your guys even arrive to reinforce them. Even the resistance soldiers' weak rifles (weaker than even your basic starting assault rifles) will still bring down basic enemy troopers quite effectively when they're hitting virtually every shot.</li><li> Void Rift is a Psionic area of effect spell which does middling damage twice: once when you cast it, and again when the area collapses. Alien units which don't leave the area might be stunned, but aliens which wander into the area have no such excuse.</li><li> It's not uncommon for enemies with AOE attacks to use them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfriendlyFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfriendlyFire">against their own troops</a>. In particular, Gatekeepers and Sectopods will gleefully spam Gateways and Lightning Fields to get more zombies and fry enemy troops respectively, even if their allies are in the radius.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme">Ascended Meme</a>:<ul><li> Vahlen <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/7577u7/official_remix_commander_you_may_want_to_instruct/">really,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/758de8/advent_vahlen_canon_now/">really<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> wants the men to exercise restraint when using explosives. <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/iA0nIRE4u2o">And now there are<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/vGxb4XgOopk">two official dance remixes<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</li><li> Peter van Doorn, NPC from the first game who became recruitable in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMLongWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMLongWar">Long War</a></em> mod, appears here as one of the Hero Units.

Going toe to toe with the aliens and slashing them in half is <em>awesome</em>... but you won't see it happen a lot during the mid- and lategame. Sword damage doesn't scale well with enemy health and armor, so melee kills will be rare, unless you soften the aliens up first. On the other hand, a shotgun blast can usually take care of most enemies, especially if you attached a laser sight (lots of extra crit chance at close range) to said shotgun. Making matters even more difficult, enemy pods normally only become active upon <em>seeing</em> one of the player's units... and dashing up to perform a melee attack has a decent chance of bringing your attacker into the sight of another group, who will then join in against you<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2iirx');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2iirx" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2iirx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The advantages of swords are movement and a much higher hit chance than a shotgun: you can dash and still attack with a sword, which you can't do with a shotgun until Lieutenant rank Run &amp; Gun. <em>War of the Chosen</em> also makes swords much more viable: a random breakthrough can give you a permanent damage boost to all blades, making them on par with rifles, and Blademaster abilities can guarantee a hit, allow you to take attacks against anything that moves near you, and more. With the Chosen Katana, you also get a blade as powerful as a shotgun, that can't miss and <em>ignores armor</em>, making it devastatingly effective</span>.</li><li> On the other hand, the Ranger's concealment branch doesn't fare much better. A lot of its abilities rely heavily on concealment, which only happens by default at the start of most missions. A Ranger with Phantom can remain undetected, but may become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse">Too Awesome to Use</a> given the limited chances for concealment. Meanwhile, the Blademaster skills can be used all the time, any time.</li><li> Hacking nodes can reap all sorts of benefits, such as giving your squad extra turns, disorienting all enemies, taking control of a random foe, and so on. The problem is that more often than not, the penalties for failing a hack are severe; an immediate call for reinforcements or a permanent boost to every alien's defense can easily lead to a failed mission, particularly if it's timed. Unless you're not averse to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a>, or have a Specialist with a very high Tech score above 140+, hacking is usually too risky a venture to pursue.<ul><li> You can still try for a hack when almost all the enemies are killed - if there are only a few who may be too weak anyway, it may be worth it to try to get the hack bonus.</li></ul></li><li> Certain <em>War of the Chosen</em> resistance orders and geoscape perks confer a chance that a resistance fighter (a basic rookie for all intents and purposes) and/or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">random ADVENT unit</a> joins your team for any given mission. While one or two additional guns are always welcome, their wielders are on the lowest end of your troops' combat capability scale. Their short movement range means they'll inevitably fall behind higher-level operatives and may well spend the whole mission just trying to catch up without ever getting a shot off. If they do manage to fire their weapon, they'll rarely hit anything. However, the worst part is that they count as full members of your squad, meaning you <em>have</em> to extract them along with your own troops (which can cost you the mission because the guys are so damn slow), and if they get wounded or even killed, you can kiss your Flawless rating and your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyLives">Everybody Lives</a> statistic goodbye. Your operatives might also panic or even pick up negative traits just from watching the help bite the dust, unless they are higher levels.</li><li> The Resistance soldier (Skirmishers, Reapers and Templars) are certainly very powerful troops- the issue is that they're <em>very hard to acquire.</em> Aside from the complementary one you get for making contact with each faction (which will be Mox and Outrider if you do Operation Lost and Abandoned), the only way to get another is to complete a Covert Action to recruit them- and these are not only completely random, they don't even appear as an option very often at all. This also makes them very hard to replace if you lose your starter soldier. Given this, investing in upgrading them can be a very risky endeavour as you may end up spending tons of resources<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note34ec4');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note34ec4" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note34ec4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">although fortunately weapon upgrades for Resistance soldiers <em>are</em> cheaper than for your core classes</span> upgrading equipment for only a single soldier, only to find yourself without any units of that soldier left and no opportunity to replace them.

Adding in the Advanced version, which gives them grenades and some stat boosts but nothing else, accounts for another 8%, making a total of almost one quarter of XCOM losses to these simple foes.</li><li> Similarly, the official stats page shows that XCOM rookies are responsible for one third of alien deaths, more than any other type of soldier.

To make it worse, swords don't get the "Hunter's Instinct" +3 damage bonus on flanked targets unless you <a class="urllink" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=627968794">mod in a bugfix<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, so if you <em>can</em> get in melee range of an enemy in a single move, the shotgun will be more reliable than the sword.<ul><li> This can be averted if you manage to get your hands on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Assassin's Katana</a> in <em>War of the Chosen</em>, a sword that deals more base damage than any other melee weapon, never misses, ignores armor and almost always crits.</li></ul></li><li> The Grenadier's Blast Padding does not scale with armour tier, unlike its counterpart Shredder.

Other than the fact that they are fully robotic unlike their predecessor, they have double-jointed legs, favor oversized cannon-like weapons, carry a back mounted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeLauncher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeLauncher">Grenade Launcher</a> (which was a possible upgrade for MEC suits at tier 2) and generally resemble the MK I Warden MEC suits.

The only difference is that XCOM is pro-humanity.</li><li> The blueprints for the Spider Suit specifically state that it was based off schematics that they were able to scavenge from the old XCOM base, alluding to the functionally identical Skeleton Suit that you could build in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown">XCOM: Enemy Unknown</a>.</em></li><li> After building the Shadow Chamber, which lets you know what enemies you will face in various missions, enemies you haven't encountered before are instead labelled "ENEMY UNKNOWN".</li><li> The implant removed from the Commander's head in the tutorial sequence closely resembles the MOSAIC implants from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBureauXCOMDeclassified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBureauXCOMDeclassified">The Bureau: XCOM Declassified</a></em> in both appearance and function.</li><li> During the cutscene for the Encrypted Codex Data, pictures of the aliens as they appeared in the previous game are displayed.</li><li> During Operation Last Gift, as Julian tells you about the SPARK, he mentions that it's an ideal body meant to house "an adept mind". This recalls the Etheral's speech in the first game describing humanity as "an enduring physical form, paired with an equally adept mental capacity".</li><li> The Inside Look at the Lost has Bradford telling the Commander to tell the men to exercise restraint while using explosives.

While undoubtedly useful when that happens, it's also the only thing the room does, it requires power to operate (not much, but still), the turrets only become effective stat-wise when the Matrix is staffed with an engineer you might have better use for, and the number of such battles you'll have to fight in the whole campaign is somewhere between two and none. Depending on how the RNG feels about your mission roster, it's also not unusual to never be able to salvage a turret wreck at all, or so late in the campaign that the one UFO Defense mission you get on average is long over by then. Long story short, the Defense Matrix is a cool thing to have, but so situational in its use that using its room slot for something else tends to be much more efficient overall.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship">Cool Starship</a>: The <em>Avenger</em>, XCOM's new headquarters, is a massive VTOL-esque spaceship converted from an alien supply craft.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualBossImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualBossImmunity">Contractual Boss Immunity</a>: Averted.

Oh, and as of <em>War of the Chosen</em>, there's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a> going on that ADVENT seems to be struggling to contain.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a>: According to the prequel novel <em>Resurrection</em>, the resistance found out the hard way that ADVENT has three layers of redundant security onboard their transports to prevent theft: biometrics that prevent the craft from being piloted by humans, then a tracking beacon that calls down ADVENT troops on the craft's position if the biometrics is hacked, and finally if both security measures are breached the craft vaporizes itself.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCameo">Creator Cameo</a>:<ul><li> Continued from the previous game's Sid Meier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroUnit">Hero Unit</a>, and then taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>.

In combat, units are perfectly capable of moving and fighting so long as they have at least one HP. At the end of missions, however, soldiers who have been wounded will limp slightly. Heavily wounded soldiers will fall to their knees. Furthermore, a critically injured unit can be "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran">shaken</a>", resulting in a Will penalty.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMachines">Cute Machines</a>: The Gremlins appear to have a rough approximation for a face, with their optics even having mechanical eyelids of sorts that even blink.

It features futuristic technology that have good as well as horrifying applications, the game revolves around fighting the monolithic evil overlords ruling society, and the host of customization options encourage your soldiers to be colorful, unique operatives like any Cyberpunk character. Most evident in the "slums" environment, which feature the futuristic, grimy, neon-lighted streets pervasive in the genre. The Anarchy's Children DLC pack embraces the aesthetic, with even more outlandish and punk-looking customization options.</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D - H&nbsp;</div><div id="folder1" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageTyping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageTyping">Damage Typing</a>: The game differentiates between "lightly wounded", "wounded" and "gravely wounded" soldiers. The only difference between them is usually the time it takes to fully recuperate (each category rolls on a fairly broad, overlapping time table for every wounded soldier at the end of the mission), with only one exception: a Templar resistance order that allows lightly wounded soldiers to be deployed on missions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory">Damn You, Muscle Memory!</a>:<ul><li> When Shadowstep says that a Ranger does not trigger Overwatch, it really does mean that he does not trigger Overwatch.

Making that mistake can hurt.</li><li> In-universe, anyone with Bladestorm can run into this problem. It grants a reflexive attack against enemies who get too close, but once they are trained in the technique, they can't <em>not</em> use it, and it is still vulnerable to being parried and counter-attacked, making it a liability sometimes.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil">Dark Is Not Evil</a>: XCOM is a secretive, subversive underground organization who tend to go for a fairly dark default color scheme.

It will even pick an environment based on the current mission, such as a burning resistance settlement, or a recent mission if you saved and exited after mission is over. There's even unique main menu screens for the Chosen missions!</li><li> Andromedons are coded as organic enemies, despite their hulking power armor, so standard tactics apply. However, once their pilot is killed and the suits become autonomous, they're now classified as mechanical, and as such, they can be harmed by EMP weaponry, receive extra damage from Gremlin attacks, and can even be hacked.</li><li> At the start of the campaign, rookie promotions are rigged to give one of each base class before being picked randomly (in other words, the first four promotions, <em>not</em> the four soldiers on the first mission, will always be Ranger, Specialist, Grenadier, Sharpshooter, before you start seeing repeats). If you mod in additional classes, the game will add them to the queue.</li><li> A soldier will react appropriately if placed in front of a wanted poster depicting them.</li><li> Pay special attention to units returning from a mission. If it's Flawless or Excellent, the Happy-Go-Lucky personality soldiers will be smirking, while Normal soldiers will simply have a quiet smile. Any deaths will have the soldiers sitting back and forth in contemplation.

Engineers will man the posts you assigned them to while idle ones or those that are busy clearing space in the Avenger can be seen in the bridge. Your soldiers can be seen manning less skill important posts like the armory maintenance, hangar, and the radar stations on the bridge. Off-duty crew of all types can be seen in the bar and living quarters.

If, for instance, you INI-mod the Specialist's Guardian ability to have a 100% trigger chance instead of the normal 50%, its description will accurately reflect the change in-game.

As your soldiers rank up to develop more abilities and research advances, you start getting abilities that let you disrupt the battlefield even more effectively than your opponents, and mess with the rules of combat more and more. By the midpoint of the game, your basic rookies are as strong as or stronger than the basic aliens (who do not advance) and almost on par with the Advanced/Elite ADVENT forces, while your experience soldiers are dancing around the battlefield, using heavy armor to throw rockets, killing 4 or more enemies with a sniper rifle in a single turn, and generally making it almost impossible for the aliens to use their stronger abilities without being horribly punished. It's telling that the casualty rate is, as is typical for XCOM, much higher at the beginning of the game than at the end.<ul><li> Perhaps best exemplified by <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

On Commander difficulty (where even the default ADVENT soldiers are an equal match for your rookies, if not actually <em>superior</em>) and higher you may find it close to <em>physically impossible</em> to even beat the very first mission of the game unless the RNG falls considerably in your favour because you're simply <em>that</em> badly outmatched.</li><li> The Legacy Operations, short self-contained mini-campaigns made up of a straight chain of combat encounters, tend to feature this in the beginning. The very first mission of 'Blast From the Past', for example, provides you with very close to the bare minimum force- one Squaddie of each class with kevlar armour, ballistic weapons and one grenade apiece. You have to wipe out four Faceless (which are <em>incredible</em> damage soaks against your pathetic weapons), two Vipers and a Sectoid while taking the minimal damage possible, and ideally as quickly as possible if you want the best score. Oh, AND you don't have concealment. Not only do you have to have flawless tactics, but even more luck than usual- only one or two missed shots and you're screwed, as two hits from anything will kill one of your guys (which, with a -5000 point penalty means you can kiss your gold campaign medal goodbye) and if the Vipers get even one action off they WILL tongue drag and bind you, which is death, especially when the Faceless are still bearing down on you. It gets a lot easier quite quickly in successive missions as your squad size increases, your guys learn more skills, upgrade their gear and acquire neat new tools, but that first mission is just hellish.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a>: There's a 1-in-500 chance of a mission's randomized title including the word "chicken" in it for your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InherentlyFunnyWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InherentlyFunnyWords">Inherently Funny Words</a> needs.<div class="indent"> "var localized string m_strChicken; // I just want to use "Chicken" every once in a while"</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyLevelTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyLevelTrick">Easy Level Trick</a>: The Avenger Defense Mission, often capable of being <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

All you need to do is destroy the jamming spike deployed at the other end of the map in order to be able to lift off and you start out knowing where it is- so if you can get a clear line of sight to it as well as direct vision on it (with something like a Battle Scanner, that can be thrown a long way, or in 'War of the Chosen' a Shadow mode Reaper) a Squad Sight Sharpshooter or two can destroy it in a few shots from a position of complete safety. Or if you have a couple of Blaster Launchers, which have infinite range and can be aimed freely at any point on the map, you can just casually blow the thing to scrap as your first actions of the battle and lift off immediately without even needing to move.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyLogistics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyLogistics">Easy Logistics</a>: Easier than <em>Enemy Within</em> and the original 1994 X-Com.<ul><li> As with Enemy Within, you essentially have unlimited supplies of conventional ballistic weapons and Kevlar armor.</li><li> Once you develop Predator or Warden Armor and Magnetic or Plasma Weapons, all operatives will automatically have their weapons and armor upgraded, and their Modular Weapon attachments will be inherited by their new weapons. Note that the graphics for the attachments is markedly different between the three tiers of weapons. Compare to previous XCOM and X-Com games where you need to fabricate each weapon and suit of armor individually, and to the specialized armor that must be individually assembled at the Proving Grounds.</li><li> Much of your monthly upkeep is simplified to Power being diverted from the Elerium generator aboard the Avenger and steady stream of Supplies to feed the personnel and maintain the hardware. Firebrand also doesn't need fuel for her missions; either the fuel is abstracted as part of your supplies or she draws power off the Avenger's generator.</li><li> Proving Ground projects seem to allocate resources for fabrication that allow you to always have X amount of a developed Experimental weapon or armor available per mission once you complete them, and it seems to require little more than you passing the engineer(s) in the Proving Grounds an Elerium Core and some other ingredients.</li><li> One minor detail that is handled more realistically is that the loot you can recover from timed missions that require extraction is markedly reduced compared to "normal" missions, as your operatives simply lack the time needed to load Firebrand with whatever corpses the enemies leave behind before being forced to leave by approaching ADVENT interceptors. In such missions, the only loot directly recovered from the field are any Elerium Cores and modular weapons parts taken from slain ADVENT troopers and aliens (plus "one-time" corpses such as the first Codex Brain or the Ruler corpses).</li><li> Monthly/weekly supply drops are not directly carried to the Avenger immediately - instead, the Commander must direct the Avenger to the arranged drop point and scan to locate the resources, which presumably are hidden to prevent discovery by ADVENT. Some of the mission 'reward' contact points generated after successful missions that can be scanned for in this manner are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">Permanently Missable</a> if you don't allocate the time needed to find them after a few days.

Barring all that, however, you can:<ul><li> Open and close doors in enemy line of sight.</li><li> Walk down the street out of cover.</li><li> Send your flying, humming drone to hack their hardware.</li><li> Go up and down ladders or power lines.</li><li> Throw round, grenade-shaped battle scanners.</li><li> Stay behind cover very still if an enemy wanders close and catches you in their line of sight. This won't bust you so long as you don't move or they don't accidentally (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllSeeingAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllSeeingAI">intentionally</a>) flank you, even if a park bench is the only thing between the two of you.</li><li> Use the grappling hook on the Spider or Wraith Suits.</li><li> Somehow, ADVENT consistently fails to notice the not exactly subtle approach of your Firebrand dropship whenever you swoop into a new AO.</li><li> Even when your concealment is already blown, pods of enemies that didn't participate in the opening skirmish won't activate until they can draw a line of sight on your forces. This means you can level the entire map (or even the whole Alien Facility in the respective mission type) with explosives while the remaining pods continue to merrily patrol the AO, just as long as you stay beyond their 27-tiles sight range or leave enough walls standing to block LOS.</li><li> Probably the most hilarious examples can be witnessed on prison break operations in <em>War of the Chosen</em>. The patrolling guards there have massively reduced detection range of only a few tiles, enabling you to run past almost close enough to touch them without them noticing.</li><li> The most extreme example, however, is any encounter between the aliens and a Reaper in Shadow mode, a unique passive ability that reduces all enemies' detection range to exactly one tile. Sometimes your Reapers can literally run right through an ADVENT squad without being detected.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Inverted</a> as well: The Guards Must Be Clairvoyant. Concealment is simply a means to set up good ambushes, rather than being outright able to sneak through entire missions, and the programmed behavior of the guards reflects this. They'll change their patrol paths specifically to trap a hidden operative into either staying still or blowing their cover despite not knowing of their existence, and they'll <strong>stop</strong> patrolling specifically to hang around that hidden operative if they get close enough. Sectopods can also use their AOE attack on a hidden operative they can't reveal.</li><li> Averted for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpJetPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpJetPack">Icarus Armor</a>. It doesn't matter if an enemy has a line of sight on the wearer or not when you activate its special jump ability, ADVENT <em>will</em> notice your soldier careening through the sky on pillars of rocket fire. Don't use it until you don't care about your concealment any longer anyway.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>:<ul><li> The game has a quite useful waypoint mechanic that's not only not covered by the tutorial, it isn't even mentioned in the Avenger's archives or any other official handbook. For the uninitiated out there: holding Ctrl while issuing move orders lets you choose the path your operatives take to their destination, which allows you to steer them clear of environmental hazards or things that would break their concealment, like windows, doors or those annoying civilian squealers.</li><li> The game displays gameplay hints (including the waypoint mentioned above) on the loading screen when heading out on a mission. Unfortunately it displays them on the screen within the screen in the Skyranger and then zooms out, which makes them hard to read, especially on console. Worse, part of the tip is blocked by the soldiers sitting closest to the screen.</li><li> The game says that soldiers gain promotion by taking part in missions, and there is a perk from the Guerilla Training School which gives bonus XP for kills. This leaves a few questions unanswered: <br>Do soldiers have to make kills to progress, or is it enough to show up on a mission? <br>Do different enemies give different amounts of XP? <br>What are the amounts of XP required for promotion to each rank? <br>Try asking Google, because the game isn't saying.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunAccessories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunAccessories">Gun Accessories</a>:<ul><li> ADVENT modular weapons technology, once researched, allows XCOM to attach a variety of accessories to the operatives' weapons (weapons in higher tiers can have more accessories attached). There are three tiers &#150; regular, Advanced and Superior &#150; and each makes the accessory's effect more pronounced. You can't equip two accessories of the same type, and unless you have the "Lock and Load" continent bonus, accessories are destroyed if you remove them from the weapon. The Chosen's weapons in <em>War of the Chosen</em> have fixed accessories by default.<ul><li> Stocks make your operatives just barely accurate enough to do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> even if they miss.</li><li> Scopes and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserSight">Laser Sights</a> respectively improve accuracy and critical hit rate. The latter also has increased critical chance at closer ranges.</li><li> Expanded Magazines and Auto-loaders respectively increase the amount of ammo pips available for you to use per reload, and give you a number of free-action reloads per mission.</li><li> Repeaters give weapons a small percentage chance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathBullet">killing aliens instantly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">regardless of their current health</a> (kills with the Repeater effect are marked in the user-interface with the word 'Executed!' and no damage number).</li><li> Hair-Triggers give a chance that shots become free actions.</li></ul></li><li> On a purely aesthetic front, every single one of XCOM's guns has a tactical light on the front end, even the sniper rifles, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight">XCOM operatives are actually mindful of light discipline while Concealed</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrids">Half-Human Hybrids</a>: The "Evolved" aliens all have a mix of alien and human features as a result of the Elders splicing them with human DNA.

They'll often move first and mindspin the operative, potentially panicking them, which always results in them moving to cover. The later coin flip between hunkering down or shooting at an enemy (and even <em>killing the Sectoid</em>) is just the cherry on top.</li><li> Don't overdo destruction of cover to expose the aliens, lest your own troops have nowhere to cower behind when advancing.</li><li> Vipers can get themselves killed by deciding that it's a good move to try to constrict one of your soldiers if they are successful but their target is a Ranger with Bladestorm. Packs of Chryssalids are prone to making the same error. Note that Bladestorm triggers once per in-range enemy, not once per turn.</li><li> Similar to Vipers (but exposing themselves to less danger), both Andromedons and Mutons prioritize melee against hordes of the Lost, probably to save ammo (...despite the existence of the Headshot mechanic) and getting easily swarmed and distracted. At least the Muton is practically invulnerable thanks to its counter attack.</li><li> Purifiers have a chance to blow up when they die to <em>anything</em>. Including the Lost that they're often fighting. These explosions would then lead to more Lost swarming and overwhelming even these dedicated anti-Lost units.</li><li> The PsiOps' Fuse ability's sole purpose is to blow up any explosives the target is carrying. Mutons, MECs and many ADVENT troops including Officers carry grenades of varying power. You do the math. Fuse is unlikely to kill the target due to grenades' rather low damage, but even then it's quite useful since it prevents the target from using their grenades against your own troops.</li><li> The Templar resistance order Feedback makes psionic enemies suffer a nice amount of damage when they use any psionic ability against XCOM. This damage adds up for every unit hit, so when a Codex uses its Psionic Bomb (which it only does when at least two targets get hit, and often it's more than that), chances are good it'll instakill itself through the feedback pulse.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine">Hold the Line</a>: If the Avenger is grounded as a result of the "Hunt XCOM" Dark Event, you will need to undertake a mission wherein you destroy the alien device preventing your escape, all the while keeping the alien forces from entering the Avenger.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAcid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAcid">Hollywood Acid</a>: Employed both by the aliens (specifically the Andromedon) and XCOM (in the form of acid grenades), as well as occasionally found as a map hazard (destructible chemical containers that will cause a spill of the stuff when damaged).

Though he wonders where they found the meat and doesn't like to think about it too much... especially since Lily notes that <em>all the cows are gone</em>. However, given the scale of which ADVENT can clone and manufacture organic creatures, it's far more likely they're just growing meat in vats.

And they all carry very potent bonus effects on top of it all.<ul><li> The Darklance is a sniper rifle which removes the biggest limitation on Sharpshooters. Normally, using a sniper rifle requires both of the Sharpshooter's actions, forcing them to remain in place in exchange for a highly-accurate, damaging, long-range shot. The Darklance, however, only takes a single action point, giving Snipers all of the mobility afforded to other soldiers without any sacrifices in their extreme range, aim, or damage. This can be further augmented with the Sharpshooter's Death From Above ability, which refunds an action point when they score a kill shot... that can be used to fire the Darklance again, and again, and again.</li><li> The Darkclaw is a massive upgrade to the regular pistol, dealing more damage than a fully-upgraded beam pistol while simultaneously piercing nearly all enemy armor, while <em>still</em> able to benefit from ammunition bonuses such as Bluescreen Rounds.</li><li> The Arashi, which has all of the raw stopping power of a Shotgun without the heavy range penalties.</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KatanasAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KatanasAreJustBetter">Katana</a> is the Ranger's equivalent of the Darkclaw - a side melee weapon which deals more damage than other swords in the game, never misses, and pierces enemy armor.</li><li> And the Disruptor Rifle, which takes the Assault Rifle and adds a guaranteed critical hit against any psionic enemies, up to and including dangerous endgame enemies such as Gatekeepers and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Avatars</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew">Interface Screw</a>: Any large enough explosion will cause the UI to briefly flicker with static, which are typically caused by your Grenadier soldiers.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceSpoiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceSpoiler">Interface Spoiler</a>:<ul><li> Several during combat:<ul><li> Once again, the fact that you can't move into tiles occupied by enemies can help you locate hostiles or civilians you don't have a line of sight to.</li><li> When in concealment, you'll sometimes be able to see the "spotted" tiles from enemy pods you haven't discovered yet.</li><li> Normally, you can issue a move order to your units and select a different one before the unit actually finishes moving, which is convenient when you're trying to move many of them at the same time. However, if something (such as activating an alien group, breaking concealment, or getting a message from Central) will be triggered during your unit's movement you will not be able to do this as the camera will follow the unit until the triggered event occurs, serving as an early warning.</li><li> During Retaliation Missions, Faceless infiltrators disguised as Resistance members can be picked out by the simple fact that the aliens will not actively attack them.

If you're lucky, the map spawns you near (or on top of) a tall building with good sight lines on your objectives and enemies. If you're not, you may find yourself forced to navigate an urban maze where turning any corner could have you run straight into one or more pods, or you get a wide open map with hardly any cover for your soldiers near the objective. Even if the map generator was on your side, you can still have a hard time making headway when your soldiers stubbornly refuse to hit the broad side of a barn despite their 90+% hit chance.</li><li> Also applies to the campaign as a whole. A lot of weapons and armor technologies require specific alien corpses for research and/or construction, so if you either don't encounter these aliens in the first place or only fight them in extraction missions that don't allow you to salvage corpses for Tygan to dissect, your tech development can end up stymied by factors beyond your control for a dangerous amount of time. Sharpshooters, Psi Ops and Specialists suffer the most from this effect due to their top-tier equipment depending entirely on the successful salvaging of rare late-game enemies.</li><li> <em>War of the Chosen</em> can further add to your luck-based woes. It doesn't happen <em>often</em>, but if a Chosen spawns near a VIP that you have to rescue, then good luck getting across the map and putting the bastard down before they one-shot your entire mission. (Of course, any difficult mission can be made even worse when the Chosen decide to spawn, but usually their appearances aren't so egregiously unfair as this particular example.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">Magikarp Power</a>:<ul><li> Again, the rookies you start off with have the aim of a stormtrooper and often panic as soon as a shot grazes them, but given enough experience they'll eventually grow into the finest warriors Earth has to offer.</li><li> The Specialist's Gremlin, at least in terms of attack. The Mark I's combat protocol ignores armor, but only deals a measly 2 damage (4 against robots), useful only if your last barrage left an enemy with a sliver of health. The Mark II upgrades it to a slightly more useful 4 damage, but guaranteed 8 damage against robotic enemies can quickly finish off a MEC after an average attack instead of focusing your entire squad on it. By the time the Mark III rolls off the assembly line, its 6 damage is basically a standard, unavoidable attack, regular MECs can be One-Hit Killed by the 12-damage shock, and Heavy MECs and Sectopods will wish they were programmed to retreat.</li><li> Psi-Operatives play with this trope to hell and back. Sure, they may start off as fresh rookies, but the fact that their continuous training method disregards combat means they don't need to risk injury, potentially missing out chances for training like your regular soldiers or even getting killed. It takes time, zero effort, and a month or two of training, but your psi-operative's first combat experience can have them more dangerous than even hardened veterans.</li><li> As of <em>War of the Chosen</em>, Templars without their unique Focus resource are mostly useless. Kill a few things to build up their Focus and they become fairly effective. Get a Templar promoted to colonel and suddenly you have a versatile psionic murder machine that can one-shot most infantry in melee, has very powerful crowd-control abilities, can support your team in a variety of ways and generally raise more hell on the battlefield than almost any other class.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MauveShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MauveShirt">Mauve Shirt</a>: Irish Jane Kelly continues the Argentine Heavy's tradition of surviving the tutorial mission and being your first promoted soldier (a Ranger).

However, there are some whose consequences are mild to non-existent. These events are usually considered a free-card when it comes to deciding which of the few events of the month to counter:<ul><li> A dark event has Faceless appear in every mission, which is actually <em>beneficial</em> to the player. Faceless are mostly harmless and are used to create Mimic Beacons, making the event a <em>huge</em> boon to someone in the early game or on Legendary and/or Ironman. Civilians are usually best avoided in guerilla operations anyway.</li><li> The Midnight Raids dark event. It simply doubles the cost of recruits, but since most people intend on preserving their starting pool of soldiers, this is a non-factor almost all the time. Even with Ironman or for players who don't save scum if an outcome is "good enough", this is a non-factor because you can just recruit more soldiers before this goes into effect if you see needing more.</li><li> Introduced in War of the Chosen is Lost World, enabling The Lost to appear on just about any mission even without the appropriate SitReps. The Lost themselves aren't too hectic to deal with.</li><li> Undying Loyalty from War of the Chosen gives ADVENT units a chance to revive as Psi Zombies on death. Considering the fact that Psi Zombies have <em>less</em> health than most late-game ADVENT units, this isn't that big of a deal.</li><li> ADVENT Sealed Armor isn't too much of a fuss, as it only affects the proper ADVENT units, rather than the tougher alien enemies. People don't usually consider ADVENT grunts to be worth wasting ice bombs on.</li><li> Collateral Damage and Return Fire aren't much of a factor to those who intend to kill first, let the enemy attack never.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookMaker">Mook Maker</a>: there's no enemy that directly creates new enemies, but the Gatekeeper's "Gateway" ability, in addition to harming all hostile targets in the (massive) area of effect, also revives any dead ADVENT or alien troops, as a kind of mass "Psi Zombie" ability similar to the Sectoid ability. This bad enough in the base game, but in <em>War of the Chosen</em>, the effect can also work on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">the Lost, without limit</a>, and since the Lost show up half a dozen at a time and swarm towards a particular area...<ul><li> The Chosen can develop abilities that let them spawn ADVENT soldiers, from basic Troopers, to Lancers, to Priests, two at a time.

Squadsight is now inherent to the equivalent class, but now snipers receive an aim <strong>penalty</strong> scaling with extreme range plus a flat crit chance penalty when using Squadsight, so the strategy of letting your unreachable marksman pick off every target from the start point is no longer a reliable tactic.</li><li> During beta testing, the popular streamer Beaglerush discovered a counter-intuitive method that led to extremely successful ambushes: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense">leaving a soldier out in plain sight</a> for enemies to stumble upon while the rest of the squad sits on Overwatch. Since enemies would only move, not attack, as concealment was broken, you got to attack them while they're out of cover like in a regular ambush (minus the small Overwatch accuracy penalty) but the enemy effective wastes their first post-ambush turn. Firaxis promptly enabled enemies to attack <em>immediately</em> when concealment was broken on their turn, so attempting that strategy now risks the aliens simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYaJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYaJustShootHim">firing upon</a> the defenseless trooper.</li><li> Sometime later, Beagle then discovered that the Sharpshooter's "Kill-Zone" ability triggers even if the Sharpshooter is concealed, and promptly resurrected his old tactic in full force. Again, Firaxis then went and changed Kill-Zone such that it respects the normal rules for concealed Overwatch and thus will not trigger until the squad has been revealed.</li><li> Mimic Beacons were game-breakingly powerful at launch as the decoy could utilize cover and also inherited defense and dodge stats from the soldier that deployed it. Player could also use other defense-boosting abilities and items (such as Specialist's Defense Protocol or Smoke Grenades) on them. Since AI always focuses on the decoy, aliens wasted their entire turn shooting it even when their hit chances were pathetically low, essentially making the item a Get Out of Jail Free -card. First major patch made attacks against decoys guaranteed to hit, thus significantly nerfing them.</li><li> In War of the Chosen, two new units are added to the enemy pool that nerfed the complacent gamer's strategy of "overwatch camp against all enemy groups": Spectres and Purifiers. Spectres turn into a cloud of nanomachines when moving, giving them Lightning Reflexes to dodge the first overwatch shot against them. Purifiers, meanwhile, made it dangerous to overwatch camp too close to enemy groups, as they have a chance to explode upon death. Purifiers can drop down from enemy reinforcement flares too, unlike Spectres, and greatly disincentive the old tactic of "move a Ranger with Bladestorm into the middle of a flare, and watch everything get cut up at close range". <br><br>Interestingly, there were already units that tried to avert overwatch camping (MECs that stand still and overwatch, and the occasional Codex splitting up). Now, the new Templar units can acquire both Bladestorm and Fortress (rendering them immune to explosions and safely camping Purifiers) if they get lucky.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OccupiersOutOfOurCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OccupiersOutOfOurCountry">Occupiers Out of Our Country</a>: XCOM's members are fighting to free their homelands as much as they are freeing humanity.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOmniscientCouncilOfVagueness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOmniscientCouncilOfVagueness">The Omniscient Council of Vagueness</a>: The shadowy Council of Nations that gave XCOM their marching orders makes a return, now represented by The Informant (AKA the Council Spokesman).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a>:<ul><li> The Repeater modification gives the weapon it's attached to a (admittedly very small) chance to instantly kill its target on a hit. The developers said that this applies to any target, from the basic ADVENT Trooper to the Berserker. It also works on robotic enemies (Including the sectopod, basically a giant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTank">Walking Tank</a>). It even works on the chosen, which, if you're lucky, can make any encounter of them much easier.

This includes damage caused by the Stock attachment - a weapon with both of them can One-<em>Miss</em> Kill. However, it was sadly patched out in an update in early May of 2016, though mod interaction with certain mods can inadvertently bring back this behavior.</li><li> Skulljacking an enemy is guaranteed to kill them (provided you get the 70% chance to get the spikes in their brain in the first place). It only works on ADVENT enemies, but no matter how many hit points they have left, after the skulljack is complete the enemy dies. It's a useful way to kill a pesky enemy shieldbearer or officer and maybe get some intel bonuses in the bargain.</li><li> Due to the nature of the game, killing enemies in one hit is highly recommended at all times. Most weapons can instakill most targets on roughly the same level ((mini)bosses notwithstanding) if you utilize them cleverly, and a large part of the gameplay revolves around figuring out how to kill as many enemies with as few shots as possible. Ideally, once your round is over, there's nothing left standing that could shoot back.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OptionalStealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OptionalStealth">Optional Stealth</a>: You can now use cover to sneak past enemies and set up ambushes.

The only visible application of this is to determine which soldiers socialize with each other in the Avenger, although certain mods (like Squad Cohesion) use these values to assign bonuses or penalties based on the troops' relationships.<ul><li> <em>War of the Chosen</em> finally utilized these values in an official capacity through the new Soldier Bonding system, that can unlock powerful perks for bonded soldiers. The exact nature of the relationship between soldiers through this system (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BashBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BashBrothers">Bash Brothers</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCouple">Battle Couple</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends">Fire-Forged Friends</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethClenchedTeamwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethClenchedTeamwork">Teeth-Clenched Teamwork</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a>) is left up to the player.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemake">The Remake</a>: The game borrows a lot of elements from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XComApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XComApocalypse">X-COM: Apocalypse</a></em>, such as a decades-long <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, battles in futuristic urban environments, XCOM no longer having funding from world governments, and so on. The ADVENT even use one of the alien faction symbols from <em>Apocalypse</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers">Required Secondary Powers</a>: Even with the Advance Warfare Center, your soldiers cannot get perks they are not equipped for; a sharpshooter can't get gremlin-based abilities, and likewise specialists can't get pistol-based abilities. Everything else is fair game, however.<ul><li> Similarly, some abilities are not as good without the backup from other synergised abilities: Run and Gun/Implacable can be dangerous without Shadowstep to protect you from overwatch fire.</li><li> <em>War of the Chosen</em> and its Training center removes one of the potential drawbacks: randomness. However, you now have to pay for the abilities your characters gain out of their native classes, and Psychic soldiers don't get any, period.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La R&eacute;sistance</a>: XCOM is now a rebel force looking to overthrow the ADVENT Administration that rules the planet.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRevolutionWillNotBeVilified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRevolutionWillNotBeVilified">The Revolution Will Not Be Vilified</a>: The XCOM-led resistance movement wants nothing more than to reclaim Earth from the aliens, to restore humanity's freedom, and to reveal the evils committed by the totalitarian ADVENT Administration to the masses. This is expressed by the motivations of XCOM's top staff, the Informant, and some of the randomly-generated biographies of XCOM soldiers. It is further reinforced in vanilla-gameplay by there being no penalties for committing excessive collateral damage in ADVENT cities (that could easily be spun as terrorist attacks), and no penalties for the deaths of civilians in most operations (excluding Retaliation missions, where you must rescue civilians that are working with the resistance). Granted, these game mechanics, especially the collateral damage penalties mechanic, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun">would make the tactical missions even more difficult and less fun to play</a>. This is also a necessity stemming from civilian AI 'fight avoidance' routines: get away from the fighting, even if the hiding place it picks is dangerous. Hiding on top of fuel tankers is not unprecedented.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolversAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolversAreJustBetter">Revolvers Are Just Better</a>:<ul><li> The Sharpshooter's basic handgun is a huge revolver. No reason is ever given why they don't use pistols like any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> military, so the devs probably had this trope in mind when they made the design decision, especially since Central talks about pistol marksmanship (not general handgun marksmanship) when he introduces the class.<ul><li> Related to the above, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdSniper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdSniper">Hunter</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Darkclaw pistol</a>, though rather subtle about it from the outside, explicitly notes in its item description that its inner workings seem to have been inspired by Earth's revolver technology.</li></ul></li><li> Grenadiers field revolving grenade launchers very similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> examples like the South-African <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milkor_MGL">Milkor MGL<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> as their trademark secondary weapon.

The soldier becomes affected by the 'berserk' status, making them uncontrollable and causing them to fire wildly on the aliens whether it's their turn or not, albeit with greatly-reduced accuracy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobbingTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobbingTheDead">Robbing the Dead</a>: You can now loot enemies for materials and equipment, similar to how you could scavenge equipment from EXALT troops in the previous game.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Roboteching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Roboteching">Roboteching</a>: What sets the Blaster Launcher apart from its basic cousin, the Rocket Launcher, is not the increased damage but the total independence from sight lines. The BL can be launched at anything within range no matter what's in the way, and the warhead will then manoeuvre over, around or through any obstacles until it hits the target. <em>Very</em> handy for getting rid of those pesky EMP spikes in the dreaded Avenger Defense missions - two soldiers with Blaster Launchers can usually destroy the spike in the player's first turn without ever engaging a single enemy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBeatsLaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBeatsLaser">Rock Beats Laser</a>: The bane of most of the exotic and dangerous aliens is a humble flashbang grenade. It disorients non-mechanical enemies, which locks out all abilities except for basic weapon attacks, slows their movement and reduces their aim. These can turn a squad of Vipers, Sectoids or Codices into pathetic rookies missing every shot they take at you, or destroy all of a Gatekeeper's psionic zombies in one go.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketTagGameplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketTagGameplay">Rocket-Tag Gameplay</a>: Just like in the previous game, at the start, your conventional weapons can usually kill ADVENT Troopers in one hit, but theirs will also kill or gravely wound in one too.

Both are easily among the most difficult mission in the whole game, yet at the same time they're absolutely awesome in their scale.<ul><li> If a Dark Event sets a UFO on your trail, it can catch up to the Avenger and force an emergency landing with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EMP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EMP">EMP</a> weapon that keeps the ship grounded. It's up to you to disable the EMP spike while keeping a small army of ADVENT forces from entering the Avenger, with enemy reinforcements arriving every turn. To spice things up even more, you're running a tight turn limit (as usual) because ADVENT has a whole fleet of battleships inbound on your location.</li><li> Even better than the above is what happens when you allow any Chosen to gain enough knowledge to track down the Avenger. They bring so many forces with them (including four <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolTank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolTank">unique ADVENT tanks</a> you won't see in action anywhere else) that you can actually deploy <em>two squads</em> of five soldiers each to repel the onslaught, backed up by up to four heavy turrets if you installed a Defence Matrix aboard the Avenger.

They only have it when appropriate, such as inside the base, on the unmistakable hull of their ship, and sometimes on their operatives. Funnily, their X4 demo charges are also XCOM-logo-shaped. Meanwhile, it's the Resistance havens that often have quite a few XCOM flags, graffiti logos and posters, sometimes out in the open where anybody with a telescope can see them. Since the only time you physically visit those locations are when ADVENT discovers and raids them, <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">one has to wonder if those open symbols of allegiance had something to do with it</a>.</li><li> The ADVENT logo is virtually everywhere. ADVENT troops have it on their uniforms, their MECs, their vehicles and on their public facilities. In the city centers and slums, it can also be seen on holographic displays, TV screens and in all ADVENT propaganda broadcasts. Even the publicly inaccessible top floors of ADVENT Network Tower have ADVENT logo sculptures for interior decoration. This trope is of course the signature look of totalitarian dystopian police states in general.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleYetAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleYetAwesome">Simple, yet Awesome</a>:<ul><li> The humble <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindedByTheLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindedByTheLight">flashbang grenade</a>. It costs only 35 supplies (dirt cheap for its abilities). It is an absolute bane to any ADVENT enemies. In particular, it applies -20 to Aim, -30 to Will, kills any Psi Zombies, and cancels Overwatch, Suppression, and Mind Control (except for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Avatars</span>). In short, it will make the lives of XCOM soldiers far, far easier.<ul><li> It's quite funny to watch enemies who would be fearsome like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">Mutons</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProjectedMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProjectedMan">Codices</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">Troopers</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExposedExtraterrestrials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExposedExtraterrestrials">Sectoids</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">Lancers</a> turn into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialStormtrooperMarksmanshipAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialStormtrooperMarksmanshipAcademy">pathetic rookies missing every shot at you</a>.</li></ul></li><li> Salvo from the Grenadier is similar to the Heavy's Bullet Swarm from the previous game. It allows the user to use a grenade or heavy weapon as their first move without ending the turn. Sounds simple, but greatly increases flexibility, and it's also powerful on other classes that get it through the Advanced Warfare Center. For example, it allows a Gunslinger-spec Sharpshooter to soften up a pod so the following Faceoff can kill them all, or de-armour an Andromedon or Sectopod so Fan Fire hurts much more.</li><li> All the moves that allow multiple attacks with a single action - Chain Shot, Fan Fire and Rapid Fire - are invaluable against aliens with reaction abilities, like Alien Rulers, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Avatars</span> or Codices, and the 15% aim penalty can be entirely eradicated with a Superior Scope.</li><li> Frag and Plasma grenades are free, come in infinite quantities, and can shred armor, destroy cover, and subtract health from enemies. No need to set the environment on fire, or spread gas all over the place, or douse corrosive acid on the floor, or even fry enemy robots. Pure explosive force is all that's needed.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmashToBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmashToBlack">Smash to Black</a>: Happens twice in quite rapid succession. The first example from the tutorial mission shows Central's boot coming down on a mortally wounded ADVENT soldier's head from that soldier's perspective, briefly interrupting Shen's radio message in the process. The second is part of a flashback when Central relays to the Commander how XCOM got curbstomped by the aliens during the initial invasion twenty years back; it involves the defenseless Commander taking a Muton's rifle butt to the face in first person, with predictable results.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a>: Quite literally in the "Retaliation" trailer, as a reptilian Thin Man smirks at the camera.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SparedByTheAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SparedByTheAdaptation">Spared by the Adaptation</a>: Bradford, Lily, Kelly, Osei and Ramirez cannot be killed in Tactical Legacy Pack missions since they will appear in the main game.

This unfortunately makes it much more likely they will kill all the civilians, causing the mission to end in failure even if all squad members survive and kill all the aliens. Justified though; it's called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeBeforeReason">Retaliation,</a> come on.</li><li> In protect the data tap missions, it is possible for aliens that have had their aim lowered to go after the much easier-to-hit data tap rather than your troops.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoMuchForStealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoMuchForStealth">So Much for Stealth</a>: Certain actions will always break Concealment even if your soldier isn't spotted carrying them out, like planting X4 charges in an Alien Facility or hacking into secure consoles.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil">Sorting Algorithm of Evil</a>:<ul><li> With every month your guerilla campaign drags on, ADVENT breaks out more advanced unit types in their efforts to stop XCOM until eventually their most dangerous troops are being deployed by June/July. Some enemies disappear almost entirely to be replaced by all-around better alternatives, like Sectoids making way for ADVENT Priests, or Mutons diminishing in numbers while more Andromedons show up. It's especially noticeable with the bog-standard ADVENT soldiers, the very first enemies you encounter. They come in three explicit tiers (Basic, Advanced, Elite), each with more health, sometimes armor, better aim, better equipment and new/upgraded abilities over their lesser brethren.</li><li> Also worth noting from a lore perspective is that any alien unit outranks ADVENT soldiers, Officers included. If a pod consists of ADVENT and aliens, the leader is always one of the aliens, even if it's just a lowly Sectoid. Most tellingly, even ADVENT's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks">Mecha-Mooks</a></em> have more authority, and arguably more autonomy, than their organic goons.</li><li> Averted in the backstory, where instead of playing it straight like the original game, the Ethereals just decide to throw everything at humanity immediately, which means XCOM, not even getting their laser weapons yet, easily gets stomped by advanced enemy units like the Sectopods.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeedRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeedRun">Speed Run</a>: The "Exquisite Timing" achievement requires you to beat the game by July 1st, and on Commander+ difficulty at that.

Looks particularly impressive on the Grenadier's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood">minigun</a> due to its large caliber.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishLanguage">Starfish Language</a>: How ADVENT troops bark orders at each other. The Skirmishers also use it here and there, so it's at least possible to gather the context if not the actual meaning. Strangely, civilians that pass through ADVENT checkpoints are adressed in the very same language and seem to understand it just fine, which makes you wonder why the Resistance hasn't been able to translate any Elder at all in twenty years.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthRun">Stealth Run</a>:<ul><li> One specific espionage mission late in the campaign can be completed with only one soldier, without ever breaking concealment <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

This includes the Sharpshooter's sniper rifle, a gun so long half of it clips through the ground every time this happens. To top it off, Sharpshooters already carry their handguns in the same spot, so they actually stack two guns on one invisible mount.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic">Stripperiffic</a>: The <em>Anarchy's Children</em> DLC gives your operatives some rather unconventional armor options. The most modest option sends them into battle with a midriff-baring breastplate or an open jacket, but particularly mischievous players can send their troops into battle <a class="urllink" href="http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/296482365526679941/ECA61B7447A86836182BB3C1CD325DE37A50666B/">basically in their underwear<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">Stuff Blowing Up</a>:<ul><li> The sequel gives the destruction system a huge upgrade, with prettier explosions and the ability to demolish roofs and floors to open new entry points. The Grenadier in particular shines in this area.</li><li> Anything that a Faceless hits with an AOE attack will be destroyed instantly. This is particularly bad when it comes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheFuelTank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheFuelTank">propane tanks</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto">cars</a> (which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">can deal upwards of 10 damage</a>). Even if the attack itself misses, it's not a good idea to be standing around cars or environmental explosives.</li><li> A particularly notable change is that, for buildings with multiple stories, you can destroy the actual floors, causing anyone standing on them to fall down to the first floor and take extra falling damage. Of course, enemies can also do this to you if you're not careful...</li><li> Blowing the floor out from under turrets is also an easy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a>, for obvious reasons. This is fairly handy, since late-game turrets are actually reasonably chunky and well-armoured, making them difficult to disable with normal weapons.</li><li> Between late-game plasma weapons, heavy weapons, and grenades, the X4 charges in the Destroy Alien Facility missions can almost seem redundant. You still need to plant them to actually complete the mission, but you can almost level the entire facility just with the weapons you're carrying to fight the aliens.</li><li> In <em>War of the Chosen</em> the Reapers can excel at this. In addition to their Claymore mines, they can also gain the Remote Start ability that instantly detonates any explosive environmental object with twice its normal blast radius and damage. Gets particularly entertaining when used on those large fuel tanks ADVENT trains sometimes pull around; the resulting explosion is the largest and most powerful in the game, with a fireball that can easily cover the whole screen.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityInducingAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityInducingAttack">Stupidity-Inducing Attack</a>: Mimic Beacons.

Some will run across the map just to get a good look at it, and others will dive out of cover entirely just to try to flank it &mdash; even if they were already flanking another soldier, and even if doing so would leave them unable to attack it that turn! Incredibly powerful, but they require rare Faceless Corpses to build.<ul><li> The Mimic Beacon was nerfed by an early patch, as players could abuse it by giving the beacon cover and using defense protocol to make it nigh-impossible for the enemy to hit the decoy, causing the AI to waste entire turns attacking it while ignoring everything else.

These skills can come from the other classes, or they might be unique skills that aren't part of the main skill trees. If you're lucky, it could be something very useful like Shredder; if you're not, it could be something redundant, like getting the Ranger's Rapid Fire on a Grenadier with the nearly identical Chain Shot.<ul><li> War of the Chosen mitigates some of the Lottery factor, at least; the new Training Center allows soldiers to gain up to four additional perks from other classes.

They can also reload, move, and then attack a Codex in one turn, likely flanking it and hitting it for a quick kill before it can clone itself. On the other hand, their reliance on flanking, getting one-shot kills, and melee combat are less effective against the sheer bulk of Gatekeepers and Sectopods, who also explode when killed, making closing to zero range... <em>less than advisable</em> while Mutons can reliably counter their Sword strikes and instead land a melee hit of their own. It also makes them more prone to trigger another enemy squad.</li><li> Grenadiers and their ability to tear apart armor make them extremely efficient at bringing down heavily armored foes, such as Andromodons, Sectopods, and Gatekeepers, being able to shred even the most heavily armored enemies on the highest difficulties down not only to Zero armor, but with Rupture, even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeyondTheImpossible">give them an effective -3 armor</a>, negating their vaunted resilience. Their increased blast radius on grenades and ability to reliably pile on the Burning status, or smash cover and shred armor in one go, also makes them good answers to Chryssalid swarms and teams of Mutons. However, their poor aim renders them vulnerable to Archons with their inherent defense and dodge, Vipers, who have similarly high dodge and can worsen the Grenadier's poor aim with poison, and Codexes, which not only are likely to dodge their inaccurate fire, but also multiply as a result of the grazed hit. They're also likely to get behind on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints">Experience Points</a> because explosives are used more to make enemies vulnerable than to finish them off.</li><li> Snipers with their precision burst damage, are good counters to Archons, whose tendency to fly up and about make them more vulnerable to long-ranged squadsight fire than other Aliens, can set off Berserkers on an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a> while they're still far from any allied forces, causing it to vent said rage on nearby aliens, but are countered by Codexes teleporting in on them, as well as getting jumped on by Faceless or Chryssalids when you thought they were safe.</li><li> Specialists, being <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportPartyMembers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportPartyMembers">Support Party Members</a> typically don't engage in combat enough, but their hacking skills make them good against mechanical enemies, but they're relatively poor against heavier organic forces, especially those that don't trigger overwatch shots as often due to greater focus on shooting rather than moving.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeCover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeCover">Take Cover!</a>: The most important defensive mechanic in XCOM 2, with survival depending largely on whether units are behind cover or not.

Defusing bombs, extracting a VIP before your escape is cut off, destroying a data relay or downloading something before it gets erased, and so on. Appropriately, Bradford is a lot more insistent on you getting off your ass and finishing the timed mission objective and will start to panic if you're down to one turn left. Even missions without an explicit timer usually put you under time pressure; retaliation missions often have a civilian dying each turn to unseen aliens, and "protect the data relay" missions have the data relay already being fired upon before you get there. Lastly, the campaign as a whole is on a timer.

It improves a soldier's mobility, makes them immune from insanity effects, and reduces damage taken for the next two turns. The catch? It's a single-use item that is lost permanently upon consumption. Add to the fact that Berserkers are excessively rare and they're typically only deployed to the field for about a month or two, and you have a small number of items of extremely limited utility.</li><li> Breaking Concealment as a Ranger with Phantom can be this. Phantom allows a Ranger to remain in Concealment even after the rest of the team is revealed, which allows them to continue to scout ahead for other foes. If you break Concealment, Conceal gives that Ranger one and only one more chance to go back into Concealment.

And it kept its poisonous attacks and gun.</li><li> The Muton didn't change much in appearance but got a new powerful melee attack and can also counter Rangers' melee attacks frequently. All its former weapons and grenades remain.</li><li> The Berserker is now so muscular that it no longer has skin, and the new mechanic that allows two moves before a melee attack makes her a very real threat to take care of before its strong attacks wreck your squad.</li><li> The Sectopod used to have one big weakness : its immobility combined with a moderate attack range that allowed you to ignore it while you wrecked its allies.

Countless questions go unanswered. Why were the ethereals dying? Why did they need to go through so much trouble to make Avatars instead of using the body of any one of the many slave races, or just a normal human body?

For example, certain missions have you defend a data tap from destruction. If the game spawns on turn 1 an enemy who can inflict the burning status next to the tap, and that enemy manages to activate before you reach him, it's impossible for the player to "heal" the tap and thus end the burning status - meaning it's likely the automatic burning damage each turn will destroy the tap so fast it's not possible to clear out every alien pod on the map before it happens, resulting in a failed mission.</li><li> In rare cases, the evac zone may be automatically placed on an elevated structure. If said structure is destroyed (even inadvertently, such as by a Sectopod exploding next to it, or an Andromedan walking through it), Bradford will automatically relocate it to a new location, potentially too far away for the squad to reach before the mission timer ticks down.</li><li> It's possible to freeze VIPs using the freeze grenade, which prevents you from taking any actions with them.

This is contrasted by the ADVENT city centers, which are <em>painfully</em> clean, clear, bright, and sleek. Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> with the Resistance bases and villages, which are third-world-looking collections of ramshackle huts made from whatever junk is on hand.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">Utopia Justifies the Means</a>: The ADVENT Administration justifies regular security screenings and troops with assault weapons patrolling throughout cities as just a means of protecting the "perfect future" mankind now enjoys.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VFormationTeamShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VFormationTeamShot">V-Formation Team Shot</a>: The wedge team formation option in War of the Chosen's photobooth.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VariableMix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VariableMix">Variable Mix</a>: Music during tactical combat transitions seamlessly from dramatic and orchestral during XCOM's turn, to menacing and electronic during the alien's turn.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCaringPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCaringPotential">Video Game Caring Potential</a>: Soldiers now have the option of carrying knocked out (and dead) comrades back to the EVAC point but with reduced movement and the inability to fire. While it does obviously have long-term game-play benefits most players will be channeling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneGetsLeftBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneGetsLeftBehind">No One Gets Left Behind</a>.<ul><li> Getting the players to care about their front line troops has long been a part of the franchise, but the rebooted XCOM series kicked it up a notch by allowing players to customize their soldiers to the point where each one can be a completely unique character. As a result, it's actually common for players to construct entire personalized narratives of what's going on as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergentGameplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergentGameplay">Emergent Gameplay</a> and to save scum in order to prevent a favorite soldier's death. This is reflected with the bond mechanic introduced in War of the Chosen, which allows soldiers to form actual emotional ties with one another.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">Video Game Cruelty Potential</a>: Apart from Retaliations, there is no penalty if a grenade or other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HerdHittingAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HerdHittingAttack">Herd-Hitting Attack</a>, in trying to blow up some aliens and/or their cover, also takes out a few civilians. In fact, there's not even a warning. Sometimes it's even cathartic given that the ones outside Retaliation missions are prone to detecting you when in concealment, or being Faceless when its dark event is active.<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind control</a> an unfortunate alien with a grenade and cause it to drop a grenade on its own troops. There's nothing to stop you from doing it, and the alien won't be able to fight back. They won't realize they're killing their own troops.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameFlamethrowersSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameFlamethrowersSuck">Video-Game Flamethrowers Suck</a>:<ul><li> The ones deployed by ADVENT Purifiers suck no matter which side you're on. Burning XCOM soldiers can't do anything but move and shoot (even reloading is disabled), and they suffer consistent burn damage for at least two turns. While that sounds bad, there are multiple ways to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">completely nullify</a> fire damage. The weapon itself has very short range and fires only in a narrow cone, deals surprisingly low damage to start with, and the wielder has a 50% chance to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlamethrowerBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlamethrowerBackfire">explode spectacularly upon death</a>, which often results in casualties among their own comrades.</li><li> The two flamethrower types XCOM can issue to soldiers wearing heavy armor are arguably the most useless heavy weapons available to the player. Their firing cone is even smaller than the Purifier's (it's almost linear, making it difficult to hit more than one target most of the time), the burst is blocked by high cover, it deals mediocre damage at best and, like all heavy weapons, can only be used once per mission. The game's many robotic enemies are also completely immune to fire damage, making it even more of a liability. For comparison: the ballistic alternative in terms of working principle, the Shredder and the Shredstorm Cannon (basically oversized single-shot shotguns), are more powerful, destroy cover, shred armor, can land critical hits and have a much larger area of effect.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense">Violation of Common Sense</a>:<ul><li> Enemies get tremendously more difficult to hit the bigger they are. A human-sized trooper is easy pickings if caught in the open, but you have to get pretty lucky for a junior soldier to hit a gatekeeper, which is the size of a small car even if she is standing right next to that alien. In fact, it is harder to hit a sectopod (a walking tank) than it is to hit a superpowered alien ninja from equivalent distance.</li><li> It is possible to succeed in the <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">Avenger Defense mission</a> and then have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">all of your soldiers die afterwards</a>. You will end up with an empty roster.</li><li> Aliens from activated pods will usually focus on killing your troops over attacking the data tap. If you're unlucky enough for two pods to spawn with line of sight on the tap, it may be necessary to activate both so that they go after your troops rather than the tap.</li><li> Due to the way Concealment and detection works, it is ironically easiest to see if there are hostiles and "sneak" around by deliberately going down open areas for the widest cone of vision.</li><li> Thanks to the way acid, poison, and fire effects work, if you find yourself in the middle of a pool, cloud, or clump (respectively) of it, order your troops to simply <em>stay put</em> and heal them. The game only checks status hazards when the hazard first spawns, and then when units move through them, <em>not</em> for sitting pretty in the middle.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceOfTheResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceOfTheResistance">Voice of the Resistance</a>: <em>War of the Chosen</em> adds a radio station to the Avenger's bar that covers XCOM's recent exploits, drums up support and usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicRelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicRelief">lightens the mood</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">in its own special way</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingShirtlessScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingShirtlessScene">Walking Shirtless Scene</a>: Your male soldiers can become this with the Anarchy's Children DLC, either completely topless or a vest with nothing underneath.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallOfWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallOfWeapons">Wall of Weapons</a>: Crops up here and there.
