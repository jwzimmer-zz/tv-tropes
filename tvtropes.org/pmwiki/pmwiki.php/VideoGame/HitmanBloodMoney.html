The timeline is full of false leads and near-misses, but he finally bagged 47 during an attempt on the U.S. President's life. As he relates his story, we <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanContracts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanContracts">flash back to the Paris opera</a>, where 47 was gravely wounded before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunForTheBorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunForTheBorder">fleeing Europe.</a></p><p>After a pit stop in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chile">Chile</a>, the manhunt picks up in the United States, beginning with a minor hit in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baltimore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baltimore">Baltimore</a> and zig-zagging its way across the country: first a visit to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/California" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/California">California</a> to rub out some mobsters, and onward to a political rally in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewOrleans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewOrleans">New Orleans</a>, a Christmas party in the Rockies, the swamps of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth">Mississippi</a>, the underbelly of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LasVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LasVegas">Las Vegas</a>, and finally the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWhiteHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWhiteHouse">Oval Office</a> itself.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>It was a radical change from previous <em>Hitmans</em>, as the series moved away from its PC gaming roots. The fixed camera is gone, allowing much greater mobility than before. The difficulty is also more balanced: 47 sneaks faster than in prior games, and guards aren't quite so anal about disguises. (They won't bust you for carrying the wrong make of gun, and <em>strolling</em> is no longer part of a disguise.) A new way to keep your low profile is to make hits look like "accidents", such as rigging a grill to explode, or shoving targets off high ledges. Bodies found as a result of accidents do not count toward your total. Among other improvements:</p><p></p><ul><li> Heads or tails? Toss a coin to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowingTheDistraction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowingTheDistraction">momentarily distract people.</a></li><li> Hiding in closets and armories is one of your new tricks.</li><li> Likewise, corpses can be stuffed in containers or thrown off ledges. Mr. 47 can also play 'elevator monster' where he hangs out above the elevator, garroting everyone who gets onboard and piling their bodies on top of the elevator.</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> A new repertoire of melee attacks: punching, headbutting, shoving, and using people as shields.</li><li> Use the funds you accumulate from hits to purchase <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignItYourselfEquipment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignItYourselfEquipment">custom weapon parts</a>. There is one custom weapon in each category (Pistol, Assault Rifle, Sniper Rifle, Sub Machine Gun, Shotgun) which can be loaded up with suppressors, sights, extended magazines, and up to three ammo types.</li><li> 47 can leapfrog/climb over some obstacles.</li><li> Bodies leak blood now, so keep it clean or else your enemies might find them.</li><li> You need to keep track of cameras, as being caught on film now counts against you.</li></ul><p><em>Blood Money</em> also has an unusual newspaper feature. Each time you finish a mission, you will see a headline with all the details of your mission. When your "notoriety" level is at a minimum, you can enter levels normally. The higher your notoriety level, the harder it is for 47 to blend in. Notoriety increases when you leave witnesses to your crime alive or un-sedated, or you get caught on CCTV cameras and don't destroy the evidence.</p><p>Originally released for PC, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Playstation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Playstation2">Playstation 2</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox">Xbox</a>, the game has been remastered twice: first for the <em>Hitman HD Trilogy</em> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Playstation3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Playstation3">PS3</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360">Xbox 360</a> in January 2013, which contained this game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanContracts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanContracts">Contracts</a></em> (a semi-remake of the first game), and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman2SilentAssassin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman2SilentAssassin">Hitman 2: Silent Assassin</a></em>, all of which received the standard HD remaster treatment. In January 2019, the game and its sequel (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanAbsolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanAbsolution">Hitman: Absolution</a></em>) were also made available on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Playstation4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Playstation4">PS4</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxOne">Xbox One</a> in the form of <em>Hitman HD Enhanced Collection</em>, which upgraded the games to 60FPS 4K resolution, among other graphical improvements.</p><p></p><hr><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In General&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbhorrentAdmirer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbhorrentAdmirer">Abhorrent Admirer</a>:<ul><li> 47 attracts some unwanted attention in the Shamal Casino. If you stroll down the west wing of the 7th floor, you'll be accosted by a large, intoxicated woman who mistakes 47 for a swinger [!]. He responds with his usual deadpan wit, but accepts her room key. If you take the guest up on her offer, she'll gyrate for a bit before passing out from such strenuous activity. Just don't exit out the way you came, though; you'll bump into her husband. But the balcony gives you a perfect view of Hendrik's suite.</li><li> Margeaux obviously dislikes Hank, and if 47 marries them while disguised as a priest, she doesn't even let him kiss her. After 47 pronounces them "husband and wife", all of the guests turn their backs to the gazebo and start firing their guns into the air, which gives you a clear window to shoot the groom. This will incite the wrath of the entire wedding party, but has the advantage of confirming your suspicions: What's funny is that you'll hear Margeaux sigh "<em>Finally!</em>" before screaming for help.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcoholInducedIdiocy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcoholInducedIdiocy">Alcohol-Induced Idiocy</a>:<ul><li> Ironically, life at the rehab center has <em>caused</em> alcoholism in the wiseguys who are hiding out there.</li><li> The Santa at Lorne's party is completely shitfaced.</li><li> Corky the Clown has seen better days. He often retreats to his own van to have a drink. He can be sedated (or killed) and hidden in that very spot.</li><li> Mrs. Sinistra is one of the dumbest NPCs in the entire series: she starts the mission falling-down drunk (on her son's birthday, no less) while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveStupidity">operating a gas grill</a>, and is unable to resist the advances of any man who comes near.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPartOfTheShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPartOfTheShow">All Part of the Show</a>:<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Tosca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Tosca">Tosca</a></em>, Cavaradossi attempts to fake his death and flee the country with Tosca, which fails when the executioner's fake gun is exchanged for a real one. As Cavaradossi dies, Tosca exclaims "What an actor!" before hurrying to Cavaradossi's body and discovering in shock that he is really dead. The incredible irony is that if the player chooses to replace the fake gun with the real one, the events unfold like a story within a story, with Alvaro as Cavaradossi and Richard as Tosca. In "Curtains Down", if you find a nice spot and wait until dress rehearsal, you will be in perfect position to snipe the tenor during his death scene. Do so when the executioner fires his gun, and the sound will be masked. Alternatively, Diana provides you a fake WWI pistol to swap with the prop one, and Alvaro will be shot in the heart and perish without anyone thinking to help him (and Richard even giving him a standing ovation).</li><li> Just to show you how much attention to detail is given: when you switch the prop gun for the real thing, the actor playing the executioner will say (in French) something to the effect of "Wow, this thing feels so real".</li><li> In "A Dance With The Devil", you can dunk NPCs into the shark tank backstage, then watch as a shark swims by and gobbles them up, dragging the victim to their death. Then go outside to the dance floor to watch the shark play with its prey while everybody keeps dancing.</li><li> One of the targets, Vaana, will plunge herself into the shark tank if she is set aflame. A group of clubbers gather on each balcony every time the pyro show is performed, and you can hear them "ooh"-ing and "ahh"-ing. After sabotaging the pyrotechnics show and cooking Vaana, you can hear a guest saying something along the lines of, "That show was amazing&mdash;especially the shark attack at the end! How do you figure she did that?".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Artificial Stupidity</a>:<ul><li> <strong><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKbptWt_Qs4#t=30s">This amusing fail when it comes to Witness Protection.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></strong></li><li> Diana is blowing smoke about Angelina and Raymond going crazy if they find out the other is dead. You can kill them in any order, at any time, and very little changes. Want proof? Drag Angelina's body (without being spotted) to the room Raymond is residing in. He will exhibit no reaction to the body and will go about his normal routine.</li><li> There <strong>is</strong> a way to trigger this by confronting Angelina while wearing Raymond's outfit, causing her to go berserk and start emptying her gun into the crowd at you. (Disappointingly, the cops think nothing of this and won't try to stop her. They will, however, fire on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRulesAreNotYourRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRulesAreNotYourRules">YOU</a> if you try to fight back.)</li><li> Speaking of which: Regardless of whether or not the guard birds open fire on 47 first, the police will join in on the shooting and take no notice of the violent gunmen. It is unknown whether this is an intentional choice of the developers or a glitch; though the former is more likely, it seems to insinuate that there has been an agreement between the local authorities and the Crows, as they rent out two separate rooms as well as an entire building as their base of operations during the level.</li><li> Strangely, you can chase Lorne all around the studio floor and his bodyguard will do nothing as he pleads with you to spare him.</li><li> In an AGQD speedrun by Saintmillion, the AI is exploited <em>to hell and back</em> in many preposterously hilarious ways &mdash; most notably with the coin. It is explained that if you hold and aim the coin, anyone nearby will stop what they are doing and stare at you like idiots, until you drop it. This is used as an advantage many many times in order to break the routes of civilians, guards and targets to make them easier to assassinate. Saintmillion places an RU-AP mine on the Sheik's route to the casino, uses the coin to stop the guards, detonates the bomb and runs like hell. It's one <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/IFFvUlCQ8Rw?t=39m18s">hell of a show<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBystander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBystander">Badass Bystander</a>: On rare occasions, random civilians will pick guns off the corpses of your enemies and join in on the firefight.

When looking at the inventory screen, you'll get a description of the item or weapon.

If you don't have a silencer yet, you will need to time the shot to coincide with the soundtrack gunshot. The body will be found, but his bodyguards don't leave the booth to find you (since the noise drowns out your gun muzzle), and the suspicio-meter quickly moves back into the black. Note that this doesn't disturb the actors at all.</li><li> Another trick is to stick a bomb in Schmutzy's payment briefcase and wait for Tariq to come have a look. BLAM.

Once you've caused the downfall of a famous tenor, you may be a little confused by the cut-scene if you&#146;re new to <em>Hitman</em>. This mission is the prelude to <em>Hitman: Contracts</em> wherein 47 was shot and (as we all remember) barely escaped the police blockade in Paris.</li><li> In "Flatline", 47's animation for injecting Agent Smith with the false poison includes flicking the tip in the same way he did when he injected Smith in Romania back in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanCodename47" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanCodename47">Hitman: Codename 47</a></em>.</li><li> Also in "Flatline", the post-mission newspaper includes an ad for a new Chinese restaurant; the Cheung Chau 2. Its menu includes deep-fried Red Dragon feet, Blue Lotus spring rolls, Zun's noodle soup, and Mei Ling stir fry.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerEndingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerEndingInjury">Career-Ending Injury</a>:<ul><li> Raymond was a pro athlete before embarking on a life of crime. He qualified for the 1992 Winter Olympics as a biathlete, but a knee injury resulted in him missing the games.</li><li> Cayne's testimony to the reporter suggests he retired from the FBI fairly recently. The left side of his body is paralyzed, the result of a "work-related accident" (according to the <em>Blood Money</em> official website) which he believed to be a failed assassination attempt, though nothing was ever proven.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaughtOnTape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaughtOnTape">Caught on Tape</a>:<ul><li> Lorne's blackmail ring is operating out of his film studio. Publicly, Lorne is a perfectly legitimate millionaire, publisher of the magazine <em>Popqurn</em> and producer of adult films. However, he also owns many strip clubs; the real sources of his income are the hidden cameras through which he catches well-respected people with their trousers down.</li><li> If you get caught on camera, and want to keep your rating, your only option is to dress as a guard and head for the security office marked on the map. The guards wander in and out of here, which should give you a chance to snag the tape.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityDrift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityDrift">Continuity Drift</a>:<ul><li> It's apparent from the promotional materials that Cayne was originally going to be an oddball business tycoon named Jack, but this was changed in rewrites to give him a law enforcement background. However, Rick Henderson still refers to him as "Jack" throughout his interview. (A radio program overheard in <em>Hitman: Absolution</em> refers to him as Alexander Cayne, finally putting the naming confusion to rest.)</li><li> "Death of a Showman". This mission takes place on Jan 9, 2004 (based on the paper with your stats at the end of mission). However, in the introduction video, the papers on the father's wall all have the date Jan 20, 2005, even though they depict events that would have logically taken place over the course of years. (The dialogue in the introduction implies that at least five years had passed.) Also, Diana mentioned at the beginning of the mission that the accident took place a few years ago, further highlighting this inconsistency.</li><li> Several sudden changes to the story line were made during development, and IO left some uncorrected lines of dialog in Lorne's mansion. The drunken Santa Claus claims that it's April, and Diana's briefing claims it's a Tax Day party (which fell on April 15 in 2004). The bartender calls Chad Bingham "the Gubernatorial mistake" if the player keeps talking to him, suggesting Bingham Sr. was originally written as a Governor instead of a Senator.</li><li> In the briefing for "'Til Death Do Us Part": Diana gets the gang name wrong by calling them the "Blue Claws". The text clearly says "Blue Crabs".</li><li> Also, there is an open grave reserved for Pappy's brother on the mansion grounds. The in-game dialogue seems to suggest the coffin belongs to Skip, whom you assassinated in the previous mission, and that the groom is Pappy's nephew. For some odd reason, this connection between the Muldoons and the LeBlancs was removed from the finished game (to remove any inflammatory subject matter?), and "Buddy Muldoon" was renamed to "Hank Leitch". In the first draft, Margeaux wished to eliminate Skip due to a prior incestuous affair with him, whereas in the final version, she just wants to shut down his business.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory">Damn You, Muscle Memory!</a>: If you played any <em>Hitman</em> game from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanAbsolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanAbsolution">Absolution</a></em> onward, be prepared.

Shoving them down <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StaircaseTumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StaircaseTumble">a ten-foot flight of stairs?</a> Not quite so believable, but plausible.

The other two female victims are both sexualized in ads, with one dressed in lingerie and the other naked in her bathtub. Didn't make IO Interactive too popular with parents' groups in the US, naturally.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelBoss">Duel Boss</a>: Note that a headshot will drop 'em both, just like any other enemy.<ul><li> In the second Vegas level, 47 encounters rival assassin Maynard John while on an assignment. John has been looking forward to this for some time, and because he wants to prove himself superior, he challenges 47 to a one-on-one gunfight in a soundproofed room: No sneak attacks, bomb traps, or coin tricks. He even provided semi-autos and magnums on a display table for you to use.</li><li> 47's final battle with Mark Parchezzi III is, at Mark's insistence, a duel. Mark had the perfect opportunity to kill 47 with a bomb earlier, but just used it as a distraction so he could go up to the roof and await 47's arrival.</li><li> Of course, both fights can be circumvented with some clever thinking (or metagaming).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a>:<ul><li> The actor chatting with his agent was most likely a target until Eidos removed that mission requirement. Diana warns of the TV crew covering the wine tasting, but they can't film you no matter how much you photobomb in front of them, so don't sweat it. There's also a few poison-able wine casks around, but nobody ever seems to drink from them. At a <em>wine tasting</em> there has to be <em>some</em> way to poison the target, no?</li><li> There are many things you can poison, but only a few are of any use; whether they are related to content that was dummied out or not is unknown. You can poison certain playing cards in "Death on the Mississippi" and even <em>shoes</em> in "A House of Cards".</li><li> The "Murderous Manicurist" is an interesting rating. You'd get it if you killed a lot of people with a nail file, but since Eidos didn't want that item included in the end version, you can't earn it at all.</li><li> A surprisingly large and completely unused section of the "Requiem" church basement (around the crematory) is modeled. At some point during development, the mission was likely planned to have 47 wake up in the basement before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being cremated</span>, and then sneak back upstairs to the unsuspecting funeral crowd.</li><li> The Mark III rifle which, while fully functional and having a space in the Hideout in the SD versions, cannot be obtained without the give all cheat or by modding the game. It was probably going to be obtainable in "Curtains Down", as the actors wield prop versions of the same rifle, and you can carry it openly without suspicion if you are in-costume. It must have been cut late in development.</li><li> Technically; the PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game run on powerful enough systems that the loading screens that show the targets of each level don't have time to show up (comes with the territory of running a game originally made for 2004 hardware).</li><li> There's a bowie knife in the games files. It doesn't appear in any level, nut you can still obtain it in the PC version with cheats or mods. Similar to the nail file mentioned above, it has an unique rating for killing a lot of people with it ("Jungle Boy").</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a>:<ul><li> "Kinda makes me feel like <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9mgZZsZGEM">riverdancing.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>"</li><li> An interesting easter egg exists in "Curtains Down". If you explore the Backstage area, on 3rd floor, you will find a door that requires a keycard to open, but this keycard is nowhere to be found. In the 1st floor room with some garbage bags, there are 3 rats. Kill them all and a keycard named "Keycard RatClub" will appear at the table. Head back to the door on the third floor, and open it with the RatClub keycard. There will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceMice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceMice">rats doing various things behind the bars</a>.</li><li> A very subtle one in '"A New Life". It's a rank called The Russian Hare, based on the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuFNjXlNiXk">real life exploits of a WWII sniper<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for those who one-shot kill combatants with the sniper rifle. You need to snipe every FBI agent on the level, with at least 10 headshots. Don't kill any civilians or the dog.</li><li> "Death on the Mississippi"... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsDeaderWithZombies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsDeaderWithZombies">for real</a>. There is an easter egg where if a certain amount of requirements are met, everybody in this mission will start limping or dragging around the ship, and anything <em>but</em> sufficient damage from explosives or a headshot can't kill them. They use melee attacks, which are incredibly ineffective against 47, so the mission's a cakewalk. Having to kill everyone on the cruise ship gets you a <em>much</em> lower ranking than Silent Assassin, but whatever.</li><li> There is a small silver coin outside the far left side of the front of the LeBlanc mansion, partially hidden in the swamp water. Shooting it will cause the men who are fighting outside to instantly lose their clothes, rush over to 47, and start applauding him. They will return to fighting after a time, albeit still in their underwear.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsArmed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsArmed">Everyone Is Armed</a>:<ul><li> In "'Til Death Do Us Part", all of the guests, half the guards, the two targets, and the dog (probably) are packing heat. The Blue Crabs who don't have six-shooters have shotguns instead. This mission is one of the "heaviest armed" in the <em>Hitman</em> saga since every NPC apart from the bride and the priest carry weapons.</li><li> "Requiem" drops you in a confined space with 12 members of The Franchise, including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cayne</span> himself. One of the agents in the crowd carries not only a stiletto, but also sometimes lobs an RU-AP mine at 47 as a grenade [!].</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingFades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingFades">Everything Fades</a>: Yes and no. Just as in past games, bodies stick around for the entire mission. However, in <em>Blood Money</em>, guards are fairly *ahem* unceremonious with the bodies of their dead buddies. The standard treatment is bag and tag in a black body bag and then *drag* said body bag across the floor, up stairs, through water, past civilians, and dump it in the nearest security office, and no one seems to care or be the slightest bit concerned. It's quite a macabre sight if you've been on a rampage: the pile just grows and grows.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolvingCredits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolvingCredits">Evolving Credits</a>: The title screen shows an audience inside a church at sunrise. The audience dwindles as you progress through the missions, with each member disappearing as you kill them, until only Alexander Cayne is left. It's also daylight outside, revealing the others were just ghosts, and Mr. 47's funeral is now at hand. Strange stuff.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacialCompositeFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacialCompositeFailure">Facial Composite Failure</a>: Some of the artist's renderings of 47 in the paper are....interesting. One of them is fifty pounds overweight and has shoulder-length hair. At low notoriety, the image will be wildly different from 47's rather distinctive face, but eventually the sketch artist <a class="urllink" href="http://images.wikia.com/hitman/images/5/5d/Notoriety_police_sketch.jpg">does begin to catch on.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatSweatySouthernerInAWhiteSuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatSweatySouthernerInAWhiteSuit">Fat, Sweaty Southerner in a White Suit</a>: 47 is flown out to Mississippi to mop up after two of them: Skip Muldoon and Pappy LeBlanc.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale">Femme Fatale</a>: This being a <em>Hitman</em> game, there are a few:<ul><li> The Franchise hitwoman at Lorne's. When she sees 47 pass through the VIP area, she will seductively gesture for him to follow her into a private room. If he does so, a cut-scene will play in which she stabs him in the neck with her nail file after making a remark. ("Men are so easy.") On the other hand, if you attack or try to run away, she'll pull a gun.</li><li> Eve will pull the same trick, and apparently uses this as her MO.</li><li> Diana has shades of this when betraying <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">47 and then Cayne</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a>:<ul><li> The main menu of <em>Blood Money</em> shows a group of strange people attending 47's funeral. As one plays through the game, it quickly becomes apparent that each 'mourner' is actually a target from one of the game's missions. As each level is completed, the corresponding 'mourner' disappears, until, in the end, only Cayne is left...just in time for the final mission.</li><li> The "story" being recited to Rick, the reporter from <em>First Edition</em>, is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a pack of lies. Not only that, Cayne mentions at that start of "You Better Watch Out" that the Feds "had our best agent on the spot. We were ready." The 'agent' is a female assassin placed at Lorne's party, a hint to Cayne's true role as The Franchise boss</span>. The hitwoman <em>will</em> sneak up and kill 47 from behind if she gets the chance.</li><li> In the newspaper you get after "House of Cards", there's an advertisement for the Heaven and Hell party which makes up the next mission. The angel is in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperific" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperific">Stripperific</a> clothing but sports a sinister grin and a stiletto just like Eve while the well-dressed devil just sort of stands there looking professional, just like Maynard John.</li><li> Most of the newspaper scenes include some reference to the next level (i.e. "Flatline" has an ad for Del Mar, which is visited in "A New Life") and there are even some articles that vaguely outline what The Franchise is doing behind the scenes (i.e. Morris ascending to Vice President). They seem unrelated on the first playthrough, but are much more coherent once you find out what's going on.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Frameup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Frameup">Frameup</a>:<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cayne's version of the White House attack</span> puts the blame squarely on 47, when in reality, he and Smith were <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in Washington to <em>prevent</em> the hit.</span></li><li> This one is worth a few yuk's: In "Amendment XXV", 47 begins the mission in front of a charter bus full of tourists. Sneak a weapon in the suitcase belonging to one of the women, and she'll get a big surprise when she comes to gawk at the White House. ("Talk about an Army of One!") Another possibility is to push the lady into the security lasers in the museum. Do it from behind the wall so that the cameras don't catch you in action.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangOfHats">Gang of Hats</a>: The Gators are a notable gang which operates on the Mississippi River, using the riverboat attraction as a front. The gators all wear telltale ball caps. They reappear beside Hank in the next mission, "Till Death Do Us Part," now wearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TackyTuxedo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TackyTuxedo">Tacky Tuxedos</a>. A sister group, the Blue Crabs, function as Pappy's private army.

Cayne however <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is lying about the events in question and is revealed to be only using the reporter as a mean to advance his plans for The Franchise's cloning capabilities.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetBackHereBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetBackHereBoss">"Get Back Here!" Boss</a>:<ul><li> The "Torture Room" in the Shark Club is set up to give Maynard lots of cover and prevent you from just running up to him and shooting him point blank, since he doesn't really have that much health. Challenging him to a duel is also the only way to assassinate him "silently", bar wearing the wrong disguise for the area and getting him to chase you.</li><li> In "Amendment XXV", Mark will make you chase him through an endless maze of file cabinets. If you're quick, you <em>can</em> kill him before he reaches the rooftop, but it will probably attract attention from all the agents milling about. An alternative way to kill him quickly is to enter first person mode before you enter the room he is in, and as soon as the cutscene ends, fire upon him before he starts to run.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost">The Ghost</a>: The President. His pro-cloning stance is the driving force behind most of the game's plot and an entire mission is about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">preventing an assassination attempt</span> on him at the White House, but he never appears or is even heard.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GildedCage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GildedCage">Gilded Cage</a>:<ul><li> Pine Cone, a celebrity rehab clinic.

They are very relaxed and even suggest just shutting their eyes during their psychiatry sessions or talking sports instead.</li><li> The gated community of Del Maur in San Diego. Vinnie was caught by the FBI and went into witness protection after snitching on his cohorts in Cuba.

Pull out your piece and fire at the 'gators to get them to stop and watch you in awe. (Or jealousy.) You can also shoot at some bottles sitting on a tree stump, causing the boys to cheer you on.</li><li> Also, if you stand idle on the outdoor dance floor for approximately two minutes, 47 will perform a square dance with one of the women present. Even better, 47 can join in on a drunken fight going on without it counting as a crime. (When in Rome...) However, if an opponent is knocked unconscious, he <em>will</em> open fire on 47 the moment he is woken, causing the rest of the party to turn hostile.</li><li> This also happens in "The Murder of Crows" if you loiter around one of the clubs. Just leave 47 on the dance floor without touching the controller, and he will start to boogie. It's possible to rotate the camera or enter first person mode to watch 47 tearing it up.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy">Government Conspiracy</a>:<ul><li> "Amendment XXV".

The "Till Death Do Us Part" level has an easter egg in which any bodies (alive or dead) can be pushed into the swamp to be eaten by alligators. One of your targets likes to feed chum to the reptiles, which makes your job easier. The other one is "A Dance With the Devil", set in a Las Vegas nightclub with a massive shark tank in the Hell-themed basement area.

President Stewart favors the idea of human cloning and wishes to make it legal in the States, but he can't do it without the public&#146;s support, and for that he needs Daniel Morris. In actuality, Morris' boss is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the former director of the FBI</span>, who is strongly opposed to legalized cloning insofar as it takes Ort-Meyer's research out of private hands; The Franchise employs at least two clones to carry out their hits.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyNameIsQuestionMarks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyNameIsQuestionMarks">My Name Is ???</a>:<ul><li> If you manage to kill the target without wasting any civilians or being spotted, and your Notoriety is at 0, the newspaper will report on a "Silent Assassin" on the loose and print a front-page splash of the victim (the primary Target). If however, you accrued a minimum amount of Notoriety (10 points or so) but still weren't identified, then the paper will print a silhouette of a featureless, bald man with a "?" for a face.</li><li> "You Better Watch Out...": If you pay close attention to the loading screen for this level you'll notice a "?" sign and a silhouette next to the 2 targets.

If you take the bait, she stabs 47 in the neck with a nail file. The second is in "A Dance with the Devil": the singer is actually a Franchise assassin named Eve, who will try to seduce 47 and invite him into an empty office. Should you follow her and wait for too long, she will pounce on 47's body and stab it repeatedly. <em>Yikes.</em> The third happens in "Requiem", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> if the player doesn't wake up 47 in time during the fake credits sequence, the funeral ends and his coffin is closed and then cremated.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoobBridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoobBridge">Noob Bridge</a>: 47 can climb things now.

Once awake, 47 must leave no witnesses and eliminate everyone at the funeral.</span><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBasedMission">Action-Based Mission</a>: Outside of the tutorial, the only instance in which combat is actually required is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">47's funeral, in which he awakes from his induced coma and kills everyone present.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossOnlyLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossOnlyLevel">Boss-Only Level</a>: Or a stealth game variant of it. "Requiem" is unique in the <em>Hitman</em> franchise seeing as <em>everyone</em> is a target. "Redemption at Gontranno" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman2SilentAssassin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman2SilentAssassin">Hitman 2: Silent Assassin</a></em> is somewhat similar, featuring only Father Vittorio as a VIP and everybody else as a target.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsBoomerang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsBoomerang">Chekhov's Boomerang</a>: The fake-death serum used in the mission "Flatline" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">plays a pivotal role in the epilogue. In order to destroy The Franchise, Diana uses the serum on 47 and later revives him with the antidote by applying it on her lipstick</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsSkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsSkill">Chekhov's Skill</a>:<ul><li> In "Death of a Showman", the game coaches you to get out your gun and hold up someone while he's relieving himself in a bathroom. Remember this method for the remainder of the game: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In "Requiem", if you wag the joystick when the priest is on his left side, 47 will grab him as soon as he revives.</span></li><li> So, for that matter, is the "Last Man Standing" mechanic found in this and <em>Hitman: Contracts</em>. When the player has lost all health, 47 enters bullet time and has a small sliver of time to save himself. He must score at 3 headshots to escape the mode. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">On "Professional" mode, the parishioners won't hesitate to blow the chaplain to bits. But if you shoot the front row of guards and then enter L.M.S., 47 will have just enough time to kill everyone before he exits slo-mo.</span> This is an effective but altogether riskier strategy, as 47 will die instantly if he gets hit again.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControllableHelplessness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControllableHelplessness">Controllable Helplessness</a>: "Requiem". If you don't wiggle the joystick to wake up before the credits end, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">47's coffin is dragged underground for the cremation</span>. Game over.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverDrop">Cover Drop</a>: The main art shows Agent 47 lying in state in a church, apparently dead. This turns out to be a setup for the final mission in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">47 rises from the 'dead'.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreditsGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreditsGag">Credits Gag</a>: The credits that roll over Mr. 47's funeral service are fake.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestHour">Darkest Hour</a>: The dramatic conclusion to <em>Hitman: Blood Money</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">47 has been taken down by The Franchise who have now completely eradicated the Agency. Cayne</span> has come to witness his adversary&#146;s funeral. All hope seems lost. Little does <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cayne</span> know, he&#146;s been deceived...</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead">Faking the Dead</a>: In "Flatline", 47 springs Smith from captivity by injecting him with a chemical to simulate death, and then applying the antidote after Smith is pronounced dead and sent to the morgue. At the end of the game, Diana <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">seemingly 'kills' 47 and delivers his corpse to The Franchise. Actually, he's under the effect of the fake death serum</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FissionMailed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FissionMailed">Fission Mailed</a>: The final sequence <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">involves Mr. 47's funeral after Diana betrays him. However, as the credits are rolling, the player can twiddle the thumb sticks to bring him out of his induced coma and take out everyone present</span>. One of the main misconceptions by most first-timers is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">47 dies for real, just as Cayne said</span> in the beginning. Look closely: Diana mixes the antidote with her lipstick, kisses him and then leaves 47&#146;s Silverballers on his chest. (This level is <em>so</em> secret that, on the Xbox versions, an achievement is unlocked just for sitting through the entire cremation. Realizing that there <em>is</em> a mission in "Requiem," and then completing it, is good for a second achievement of equal value.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAlwaysSunnyAtFunerals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAlwaysSunnyAtFunerals">It's Always Sunny at Funerals</a>: 47's funeral takes place at a private chapel somewhere on the upper east coast with dozens of assassins in attendance. Not a bad turnout for a Romanian freak of nature. Once the sun rises, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Alexander Cayne arrives with his spin team to record your death for posterity. Ultimately, though, it becomes a wake for Cayne</span> himself. (Overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CueTheSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CueTheSun">Cue the Sun</a>.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Kill 'Em All</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As soon as you&#146;re resurrected</span>, take your Silverballers and pop The Franchise agents one by one, remembering those headshots. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cayne is traveling at top speed toward his SUV. Once 47 pumps this manipulative, power hungry, little bureaucrat full of lead, that just leaves the reporter Rick Henderson</span>. No witnesses, remember; there is no way to do this thing cleanly. You can still make all the deaths look like an accident by disarming them and pushing them down the stairs, though.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveNoWitnesses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveNoWitnesses">Leave No Witnesses</a>: This is the objective of "Requiem" verbatim. Mr. 47 revives in the middle of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his own funeral</span> and proceeds to kill anyone who saw him do it, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">including an innocent priest and a reporter.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCarHatesMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCarHatesMe">My Car Hates Me</a>: Working in your favor to eliminate all the witnesses. Also, Diana has locked the church gates to prevent the reporter from escaping on foot.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundtrackDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundtrackDissonance">Soundtrack Dissonance</a>: "Requiem" takes place in an idyllic, seaside cemetery with "Ave Maria" playing on a loop. Perfect for a massacre.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a>: In the epilogue, the British government agrees to reboot the Agency. The game ends with Diana on the phone with Buckingham Palace, telling them that "all our resources are online again". Don't read too much into it; each <em>Hitman</em> game stands on its own so it's highly doubtful The Agency or Diana will ever be truly vanquished.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield">Where the Hell Is Springfield?</a>: "Requiem" is notable in the series for lacking an informed location. (The Training Missions in <em>Hitman</em> '16 and <em>Hitman 2</em> are set in ICA Facilities that are top-secret rather than simply unknown.)</li></ul></div><hr>
