The Locust are relentless, vicious, can pop out of the ground almost anywhere and seem to be numberless, but the COG have superior technology and the capital city of Jacinto is located on a plateau of solid granite, making it the one place the Locust can't tunnel up.</p><p>The player assumes the role of Marcus Fenix, a battle-hardened former war hero. When in cooperative play, the second player takes control of Fenix's best friend and fellow soldier Dominic "Dom" Santiago.

They handed the reins of the franchise over to Black Tusk Studios, which would go on to rename themselves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCoalition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCoalition">The Coalition</a> (a reference to in-game mythology, following the trend of official <em>Halo</em> developer 343 Industries). Their first work on the series was a remastered version of the first game titled <em>Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</em> was released August 2015 for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxOne">Xbox One</a> and PC (via the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MicrosoftWindows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MicrosoftWindows">Windows 10</a> Store) March 2016. The first original work from The Coalition was <em>Gears of War 4</em> and launched worldwide on October 11, 2016.</p><p>At E3 2018, The Coalition revealed three new games: <em>Gears Pop</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsTactics">Gears Tactics</a></em> and <em>Gears 5</em>. The first one will be a mobile game where players will battle the Locust as the series' characters in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/FunkoPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/FunkoPop">Funko Pop!</a> form, the second is a PC release that will focus on epic cover-based battles that the series is known for and the final one is a direct sequel to <em>Gears of War 4</em>. It will star Kait Diaz as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> rather than JD Fenix and will focus on Kait's personal quest to discover her family's connection to the Locust Horde and promises to take the series &#147;back to where it all began&#148;. All three games are set to be released in 2019, with <em>Gears 5</em> releasing on September 10th, 2019.</p><p></p><hr><h1><strong>Gears of War</strong></h1><p></p><div class="quoteright" style="width:189px;"><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/gears_of_war_001_1432.png" class="embeddedimage" border="0" alt="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/gears_of_war_001_1432.png"></div><p></p><dl><dd><div class="indent"><strong>Dominic Santiago:</strong> Welcome back to the army, soldier.</div><div class="indent"><strong>Marcus Fenix:</strong> Shit.</div></dd></dl><p>Released on November 12, 2006, the Locust Horde has been rampaging across the planet for about 14 years. Marcus Fenix was imprisoned for dereliction of duty four years earlier, but was pardoned when the Locust assaulted Jacinto Plateau and invaded the prison. Marcus was reinstated and assigned to Delta Squad alongside Dominic Santiago. His first assignment involves a priority mission to assist another group, Alpha Squad, to deploy a device that would help deliver a final strike against the enemy.</p><p>The game was praised for its beautiful visuals and innovative gameplay system. The most common complaints were a dull color palette but most especially an uneven storyline.</p><p>The game was remastered for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxOne">Xbox One</a> under the title <em>Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</em>, with a graphical overhaul to bring it up visually to the later games in the series, done in the same vein as the work for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">The Master Chief Collection</a></em>. The remaster even got a new "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwbYhvlrQbc">Mad World<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>" trailer.</p><p></p><hr><h1><strong>Gears of War 2</strong></h1><p></p><div class="quoteright" style="width:193px;"><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/gears_of_war_2_001_4392.png" class="embeddedimage" border="0" alt="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/gears_of_war_2_001_4392.png"></div><p></p><dl><dd><div class="indent"><strong>Marcus Fenix:</strong> This is it, Dom.

COG forces return to action in an attempt to make an assault on the enemy's home turf, while Dom embarks on a personal mission to find his missing wife Maria, putting him in conflict with his other responsibilities as a member of Delta Squad.</p><p>The second game received similar accolades, with many complaints of the first game addressed. The graphics are better than ever, a larger weapon variety is given and the story is epic while more personal. However, it still holds many slight flaws, but that doesn't reduce the amount of fun there is in playing the game. The multiplayer set-up has also been cheered, with the new "Horde" mode receiving the most attention; while it didn't invent the concept, <em>Gears 2</em> is the reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">most shooters have a wave-based survival mode now</a>.</p><hr><h1><strong>Gears of War 3</strong></h1><p></p><div class="quoteright" style="width:190px;"><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/gears_of_war_3_001_5924.png" class="embeddedimage" border="0" alt="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/gears_of_war_3_001_5924.png"></div><p></p><dl><dd><div class="indent"><strong>Augustus Cole:</strong> "Do you ever feel like you're dead, but nobody told you?"</div></dd></dl><p>Released on September 20, 2011, the ending of the second game has left both sides decimated, with Marcus and Delta Squad trying to keep their head down as there's no place left on Sera that is safe. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceWithAnInternetConnection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceWithAnInternetConnection">Anya</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Stroud</a> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">joined the team as a soldier</a>, Dom has grown a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeardOfSorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeardOfSorrow">Beard of Sorrow</a> and the approaching summer has the squad wearing lighter versions of their normal armor. The story picks up 18 months later when the COG leadership (what is left of it) approaches Marcus with some new discoveries about the Locust. Unfortunately, the Gears don't just have to contend with the Locust Horde: a new faction, the Lambent Locust, have emerged from the underground and are hostile to both sides.</p><p>With the added benefit of a multiplayer beta to iron out the kinks (including dedicated servers), <em>Gears of War 3</em> ended up the best reviewed of the trilogy with a very bright color palette, crisp visuals and fluid gameplay. A very full game release, it has a very long campaign where you can play with four characters at all times (including a co-op online arcade version), Horde Mode 2.0 (with some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TowerDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TowerDefense">Tower Defense</a>-like strategy), Beast Mode (a reversed Horde Mode where you play as Locust creatures attacking the COG), loads of features to track your gaming history and a single leveling system that works under all modes. The game was also built to be heavily modifiable, with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">Downloadable Content</a> pack called "RAAM's Shadow" containing an entire mini-campaign.</p><hr><h1><strong>Gears of War: Judgment</strong></h1><p></p><div class="quoteright" style="width:300px;"><img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/showposter_1.jpg" class="embeddedimage" border="0" alt="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/showposter_1.jpg"></div><p></p><dl><dd><div class="indent"><strong>Damon Baird:</strong> ...To survive out there in the field, you have to know how to adapt.

It is a prequel from fifteen years before <em>Gears of War</em> with Baird taking over as the lead protagonist. The game focuses on his time as a lieutenant in Kilo Squad, with Augustus Cole and others under his command. In the tale, taking place early in the Locust War, the squad is accused of treason for stealing COG experimental technology on a mission. The game uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMediasRes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMediasRes">In Medias Res</a> as Baird explains what they were doing and why, and along the way the campaign has various "Declassified" segments that adds a new wrinkle to the gameplay that are optional but provide a replay bonus along with a player competition.

Like <em>Gears 3</em>, it will have a multiplayer beta, which will be available on April 18 to anyone who has played <em>Ultimate Edition</em>, April 25 to the general public, and will end on May 1.</p><p>The game is set 25 years after <em>Gears 3</em>. The main character is James <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyJunior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyJunior">Dominic</a> "JD" Fenix, the son of Marcus and Anya, who first ran away from home to join the COG against his father's wishes and later went AWOL from the COG after being involved in some kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">Noodle Incident</a> that will apparently be explained in the game. He is joined by his best friend and obvious Dom-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> Delmont "Del" Walker, who went AWOL along with him after being involved in the same incident; and Kait Diaz, a young girl who is one of the Outsiders, essentially the new version of Stranded, though it's confirmed that the COG-Outsider relationship will be different from the COG-Stranded one. The campaign will have 2-player co-op, with the second player getting a choice between either Del or Kait. Other confirmed characters are Reyna, Kait's mother and leader of the Outsiders; and Oscar, Kait's uncle, a former Gear, and an expert survivalist (level of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazySurvivalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazySurvivalist">craziness</a> not yet confirmed).</p><p>The enemy faction is the Swarm, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">suspiciously Locust-like race</a> that has shown up out of the blue and started kidnapping people. The COG will function as secondary antagonists, as they think it's the Outsiders who are kidnapping people and are sending their new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks">Mecha-Mooks</a>, the DeeBees, to deal with the situation. DeeBees were developed by the COG to maintain order and peace within their walled colonies following the wake of the Locust War, as well as do dangerous jobs such as construction that have a high risk of injury or death <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">so that humans don't have to do them</a> and can focus on repopulating. However, the biggest enemy in the game is probably going to be the weather. Adam Fenix's weapon at the end of <em>Gears 3</em> apparently had the nasty side effect of turning Sera's already-deadly weather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>, and throughout the game the trio will encounter "wind flares", essentially fire and lightning inside a tornado. The strong winds will even affect the trajectory of bullets and thrown grenades, and the wind flares contain deadly "storm walls", Mother Nature's answer to the Hammer of Dawn. Also, it's been implied that they can happen at <em>random</em>, as well as at predetermined points in the story. Multiplayer, however, seems safe from deadly weather (at least for now).</p><p>The game is bringing back some of the horror and suspense elements of <em>Gears 1</em>, rifles such as the Hammerburst and Lancer now have stocks, and the latter has an attached flashlight to assist in navigating through dark areas (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">looks like Dom got his wish</a>).

The most comprehensive backstory detailing is <em>in the concept art book that comes with the collector's edition.</em> The key events that are not explained within the game involve: this is not Earth but a planet called Sera, the Pendulum Wars was a world-wide conflict over control over a super-fuel called Imulsion (started before the characters were born), Emergence Day was so devastating that the COG turned the Hammer of Dawn on their own cities just to fry the Locust and keep them at bay and leaving pockets of survivors called the Stranded.<ul><li> Fortunately, the comics and novels are doing this job for everything, even to the point of introducing new characters.

Bots are much smarter than in the previous games, with them intelligently taking cover and firing around and over it to kill you and enemies instead of charging out in the open and actually attempt to get away from you if you rush them from the side of their cover; in direct contrast with <em>Gears 3</em> bots that would stupidly stare at you from cover even on Insane if you walked up to them. However, the improved A.I. is the most noticeable in the Co-op Team Deathmatch mode, which pits a team of players against a team of Hardcore-level bots. The bots <em>play very disturbingly like real players!</em> They will employ nearly identical tactics that players do, firing at you with rifles from a distance as you rush to the power weapons and have shotgun battles with you when you close in on them. They even know when to quickly finish players rather than stupidly doing extended executions in the middle of a firefight. They are also incredibly good at flanking players and <em>very</em> accurate with power weapons unlike the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Artificial Stupidity</a> tendencies of bots mentioned below. If you're not careful, a team of bots can sweep the match out from under you. A marvelous A.I. improvement over the previous Gears titles.<ul><li> This is also very noticeable in the campaign and Horde as well. While in the previous games Locust would employ pretty good tactics, a lot of them would eventually just vault over their cover and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">walk through an unprotected battlefield in a futile attempt to hit you</a>. This also carried over into <em>Gears 3</em> Horde, where the last Locust left would just charge at your team's ready weapons. This is <em>not</em> the case in <em>4</em> at all. The Swarm will almost always hang back in their cover and wait for the player to approach them. While they are hanging back, their snipers will keep you pinned under their fire while a pack of Grenadiers or Scions will approach from the side. If <em>that</em> doesn't work, Juvies or Pouncers will jump nearby to draw your fire while the drones will rush you while you are distracted. Even in Horde, drones will generally move in groups of 2 to 3 and when down to the last 5 enemies, they WILL all crowd around you to take you out quickly.<ul><li> On Hardcore and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Insane</a>, it's not uncommon for them to charge from their cover and around yours for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> melee strike. On these difficulties in Horde, you have between 3 to 4 seconds to revive a downed teammate before they are executed compared to the roughly 10 second window on Normal.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Artificial Stupidity</a><ul><li> In the first game, combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalOverconfidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalOverconfidence">Suicidal Overconfidence</a>: your A.I. teammates will often vault over a perfectly good piece of cover to charge straight into enemy fire, resulting in them being shot full of holes.

Your AI teammates will ignore this piece of advice and spend the rest of the fight walking into the Imulsion and screaming for help. Especially frustrating on Insane difficulty.</li><li> Multiplayer bots in <em>Gears 3</em> are noticeably terrible at using explosive power weapons and Frag Grenades. Bots will usually pick up a Boomshot, Torque Bow or Digger Launcher and immediately fire it into the nearest wall or piece of cover and spectacularly blow themselves into meaty chunks. The Torque Bow is particularly hilarious, as bots tend to prime the arrow and immediately go into cover, only for the arrow to stick the cover and kill themselves.</li><li> The computer's stupidity is the only possible explanation for how the Locust and Lambent, two VERY intelligent and murderous species, will completely break fire from actual gears to target the decoys you build in Horde mode. These two are genuinely fooled by <strong>cardboard celebrity cutouts and mannequins!</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, the Locust and Lambent are incredibly dangerous and most certainly do not fall for such obvious-looking traps.

Sure, it's pretty awesome to shred enemies with the Mulcher or drop mortars on the Locusts' heads, but they make you move at half your normal speed and you can't roadie run or mantle over cover while you have them. Not to mention that they have horrible accuracy when blind fired and aiming with them makes you completely immobile. In the Mortar's case, it also has severely limited ammo and its attacks are audible from even the other side of the maps.<ul><li> The famous chainsaw bayonet is this in spades, especially in multiplayer. If you're struck while revving the chainsaw up, you will be badly staggered and left completely vulnerable. Furthermore, the lengthy kill animation has you completely vulnerable for over seven seconds.</li><li> The Buzzkill as well. You'll feel like a total badass if you can ricochet the saw blades to kill hidden enemies and it only takes about 2 shots to kill infantry, but besides the standard weaknesses of all heavy weapons, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">the blades can just as easily kill you instead</a>.</li><li> Just about any weapon that isn't one of the starting ones (Lancer, Hammerburst, Gnasher, etc.) count as this, if only for the fact that most enemies don't carry them, so ammo is often scarce and they all require precision in some way. The Boomshot and Hammer of Dawn play this the straightest. The Boomshot can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> any infantry and does great damage to big enemies as well, but you'll never have more than 3 or 4 shots and will often discard it in the same area you grab it.

But an in-game collectible carries a note from one of his Stranded members who comments that Griffin <em>always</em> refers to them as Employees, which many resent because they were obviously not getting health insurance anymore.

By the time you get to around level 40, you'll need roughly <strong>100,000</strong> xp to go up a single level! This feature fails because with the amount of time you spent going up that one level, you could've gotten the same credit bonus 2 to 3 times over if you hadn't completed all your Re-ups.

Brand, for her part, decides while she should and is justified in being judgemental and pissed, when the fate of what remains of humanity is on the line, holding a grudge is probably not the best thing for everyone; she'll wait until after. It's implied (but never outright stated) in the novels that Anya can't have children, but never mentioned one way or the other for Sam, with both women being in their early-to-mid 30's (Sam 32, Anya 35 or 36) during <em>Gears 3</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a>: As of <em>Gears of War 4</em>, this is what happens to Marcus.

There was also no stopping power on weapons, meaning players that were hit by gunfire while moving wouldn&#146;t be slowed down at all; There was also a limit to how long you could roadie run.

Since Wingman's typically played by 4 teams of 2 in a free-for-all setting, dumping an <em>entire</em> group of 5 onto a single team is <em> slightly</em> unbalancing.<ul><li> Another rather irritating bug from <em>Gears 3</em>: When starting a Horde match, if the current host of the match quits just as the match starts, the results screen will come up and say that the team has failed Wave 0. Since this game mode is supposed to start you from Wave 1, this is very problematic. When the host changes, the team will respawn on the map as usual: still from Wave 0. Even though you will hear the Locust's cries that signify the enemies spawning, no enemies will actually spawn, leaving you to wander around the map with no way to progress the mode. The only way out is to quit the match and hope you find another match with a team that won't quit at the drop of a hat.</li><li> There is an <em>incredibly nasty</em> bug in <em>Gears of War 3</em> and it is by far the worst out of any of the glitches. Without warning, when you start up the game, there is a chance that your Player Data file can become corrupted which will result in ALL OF YOUR DATA BEING WIPED FROM THE GAME! What's in the Player Data file? Just every last one of your ribbons and medals that you have pain-stakingly earned throughout your total investment in the game! Oddly enough, your Campaign collectables and achievements will still be intact, but imagine being one of the unlucky souls starting up the game to have some fun only to mysteriously see that your level has been reset back to 1 and every one of your ribbons and medals are GONE. The worst part is that this glitch has apparently been in the game since launch and nobody quite knows what causes it. It is believed that it is the result of faulty Epic or Microsoft servers glitching out at the EXACT moment you press Start, but it can apparently happen if you so much as sign in after you start the game. Also, Epic and Microsoft will do nothing to reset your stats back to what they were because the second you enter the main menu, your Player Data file gets overwrittten and basically pretends that your old data never existed. The only way to combat this is to hope that you have played <em>Gears 3</em> on another console that hasn't been hit by the bug so that you have an uncorrupted Player Data file. Then, you must transfer that data into a Memory Unit or Flashdrive and beam it back into your Hard Drive to replace the corrupted data. Only have one console? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Congratulations</a>, all of your hard-earned data is lost and your only option now is to start clean again from the beginning! Bugs, huh?</li><li> In <em>Gears of War 4</em>, if a player joins a social match at the moment when the cameras are showcasing the teams before the match starts, the bot that said player will replace will disappear, but the player will not be able to play and will be stuck in the ghost camera. This will rob a team of a player for an entire round and the only fix is for the player to quit the match or wait until the round is over.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">Gameplay and Story Integration</a>: An interesting example of this can be found in the first Gears of War and also doubles as <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

Normally, Marcus (technically, the player) is able to give orders to the rest of Delta Squad and change their behavior by making them more aggressive or having them battle more conservatively by hanging back. However, you cannot give orders for the entire first act because Marcus is only a part of Delta Squad as a Private while Liutenant Minh Young Kim is the current leader. It's only until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Minh is killed by General RAAM towards the end of the act</span> that Marcus gets promoted to Sergeant and becomes the leader of Delta Squad, allowing you to give orders for the rest of the game.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a>: The chainsaw bayonet was developed because the standard bayonets of the Retro Lancer weren't strong enough for the Locust's thick skin and kept breaking too easily.

Ominously, the "Brothers To The End" tagline fades to just "The End" in trailers and commercials.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastLousyPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastLousyPoint">Last Lousy Point</a>:<ul><li> A number of Onyx medals in <em>Gears of War 3</em> take a lot of time to get, even if you boost them in private matches. To claim the "Seriously 3.0" achievement, you need to have them all.</li><li> Ribbons are not exempt from this trope either. While even some of the tougher ribbons can be easily gotten in different game modes that provide better opportunities to get them, there are 4 particular ribbons that are noticeably difficult to get. The "Long Hauler" ribbon requires you to complete all 50 waves of Horde in one sitting. Getting through all the way to wave 50 can easily take you 2 and a half to 3 hours and that's not even counting if you repeatedly fail waves which will lengthen that time even more. Additionally, most people seem to drop out at around wave 20 and if you don't have at least two other players with you, completing the last waves is nearly impossible. Also, if you have to leave in the middle or your Xbox crashes and boots you off, back to Wave 1 for you! There's also the "Trick Shot" ribbon which requires you to score a headshot on an enemy with the Torque Bow and have that same arrow stick into another enemy and kill them. Good luck ever coming across two enemies that will be lined up perfectly for this shot without getting killed beforehand. Even when playing with bots, this orientation of enemies will pretty much never present itself and that's what makes this ribbon so frustrating to get. Next, there's the "Survivor" ribbon which requires you to revive yourself FIVE times in a SINGLE ROUND. Since you'll be forced into Gnasher duels for the majority of matches, the only way this could happen is if you're engaging enemies from a distance behind a piece of cover where you can't be hit from if you get downed there, leaving you to revive yourself in peace. However, since you can only go down twice before dying the next down, you HAVE to die at least twice, then hope that someone doesn't follow you to a good (or the same) spot for this ribbon so you don't get flushed out. Finally, there's the "No Smoking" ribbon which, naturally, requires you to kill someone with a smoke grenade. The only viable way to do this is in Team Deathmatch, Warzone or Execution. You basically have to pick out the last enemy remaining, down them twice, let them get revived and then run up to them (hoping that they don't kill you before you get to them, or you'll be screwed) and stick them with the grenade while you run away. Worse yet, there's an achievement requiring you to have each ribbon at least once. Going for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">all the achievements</a>? You must get these ribbons one way or another.</li><li> The "Foreshadowing" achievement added by "RAAM's Shadow": to get it, you must execute players playing as Lieutenant Kim while playing as General RAAM. This <em>cannot</em> be done privately, only in public multiplayer, where nobody ever played as Kim to begin with, even in the last two games, and certainly won't now since doing so will make them a highly sought-after target.<ul><li> And if they <em>do</em> play as him, it's because they are incredibly skilled at the game and <em>want</em> to be a highly sought-after target so that they just have to wait for free kills to come directly to them.</li></ul></li><li> "I've Got This!". You must get 10 kills in one round of Guardian while playing as your team leader. Guardian cannot be played privately. You are not guaranteed to get a turn as the leader every match. Leaders cannot respawn. If the team leader is dead, nobody else on the team can respawn either, which means if the enemy leader dies too quickly it will be impossible for you to get the required amount of kills. It also must be done on a map from the "Forces of Nature" map pack. To top it all off, it unlocks a set of weapon skins. It's the Last Two Lousy Points in One.</li><li> The original "Seriously..." was this, due to the leaderboards recording all of your ranked kills, but not all of them counted towards the achievement for reasons that were never fully explained. You could potentially have enough recorded kills to get "Seriously 2.0" and still be nowhere close. All of the other kill-based achievements had the same problem, but were only for 100 kills to "Seriously..."'s 10,000.</li><li> Unlocking Richard Prescott for use in multiplayer. To unlock Prescott, you must earn the silver Allfather's medal. Being a silver medal, this doesn't sound too bad; until you see the medal's requirements. The Allfather's medal requires you to have a medal in every available game mode (Team Deathmatch, King Of The Hill, etc.). The bronze medal for any game mode requires you to play 100 matches of that game type (not rounds, MATCHES). Since there are a total of 6 game types that count for the medal, you have to play a total of 600 matches just to get the bronze Allfather medal. The silver Allfather's medal requires you to play THREE HUNDRED matches of every game type, clocking in at a total of 1800 matches just to unlock a character. Even if you set the number of rounds to complete a match to 1 so you can boost them in a private match, you'll be in for a huge amount of grinding. This will be even slower if you only play matches online, as the default number of rounds for winning a match in most game modes is 2, with the exceptions of Wingman (which uses the number of total kills a team gets to decide when the match ends) and Warzone and Execution ( which requires FIVE rounds to be won to conclude a match). It also doesn't help that very few people even play Warzone, Execution and Wingman online. Some players have taken to just leaving the game running in MP while they go do something else, but even then, it will still be a painfully slow process to unlock Prescott and will most likely tank your versus k/d ratio in the process. (Fun fact, this troper still hasn't unlocked Prescott despite having the game since it came out in 2011 and Re-Uping all three times).</li><li> Also, to a lesser extent, unlocking the Savage Theron Guard. To get the Savage Theron Guard, you must earn the Onyx "I'm A Beast!" medal. To do that, you must complete Beast Mode on all four difficulties. Did I mention that you won't get the medal if you fail a wave? Fail even one wave in your run and you have to start all the way from wave 1 again or the medal won't be given to you. Doesn't help that this mode has a very unforgiving timer if you don't get to killing ASAP. Also, if you're looking to do this on Hardcore and Insane, you have to host a private Beast match so that you can change the difficulty, as it is set to Normal in public matches. Even if you do get enough people to play a private match with you, you'll still be in for one hell of a fight. The humans' AI is absolutely brutal at these levels, having ridiculous accuracy with even short-ranged weapons like the Gnasher and Sawed-Off Shotgun and massive damage output, forcing you to use weak-ass tier 1 locust so you don't burn through your pile of cash (Even if you do this, 5 people getting killed constantly will still use up so much cash that you probably won't even have enough cash to use higher tier locust). Most of the locust units in this mode are either clunky to control (Savage Corpser, Berserker), incredibly slow (Boomers) or are tall easy targets (Kantus and Armored Kantus) and have a difficult-to-cover weak point (Giant Serapede). Normal humans are easy enough to kill, but Heroes and Onyx Guards must be executed or finished with an explosive to be perma-killed. Oh, and they can revive themselves nearly instantly if they aren't taken care of quickly. You'll need a lot of patience and trial-and-error before you can finish this mode without failing on the highest difficulties, insuring that the Savage Theron Guard will be the last locust unlocked for most players.</li><li> <em>Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</em> brings a new lousy point with it in the form of the "Brothers To The End" achievement. To get this one, you must defeat General RAAM in co-op on Insane difficulty without either player going "down, but not out." Anyone who has played the original <em>Gears 1</em> will remember just how brutal RAAM's battle was, even with the AI glitch that prevented him from attacking you. This glitch no longer works in <em>Ultimate Edition</em>, so players will need a player just as competent as them and a solid strategy to get through this. Between RAAM's Troika, the Kryll and Reavers constantly pelting you with shots from every direction, you'll be killed if you even think about sticking out from cover to target RAAM. Doesn't help that RAAM is still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a> and the Tyro Pillar is a very cramped battlefield. Getting this achievement is as much of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a> as it is of skill in the players and a single mistake or stroke of bad luck will certainly lead to a lot of retrys.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeWeapon">Lethal Joke Weapon</a>: From <em>Gears of War</em> 4, we have the Repair Tool. It's range is pathetically short, limited to half a foot in front of you, it does less damage than the Snub and requires seconds of sustained fire to kill anything. However, it has infinite "ammo" and doesn't need to be reloaded, so if you focus on enemies that are pinned on a barrier or distracted by another player, you <em>can</em> actually <strong>kill</strong> with the thing! Justified since it's meant to repair fortifications and not for combat, but you can get a surprising amount of points for "repairing" the DeeBees and Swarm.<ul><li> The Smoke Grenade also counts. It's primarily used to stun players and temporarily obscure their sight and deals no damage with its explosion. However, starting from <em>Gears 3</em> onwards, if you melee tag someone with it, it will instantly down them after it explodes, allowing you to quickly execute them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedLoadout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedLoadout">Limited Loadout</a>: The first three games give the player access to two primary weapons, a pistol, and grenades on a cross-shaped menu.

There are so many random factors in this fight (Reavers shooting at you, randomly appearing Kryll, plus RAAM himself and his own pet Kryll) that winning is as much luck as skill, unless you abuse the AI-block glitch.<ul><li> Multiplayer in general can be this. Sometimes, you may get paired up with incredibly skilled and intelligent teammates and effortlessly steamroll the other team, or you get stuck with a bunch of inexperienced greenhorns and get butchered by the other team before you can get a decent score.</li><li> Certain ribbons can only be achieved through this trope, the most frustrating ones being Trick Shot, Smorgasbord and Ole. In order: you have to hope that two players are right near each other so that you can score a Torque Bow headshot on one player while the still-traveling bolt sticks the other one; stay alive throughout an entire Arms Race match so that you can kill a player with every weapon, and hope that someone picks up a Retro Lancer, decides to use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> charge attack, hope that you have Frag Grenades on hand, successfully sidestep the charge and grenade tag them as they run past you. The latter two are so difficult to get that The Coalition flat out removed them from the ribbon requirement for the &#147;Seriously 4.0&#148; achievement.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckilyMyShieldWillProtectMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckilyMyShieldWillProtectMe">Luckily, My Shield Will Protect Me</a>: With the previously mentioned meat shields and with the Mauler's indestructible Boomshields (that also double as roadblocks for larger enemies in Horde Mode).

Following title updates, they momentarily stun players to stop them from firing or moving away, but recover much faster than the former effect.</li><li> A "Stopping power" feature from firearms was programmed into every Gears after the first in order to encourage players to play more strategically rather than just rushing at the enemy. Now, if a player tried to run in the direction where they were being shot from, they would be slowed down to an increasing extent until they got downed. Thus trying to rush at someone would end up with you coming up short.</li><li> The Gnasher Shotgun, according to some players, was the only gun to use in multiplayer. Nowadays, it's a shadow of its former self, due to a few things such as the stopping power and the tightening of its spread. This was to give it a better medium range while still giving it the "gibs" effect at close range. The last title update to <em>Gears of War 2</em> returned the Gnasher to a point where it balances, if not outmatches, the assault rifles at medium range.</li><li> The Torque Bow in the sequel is somewhat weaker, as it no longer kills Boomers in one shot (around on par with the Boomshot grenade launcher in terms of damage). It still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One Hit Kills</a> Drones and Theron Guards, and also kills <em>you</em> in one shot on Hardcore (but not on Normal, where a direct hit doesn't even down you).</li><li> Like the Gnasher, the chainsaw bayonet isn't as effective anymore, as taking more than a handful of damage will prevent you from keeping it revved up and take a few seconds before you can rev it up again. Of course, certain players <em>really</em> hate getting chainsawed, so in their eyes it still hasn't been nerfed enough.<ul><li> Gears of War <em>3</em> rectifies it - getting hit while reving the chainsaw up will mess it up, but after you've managed to rev it, you'll keep it up despite getting damaged.</li></ul></li><li> An overlooked aspect is how the melee attack was weakened across the games, although in terms of stunning power rather than damage. In the first game and <em>Ultimate Edition</em>, melee attacks stunned players for 2 whole seconds, which pretty much left you defenseless to a follow-up Gnasher shot which the community used relentlessly. By Gears 2 onwards, the melee attack makes players flinch for about half a second, which allows everyone to escape from being gibbed and made <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry.

However, you can still down an opponent from 2 melee strikes, so the attack itself is still useful in damage output, but the lack of stunning power is predominately why almost nobody melees online anymore.</li><li> Come <em>Gears of War 4</em>, active reloading was somewhat nerfed. In the previous games, you could go for a perfect reload whenever you reloaded your weapon. Now, in multiplayer at least, each weapon has a cool down timer to when you can perfectly reload it. This requires that players now pay close attention to the situation and only get perfect reloads when they're about to enter combat. This was presumably done to prevent people from getting damage boosts in literally every clip they fire, as the community has gotten so good with reloading that everyone was doing a bit too much damage to everyone else. This helps give players more of a sporting chance.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverBringAKnifeToAGunfight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverBringAKnifeToAGunfight">Never Bring A Knife To A Gunfight</a> : Subverted, Cleavers are very useful and often kill mooks (even more than one) in one swing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTrustATrailer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTrustATrailer">Never Trust a Trailer</a>: The "Ashes to Ashes" trailer showed Delta Squad fighting in Char <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> completely intact.

It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelDifficultyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelDifficultyDrop">Sequel Difficulty Drop</a>:<ul><li> The second game is much less insanely difficult than the first, even if you still play on Hardcore instead of the newly added Normal difficulty. You can take noticeably more damage before going "down but not out", Locust are slightly less durable, the range and accuracy of the Hammerburst assault rifle has been increased to make it a viable long-range weapon, and the overall level design is more user-friendly and forgiving than before. Most notably, your A.I. squadmates are <em>MUCH</em> smarter and more useful, actually capable of holding their own even in heavy firefights, compared to the first game where they would charge the enemy suicidally and end up going down in the first 10 seconds, leaving you all alone and surrounded by Locust.</li><li> Also worth noting is that A.I. squadmates gained the ability to revive other characters in <em>2,</em> while downed characters gained the ability to crawl. In the first game, reviving a downed character involved running straight to whatever (presumably dangerous) spot he had been in when downed, and caused a game over if all the human players dropped (which was especially frustrating when playing solo). In <em>2</em> and <em>3,</em> this is no longer the case, as a downed character can slowly crawl away from the action and be revived by player and A.I. alike. The "down=dead" rule was brought back on Insane difficulty in <em>3,</em> but playing campaign in Arcade Mode swaps out the automatic mission failure for a 25-second respawn counter, with the defeat only triggering if all human players are dead simultaneously.</li><li> <em>Gears Of War 3</em> continues the trend, at least on the Normal difficulty, which is even easier than the Normal difficulty of the second game. You can survive a lot of damage, especially compared to the previous 2 games, and can even "rambo" your way through many areas. Your A.I. teammates are also a lot more competent, which helps a lot.</li><li> It should be noted that <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry.

It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelDifficultySpike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelDifficultySpike">Sequel Difficulty Spike</a>: <em>Gears of War 3</em> is the most difficult of the games to play on Insane, especially in key locations, as the inclusion of a dedicated four player campaign mode means that the enemies are more numerous and tougher. This holds true mostly for the basic Campaign Mode, Arcade Mode makes things both more difficult with enemy health being higher but also easier in that you don't need to restart if one person dies, they are put on a respawn timer, allowing the remaining players to simply take cover and wait for them to come back.<ul><li> <em>4</em> may perhaps be harder than <em>3</em>, since Insane difficulty removes the ability to get downed, instead just killing the player (although Snatchers can still down you since their entire gimmick revolves around it). This was true in <em>3</em> as well, but <em>4</em> lacks an Arcade mode that allows players to respawn. It also has multiple sections which become extremely difficult on Insane, almost all of which involve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">large packs of Juvies</a> (which on Insane can kill you in two normal hits or one leaping attack).</li><li> Further adding to 4's increased difficulty is the huge improvement over the enemy AI. Scions and Dr-1 Protectors will actively duck shots from your power weapons and standard Swarm troops KNOW that a melee strike will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> you on Insane and will constantly try to flank you by running straight at you and around your cover for an easy kill. There are also no Mutators to help you out and there are a few set piece encounters that are ridiculously difficult, like the chase of Jinn's gunship on Marcus' motorcycles, leaving you to dodge all sorts of hell at high speeds with only an Enforcer to fight back and the dreadful Fabricator segments which spawn huge amounts of enemies with only minimal fortifications to assist you. There is also no 4 player co-op, so you'll either have to tackle Insane alone, or with a really experienced friend.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelEscalation">Sequel Escalation</a>: Each game seems to aim to be manlier, gorier and darker than the last, with the exception of <em>Judgment</em>, which is just one single long mission with a lone objective (stop/kill Karn), broken up into levels of course, all taking place in the port area of a city. There is another bonus mission taking place later in the timeline that is also about accomplishing one single objective (procure a boat). <em>Gears 4</em>, since it's based on the trilogy, seems to be invoking this in spades, as the game will take place over a twenty-four hour period as the rebuilding human civilization has to deal with the new threat of The Swarm.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel Hook</a>: The ending narration of the first game is a bona-fide hook.

Let's count them, shall we?<ul><li> In the first game, the entire story revolves around using the Resonator to map out the Hollow (the tunnels that the Locust live in) and drop a Lightmass Bomb into it. When it gets deployed, it turns out that the Hollow is so huge that, as Hoffman puts it, "we'd need a hundred damn resonators to map the whole thing!". However, humanity is able to drop the bomb into the Hollow at the end and the Locust are seemingly defeated...until the second game shows us that the Lightmass Bomb did absolutely nothing to kill the Locust. Oh, and it also woke up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandWorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandWorm">the Riftworm</a>, giving humanity yet another enemy to worry about.</li><li> In the second game, humanity eventually comes to the decision that the only way to stop the Locust for good is to breach the grounds of Jacinto, humanity's last bastion of safety, and flood the Hollow with seawater to kill everything underground. After defeating a Lambent Brumak to be used as an improvised <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb">Action Bomb</a>, the humans are able to flood the Hollow and victory seems to have finally been achieved. But, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOrIsIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOrIsIt">yet again</a>, the third game reveals that the Locust STILL aren't down for good and even worse, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">The Lambent</a> have broken through to the surface with the intent of turning every living thing to their ranks, accelerating Sera's destruction even more.</li><li> In the third game, after Marcus and Co. are told <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> from Prescott that Adam Fenix is alive rather than dead like everyone believed, the game amounts to acquiring fuel and an aquatic vehicle to get Delta to the island of Azura, where Adam has been doing extensive research on Imulsion. When they arrive there, Adam reveals that he has concocted a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSolution">Final Solution</a> in the form of the Anti-Imulsion Counterweapon. The device will kill everything infected with Lambent cells, including the Locust. After a grueling and relentless war, Delta is able to deploy the weapon and the ending cutscene shows the Lambent being obliterated and every Locust dying. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">The war has finally come to an end, right?</a>.

We also find out that Adam's weapon didn't kill the Locust after all; it simply put them into a cryogenic state that mutated them into the much more powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook">Scions</a>.
