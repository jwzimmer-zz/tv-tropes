Taking place a few years after the previous game's end, Clementine has found AJ and is now taking care of him in the walker-infested, apocalyptic world. During a supply venture, the two encounter the residents of Ericson's Home for Troubled Youth, a group of children and teenagers abandoned by adults but still surviving.</p><p>Clem and AJ fit in nicely at Ericson's, but quickly find themselves entangled in the residents' internal struggles and outside threats.

While they suffered a considerable amount of loss over the years, they are more capable of defending themselves against Walkers, building weapons and traps and foraging for food.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionizedSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionizedSequel">Actionized Sequel</a>: The game has more advanced combat sequence than the previous seasons. Instead of a clicking of a button or moving the mouse to a cursor, fighting Walkers is now done in third-person action and the player must move Clementine to fight, choosing either to kick a Walker in the knee to stun it or stabbing its head.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless">Adults Are Useless</a>:<ul><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> One of the first things Clem notices about Ericson's is that there are no adults around to look after the teenagers residing in there. Marlon later explains that the reason there aren't any adults is because they all took off and left the kids (and Rosie) to fend for themselves.</li><li> Episode 2 however shows one adult who stayed with the kids, Ms. Martin, the school nurse. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> However, she turned into a Walker long ago after telling the children to run away while she stayed behind to protect them</span>.</li><li> You can also make this argument about the Deltas; if the adults were more competent fighters, they wouldn't need to kidnap <em>teenagers</em> to replenish their ranks.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AHouseDivided" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AHouseDivided">A House Divided</a>: The end of Episode 1, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> as Marlon's actions drive the others to stand with Clementine against him.

Kent Mudle joked on his Tumblr that if Clem ever attained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness">Medium Awareness</a> she would weaponize this to become invincible.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot">Hope Spot</a>: In the final episode, Clem, AJ and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tennessee eventually reunite with either Violet or Louis and all walk towards the school as they share heartwarming quips and comment how things will be alright for them now - only for Minerva to be revealed to be alive and bringing a walker herd on them, leading to either Violet/Louis or Tennessee to be killed in the ensuing chaos.

The dynamic between them can also be mirrored since both younger Clem and AJ are influenced by the choices the player makes.</li><li> The final episode of this season and Season One's "No Time Left" are very alike, particularly towards the end. Much like how Lee fought through a herd of walkers to get to Clementine, Clem (in a flashback) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">goes to the McCaroll Ranch and kills many of its inhabitants to get to AJ. Lee and Clementine are both bitten in the two episodes, both slowly succumb to the effect, manage to get "their" children to safety, and spend their last moments giving said children advice. The entire scene of Clem talking to AJ while she's dying from her bite is a direct parallel to Lee doing the same for Clem. The biggest difference being that Clem actually comes out of it alive.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">Hypocrite</a>: In Episode 2, one option is to have <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Clementine ignore Lilly's offered hand and get to her feet on her own.

Devs have said that this season is as much about AJ&#146;s morality as it is about Clementine. Part of the story involves the player/Clem acting accordingly if they <em>don&#146;t</em> want to turn AJ into a ruthless killer, similar to how Season 1 Clementine is affected by Lee&#146;s choices (albeit she had a stronger moral code back then). Two of the first in-game statuses are &#147;AJ is always listening&#148; and &#147;Your choices determine what he will become&#148;. Since AJ was born in the apocalypse, he knows nothing of the world before walkers and has little understanding of morality. If the player is so inclined, Clem has a responsibility to teach him how to be a good person. It&#146;s not as if AJ has innocence to lose, but that you are trying to instill innocence/humanity into AJ so that he can retain it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In Episode 3, James expresses concern that even a repentant AJ is going down a dark path and urges Clem to not let it be too late for him. Should AJ be allowed to kill Lilly at the end, AJ will empty half the clip into her corpse. One dialogue option in Episode 4 has Clem worrying that AJ likes killing, but he tells her he actually hates it, saying that it makes him feel weird and breathe wrong. But he <em>does</em> like protecting good people, and if killing bad ones is how he has to do that, oh well.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho">Ironic Echo</a>: During the raid on the train station, Louis half-jokingly states that if he gets bitten "Walker Louis" is going after Clem and Violet first. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When Louis initially refuses to help her if appealed to during the final confrontation, she can echo that statement by coldly telling him to bury her body deep because if she reanimates she's going after him first.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicNurseryRhyme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicNurseryRhyme">Ironic Nursery Rhyme</a>: Not an actual nursery rhyme, but "Don't Be Afraid" was a song Minnie used to sing to the other kids at Ericson. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In Episode 4, you hear her singing it while approaching the group... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamShot">And then you see her, feebly clinging to her ax, covered in bite wounds,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThousandYardStare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThousandYardStare">eyes wide and broken</a> as she sings "The night will be over soon..."</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">Irony</a>:<ul><li> As quoted at the top of this page, it's predicted that AJ will be the reason Clementine dies. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In Episode 4, he actually turns out to be the reason she <em>lives</em>, as she would have died of a walker bite if AJ hadn't amputated her leg instead of either killing her or leaving her to turn.</span></li><li> In episode 1, you learn that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Marlon was lying when he said Sophie and Minnie were killed by walkers, as in reality he gave them away to raiders.</span> In episode 4, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Minnie is killed by walkers for <em>real</em>.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackBauerInterrogationTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackBauerInterrogationTechnique">Jack Bauer Interrogation Technique</a>: Clem can preform this on Abel to get the location of the raider&#146;s bass, and the methods range from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">slamming his head on the table, ordering Rosie to attack him, burning him with his own cigarette, and letting him believe that he will turn, which he begs her not to let happen.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Karma Houdini</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lilly, if you talk AJ down from killing her in Episode 3.

Sure enough, Clem gets bit and is put in the same situation as Lee: She's critically wounded, unable to stand, surrounded by walkers, and insistent on being left behind. But instead of killing her, AJ chops off her leg and prevents the injection from spreading. She turns up alive and well in the end. Though people have died along the way, and Clem's missing leg makes her more vulnerable to walkers, the final season ends on a much sweeter note than the previous installments</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpitefulSpit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpitefulSpit">Spiteful Spit</a>:<ul><li> In Episode 2, Clementine has the option of spitting on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Marlon's grave</span> in Episode 2 if she's still pissed over what happened at the end of Episode 1.</li><li> In Episode 3, Lilly <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">scornfully spits on James after the Delta raiders capture him and Tenn</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritAdvisor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritAdvisor">Spirit Advisor</a>: In Episode 3, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">before the final battle Clementine has a dream of talking to Lee on the train from Season 1 Episode 3 and asking him for advice, with Lee noting she does this before every major battle</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome">Stockholm Syndrome</a>: Through the Delta's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreThanMindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreThanMindControl">mental conditioning</a>, their victims come to join them willingly and will murder even friends and family when ordered to. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Minerva is a victim of this and so as Violet if she is captured in Episode 2</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetieGraffiti" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetieGraffiti">Sweetie Graffiti</a>:<ul><li> In Episode 1 the fishing shack has a carved heart on one wall <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with "V + M" in the center.
