The first five games were introduced under his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NewWorldComputing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NewWorldComputing">New World Computing</a> company, before they were bought out by 3DO and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> began.</p><p>The games' definitive trait has always been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction">Science Fiction</a> elements beneath the surface of an otherwise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardFantasySetting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardFantasySetting">Standard Fantasy Setting</a> game<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0iudh');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0iudh" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0iudh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Up until <em>X</em>, which, due to taking place in the standard fantasy setting of Ubisoft's Heroes, is by the developers' statements prohibited from veering from the canon by having science fiction elements.</span>. Usually, the climax reveals that ancient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Precursors</a> are responsible for lots of what is going on in the world, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is a robot or an alien. Indeed, as it overlaps with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic">HOMM</a></em> universe, it turns out that Devils from <em>HOMM3</em> are actually aliens. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowUnscientific" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowUnscientific">How Unscientific!</a>.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>In terms of gameplay, <em>Might and Magic</em> games are all centered around first-person party-based <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonCrawling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonCrawling">Dungeon Crawling</a> in an open world. The games heavily emphasize combat and puzzle-solving over story and character interaction. Dialogue is kept to a minimum.</p><p>The first game of the series had a rather non-linear plot for its time (though it lacked most elements of the modern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox">Wide Open Sandbox</a>). Its maps were flat areas made of discrete tiles, and all movement happened in the four cardinal directions, one ten-foot "step" at a time. The engine used sprites to simulate a 3D view, and combat was turn based.</p><p>In the first two games, the action was set on flat, square worlds orbiting in space. The third moved the action to a "round" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameGeography" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameGeography">actually toroidal</a>) planet. <em>M&amp;M 4</em> and <em>5</em> were set on XEEN, another flat platform, with a twist: the world of <em>M&amp;M 5</em> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Darkside of XEEN</a>, literally the flip side of the world from number four. All these games have the player pitted against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TinTyrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TinTyrant">Sheltem</a>, a Planetary Guardian constructed by the Ancients, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">went rogue</a> and decided to protect his homeworld by blowing up all other worlds. Sheltem is finally defeated in <em>M&amp;M 5</em>, bringing an end to the whole plot arc.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p><em>M&amp;M 6</em> started a new story arc in the series. It switched to a different kind of graphics: instead of flat tiles it became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpritePolygonMix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpritePolygonMix">true 3D world, with 2D sprites</a> for characters and monsters, and the option of real-time combat. (Think <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em>, but with large outdoor areas.) The setting moved to the world Enroth, where <em>HOMM2</em> had taken place, joining the continuity more tightly with that of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic">Heroes of Might and Magic</a></em>.</p><p>The plot of this one concerned an invasion of the world by Devils. Said Devils turn out to be alien enemies of the Ancients, and defeating them involved unearthing some of the Ancients' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a>. Along the way this plot traded points back and forth with the HOMM games. For instance, Archibald Ironfist, evil mage defeated in canonical ending to <em>HOMM2</em>, was freed in <em>Might and Magic 6</em>, returned in <em>Might And Magic 7</em> and helped free a character who then showed up in an addon to <em>HOMM3</em>.</p><p><em>Might and Magic 7</em> was effectively more of the same and was tied very closely to <em>Heroes III</em> and <em>Might and Magic III</em>. So did <em>Might and Magic 8</em>, with a rapid scale-back to fantasy rather than science fiction and a nod to the pre <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MM6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MM6">MM 6</a>, making the party consist of on-the-road changeable crew members from a single person to five, and a darker, more mysterious and exotic continent as opposed to the knightly Enroth or light High Fantasy Erathia. But you could have dragons, vampires, trolls and minotaurs in the party in 8, so this makes it cool.</p><p><em>Might and Magic IX</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">almost happened</a>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">what we got instead</a> was such that many fans wish they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDisContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDisContinuity">hadn't even bothered</a>. The same goes for a number of failed spinoffs, such as the action-RPG <em>Crusaders</em>, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsBounty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsBounty">King's Bounty</a></em> remake <em>Quest for the Dragon Bone Staff</em>, and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CounterStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CounterStrike">Counter-Strike</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">clone</a> <em>Legends</em>.</p><p><em>Heroes of Might and Magic V</em> represented <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagicAshan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagicAshan">a complete reboot of the series</a> after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Ubisoft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> bought the rights from the bankrupt 3DO, with a new developer (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nival">Nival</a> Interactive), and taking place in a new, purely fantasy-based universe with no ties to previous games. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkMessiah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkMessiah">Dark Messiah of Might and Magic</a></em> is a first-person hack &amp; slash action game that takes place in the same world as <em>HOMM5</em>.</p><p><em>Heroes of Might and Magic V</em> was eventually followed by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaidenGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaidenGame">Gaiden Game</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagicClashOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagicClashOfHeroes">Might and Magic: Clash of Heroes</a></em> and <em>Might &amp; Magic Heroes VI</em>, but there were no further RPG <em>Might and Magic</em> games in the new continuity in the style of <em>Might and Magic I-IX</em>...at least, until mid-March 2013, when <em> Might and Magic X: Legacy</em> was officially announced.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narrator">Narrator</a> says in the beginning that Uriel was notorious for doing this too, saying "Angels cannot lie, but no-one every said they always have to tell the complete truth."</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate">Beef Gate</a>:<ul><li> This is pretty much a staple in most games of the franchise. You can go wherever you want, at the beginning (though forests and mountains act as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBridge">Broken Bridges</a> until you learn the fairly easy skill to get them), though in some cases you need an access key to enter specific dungeons or towns. However, if you go off the beaten path (the main roads in <em>II</em>, the Western Continent in <em>III</em>, into the dungeons in <em>IV</em> or <em>anywhere</em> in <em>V</em>) too early in the game, you will find yourself in the middle of monsters you can't handle. For extra irony, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalDungeon">Disc-One Final Dungeon</a> in V is accessible right from the start of the game. You don't need anything special to enter except a death wish.</li><li> <em>VI - IX</em> are no better. Although there's a certain linearity to all of them, but you can still wander into harder regions before you should thanks to the open world format:<ul><li> <em>VI</em> tries to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTunnel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTunnel">Plot Tunnel</a> you by limiting your travel options until you reach Free Haven. However you can reach The Mire of the Damned by going west from Castle Ironfist, which is full of undead (and quite literally so) and if you continue to the west and you somehow get through (possible with Water Walk and by going by south), you can get to Dragonsands, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">which is instead full of dragons</a>. Even after reaching Free Haven many places, especially on the west, are deadly. The Gharik's Forge makes a subversion as it is full of high-tier monsters and is on starting map, but on separate island and locked by a key (though it is not that hard to get).</li><li> Once you get to Harmondale in <em>VII</em>, you can access most of the regions except Nighon, Eeofol and the place where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a> is. The Barrow Downs is merely south of Harmondale and like Mire of The Damned, it is full of undead, spiced up with Gargoyles (literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Walls</a>, the strongest ones inflict Paralysis) and Gogs (explode upon defeat, have ranged attacks) for extra flavor. Deyja is deadly <em>even</em> if you stick to the main road, as you can get ambushed by randomly generated event which requires quite a bit of gold to get out of. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsGonnaSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsGonnaSuck">Both must be visited in order to complete first promotion of Sorcerer</a>. Nighon and Eeofol actually invoke this to inpede you from accessing them too early, which sucks because Nighon hosts the single Water Master in region, preventing you from getting Town Portal as soon as possible.</li><li> The portal of one Elemental Plane in <em>VIII</em> is on starting map, though it <em>is</em> a bit out of hand. Likewise, you can mostly go wherever you want, including into <em>other</em> elemental planes, as soon as you get out of starting island. The Murmurwoods are lethal if wandering into the forest.</li><li> <em>IX</em> has a particularly cruel example with Verhoffren's Ruins which is a dungeon situated on the starting island. It's at least hinted that you shouldn't go in here.</li></ul></li><li> This policy is mostly eliminated in <em>X</em> where the game and story are more linear, but there is one rather sadistic example early on. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Cursed Ruins are accessible to your party very early, but if you try to go there, you'll likely get slaughtered by the two specters at the front entrance. Not only does nothing in the game discourage you from doing this, it actually tempts you; there's a merchant nearby that sells scrolls for Burning Determination and Water Flows Freely, which, in theory, could protect you from their paralyzing attacks. (Save your gold until you're strong enough to survive the actual damage they do.)</span></li><li> Still happens in <em>X</em> at plenty of other points, given that you are handed free reign of the land eventually, although most over world enemies are weaker than dungeon enemies, and regions are still closed off until you access <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the elemental shards</span>. For example, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> just around the bend from a plot-important dungeon is a group of enemies that, unless your characters come prepared or you're not a first time player, is likely to stomp you. It doesn't help that they're holding a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KicktheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KicktheDog">recruit-able dog captive</a>.</span> In fact, the whole Act II (where most of the game world opens up) is like this and worse - you must follow one exact trail, otherwise the enemies <em>will</em> kill you. The Lost City is also nasty example: while its 1st, 2nd and 4th floors are pretty manageable by the time you get there, a pair of monsters from 3rd floor (which also guard the entrances to it on other floors) is enough to wipe out your party, forcing you to come back later.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerOnTheInside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerOnTheInside">Bigger on the Inside</a>:<ul><li> All games, but especially notable in <em>VI</em> where multiple dungeons are bigger than the maps where they are supposed to be located. Granted, some of them are partly underground, but the places such as Castle Darkmoor or Alamos have no real excuse.</li><li> <em>X</em> plays with this; rasters of cities/dungeons can be much bigger that the world raster would suggest, but moving on tiles in dungeon moves time slower, implying smaller and more detailed rasters for dungeons than for world map.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>:<ul><li> In <em>V</em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s castle has an unlocked back door that you can reach at a very low level. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate">It's guarded by the MegaDragon</a>, who has <em>sixteen times</em> as many hit points as the strongest non-bonus boss, and an attack that will instantly kill characters and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead">eradicate their bodies</a>.</li><li> Also in <em>V</em>, if you make too many puzzle mistakes in the Temple Of Bark, Barkman will be released to kill you. He has nearly as many hit points as the MegaDragon&mdash; though he turns out to be much easier at high level (or at a lower level if you know the trick), because he lacks that instant-death attack <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> or any ranged attack at all; this can be taken advantage of</span>.</li><li> <em>VI</em> has an area called the Temple of Snakes, which contains some medium-level enemies and a lone Gold Dragon(one of the strongest non-unique enemies in the game). But if you know about the secret panel or are unlucky enough to accidentally hit it, you find a small alcove with a few treasure chests and a fat peasant named Q. He has approximately 8 times the HP of the next toughest monster in the game, and continuously casts Finger of Death against you, eradicating a character when it hits. (If you defeat him, there's a treasure in this room that's worth the effort: the Horn of Ros. The strategy guide described it as "A horn that doesn't seem to work". Oh, <em>it works</em> all right. It shows you the numerical HP remaining when you view an enemy's health bar, which is <em>very</em> useful. (Buff up beforehand, and hope he doesn't hit your cleric with it. Besides his Finger of Death, which has a low hit rate, he doesn't do anything noteworthy. He just has a crapton of HP, so it will take some time to get him down. But he is not remotely difficult, especially when compared to the MegaDragon of MM V.)</li><li> Theoretically, the MegaDragon from MM 2 counts if you choose to fight him yourself.</li><li> The Megadragon makes a third appearance in VII, where he is once again easy to miss and completely optional. He's a lot weaker than he is in previous games, but still exceedingly tough - he's basically a red dragon with extra attack power and a chance to eradicate anyone who he hits.</li><li> Terminator Units in <em>VI</em>, being stronger than anything in the final dungeon, usually appear single or in pairs, and are the only enemies in the game that can inflict Eradication. A room full of those guards the chest containing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">Proclamation Scroll</a>.</li><li> There's something like this very early in <em>VII</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When you go to the Temple on Emerald Isle at the start of the game (the only place to get the Floor Tile, needed for the Scavenger Hunt), there's a guy named Sal Sharktooth and another guard. At first, both seem friendly, like the other guards. However, if you take the Fancy Hat in the next room (another item you need for the Scavenger Hunt), and then talk to Sal, he tells you to give him the Hat; if you refuse, he and the other guard attack you. Sal is tough given your likely level, and you can avoid the fight simply by giving him the Hat (there's another way to get one) or just not talking to him at all. But if you fight him and win, he's worth a lot of XP.</span></li><li> Similarly, the Red Dragon on Emerald Island from <em>VII</em>. You're <em>supposed</em> to leave it alone, but with real-time combat mode and a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a> the party equipped with bows can run circles around him and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping">Cherry Tap</a> him to death.</li><li> Also in <em>VII</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> if you find and access <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeLevel">the Strange Temple</a>, you fight a Blaster Guy "C", who is much like Tolberti or Robert the Wise, who you fought before.</span></li><li> In <em>VIII</em> there are three Pirate Captains (each with unique name) on their ships presumably leading the assault on Dagger Wound Island during the game's beginning. If you get to them early (possible by going straight to Garrote Gorge, picking Ithilgore the Dragon and Mastering his Dragon skill via Horseshoes found in stables, which gives you Flight), you find out they are much stronger than the pirates attacking the land, and one connecting hit will probaly kill anyone in your party that's not a Dragon. Subverted since later in the game, when you're searching for access to Regna, they will be at level of average monster.</li><li> In <em>IX</em>, there's the dragon by Lindesfarne, which has 39k health. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">Casting Poison Cloud ad nauseum</a> deals ludicrous damage thanks to the dragon's size being so big, it gets hit multiple times as the spell passes through it.</span> A bit of a subversion, perhaps, in that the quest leading up to it is very accessible very early in the game. However the quest is entirely optional.</li><li> In <em>X</em> there is plenty of these in later Dangerous Caves and some optional dungeons. The hardest of the bunch is probably <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Crystal Spider in The Lost City that guards The Shard of Fire</span>.</li><li> The Dragon Emperor in <em>III</em>. He's guarding a treasure horde and some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon">Ultimate Power Orbs</a>, but you don't specifically need those (or need to fight him to get them).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMooksClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMooksClothing">Boss in Mook's Clothing</a>: Any time a Gold Dragon appears in one of the later games, it qualifies. These things are <em>tough</em>, and they'd likely qualify as actual Bosses if not for the fact that they weren't unique.<ul><li> In <em>X</em>, you can access two "Dangerous Caves" very early in the game; most Dangerous Caves in the game have actual Bosses, but one of the two you can access early (the one which has a convenient warning outside telling you that there's a grumpy cyclops inside) just has a very powerful monster that might just count as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook">Elite Mook</a>. Nonetheless, it really best not to go in and fight it until you're Level 17 or so.</li><li> In <em>III</em> the bosses of various temples are skinned exactly like the mooks inside, they just have an extra attack a round, more HP, and a different name. Only the Dragon Emperor is different. It also has the Eradicators in the final dungeon, who are immune to physical damage and can eradicate your party.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a>:<ul><li> Bows, whenever they appear.</li><li> While many low level spells are case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp">Can't Catch Up</a>, the Sparks are usually an exception. This is because the damage per spark rises with your skill and number of sparks increases with your mastery. Therefore, in VII the grandmaster can cast 9 sparks that each hits for at least 12 damage, which accumulates quite fast, not to mention you can mine the ground with them as you escape, or you can throw them on enemies stuck in a hole.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines">Bottomless Magazines</a>: You never have to buy ammunition for ranged weapons, and you have unlimited ammunition.

If you use the scroll, snatch the bonii and the treasures, you can flee to Abdul's desert resort and hire a gate master to teleport to any city in the game and arm yourself with the highest tier gear at the start.</li><li> The spell non-restriction in <em>VI</em> essentially means you can put your Air Magic on Expert, which is quite easy if you know where to look for teacher, and using the above tactics you can learn powerful spells like Flying quite fast. Similarly, you can get Power Cure right as soon as you get into Free Haven, if you have money for it.</li><li> Another example from <em>VI</em> would be Alchemy. Unlike in later games, there was not Alchemy skill <em>per-se</em>, instead it was an innate ability of every person. Yes, this means that you can create the strongest potions out of bat, for which you need only three types of ingredients that are scattered practically everywhere. While black potions are far less potent than in later games, you can still add +10 to every stat of all party if you're persistent.</li><li> Likewise, you can promote your Sorcerer full way to Archmage before even getting to Free Haven. The first promotion quest is really simple, you must drink from Fountain of Magic, which is located on main continent in Bootleg Bay - most likely third location you can get to. The second promotion quest is a bit harder - you must essentially traverse Corlagon's estate. However, while enemies there may be annoying because of ability to curse and age your characters, they have relatively low stats, none of them have ranged attacks and mostly narrow corridors make easy to keep distance, especially if your Wizard has Sparks spell and Air Magic Expertise on him. The only problem may be Corlagon himself, but even he's not immune to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a>. And the promotion gives you instant access to Master Level Air magic.</li></ul></li><li> Might and Magic 7 clearly tries to dampen this trope with forcing spells to have skill level requirements and promotions, as well as putting more effective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate">Beef Gate</a> levels like "Tunnels to Eeofol" where escape from Behemoths is (almost) impossible (several speedrunners *still* went to Eeofol around starting levels and have boosted themselves. That said, Bracada has a guaranteed flight scroll in a chest, and *tons* of free gold and items laying around like colorful candies, as well as super-high level ores for crafting. One clickfest, flight acrobatics and clear Bracada later, your starting party will certainly be equipped to take on the world weeks of playing in advance. Non-combat quests if you know where to look for them can level you up and make you rich just as well.</li><li> Might and Magic VI and VII has the "Assistant" system, non-combatant specialists that take a signup payment in advance and take a bit of your money; some of them giving insane bonuses. A windmaster can cast Fly, letting your party fly everywhere to loot the hell out of the map, and a gatemaster can cast Town Portal. Even the mundane ones have crazy perks: a Scholar will bring unlimited item identification and +5% Experience earned. A windmaster and a scholar can speed up the game in days of gameplay.</li><li> Might and Magic 8 admits defeat and takes it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>(Speedrunners with glitches finish the game around 20 minutes). If you know where to look you can acquire a low level (but nontheless extremely powerful) Dragon and a level 50 Dark Elf very early (Said dark elf has all the elemental spells, grandmaster -perfect- disarm trap skill and merchant skill, effectively dominating the game in *every* technical aspect). The Dragon especially becomes significantly more powerful than his peers over time, because you can distribute his skill points as you see fit. Several towns also have artifacts hidden in trees and rocks right at the beginning of the game.</li><li> In <em>X</em> relics possibly count as these. Even at level one they are stronger than the base equipment you can find. While those in Dangerous Caves won't see light for quite some time, The Mysterious Crypts are completely devoid of any monsters and require just to solve (sometimes arguably rather hard) puzzles. Also, the Tower of Enigma can be gotten into as soon as you get Blessing of Shallassa if you don't feel like fighting Black Guards and houses rather powerful relic for your mage.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a>: Lord Xeen in IV, who serves Sheltem of V.

Particularly bad in VII, as your party actually <em>rules the town where your own subjects treat you like dirt</em>. The latter is somewhat justified by the town's complete lack of faith in your ability to rule being a central plot point, but their attitude doesn't improve as much as one might expect after you have clearly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking">asserted your authority</a>. Their dialogue does change after you've cleared out and renovated Castle Harmondale, but you can't put the last of their doubts to rest until you choose a new arbiter and end the war.<ul><li> The problem is, starting with <em>VI</em>, you have a Reputation Score people are mean to you if it's low, and it's <em>much</em> harder to raise it than it is to lower it. (The bad things you do stick out in people's minds longer than the good things, which makes sense, sort of.) One example: In <em>VI</em>, one of the first available Side Quests you have is from the first NPC you meet in the game, who asks you to get a candelabra from the abandoned temple outside of town. It's not required, but you probably should, because it's an easy job, and a good way to get some fast gold and experience, which you kind of need early in the game. Unfortunately, seeing as the candelabra in question belonged to some evil cult, it lowers your Reputation Score, and the townsfolk aren't going to like you right off the bat.<ul><li> Even <em>worse</em>, having a bad Reputation Score can sometimes require you to do things that make it even worse. Some <em>important</em> or even mandatory quests require you to find and recruit NPCs, and if you have a bad reputation, they won't listen to you when you talk to them. Threatening them usually works, but that lowers your Reputation Score even more. (You're going to end up as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity">Heroes With Bad Publicity</a> before winning these games, most likely.)</li></ul></li><li> In <em>X</em>, the heroes likely wouldn't expect much respect, being Raiders, a type of adventurer with a shady reputation that few people trust. However, much of the first part of the game is spent <em>earning</em> that trust, and you do so rather quickly.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DueToTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DueToTheDead">Due to the Dead</a>: Grave robbing is bad in this franchise. Looking a sarcophagus or selling human bones and other remains in most games is considered evil, and will damage your reputation. (Of course, taking other stuff in tombs is all right, for some reason.)<ul><li> This is also the original motivation of the heroes in <em>X</em>. They first come to Sorpigal-by-the-Sea to take the cremated ashes of their mentor to another town, which they cannot do because of a royal edict that makes it off-limits due to the political turmoil.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat">Dump Stat</a>: Intellect/Intelligence (the name varies from one game to the next) has no effect on classes lacking elemental spellcasting abilities (or learn Master Learning, which requires 50 Intellect in addition to the usual prerequisites), while Personality is useless for classes that can't cast self magic (or learn Master Merchant). This makes at least one of the two a dump stat for every class except Druids and Rangers. In fact, this also means that the Insane condition (which increases Strength but cripples Intelligence) is actually a benefit to some classes, like the Knight.<ul><li> Averted in <em>Might and Magic VII</em> and <em>VIII</em>, as each outdoor region has a Game, Contest, Test, or Challenge that rewards characters with extra skill points for having a certain stat above a certain threshold. Even Knights can benefit from having Intellect of 200 or higher, as they can then gain 10 skill points from a Challenge of Intellect. You can bypass it with temporary boosts though.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">Earth-Shattering Kaboom</a>: generally encountered whenever the series needs a radical change in the setting (see <em>Armageddon's Blade</em>, the titular artifact of a Heroes 3 expansion of the same name).<ul><li> For a milder version, refer to the dark magic spell, "Armageddon".</li><li> Occurs as a bad ending for <em>VI</em>, if you didn't free Archibald to get a protective spell.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElaborateUndergroundBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElaborateUndergroundBase">Elaborate Underground Base</a>: The final dungeon in several of the games is one of these, being the sci-fi corridors beneath the fantasy world.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElegantWeaponForAMoreCivilizedAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElegantWeaponForAMoreCivilizedAge">Elegant Weapon for a More Civilized Age</a>: Ancient weapons, a.k.a. blasters, are pretty rare and hard-to-find in <em>VI</em> and <em>VII</em>, but they do exist. Some people even managed to become experts in their use, and can teach the protagonists.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalEmbodiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalEmbodiment">Elemental Embodiment</a>: Various games have different elementals as enemies. In <em>VI</em> some of these are actually artificial constructs that were designed to guard specific locations, such as Gharik's Forge. <em>VII</em> actually allows you to summon Light Elementals if you've chosen the Light Path. The frenzy of elementals also kickstarts the plot of <em>VIII</em>, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPlane">Elemental Planes</a> themselves appear as well. <em>VIII</em> also complements them by various Crystal Monsters in Great Crystals. <em>X</em> has an important (side)quest involving the original quartet plus light and dark elementals and their lords.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers">Elemental Powers</a>: Magic in these games is divided into schools based on elements. The basics are Air, Water, Fire, and Earth, while Dark and Light is more advanced magic (which, in later games, can only be used by players that are Evil and Good, respectively). Each player also has six Resistance scores, measuring how well he can resist each form of magic. (It starts at zero, but magic and items can increase it.) Monsters use attacks based on these elements too, and also often have Resistances (some have two, and some very powerful ones have several). Energy is a special seventh form that usually only comes into play late in the games; this cannot be resisted. Blaster weapons cause Energy damage, and so do some of the most powerful monsters.<ul><li> <em>X</em> adds another type of magic called Primordial, which also seems to be a type of advanced magic.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower">11th-Hour Superpower</a>: If you can get Blasters at all, they're going to be this. Case in point: in <em>VI</em> you can get them only after completing the objective in Tomb of VARN, which is also third-to-last objective of the game (the following being to acquire the weapons themselves). In <em>VII</em> you can get them only in Eeofol (which requires a difficult trek through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel">Marathon Level</a>) and one dungeon in Shoals (which is only unlocked after completing the mission in Eeofol and is the place of final task).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a>: In the games where you have to choose the Dark or Light Path, your party seems to be an Evil Counterpart (or Good Counterpart) to what your party would be had you chosen the other path, and the reasons become obvious when you compare the quests in each path. While the plot is changed in a big way, there are many instances where the Quests you take are only different in terms of cosmetics and what your motives are. One example: If you're on the Light Path in <em>VII</em>, your superior is Robert the Wise, and an enemy you have to kill near the end is a guy named Tolberti. If you're on the Dark Path, the opposite it true. As far as the actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle">Boss Battle</a> goes, the two are the same character in every way except cosmetically. Another good example: For the Crusader to Villain Promotion Quest (which is recommended for Paladins on the Dark Path) you have to kidnap a maiden named Alice; for the Promotion Quest that Paladins take on the Light Path, you have to <em>rescue</em> her - from the guy who would have told you to kidnap her, had you chosen the Dark Path.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpressiveSkull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpressiveSkull">Expressive Skull</a>: If you can have Lich in your team chances are they are going to have such skull. Does not apply to enemy liches however.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink">Fantasy Kitchen Sink</a>: <em>Everything</em>. The series had already started as a mix of science fiction <em>and</em> fantasy fiction, with robots and ancient alien technology joining in as early as III. Turns out most worlds were flat artifical worlds built by cosmic elemental forces in space, led by Ancients, godlike humanoids. Around 4 and 5, world-threatening <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is already established as a rogue robot, and there are many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a> droids running around. The world protector dragon Pharaohs live in technological havens for pyramids, and have a lot of high-tech equipment to manage "nacelle" worlds. In VI, it is eventually revealed that the world is a normal planet, but colonized by a ship from VARN with the ship personnel's passwords directly ripped from Star Trek, the ship being a literal Egyptian pyramid with engines, now protected by rogue elemental constructs resembling Anubis and Djinni. Also the sixth and seventh game gives an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> in the shape of blasters, literal laser weapons to destroy the final bosses, though they can be used for annihilating all the enemies up to that point with vengeance. It kicks into overdrive in VII as the party from the third game lands on Antagarich in an escape spacecraft and splits up to support opposing factions, to restore the Golden Age of Technology, or to conquer the world with a Star Trek Replicator, respectively. At its zenith, the series have everything from cosmic energy beings to standard fantasy races and undead, robots, lasergun-wielding Liches and Terminator robots. The "science fiction" aspect declines sharply at VIII to mere snippets of lore and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> being an android to destroy worlds infested by demons by dislocating the elemental balance of the planets. In the ninth game, all science fiction seems axed and the setting is harshly pulled into Norse mythology, and it's all downhill from there.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlunkyBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlunkyBoss">Flunky Boss</a>: Actually it might be easier to list the Bosses that <em>don't</em> qualify. Most have at least a small mob of normal monsters helping them, and a few have dozens.<ul><li> This doesn't seem to be the case as much in <em>X</em>, however. A few bosses have minions, but many fight alone. Of course, the bosses in <em>this</em> game are <em>tough</em>; a monster even has a special benefit simply for being a Boss that seems to make it immune to status effects or attacks that don't damage it directly.</li><li> Tolberti/Robert The Wise in <em>VII</em> avert it as well, as they fight you alone, <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

(An early quest in <em>VII</em> resulted in you getting the deck you needed to play it.) Each tavern had its own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseRules">House Rules</a>. 3DO actually marketed <em>Arcomage</em> as a title of its own.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBusting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBusting">Genre-Busting</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GladiatorGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GladiatorGames">Gladiator Games</a>: Most games in the series have an Arena you can go to where you can fight monsters to win gold (and in some cases, experience). The rules vary depending on which game, and the monsters are chosen at random, although you can usually pick the level of difficulty. (Although the difficulty levels often get more difficult overall as your own experience levels get higher.) Sometimes you have to pay a fee to enter, and other times you can only go on certain days. In at least one game, a promotion quest depends on going there.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrailInTheGarbage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrailInTheGarbage">Grail in the Garbage</a>: Yeah, you can find some powerful stuff in these games lying around in unlikely places. Very early in many games, if you check out the stables in the towns you have easy access to, you're likely to find horseshoes. Of course, a stable is a place where you'd expect to find horseshoes, most likely, but in these games, horseshoes increase your Skill Points by 2 when you use them, making them incredibly valuable.<ul><li> Starting in <em>VII</em>, you can't sell artifacts you find, and if you pick up any that you can't use, you may have to <em>throw</em> them in the garbage. And there's more than you might think. Many can only be used by a specific <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> race, like the sword <em>Elfbane</em> (only a goblin can use it, assuming he's a class that can use a sword), or can only be used by Good or Evil characters (Ethric's Staff is useful for your wizard if you're on the Path of Dark, but worthless if you're on the Path of Light, and if you <em>are</em> on the Path of Dark and find Taledon's Helm, you have the opposite problem.) Also, any character can wear the Cloak of the Moon or the Cloak of the Sun, but because the first augments Dark spells (which you can't learn if you're on the Path of Light) and the second augments Light spells (same problem if you're on the Path of Dark) one of them isn't going to be any good. The only way to get rid of these priceless artifacts - other than just stash them in your castle - is to throw them away.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">Greater-Scope Villain</a>: The rarely mentioned Creators were this in the first five games, a mysterious race described as hostile to the Ancients' experiments and in the habit of creating vile armies to disrupt them, a looming threat by the Great Experiment's distance from the Ancients' home space, but who never actually end up <em>doing</em> anything to the shown worlds (Sheltem's malfunction is his own)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3ef72');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3ef72" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3ef72');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Except in a meta sense. The Creators were something of a nod to the team <em>creating</em> the games, and hence, responsible for everything that happens</span>. A long-standing fan theory was that the Creators were this for the Enroth games through the Kreegans, them being a very vile army, but <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry. It should be moved to the TRIVIA tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> later stated the Kreegans were separate from the Creators and had their own goals and plans.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality">Grey-and-Gray Morality</a>: The Necromancer-Church of the Sun War in <em>VIII</em> is surprisingly nuanced, given how Necromancers and Light-aligned Clerics are presented in the other games; the Necromancers' Guild of Jadame is fairly live-and-let-live, or at least not out to conquer the continent anymore, and the Church's Jadamean branch has some pretty strongly implied tendencies towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch">Corrupt Church</a>.<ul><li> It's not only implied, it's explicitly mentioned by Dyson Leyland (a plot-critical hireling). Then again, he hates both sides, so probably doesn't care who you end up with.</li><li> Another good example: Lady Loretta Fleise (note the name) is Roland's vassal in charge of tax and tariff collecting in <em>VI</em>. (That means she's supposed to be with the good guys.) However, the task she wants you to do before she gives you her approval for the main line quest is go to all the stables and have them jack their prices. She's basically telling <em>you</em> to do this so no-one can rightfully accuse <em>her</em> of price gouging in order to rip travelers off. (This originally lowered your Reputation score a full level, but this was a bug that was fixed in the 2.0 version.) Still, this is likely the easiest of the council quests, so it's hard to complain.<ul><li> The other nobles don't seem to like her much, either. In one quest, when you recover an important document (from a dungeon in her jurisdiction) she tells you to go to Lord Anthony Stone to get your reward. (Apparently, she feels it's his problem because the document involves a criminal he was looking for.) If you do that, Stone calls her a "greedy witch", but he does reward you for it.</li><li> If you complete the quest, Lady Fleise reveals she is using the money to build more granaries in the kingdom to prepare it for the trials ahead. So perhaps she doesn't care how others think that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheMoneyIHaveRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheMoneyIHaveRules">she's greedy, she's looking out for the common man</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <em>VII</em> also hints at this at occassion, shown by the vitriolic reactions of the givers of the Light-aligned promotion quests towards you if you're Dark-aligned, sometimes even accompanied by death threats. Best shown in hindsight by Charles Quixote, who becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> driven dragonslayer in <em>VIII</em>.</li><li> <em>X</em> has also this, where many <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Faceless (dark-aligned side)</span> don't want to have anything with the war between them and the light quite few of Inquisitors and Angels (ligth-aligned site) being fanatical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolierThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolierThanThou">Holier Than Thou</a> warriors not refraining from crossing the <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

On the one hand, they do fairly low damage that cannot be increased by your Might score or your skill in Blasters. Also unlike other weapons, they cannot be enchanted. However, on the other hand, they do have an <em>extremely</em> high rate of fire, so you can deal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">Death of a Thousand Cuts</a> with them, especially when you fight in the real-time mode.

When you reappear outside, you must rush to the western spur of the Shrine and touch its south wall, which returns you safely to New Sorpigal. Meanwhile, you can pick up several useful items including a set of very good chain mail, and find a "chest" that gives you money. Another way to get home is to hire a Gate Master in New Sorpigal who can cast Town Portal once per day, or, provided you left with enough Fly duration, to head southwest, dodging the volleys of dragon breath, to the Desert Resort where a Gate Master lives in one of the houses. You then have the option of 'porting to Free Haven where you can buy Lloyd's Beacon, revisit NWC and put a marker right by the money chest, allowing you to loot, deposit money in New Sorpigal, and return, until you're tired of accumulating funds.</span></li><li> In <em>VII</em> they have the "Strange Temple" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> which is another version of the NWC Dungeon, which is reached by using a model-temple-in-a-bottle found in sunken ship.

Play the your cards right and a group of pure casters (Clerics and Sorcerers) can be deadlier than hybrid classes or Knight at the beginning of the game already. A Sorcerer with Sparks spell can clean enemies more efficiently than Knight with his sword and all classes can learn bow, the most useful weapon for when mana runs out, anyway. The gap widens even more when you get to Dark and Light magic, as the former has spells like Shrapmetal with potential of dealing huge physical damage or Armageddon spell that deals about 50 points of damage <em>to an entire map</em>, something with what Knights and hybrid classes will only hardly keep up. The latter has powerful spells that raise stats, reduce damage and completely heal the party, meaning with enough skill points and equipment boosting it even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a> can punch out a <em>minotaur</em>.</li><li> Toned down in <em>VII</em> where now spells are tied to magic mastery, so they are not so easy to get, therefore power curve for pure casters is slower.

You're safe here if you're on the Dark Path (in which case these things are your allies and won't attack you unless you do something stupid) but if you're on the Light Path, this city is a deathtrap, and the quests that take you here are best done by turning yourself invisible.</li><li> Same game's Celeste as well.

(Of course, the three varieties of a monster tend to be found together.) Boss Monsters are sometimes exceptions, but many of <em>them</em> are just Palette Swaps of common monsters.</li><li> In <em>VII</em>, Boss monsters are exactly the same as their strongest variety, for example Xenofex is just the Devil Captain named Xenofex.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">Permanently Missable Content</a>:<ul><li> Played straight with anything on Emerald Isle in <em>VII</em>, seeing as once you leave, you can't go back (of course, there's really nothing useful there that you can't get anywhere else).</li><li> Also the case with the lower floor of Red Dwarf Mines of the same game, once you sabotage the elevator.

The first time you speak to Roland's son, Nicolai, in Castle Ironfist, he joins your party (you do not get a say in this) and the first time you rest, he runs off (again, there's nothing you can do to stop him). Unfortunately, this means you cannot enter Castle Ironfist until you find him, because it is put on emergency shutdown, because they think he's been kidnapped (and it's probably for the best that you don't enter, because technically, <em>you</em> kidnapped him). Because this means you <em>can't</em> complete any important quests, you really have to find him. The worst part is, it's kind of hard. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His constant begging to go to the circus should tell you where he is, but the circus only appears on certain months and in only three locations, and one of those locations is a place you really shouldn't go, given your likely current level. So this could take a while.</span> Frustratingly, Nicolai doesn't give you any tangible reward for this, <em>except</em> that he owes you a favor, which comes in <em>very</em> useful much later.<ul><li> You get an XP reward for it in the 2.0 version.</li><li> If you never talk to him about "Boredom", the problem doesn't arise, and he still helps later.</li><li> Happens in both <em>VII</em> and <em>VIII</em> at the start. In <em>VII</em> you are stranded on Emerald Isle until you complete the tournament - you can explore the Isle at your leisure, but it is quite small and there is nothing interesting not related to the main quest. The single sidequest is still related to the tournament and will be possibly completed with the main quest as the items required to both are literally laying on the ground next to each other. In <em>VIII</em> your main quest is in fact to leave Dagger Wound island, and most of the sidequests are related to the objective.</li><li> This happens a lot in <em>X</em>, where the plot is very linear. For example, after foiling the attack on the governor's castle, he asks you to go to the Elemental Forge to investigate an elf raid, and until you do that, you can't progress to Seahaven.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonIsCorrosive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonIsCorrosive">Poison Is Corrosive</a>: Several games have the weapon modifiers "Of Poison," "Of Venom," and "Of Acid." They add varying amounts of the same type of damage (Poison in <em>VI</em>, Body in <em>VII</em> and <em>VIII</em>) to the weapon.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice">Power at a Price</a>:<ul><li> In <em>VI</em>, Artifacts were safe; Relics, however, had drawbacks. They usually raised one or more stats tremendously, at the cost of greatly reducing one or more others.</li><li> In <em>VII</em>, the distinction becomes even more pronounced. There are unsellable rare items often obtained as parts of quests, Artifacts and Relics. Artifacts again do not have drawbacks, while rare items and Relics do. From the first category: The Cloak of the Sheep that you find in the Temple of Baa <em>might</em> be useful, but not to everyone (it renders the user immune to status conditions, at the cost of reducing his Intellect and Personality by 20). There's also Mash, a Relic mace that has drawbacks that might not even be worth the benefit. (It increases your Might by 150, but decreases your Intellect, Personality, <em>and</em> Speed by 40 apiece.)</li><li> In <em>VIII</em>, the game no longer displays "Artifact" or "Relic" when you find a rare item, instead a regular class of the item is displayed, like "Longsword" or "Leather Armor", for example. There is still a distinction like in the previous games, though, with some items being priced at 15-20k and having no drawbacks and ones being priced at 30k and having drawbacks. There are also a few unsellable rares, but much less than in the previous games.</li><li> In <em>X</em>, Relics have no drawbacks, but in order for them to reach their fullest potential, they have to gain levels, just like your characters do. This is done by your characters using them in battles.</li><li> Also in <em>X</em> is a non-artifact example: Most of the Skill instructors who teach the Grandmaster rank require something else other than money. Some costs are very easy, like the Water Grandmaster teacher, who only requires you to walk a hundred steps on water. (If you have the Blessing of the Water Deity, you can do it in five minutes without leaving that town.) Others are a little debilitating; the Dark Grandmaster teacher is a vampire and will only teach you if you let her drink your blood (if you're brave enough to agree, each of your characters lose one point of Vitality, but she keeps her end) and the Dagger Grandmaster teacher is similar, demanding one point of each character's Spirit. (She's a dark elf who claims to collect such things.) Some are <em>very</em> difficult, like the Warfare Grandmaster teacher. (Once you agree to his terms, you have to fight three waves of monsters, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">goblins and plunderers</a> first, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook">dreamwalkers and jaguar warriors</a> second, and finally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook">two cyclopes.</a> Fortunately, you also get some XP for some of these tasks.</li><li> The Arcane Discipline Grandmaster teacher is tricky, because she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> gives you a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">Secret Test of Character</a>. If you ask for training, she tells you to come back the next day. If you do, she tells you she isn't ready, and tells you to come back in a week. If you do that, she says she still isn't ready, and tells you to come back in a month. (The narrative on the screen tells suggests she might be putting one over on you, but mentions that her mask and stoic voice make it impossible to tell.) If you do come back in a month, she agrees to train you, saying that the waiting was actually the first test: patience.</span></li><li> Some spells are like this, most notably Divine Intervention (induces magical aging by 10 years, and here age <em>does</em> have effect on your stats) and Armageddon (hurts your party as well).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecursorHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecursorHeroes">Precursor Heroes</a>: In <em>M&amp;M7</em> you learn the mysterious Visitors from the Stars that most of the plot centers around are in fact <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the heroes from the first three games, who never managed to catch up with Sheltem and ended up crash landing on Enroth instead. The party ended up splitting up between the Good and Evil members, with the Good members wanting to build a Stargate to find the Ancients, and the Evil members wanting to use Ancient weapons tech to carve out a galactic empire</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RainbowPimpGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RainbowPimpGear">Rainbow Pimp Gear</a>: Somewhat lampshaded in-game, as the item descriptions for a lot of the uglier equipment often tends to describe how awful it looks.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil">Religion of Evil</a>: The Cult of Baa is the biggest example, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseCult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseCult">Apocalypse Cult</a> apparently founded by the Kreegan to use as front, which plays a big role in <em>VI</em>, but become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant">The Remnant</a> <em>VII</em>.<ul><li> In <em>X</em> there's the Cult of the Wrecker; according to one NPC, this cult worships a dark and twisted aspect of one of the Dragons (most worshippers of that Dragon are benign). We can only assume that much for now, as only one faction of the cult has been seen in the open beta.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestingRecovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestingRecovery">Resting Recovery</a>: Played with from <em>VI</em> onward. Resting in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaInn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaInn">Trauma Inn</a> costed you a bit of gold and the rest always lasted to 5:00 AM, healing some of lesser statuses such as Asleep (obviously) or Fear and restoring HP and MP to full unless struck with some of more serious afflictions, such as Poison or Disease. Rather realistic. You could also pitch a tent in open, which always lasted 8 hours and consumed your supplies instead. The cost of supplies depended on type of terrain you slept on, consuming more for inhospitable landscapes such sa swamp or desert. This allowed for some really weird optimisation, since the road always counted for barren terrain, meaning you could move few feet from desert to road and consume 3 less points of supplies for resting. The resting was rather logically impossible in middle of battle or with enemies nearby and even if safe you could be ambushed by monsters. This gets simplified in <em>X</em>, where resting outside always consumes 1 supply charge and you cannot get ambushed ever even if the monsters know about your presence, and resting in inn temporarily raises stats.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RespawningEnemies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RespawningEnemies">Respawning Enemies</a>:<ul><li> <em>VI-VIII</em> have enemies respawning on maps and in dungeons after certain in-game time has passed with few exceptions:<ul><li> <em>VI</em> has the Lair of the Wolves, where the enemies will spawn in <em>huge</em> numbers if you pass through certain corridors. This is indicated by wolves howling. Rather annoying if you didn't plan for it, which you likely didn't on your first time here.</li><li> In <em>VII</em> two dungeons: The Walls of Mist and The Pit, the enemies will respawn instantly when you quit the dungeon. Not too problematic if you're on Path of Light, as you can't kill anything in Walls of Mist anyway on your mainline quest there, but the Pit practically requires you to kill monsters to advance. Also, once you clean Castle Harmondale of monsters they never respawn.</li></ul></li><li> In <em>X</em> nothing ever respawns, meaning the number of XP you can get is capped.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightOnTheTick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightOnTheTick">Right on the Tick</a>: These games use a clock and a calendar, and quite a few important tasks you have to do depend on certain dates and times. One of the worst is the Druid promotion quests in <em>VI</em> (which, fortunately, are really only necessary if one of your characters is a Druid). The quest for promotion to Great Druid requires you to go and pray at a holy site. Simple enough, right? The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestGiver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestGiver">Quest Giver</a> requires you to do it on an equinox or a solstice, which means there are four days in a year where you can complete this. At least the place isn't hard to get to.<ul><li> The Great Druid to Grand Druid quest is even worse. You have to pray at another holy site on midnight on the night of a full moon. (Twelve days in a year you can complete that one.) The &#147;catch&#148; is, this holy site is in a dungeon full of monsters, and you must do it <em>exactly at midnight</em>. (You should probably make sure to clear out the monsters first.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething">Royals Who Actually Do Something</a>: Notably played straight in <em>VII</em>, where your party inherits the kingdom of Harmondale after the first quest (somewhat enforced by the fact that you inherited it by winning a tournament, and as it turns out the only reason it was put up as the prize was that the place is politically volatile (several wars have been fought over the place, and the only reason why Erathian rulership is not contested by Tularea at the moment is the toll the wars have taken on Harmondale) and Castle Harmondale itself is a goblin-infested ruin).<ul><li> In addition to the campaign of Heroes II, where you take control of either Archibald or Roland in the final scenario.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGsEqualCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGsEqualCombat">RPGs Equal Combat</a>: All <em>Might and Magic</em> games are very combat-heavy, with the vast majority of the game world populated by nothing but monsters, and friendly NPCs only appearing as text or non-interactive animated pictures until <em>VI</em>. That said, <em>Might and Magic</em> games also have a strong puzzle-solving element, and a heavy emphasis on exploration in earlier games (especially the first two).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>: In most of the games, there's a hidden <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a> where your party earns the title of "Super Goober". Typically, it involves fighting very difficult enemies to reach an optional location.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a>: The games make it very easy, for the most part. Land a good hit, save, opponent misses, save, something bad happens reload, and with patience you can beat things you have no business trying to fight. There are a few exceptions, though - for example, saving in the Arena in M&amp;M7 actually saves you to outside the Harmondale stables on Monday, so you have to win on one try.<ul><li> This was particularly abuseable when it came to looting, as there is a bug in VI through VIII that will occasionally cause a just-looted corpse to remain in the game where you can loot it again with exactly the same loot tables. By repeatedly saving and loading every time the bug causes the corpse to remain, you can outfit your party several times over (with Artifacts and Relics, too, if you're looting a strong enough enemy) and get a ton of gold as a bonus (especially if combined with periodic trips to town and back to the corpse when your inventory fills). Of course, this is really only worth doing on enemies that drop good loot in the first place, like the dragon on the starting island in VII that you can beat by running around it in circles so that its fire breath never hits you...</li><li> This is also very useful when you have to deal with monsters like Ghosts that cause magical aging. Simply put, this is something that's hard to reverse, and you're going to have to deal with things like this sooner or later. For example, in <em>VI</em>, you have to go to Corlagan's Estate to do the Wizard to Archmage promotion quest (not required, but highly recommended if you have a wizard) and it has lots of Ghosts. The only ways to reverse magical aging in that game is a black potion (which permanently reduces <em>all</em> of your stats in the process) and a magical fountain on Hermit's Isle which you won't be able to access until much later.

This is particularly jarring, as it is entirely possible to walk on water without the aforementioned spell - your only penalty is listening to your characters yell "ow! that hurts!" repeatedly while the water slowly eats away at their health.<ul><li> IX was the first (and only, unless you count that one stage from VII) in the series to give characters the ability to actually swim (i.e., to go down beneath the surface of the water instead of treating it like solid ground). Due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">other issues</a>, however, this ability was completely worthless for a lack of any reason whatsoever to go swimming.</li><li> There's also the 'plane of water' from VIII, where you can swim freely without losing health.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeYourTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeYourTime">Take Your Time</a>: The game warns you that the world will end in the year 1000 (you start in the year 900), and your characters can age, but rejuvenating your characters at least is trivial. Oh, and if you play through 100 years... nothing happens.<ul><li> Similarly, in <em>World of Xeen,</em> one of the options in the starting town (at least on Darkside) is to spend a week as a laborer for a bit of cash. Combine this with the compound interest the banks provide, and you can spend a century or two before you do anything just accumulating cash. Not to worry, though... apparently XEEN steers and/or accelerates like a tub, because there hasn't been any noticeable climate change yet.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TempleOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TempleOfDoom">Temple of Doom</a>: Pretty much in every game. <em>VI-VIII</em> each have one as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoobCave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoobCave">Noob Cave</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming">Theme Naming</a>: Every game starting with III has a temple with some animal-related name: Temple of Moo (III), Temple of Yak (IV), Temple of Bark (V), Temple of Snakes (VI), Temple of Baa (VI and VII), Temple of Honk (IX), Temple of Meow (X)<ul><li> Archbishop Anthony Stone in <em>Might and Magic VI</em> even makes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag">Mythology Gag</a> on the first three names.</li><li> <em>VIII</em> had the Grand Temple of Eep, the Chapel of Eep and the Church of Eep, all part of a quest to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> find rare cheese - the followers of Eep are wererats.</span></li><li> Every trainer in <em>Might and Magic VII</em> is named after a Roman emperor.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTents">There Are No Tents</a>: You can rest outside of an inn, but if a place is too dangerous to do so, you can't (a message onscreen will tell you so, and you won't be able to.) And even if a place is considered safe, you might be attacked in your sleep. (The inns, however, are always 100% secure, and it also doesn't deplete your rations, which camping in the wilderness does.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThreeCertaintiesInLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThreeCertaintiesInLife">The Three Certainties in Life</a>: Some NPCs state that there are only three certainties in life: Death, Taxes, and that you'll hear the comment about death and taxes sooner or later.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse">Too Awesome to Use</a>:<ul><li> Various scrolls. Few exceptions aside (such as Fly scroll in New Sorpigal in <em>IV</em> or Bracada in <em>VII</em>), there is no shop, monster drop or chest that guarantees the access to certain scrolls. Consequently, you will save the best scrolls with the spells you can't get other way until you <em>really</em> need them, and weaker scrolls will be relegated to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash">Vendor Trash</a>.</li><li> Better magic wands with stronger spells. While <em>VII</em> and <em>VIII</em> have spell that allows you to recharge them, it has the drawback of reducing the number of charges everytime it is used, and to fully negate that, you must have Grandmastery of Water Magic at level at least 20. Therefore better wands will end collecting dust like the better scrolls.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfought" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfought">The Unfought</a>:<ul><li> You never fight Archibald at all in the series (although you do in <em>Heroes</em>, where he appears originally) even if you're on the side of Light in <em>VII</em> where he's technically your enemy.</li><li> Two examples of this in <em>X</em>, both of them in <em>The Falcon and the Unicorn</em> DLC. You never actually fight Duke Owen, the antagonist in the plot who set you and Rosalie up who is planning to take over the kingdom by wooing Empress Falcon. (He gets his, however; once you win the game, the Empress has him and the other conspirators hauled off to jail.) You do <em>confront</em> him, however, the final true enemy of the game, Owen's partner the Justicar Angel Adira leaps to defend him, and while you <em>do</em> fight her as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle">Boss Battle</a> (and a rather difficult one) it isn't finished; when you reduce her to about half her health, Falcon orders her to stop so that she can hear what you and Rosalie have to say. (So while the fight occurs, it is left unfinished.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessItem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessItem">Useless Item</a>: Quite a few through series:<ul><li> <em>VI</em> has The Flute, which was related to the quest that was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> afterwards. In Control Center you can get a bunch of Control Cubes and Memory Crystals, but they are of no use at this point of the game.</li><li> Depending on your path in <em>VII</em>, Dragon Eggs can be this, since they serve no purpose if you're on Path of Light.</li><li> In <em>VIII</em> you can find the quest item Druid Circlet of Power, but the related quest was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> as well.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell">Useless Useful Spell</a>: Varies from the game to game. Usually the utility and buffing spells are incredibly useful (Fly, Town Portal, Feather Fall), as well as spells that hit single target or do splash damage (Incinerate, Dragon Breath, Starburst). Status effects are as useless as ever (Charm, Berserk), and spells that hit everything on sight have usually so low damage it is not worth it (Inferno, Prismatic Light).<ul><li> In <em>VI</em>, various magic arrows and the like that hit for single digit of damage will fall wayside very quickly, since their damage does not scale up with the skill at all or only very slowly. Sparks avert this because of their damage scaling <em>plus</em> their total number raising for higher mastery and remain good spell from the start until the very end of the game that can be cast cheaply and with low recovery time. This is also true for the sequels.</li><li> Self-Magic schools are <em>extremely</em> important when it comes to patching your team with Power Cure or Ressurection, but trying to attack with them is asking to fail. The strongest monsters seem almost always be immune against Mind Magic, so trying to Charm a Behemoth is a waste of time and MP.</li><li> Dark Containment from <em>VI</em> costs <strong>200 MP</strong> to cast random status ailments on the target, which may not even work. To top it off, it cannot be even bought and only single guaranteed copy can be found once you solve the obelisk puzzle. For that price you may just shot Dragon Breath twice to disintegrate an entire group of enemies that are not outright immune to Poison damage. Maybe for this reason the spell was dropped afterwards.</li><li> Golden Touch of <em>VI</em> is usually treated like this, especially since anyone can become master Merchant in this game and the spell gives you 80% of value of item at most (and that's only at Master Light Magic, which is way harder to get than to master Merchant). However, if you can't be bothered to abandon the dungeon in the middle because your inventory is full, you can get some mileage of it.</li><li> Armageddon deals average damage to <em>everything</em> on map, but if you don't want to kill every pedestrian there you're restrictred to use it in zones such as Eofol, Paradise Valley or The Plane Between the Planes, and against monsters in there the damage is but a drop in a bucket.</li><li> On the other hand, Paralyze seems to be working even against Behemots, since the immunity against Light Magic is rare. The problem is it might take few tries - and Behemoths are rarely alone.</li><li> Aversion with Mass Distortion, which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PercentDamageAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PercentDamageAttack">Percent Damage Attack</a> (and percentage raises with the skill), and consequently would be heavily resisted by monsters in basically any other game, but not here.</li><li> Things change significantly in <em>X</em>, as it ditches all self-magic schools and adds Primordial Magic instead. This newly added schoold gets important/utility buff spells as Hour of Power, Identify Item and Spirit Beacon (former Lloyd's Beacon), making it essential if you don't want to blow a fortune for services. Fire Magic is best on offense due to low overall resistance of enemies to it, with Air Magic close behind because while enemies are quite resistent to it, lot of its spells have gimmicks to offset it (for example <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainLightning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainLightning">Chain Lightning</a> multiplies damage by number of enemies on tile, very useful when you get swarmed). Light magic gets healings and ressurection as well as this game's equivalent of Souldrinker, making it probably most important of the lot. Dark magic as a whole gets nerfed to the point it clumps mostly useless status effects and only Purge and Whispering Shadows may get some use, and the latter becomes obsolete if you get Spike as a companion or the Blessing of Malassa.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash">Vendor Trash</a>:<ul><li> Gems. They cost a fortune, take very little space in your inventory (usually only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GridInventory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GridInventory">1x1 square</a>) and they cannot be enchanted, so the sole reason for their existence is to be sold for a quick buck.</li><li> Some Rings and Amulets don't have any enchantment and don't provide any bonuses. Unlike gems however, you can opt for enchanting them yourself instead of selling them. In <em>X</em> you cannot enchant items anymore, so rings without any enchantment won't find any other use but this.</li><li> Spell books will be also relegated to this if you don't have anyone who can learn the spell during the game or towards the end of the game when your party knows most of the available spells. They give you even more money than gems, albeit they are slightly bigger.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">Video Game Cruelty Potential</a>: Thanks to the 3D engine, you can mow down entire villages full of helpless villagers in games <em>VI</em> onward.<ul><li> If you want to master Dark Magic (and you want, seeing as it has strongest spells in the game and best defensive buff), you need to have worst reputation possible, which requires you to do some nasty things.</li><li> Within five minutes of starting a new game in <em>VII</em>, you can "encourage" a swarm of vicious dragonflies to slaughter an entire town... and get away with it totally blameless. <em>And</em> get an awesome item <em>AND</em> save quite a bit of money by taking stuff you'd ordinarily have to buy from the peasant's corpses.</li><li> The Dark Path choice in <em>VII</em> requires you to do this quite a bit in your objective to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a>. Also, while some promotion quests are the same or very similar for both paths (Archer, Cleric), some require you to do some horrible things, like kidnap a woman, kill a traitor or rob a castle's vault blind.</li><li> The Armageddon spell in games VI-VIII would cause massive damage to anything in the current outdoor map, if it was not immune to magic or darkness damage. This meant that, while weak enemies and civilians would be instantly killed by one casting of the spell, stronger enemies and the party would generally take multiple castings. And yes, the party *was* vulnerable to the spell it would cast. The cruelty potential comes from the fact that the spell was the quickest way to get the worst reputation, if used on the innocent. The reputation was needed for ranking up in Dark Magic and being able to cast Armageddon more times each day.<ul><li> Fortunately, you could undo all your butchery just by using the Dark spell "Reanimate" on the slain peasants, as long as you hadn't looted their dead bodies. This should have turned them into zombies, I suppose, but they showed no obvious sign of it and didn't seem to mind. Bringing the dead back to life didn't fix your reputation, though... putting a few shillings in the church poorbox was the quick fix for that.</li></ul></li><li> Even as early as the second iteration you could commit genocide, though it was limited to enemy races. Specifically, it was possible to find peaceful goblin villages and wipe them out.</li><li> One quest in the second game requires you to go look for a couple of lost artifacts for Lord Haart. One, the +7 Loincloth, is worn by a peaceful barbarian shaman and can only be acquired off his dead body.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualPaperDoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualPaperDoll">Virtual Paper Doll</a>: The 3D games all had a graphical interface for equipment, although the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RainbowPimpGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RainbowPimpGear">best of it tended to look awful</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox">Wide Open Sandbox</a>: The first three games don't really tell you where to go.

If you talk to Nicolai, he says that his uncle - as in, Archibald - knows that spell, but releasing him from the curse that turned him to stone requires something called the Third Eye, and he doesn't know where it is. Fortunately, Roland's letter in the preface to the instruction manual mentions it's "in the well".

It wouldn't be until the next game onwards that made non-human races playable again.</li><li> Every skill that character can learn can be also mastered. Related to this, there is no Grandmastery level. This has created some bizarre things like Archer being supposedly master marksman while <em>every</em> class could learn and master bow. The sequels introduced maximum learnable expertise per skill depending on the class.</li><li> All spells from given school can be learned as long as the user knows given magic school. Nothing prevents a Sorcerer to learn Lloyd's Beacon at normal level. Consequently, some spells work differently at low skill expertise: Town Portal for example would teleport you to nearby fountain and only if outside on normal skill level and only when water magic was mastered it would work as in sequels.</li><li> Alchemy as a skill does not even exist, and anyone can create Black potions right off bat. However, the potions have in general smaller effect; notably stat-increasing Black Potions only increase one stat by 15 while decreasing another by 5 instead of raising one by flat 50 points.</li><li> Instead of basic elemental resistances, they are divided into Fire/Cold/Electricity/Magic/Poison and spells deal one type of this magic (or physical); for example Toxic Cloud deals Poison damage, instead of Dark like in sequels.</li><li> Enemy NPCs would ignore townspeople and other neutral or friendly NPCs and go directly for the player characters. From the next game onwards, this is averted.</li><li> In order to learn weapon, armor and miscelaneous skills you needed to become a member of certain specialized guilds. These guilds would be removed in the next games, where you'd learn such skills in the weaposmith, armorsmith, temple and tavern.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusOblivion">Evil Versus Oblivion</a>: You will need Archibald's help to save the world from the Kreegans, since only he has a spell capable of containing the explosion caused by the destruction of the Hive.

When you enter their only temple in Erathia, the descrption mentions that it's in a decayed state as if to mirror what happened with the cult, and you can read a letter from Xenofex telling the remaining cultist to regroup and go into hiding, hoping that maybe in the future they can recover from their loses.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a>: In <em>V</em>, the escape pod carrying the heroes from the third game is said to have burned up in XEEN's atmosphere, with its passengers having safely beamed down per Corak's instructions.

Unfortunately, they <em>will</em> attack you, they are <em>very</em> powerful, and the Walls of Mist is a complex maze that requires finding three keys to complete.

Turning yourself invisible is probably the best idea.</li><li> This strategy is not mandatory but <em>highly recommended</em> for a few other situations in the same game. For example, any time you got to the Pit (if you're on the Path of Light) or Celeste (if you're on the Path of Dark) it's best to turn yourself invisible and sneak your way through, seeing as the monsters in the city will be hostile and some of them can summon other monsters, meaning you'd be facing a <em>huge</em> army in a matter of seconds if you try. Also, when you approach Colony Zod late in the game (which you have to do regardless of the Path you're on) it's best to both turn invisible <em>and</em> fly to get there, unless you can fight your way past the army of over a hundred Kreegan surrounding it.

Failing to do so won't get you attacked, but even trying (whether you are successful or not) will lower your reputation, and require you to pay a fine in the town where you shoplifted. (A successful act of theft incurs a bigger fine than one where you fail and get caught. Possibly justified because you don't have to give the item back.)

Zog kicked him out and nearly killed him, but still ended up giving the troll a clue by complete accident - namely, he mentioned that he's going to feed the troll to his basilisk. Since basilisks live in Murmurwoods, the troll concludes that the home must be in Murmurwoods.

Instead, spells of all four schools of Elemental Magic and all three schools of Self Magic are sold together on a single magic shop each. Light and Dark Magic spells still have their own specialized shops.</li><li> There's only one promotion quest as opposed to two.</li><li> Aside from Elemental, Self, Light and Dark, this game introduces new schools of magic that are exclusive to a certain class (Dark Elf, Vampire and Dragon).

While the minimap is available as usual, the dungeon exploits the fact the identical rooms on different floors are shown as the same, so while you know <em>where</em> in dungeon you are, you don't know from it at <em>which floor</em>.

It is implied the spell would weaken if he left the Plane between Planes, and since he doesn't have any agents around to send after you there is nothing he <em>can</em> do but sit and wait for either the Elementals to reach the Crystal or adventurers to breach the Plane between Planes (it also doesn't appear as if he has any means to observe the planet in detail).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">Person of Mass Destruction</a>: Just what have we seen of Escaton is enough for him to establish him as this,<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and thankfully the rest of his plan isn't completed</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalNetwork">Portal Network</a>: The starting archipelago has one, which needs a power stone to be operated, but since the bridge network was built quite some time ago the citizens stopped to use them and consequently the stones became rare.

The most notable are Behemoths that got renamed to Plane Protectors and Light Elementals are changed to Dancing Light/Wisp/Will'o'Wisp. The latter might be justified by avoiding confusion why the light elementals don't have any relation to the plot despite being, well, elementals.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperNotDrowningSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperNotDrowningSkills">Super Not-Drowning Skills</a>: The Plane of Water takes place underwater.
