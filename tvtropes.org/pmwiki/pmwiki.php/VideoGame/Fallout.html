Eventually, the two superpowers clashed over the Alaskan oil fields, hoping to secure just a little more of that black gold... then, on October 23, 2077, the world ended. No one knows or cares which side fired the first missiles, but once they were up, everyone else fired too. The resulting "Great War" lasted a mere two hours, but the nuclear fire that burned the world was so incredibly destructive that it not only caused the collapse of global civilization, but irrevocably changed the planet's climate as well.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Across the United States, pockets of humanity survived the bombs on the surface, in personal shelters, or by hiding in the Vaults: massive underground bunkers built by the Vault-Tec Corporation. These shelters were <em>supposedly</em> meant to protect mankind from nuclear fallout &mdash; but in reality, the project doubled as a mysterious, government-sponsored social experiment, with most Vaults' inhabitants living in conditions ranging anywhere from "somewhat unusual" to "outright torturous". While some Vaults were nonetheless able to support relatively stable societies, many degenerated into anarchy, or worse.</p><p>The first <em>Fallout</em> begins almost a century later, in 2161. Though humanity has slowly begun to rebuild itself with some established towns, civilization as a whole struggles to survive amidst scarce resources, vicious mutants, and those who have turned to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn">Rape, Pillage, and Burn</a> lifestyle.

The space race unrolls differently (although the first moon landing is off by only a few days.) Federal power snowballs as the military-industrial complex takes over entirely. The states are rebuilt into 13 'commonwealths.' Communism continues to thrive in China (Russia, though still Communist, seems to play a minor role.) A-bombs are joined by practical laser, gauss, and plasma-projection technology.

The government, and Vault-Tec, never really believed an atomic war would occur; the <em>real</em> reason for the existence of these vaults was to run social experiments on pre-selected segments of the population to see how they react to the stresses of isolation and how successfully they recolonize Earth (or another planet) after the vault opens.

Don't expect realistic science in this series. It's inspired by pulp sci-fi after all, so this trope is deliberately Invoked:<ul><li> Radiation in particular works considerably differently in the <em>Fallout</em> universe than in reality. For starters, while Fallout has radiation sickness, it's also capable of causing genetic mutations that are directly integrated into a creature's biology, leading to creatures like radscorpions, stingwings, and bloatflies. In reality, radiation simply damages DNA, causing it to replicate improperly and causing the body to function incorrectly. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Although, there are theories in-universe that the mutations are not caused by radiation alone, but none of them are confirmed or denied.</a>) Also, in Fallout, simple hazard suits are shown to significantly or completely block radiation when worn, while in real life, the only way to block radiation is to place enough matter between you and the source to physically block the rays. A suit that truly protects you from gamma radiation would be too heavy to move in (although, in <em>3</em> and <em>New Vegas</em>, you can only have so much radiation resistance, about 85%, and in <em>4</em> 1000%+ RR stil lets in 0.5 Rads.

Aside from being Invoked because of the ubiquity of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearNasty">Nuclear Nasty</a>, there was also a struggle between the original designers; one designer exclusively attributed the mutation not to the radiation, but to the Forced Evolutionary Virus, a mutagenic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SyntheticPlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SyntheticPlague">Synthetic Plague</a> that the US government was cooking up to facilitate bio-engineering projects before the war; when the bunkers containing F.E.V got blown up, the virus was scattered across the world and caused the mutations. The other designer hated this idea, because they felt this undermined the setting's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zeerust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zeerust">Zeerust</a> aesthetic.

They had a secondary purpose of creating an intermediate body between the state and federal governments, creating legislation that would positively affect individual blocs without interfering with others, but it ultimately ended up causing more infighting as the commonwealths fought to gain national primacy at the expense of all the others.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDemocracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDemocracy">Disaster Democracy</a>: The Enclave, a descendant from the pre-war American government claims to be this, but they're really not much better than a tyrannical dictatorship trying to enforce their rule over the wasteland.

They quietly acknowledge however that their xenophobic policies will get their faction exterminated since their numbers are dwindling and their technology is becoming outdated, but they keep to the codex anyway, and as a result have divided even further into isolated chapters with differing ideals and little unity.</li><li> The East Coast Brotherhood led by Elder Lyons decided that their advanced technology would be put to better use helping people rather than just being hoarded, so they turned their attention to patrolling the wasteland trying to protect people from mutants and raiders, their ranks are open to outside recruits, and they offer aid to outsider projects they deem worth the manpower. While this has arguably made them the most successful branch of the Brotherhood, it also violates much of the Codex, and pressure is mounting within the chapter as the few original members who haven't deserted continue to question where their loyalties lie.<ul><li> <em>Fallout 4</em> takes place 10 years after <em>3</em>, and Elder Lyons has passed away in that time. The Brotherhood decided to revert closer to the original West coast counterparts (or East coast Outcasts) in terms of philosophy, but are still open to outside recruitment to get around the West Coast "dwindling population" problem. They keep some of their old beliefs from the Lyons era as they also ostensibly aim to protect the commonwealth (at least its unaltered human population) from the Institute, super mutants, raiders and other perceived threats. These good intentions however are counterbalanced by the Brotherhood being violently xenophobic and tyrannical, having no issues with using force to get "cooperation" from less powerful groups or exterminating non-humans who pose no actual threat to the Commonwealth.</li></ul></li><li> The Brotherhood Outcasts left the East Coast chapter because they felt Lyons betrayed the Codex, and while they take the name "Outcasts" as a jab at him, they consider themselves the <em>real</em> Brotherhood of the East Coast and see Lyons as a traitor who will be brought to justice. They are willing, though reluctant, to accept aid from outsiders and will open their base to one they trust enough, but do not offer membership, bolstering their ranks with robots instead. They patrol the wastelands salvaging old technology, and their patrols deal with hostiles like mutants and raiders. Interestingly, the "outcasts" are closer to the Brotherhood's behavior in the original <em>Fallout</em> than either the East or West Coast sides.<ul><li> As of <em>Fallout 4</em>, the Outcasts have since rejoined the main East Coast Brotherhood after Arthur Maxson became Elder.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown">Doomed Hometown</a>: The first two games start out with the player having to stop their hometown's impending destruction.

It only affects the Barter and Speech skills (a few extra skill points make up for low starting Speech), the Perks that use it are either poor or glitched and don't work, and it isn't needed for any critical skill checks. <em>Fallout 2</em> ties Charisma to how many companions you can have, one for every two points of Charisma, but also added two ways to permanently boost Charisma and an item that also boosts it, so a starting Charisma of 3 is still enough to get a fair-sized party. In the Bethesda-era games, chugging alcohol will temporarily boost Charisma and there's the Bobblehead/Implant to boost it again, and you can get Grape Mentats (<em>3</em>) or craft Party Time Mentats (<em>New Vegas</em>), which temporarily boost Charisma by 5.</li><li> Outside <em>New Vegas</em>, Luck was only useful for builds centering on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass">Sniper</a>. Otherwise all it gives are minor boosts to critical hit chance and an extra couple of points to all skills. A Luck of 6 is enough to take most Perks that need a Luck requirement, and <em>Fallout 1</em> and <em>2</em> both have ways to permanently boost Luck by at least 1 point, so the starting 5 is fine.</li><li> In terms of Skills, Throwing in the first two games. Grenades are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> in the Black Isle games, and aside from grenades there aren't many throwing weapons at all, and they usually suck anyway.</li><li> Zigzagged with Unarmed in <em>Fallout 2</em>. While unarmed combat is a viable, if inefficient option, the player never needs to spend skill points on it &mdash; the game offers numerous ways to increase Unarmed by several points, and it's possible to get 100 points in it with no skill points. Played straight with Unarmed in the first <em>Fallout</em>, where there is no variety to unarmed attacks and only three weapons that use the skill.</li><li> Barter. It only affects the price of objects you <em>buy</em>. You always sell your stuff at the same price. Money isn't really a problem in either game, making the usefulness of this skill debatable.</li><li> First Aid. It just restores a couple of hit points in games where Stimpaks are not very rare. Furthermore the Doctor skill heals more, can heal crippled limbs, <em>and</em> is needed for quests and Perks; the only Perk needing skill in First Aid is Medic, which just boosts the stat further. Worse is that First Aid can be increased by skill books, which can be bought an unlimited time, meaning every stat point put in First Aid is effectively a waste.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EagleLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EagleLand">Eagle Land</a>: The Pre-War United States depicted itself as beautiful but in fact was heavily boorish. <em>Fallout</em> is one of the very few cases in Western media in which the USA is actually depicted as being outright villainous; the Pre-War government was an Orwellian nightmare that makes the real-world Soviet Union look positively warm and fuzzy in comparison, and their successors, the Enclave, are <em>even worse</em>. Most frightening of all; given the nightmare the world was becoming on the eve of the Great War, it's not much of a stretch to think the United States became the way it was out of the need to survive the Resource Wars. When nations are annihilating each other over what few resources still exist on a global scale, looking out for your own country and people at the expense of all others becomes a grim necessity.<ul><li> However, it's implied in some of the historical documents that the U.S was rotting from the inside long before the Resource Wars, possibly as early as the Space Race.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">Earn Your Happy Ending</a>: <em>Fallout 2</em>, <em>New Vegas</em>, and <em>4</em> all count for this several times over.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a>: Most of the 'special encounters' in <em>1</em>, <em>2</em>, and <em>Tactics</em>.

Eyeballs are part of the burst of gore that follows a head-shot in <em>Fallout 3</em>, and if a critical hit to the head is scored they will fly out at high speed, sometimes hilariously towards the camera in VATS mode. Lampshaded by one character's combat taunts: "There's nothing wrong with you that a critical to the eyes won't cure."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalloutShelterFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalloutShelterFail">Fallout Shelter Fail</a>:<ul><li> With a nuclear war with China inevitable, the U.S. government contracted the Vault-Tec Corporation to build a series of underground shelters to protect chosen members of the population until it was safe to begin repopulating the planet... or at least, that was the cover story. The unfortunate reality was that the overwhelming majority of the vaults weren't meant to save anyone: most of them were actually research facilities where the population were used as guinea pigs for whatever Vault-Tec and the Enclave wanted to study. Hallucinogenic gasses were pumped into the ventilation, psychological experiments turned neighbour against neighbour, sonic weaponry was tested on musicians, recovering drug addicts were forced back into their old habits, residents were dosed with the Forced Evolutionary Virus, and a single inhabitant was locked in a vault with no company except for a box of puppets. Consequently, of the two hundred plus vaults constructed by the company, the ones that were successfully opened and emptied without nightmarish results can be counted on one hand. Plus, a even if the inhabitants didn't end up suffering terribly, a few vaults ended up failing anyway due to hardware failure, supply shortages or sheer bad luck.</li><li> The series also features Pulowski Preservation Shelters, tube-shaped coin-operated shelters advertised as affordable alternatives to the underground facilities of the competing Vault-Tec.

The Shi Empire is pretty much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialChina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialChina">Imperial China</a> reborn. The Great Khans intentionally base themselves after the Mongolian Empire (which gets downplayed by the fact that horses have yet to be seen in this series), and can even be encouraged in <em>New Vegas</em> to take this more to heart in one of their endings. While probably not deliberate, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOrder">Lyons' Brotherhood of Steel</a> has a lot in common with early <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Prussia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Prussia">Prussia</a>.

Also, the Commonwealth Minutemen are based on both Revolutionary America and the Iroquois Confederacy, and the Church of the Children of Atom are now essentially the Crusader States.<ul><li> Most can be justified at least marginally considering that the universe of <em>Fallout</em> is not based on some other world, but a divergence of our own world, so cultures would have tried to base themselves off of some kind of history in many cases. An inversion of sorts in some of the cultural inclusions as they end up based not on real world historical cultures, but fantasy sources, such as books or movies that were popular in or around the 1950's.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a>: This has been the case since the first game and was used for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingTheMonsterToDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingTheMonsterToDeath">Talking the Monster to Death</a> option.

Male and female player characters can hire Nova, the town prostitute in Megaton, and Bittercup, the town goth in Big Town, develops a crush on the player regardless of gender (though her crushes are mostly her turned into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerkyGoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerkyGoth">Perky Goth</a> and giving you whatever crap she found in the patrols). <em>New Vegas</em> adds 2 new perks, Confirmed Bachelor for men, and Cherchez La Femme for women, which will give special dialogue options when dealing with an NPC of the same sex, (and a 10% damage bonus against the same sex) much how the Black Widow and Lady Killer perks function when dealing with the opposite sex. If you have this perk, you can recruit one follower (which one depends on your gender, there's one for each) bypassing the usual skill check needed by flirting with them, essentially giving you a same sex romantic option. If you are a man with the perk, you can also get all your stuff repaired for free any time you want by flirting with an NPC and asking him to be "friends." Unrelated to the perk, but you can also hire same-sex prostitutes, male or female, in New Vegas if you should so choose.<ul><li> In <em>Fallout 1</em>, rescuing Sinthia at the hotel in Junktown will get the player a 'reward'&#133; whichever the main character's gender may be.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">Generation Xerox</a>: Everyone from the original Vault 13 Dweller's bloodline seems to have pure badass embedding in their genes. First there is the Vault Dweller, who stops a plot to turn the population of the Wasteland into super mutants by destroying two underground lairs, saves quite a few communities along the way, and ends up as the chief of a newly formed tribe, before going adventuring again in old age, presumably dying somewhere out in the wastes. Then, 80 years later, his grandchild, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChosenOne">Chosen One</a>, stops a plot to commit a holocaust on the Wasteland by blowing up an oil rig, again saving some developing communities along the way, and ends up becoming head of a new society (New Arroyo). And in one of the endings in <em>Fallout 2</em>, the Chosen One fathers a bastard-child with one of the Bishop women from the Bishop crime family, who, already at age 13, takes control over the family, and leads it to victory over New Reno's other crime families and, despite being a powerful Mafia boss in a crime ridden city at a time where the average lifespan is low, manages to live to the age of 73, where he dies peacefully in his sleep. This ending was confirmed as canon in <em>New Vegas</em>, by Bruce Isaac, who fled town after stealing from the casino and sleeping with Mr. Bishop's daughter.<ul><li> Likewise, the Cassidy clan are also hardasses with a tendency to associate with legendarily awesome people.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticEngineeringIsTheNewNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticEngineeringIsTheNewNuke">Genetic Engineering Is the New Nuke</a>: The "forced evolutionary virus," although it doesn't quite work as intended.<ul><li> And of course because this is <em>Fallout</em>, the Pre-War government's love of genetic engineering, though great, doesn't hold a candle to the Pre-War love of nukes.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusDitz">Genius Ditz</a>: In every game you can set your character's Intelligence so low they're incapable of speaking properly and can't understand what others are saying either.

Between 2050 and 2077, conflicts in the mid-to-late 21st century broke out in response to the decline of oil. Major events include the U.S. destabilizing and invading Mexico, the collapse of the United Nations, the European Commonwealth invading the Middle East and waging war for eight years before pulling out when the wells dry up, which was followed up by a civil war; China invading Alaska, and the U.S. annexing Canada before retaking Anchorage and sending troops into mainland China. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified">Justified</a> since this took place over 200 years ago.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeTag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeTag">Grenade Tag</a>: Planting explosives on someone via pick-pocketing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGreyMorality">Grey-and-Grey Morality</a>: Nobody knows (or cares) whether the US or China started the war. All that matters is that the entire world was almost completely destroyed because two superpowers couldn't get along. China tried to annex Alaska, while the US government showed summary executions (with the executioner laughing no less) as pro war propaganda. Nobody is really innocent here.<ul><li> Though given some of the things you read about the Pre-War United States, the conflict probably counts more as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil">Evil vs. Evil</a>.

America was the exact same except with the added caveat that it was run by the Nazi Illuminati behind a puppet government and it also shamelessly poured resources into a number of horrific science projects (the Robobrains, various bioweapons like the FEV and alien-like 'wannamingos', etc.) and often using incarcerated Chinese-American citizens as guinea pigs.</li><li> The series as a whole generally likes this trope, although it typically leans more on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGreyMorality">Black and Grey Morality</a>. <em>New Vegas</em> and <em>4</em> probably play this trope the straightest with their central conflicts.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">Groin Attack</a>: The first two games featured the groin as a legitimate target on any creature.

Kids are a regular part of the civilian population, and you can freely blow them away in a variety of gruesome ways. The game even produces funny * wink* * wink* * nudge* * nudge* combat dialogue if you do so. Further, in one town, you are practically <em>encouraged</em> to do so, as the little bastards hang around in front of quest-critical stores and attempt to pickpocket you (and no matter how high your steal skill, it's nigh-impossible for you to take what they have back; you have to buy them from the merchant they report to). Note, however, that actually killing children will mark you as a "Child Killer," which causes pretty much everyone except the most evil characters to hate you on sight. This was taken literally in the European releases of both games, in which the children were simply made invisible (they're still there - they will steal from you and occasionally say things and can be killed with explosives). <em>Fallout 3</em>, though, used the "children are present but invulnerable" variant (though you can at one point help a slaver kidnap one and <em>sell another into slavery yourself</em>).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHunger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHunger">Horror Hunger</a>: Cannibalism, in addition to being a favored pastime of rabid psychotics, can sometimes stem from a mutation.

Fallout 1 and 2 were in the era of game interfaces where such fences were the norm. Fallout 3 made certain piles of concrete debris 'insurmountable' to force you to detour through tunnel zones, though equally high piles out in the open countryside could readily be scaled. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> has some particularly lazy examples of this; the overworld is cut into cells to ease loading times, and one can only transit between cells at passes. Unfortunately, someone forgot to tell this to the designers who made the visual landscapes, meaning the Courier is often unable to climb two-degree slopes at the edges of cells. In particularly buggy areas such as the area around Nelson, the Courier can end up several dozen feet off the ground by skimming a cell edge.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvulnerableCivilians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvulnerableCivilians">Invulnerable Civilians</a>: In the first two games, all characters were killable by the PC, but were never subject to random deaths by other objects in the gameworld outside of battles that put NPCs in harm's way, such as the large Regulator shootout in the Boneyard in <em>Fallout 1</em>. Also, NPCs accidentally hitting (usually shooting) other NPCs in combat would often cause the injured party's AI to retaliate, along with other NPCs on the injured party's computer-defined "team." In a densely populated area such as the Den with many "teams" a few stray bullets or molotov cocktails can easily result in the townspeople all but wiping each other out with no input from the player.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyJetPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyJetPack">I Want My Jet Pack</a>: Nuclear cars were a big thing in the 50's, and were thought to be replacing gas-powered ones.

This is a major part of the backstory - the Resource Wars that eventually led to the whole nuclear apocalypse were fought over petroleum, and uranium once the world's petroleum was depleted. In the first two <em>Fallout</em> games nuclear-powered vehicles were extremely rare, with most vehicle wrecks you find being of conventional, non-explodey gasoline-powered cars. Nuclear-powered cars were <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

Fallout 2 greatly expands the number of conventional firearms, making most of the guns continuing from FO1 merely the bottom rung of their particular category (for example in Fallout 2, there was the combat shotgun from FO1 but additionally there is now the HK Caws and the Pancor Jackhammer). These newer firearms did damage that rivaled or exceeded that of the laser rifle. Additionally Fallout 2 had most ammunition give a bonus to damage or reducing the damage resistance of targeted armor. For example, since the common FMJ ammo halves the damage resistance of armor, it made the devastating machine gun Bozar the gamebreaker of Fallout 2.</li><li> Hilariously, in <em>2</em> the Salvatore gang are deeply feared for their exclusive use of laser weapons and one NPC relates a single Salvatore goon with a laser pistol once massacred a whole group of people armed with ordinary gunpowder weapons. However if you start a gunfight while wearing metal armour in the Salvatore bar the supposedly unstoppable thugs toting laser pistols do hardly anything to you - the biggest threat in the room is the bartender toting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunsAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunsAreJustBetter">ye olde double-barrelled shotgun</a>.</li><li> In <em>3</em>, guns are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a> compared to energy weapons.

Energy weapons also have an inherent damage threshold reduction effect making them much more effective than guns against heavily armoured enemies like robots, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Brotherhood Knights</a> and <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

In one morbidly amusing case, this led to a man believing that exposure to radiation was transforming him into an immortal ghoul after he found himself losing clumps of hair, when in reality he was just dying of radiation sickness.</li><li> Subverted in <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> with Chris Haversam, a human from Vault 34 who has joined the all-ghoul Bright Brotherhood religious group. Chris believes himself to be a ghoul because, as Vault 34's reactor technician, he was exposed to a large amount of radiation, he speaks with a gravelly voice (a trait many ghouls share), and eventually his hair began to fall out.

Higher Intelligence means more skill points per level, unique dialogue options with characters that unlocks hidden quest paths (usually better ones than what are otherwise available), and it increases the Science and Repair skills, which are very useful skills needed both for general gameplay and for quests. Even with <em>Fallout 4</em> removing Skills, Intelligence is tired to several Perks critical to gameplay, including Gun Nut, Science!, Medic, and Hacker, so you'll want an Intelligence of at least 6 and will be sinking a lot of Perk points into that part of the chart.</li><li> In the first two games, Agility. It increases your three primary combat skills (Small Guns, Big Guns, Energy Weapons), boosts Lockpick, Steal, and Traps (utility skills you'll need, <em>especially</em> Lockpick), and increases Armor Class. Most importantly though, it boosts Action Points, which determines how much you can do each round, so a higher Agility makes combat under any scenario easier to handle. <em>And</em> Agility is tied to several Perks that either give you more Action Points or let you do things for fewer Action Points. In the 3D games, Agility only affects Small Guns and Sneak and VATS is optional for combat, so its importance is lessened.</li><li> Naturally, depending on their weapons of preference, the player is probably going to want to sink as many skill points into their primary combat stat as they can; Small Guns, Big Guns, or Energy Weapons, mostly likely.</li><li> Across the series, you'll always end up sinking lots of skill points into the Science and Lockpick skills. Science lets you hack computer terminals, unlocks hidden quest paths, lets you understand technology better, and generally just opens up a lot of gameplay options you'd otherwise miss out on. The same goes for Lockpick, because the world is full of locked doors and locked containers protecting valuable items and they tend to be good ones, so of course you'll want to get them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyKnownByTheirNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyKnownByTheirNickname">Only Known by Their Nickname</a>: Player characters across the series. Games occasionally include the option for you to mention your name in dialogue, but in the Bethesda-era entries, for obvious reasons (ie, all NPCs are voiced) no one will ever refer to you by name. The first game never gave you a name or nickname, but games since have dubbed the player character of the first game is "The Vault Dweller". The second game, you're "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a>", but no one outside your tribe refers to you this way and will be amused if you say that it's your title.

The infrastructure of America had collapsed due to the resource shortages (food, fuel, and material) while unemployment was skyrocketing. The government responded by becoming a police state and by trying to blame their problems on Communists, then brutally cracking down on anyone who spoke out against their regime. Arrests, "re-education," and in some cases outright murder followed as the government tried to keep the population in line. At the same time, the New Plague (suspected to be a bio-weapon unleashed by one of America's enemies) began to spread, leading to nationwide quarantines. Before long the government had given up trying to cure it and decided to use the paranoia created by its spread as a cover in order to break up assemblies and register people. Eventually, civil liberties became virtually non-existent. In one example the commanding Officer of the Hopeville missile base, Commander Devlin, had a protest group arrested and sent off for human experimentation, claiming it would give them "the white-hot rage of capitalist justice." These tactics made things worse, and by the end of 2077 the United States was on the verge of a massive civil uprising.<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This was done because the &eacute;minence grise of the federal government (The Enclave) realized it was likely only a matter of time until total nuclear war occurred, and knowing that the common man would not survive it they believed that they alone were worthy of re-colonizing the planet.

This latter style was retconned/reconciled in Fallout New Vegas as being a more standard-issue-practical plasma weapon compared to the pre-Fallout 3 versions that never made it past prototyping before the Great War. In game terms, the Fallout 3-style weapons were lower-tier, and the (renamed) Fallout 1-style weapons were higher-tier.

Despite the culture of the pre-war world being based on 1950s United States, no <em>Fallout</em> title contains any solid evidence that racism, sexism, or LGBTQ+ discrimination existed in that time, and no one in the post-war world shows any signs of prejudice in such a manner. <em>New Vegas</em> has Caesar's Legion which does not allow women to serve in the military (and uses them heavily as slave labor), but such a stance is not based on sexist attitudes according to <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry.

Worn by both the Brotherhood of Steel and the Enclave.<ul><li> In the third game, however, it loses a little of its luster as all forms of it - excluding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity Plus One Armor</a> - decrease Agility, which is the primary statistic for VATS.

Instead of being an inventory item, it's now a separate world object that you have to enter and exit. It still boosts your Strength and other stats (depending on how you customize it). You can detach and swap out armor plates from the main armor frame, and you can customize your armor with different features (including a jetpack). You also take no fall damage from any height and can actually inflict damage by landing from a height near NPCs. In addition, your damage resistances are raised to extremely high levels, and you take almost no radiation damage. To balance it out, however, they now require the relatively rare Fusion Cores to be operated, and they only last about 20 minutes (shorter if you run/sprint or use the jetpack) before you need a new one, or else become severely encumbered. Also, Power Armor is the only armor with item health, with each armor piece separately taking damage and requiring frequent repairs with semi-rare components at Power Armor Stations.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist">Power Fist</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> for characters using the Unarmed skill; can be upgraded to a Mega Powerfist in some games.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil">President Evil</a>: Little is known about the U.S Presidency pre-War, but what is known doesnt look good at all.

Both of them are Eagleland Type 2 assholes who want to exterminate all mutated humans and repopulate the world with the Enclave citizenry, and are <em>still</em> obsessed with wiping out China.

In <em>Fallout 3</em> and <em>New Vegas,</em> they're proportioned like ordinary humans, but with flaky, rotting skin and bloodshot eyes. Come <em>Fallout 4,</em> they merely look like moderate-to-severe burn victims with blacked-out eyes, some even having full heads of hair. Interestingly, this is reversed for the animalistic "feral" ghouls, who went from being identical to regular ghouls in the early games to emaciated, skinless husks in <em>Fallout 3</em> and <em>New Vegas,</em> and then freakish, deformed zombies riddled with cancerous growths in <em>Fallout 4.</em></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchedAcrossTheRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchedAcrossTheRoom">Punched Across the Room</a>: Requires a <em>very</em> good damage roll if fighting barehanded, but it is possible to hurl someone a fair distance (a couple hexes, depending on damage, in the first two games) if you do more than 10 points of damage in melee. The sledgehammer weapons greatly increase the distance traveled.

Members of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> faction of one game often show up in later games as friendly supporting characters, having chosen less antagonistic lifestyles or better role models.<ul><li> Fallout 2 has two notable examples. If you decide to eradicate everyone in the Enclave military base, the only NPC who asks you not to kill him is the cook in the mess hall, because that's all he does and didn't care who his employer was.

Played strongly in the third, where (despite heavy atomic onslaught and 200 years without maintenance) historic DC landmarks are still standing and almost completely intact; you can still generally get lights and (heavily irradiated) running water wherever you go. In <em>New Vegas,</em> it's justified thanks to Mr. House's long-term planning (and anti-missile laser defense system) sparing Vegas and the Mojave (and even more so, Hoover Dam) from the worst of the Great War. Additionally, Las Vegas was said to be heavily dilapidated and ruined when Mr. House woke from his coma and formed an alliance with the tribals inhabiting the ruins: Vegas had only recently been restored to an approximation of its pre-War glory in order to "roll out the red carpet" for the arrival of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">NCR</a>. <em>4</em> also plays this trope relatively straight, but is partly justified due to the fact that only one atomic bomb was aimed at Boston, and it <em>missed</em>, sparing the city from atomic annihilation, (<img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

In <em>Fallout 2</em>, <em>New Vegas</em>, and <em>4</em>, many parts of the Wasteland have actually become quite civilized again.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryGorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryGorn">Scenery Gorn</a>: Naturally.

The series is vague on the degree to which the Internet and its associated functions were developed, but it's mostly implied to not have existed since most homes didn't own personal computers, and only major companies had internal email messaging systems which may be linked across multiple buildings. Computers are also relatively primitive, the more powerful ones demanding large terminals to operate, and reading into the system specs given on some systems shows them to be utterly pathetic compared to modern home computers even in the 90s. The reason for all this is two-fold, partially to conform to the franchise's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaygunGothic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaygunGothic">Raygun Gothic</a> motif, and partially to explore what kind of gaps in technological progress could result in that aesthetic becoming reality.</li><li> The Post-War world naturally has even more of this going on, since people have to make a living with whatever they can scrounge up that may or may not be functional anymore. It's completely normal for wastelanders to live in ramshackle houses built from plywood boards and chain link fences, get their drinking water from hand-crank water pumps, and defend their homestead with a semi-automatic laser rifle and a pre-war combat robot they repaired. On the other hand a scavenger might explore the wasteland outfitted in a suit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> and armed with a homemade pipe rifle held together by duct tape and hope.

Their real advantages only amounted to easy to find ammo and decent damage (and in the case of the sniper rifle, the longest range in the game though in practice few fights take place anywhere so spreadout that it has any advantage over other rifles). Otherwise conventional firearms had underwhelming damage, often doing about 1/3 of the average damage that the equivalent laser does. Sure some of the more advanced armour and the metal armour had a slight damage resistance edge against energy weapons compared to standard firearms, but the sheer damage the energy guns put out can better shear through a armour's damage threshold. With enough micro-fusion cells, there's little reason to go back to conventional firearms except for saving ammo and personal preference. Later games do a better balance, but there's usually an advantage to energy guns by the late game.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">What Measure Is a Non-Human?</a>: Explored throughout the series is treatment of non-human races, such as Ghouls, robots/A.I.s, and Super Mutants. The fourth game's story centers around this in regards to synths, Institute-made artificial humans created as spies, assassins, and slave labor. Synths are so incredibly life-like in appearance and biology that they are practically indistinguishable from humans, such that there are synths that don't even realize they are synths and think themselves flesh-and-blood humans! Because the Institute likes to switch people in the Commonwealth with synths, there is mass paranoia over them, to the point where family will turn their guns on each other at the mere suspicion that they have been replaced with a synth. The Institute consider synths little more than machines, no more human-like than a Mister Handy robot, and treat them as machines. The Brotherhood of Steel consider synths a danger to humanity and seek their complete eradication. The Railroad, meanwhile, consider synths to be people and seek to liberate them (and even then, that's only taking into account the lifelike Gen 3 synths: there is internal debate over whether earlier and more primitive Gen 1 and Gen 2 synths count as people).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithThisHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithThisHerring">With This Herring</a>: Players are given a very small handful of supplies at the start of each game, typically a handgun with some ammo, a few stimpaks, and maybe a couple other things. Each game justifies this:<ul><li> In the first game, you get a pistol with ammo, a knife, two flares, and four stimpaks. Players can find out later that you're not the first guy they've sent out to find a new water chip and the rest haven't come back and aren't expected to, so they went light on supplies assuming you'd be the same &mdash; when you return to the Vault later, you have the option to convince them to give you more gear.

(Normally, finding the vaults would be an arduous task with several middle men involved.)</li><li> Played straight early in Fallout 1, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when you discover that Vault 15's water-purification chip is utterly inaccessible.</span></li><li> Also in Fallout 1, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">once you finish the water-purification chip quest, that's not the end.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zeerust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zeerust">Zeerust</a>: The surviving pre-apocalypse architecture and technology is highly reminiscent of '50s Pop Art: complete with muscle cars, vacuum tube computers, and tin-can robots. Background material establishes that America (and by extension, the world) never really moved beyond the 1950's in terms of values. The 60's revolution was either much less influential, only effected music, or both, and there was no 80's technological shift due to the absence of the transistor. As a result, even though the world "ended" in 2077, culturally, it had barely progressed at all.</li></ul></div><hr><div class="indent"><em>"... men do, through the roads they walk.
