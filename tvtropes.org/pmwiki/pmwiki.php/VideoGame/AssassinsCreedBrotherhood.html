There is no indication in-game that repairing the aqueducts has any other effect on the over world or that repairing the aqueducts is the solution to entering the Lair, or even <em>which</em> aqueduct it is.</li><li> Most Trading Items exist only for the purpose of being sold to merchants, but some are required to complete Shop Quests. There is no indication as to which items are for Shop Quests outside going to each individual shop that offers them. There is also no indication as to when all of the Shop Quests are actually viewable. Many players don't realize that there are more Shop Quests that unlock later in the game, since the game makes it seem like the first group of quests are the only ones available. This results in players accidentally selling shop quest items only to realize later they lost access to an item only available for those quests. The Fast Poison one is among the worst because it uses Tomatoes. Most players will get almost all of the Tomatoes very early in the game, but the Fast Poison shop quest is one of the last to unlock.</li><li> A minor version; the database includes entries for Florence landmarks, but doesn't give any indication on how to get them (since most of the time Ezio's flashbacks go to Florence, you don't really have the time to take in the sights).

However, the game rewards you with more points per kill for killing your target without blowing your cover. Doing this sort of stuff, which NPCs do not do, is a quick way to give yourself away. Furthermore, performing High Profile actions within line of sight to your target will quickly result in the game automatically tipping your target off even if s/he was not actively looking out for you.</li><li> Ezio has the same issues as he did in <em>AC2</em> (although the Assassin emblem is no longer on his starting Hidden Blade vambraces and a stylized arrowhead &mdash; albeit within the arch of the Assassin emblem &mdash; against feathers or leaves is used for his front buckle), and while for "immersion's sake" one could use the Florentine Noble Attire (a Uplay Reward that makes Ezio look like he did in <em>AC2</em> before first donning the robes), it has no half-cape to conceal his main weapons in Low Profile and the Crossbow is still openly worn on his back.</li><li> However, as with the previous game, when a guard is actively looking for Ezio, or Ezio is in a restricted area, the guards spot him instantly and will draw weapons in seconds and attack if he doesn't hide or move away quickly.</li><li> This can be taken to ludicrous proportions with a couple unlockable outfits.

The joke comes from the fact that this is a central concept in Machiavelli's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DiscoursesOnLivy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DiscoursesOnLivy">Discourses on Livy</a></em>, which he will write in 1517.</li><li> Later on, after Ezio becomes the head of the Assassins, Machiavelli says that he might write a book about him one day. Ezio then tells him "don't make it too long." <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrince">The Prince</a></em>, Machiavelli's most well-known work, is only 100 pages long in most versions.</li><li> Machiavelli also scoffs at the idea of turning public opinion against the Borgia and inciting the Romans to fight against them, noting that relying on the people is like building on sand. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrince">The Prince</a></em>, he uses the same phrase, but considers it wholly untrue - a Prince should in his opinion care more about the opinion of his people rather than his nobles and he will surely fall if he does not manage to become either beloved or feared. Either Ezio's actions in the game inspired the book or Machiavelli engaged in some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthMentor">stealth mentoring</a> and fully expected Ezio to act the way he did.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga">Humiliation Conga</a>:<ul><li> Sequences 5 through 9 are one long spree of failures for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cesare Borgia</span>: first Ezio <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kills Cesare's money-man who was his main source of funds, then he deprives Cesare of his French allies and (optionally) his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardoDaVinci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardoDaVinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>-designed war machines, kills Cesare's lieutenants and wrests control of Rome away from Cesare, <em>all</em> right under his nose. Cesare then gets a stern talking-to &mdash; and attempted poisoning &mdash; from his daddy who'd withheld both financial support <em>and</em> the Apple of Eden from him and didn't even tell him about the death of his French general, though Rodrigo's attempted solution <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">fatally backfires</a> (while this was going on, Ezio had also prevented Cesare's hitman from killing a love rival). Cesare's own sister Lucrezia betrays the location of the Apple of Eden to Ezio, who reaches it first despite Cesare's head start, and then escapes the Vaticano District. Several surviving Cardinals put their support behind "Della Rovere" (actually Giuliano della Rovere) for the Papacy after telling Cesare that his family's money is "tainted." After several skirmishes in Roman streets are all lost by Cesare's men, in the final battle for Rome the Assassins openly take to the streets and literally force him outside one of the city gates. Even then Cesare still believes that his army is returning to retake Rome, led by his hitman... but instead, a general previously forced into his service now arrests Cesare at the new Pope's order &mdash; complete with a charge of incest &mdash; and Cesare is dragged away by Papal Guards whom he might have previously commanded. It would be a year or more before he escaped, breaking several bones in the process, and Ezio would finally catch up to him while Cesare was making a last desperate grab at a comeback &mdash; not command<em>ing</em>, but command<em>ed</em> by a relative.
