It added a few new features such as the ability to get haircuts, hats and accessories to wear, new items to collect, the ability to communicate with friends over Wi-Fi (though the servers for it have since shut down), and a limited increase in interaction with your neighbors. <em>City Folk</em>, released for Wii, adds in the ability to visit the city, where most of the temporary shops that appeared in prior games (like Gracie and Crazy Redd) have taken up permanent residence. The game also allowed you to visit other people's towns and play with them online through Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection before the service was shut down. <em>Animal Crossing: New Leaf</em> for the 3DS has the first character you create become mayor of the town, and adds the option to upload your town to Nintendo's servers, allowing other players to visit even if you're not online. <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> for Nintendo Switch released on March 20, 2020.</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AnimalCrossing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AnimalCrossing">An anime movie</a> based on <em>Wild World</em> was released in Japan in 2006; there are currently no plans to show it elsewhere, but a few fan dubs do exist.</p><p>The series is one of many represented in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em>.

Players start on a deserted island, and explore and gather resources to build tools and furniture, and eventually develop their own little community. Design-wise, the entire main street aspect is removed and players are expected to slowly add new shops to the island and grow the settlement until it becomes a city itself. Transport is changed to an airport, which allows access to other players' islands and randomly selected "mystery islands" (of which there are 20 types, with their statistics set such that some are visited more frequently than others). Character and landscape customization has been greatly expanded upon; the player's look can be changed at any time with mirrors and wardrobes, and the island's landscape can be further modified to the player's liking as the game progresses. Additionally, it is the first mainline Animal Crossing game to be treated as a live service, with most events, furniture series&#146;, building upgrades, shop additions, features and NPC&#146;s from the previous entries of the franchise being added via monthly updates to preserve the longevity of the game and enforce players experiencing events at their intended release time without time traveling to them prematurely. As well, some NPC&#146;s whose previous roles have been made obsolete by the game mechanic overhauls such as Rover, Reese and Cyrus have had their roles repurposed to being included in seasonal events. Returning events have been extended to span across multiple days with the main event happening on the actual day (This being the case for Bunny Day) as well as new event types being introduced in this game (Wedding Season).</li></ul></div><p></p><hr><h2>The series as a whole features examples of:</h2><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder5');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tropes A to D&nbsp;</div><div id="folder5" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality">Acceptable Breaks from Reality</a>: Realistically, orange and cherry blossoms (necessary for fruit) wouldn't be able to survive the snow, much less bear fruit during winter.

If you switched tools a lot, this quickly became tedious. Especially bad in <em>Wild World</em>, as the game didn't pause while you did this, making catching bees almost impossible. Later games would allow you to cycle through tools you have using the D-pad, saving some hassle.</li><li> Watering flowers in early games was annoying if you had a lot of them and had difficulty keeping track. Later games made already-watered flowers sparkle, which came as a relief to players. <em>New Leaf</em> goes one further and made flower upkeep even easier by making the silver and gold watering cans water multiple flowers at once and introducing the "Keep Your Town Beautiful" ordinance. <em>New Horizons</em> takes this even further by removing the wilting mechanic altogether, only requiring flowers to be watered to propagate them.</li><li> Fruit wasn't stackable in the beginning. If you had a lot of fruit trees, this meant a lot of trips back and forth to the store. Thankfully, the ability to stack fruit (one stack holds nine, ten in <em>New Horizons</em>) was made possible in later games, cutting the number of trips down considerably.</li><li> If you're trying to catch bees in <em>New Leaf</em> and <em>New Horizons</em>, the swarm will <em>freeze in place</em> when you open your inventory. This eliminates the rush to equip your net, allowing you to focus on the timing of your swing.</li><li> Buying an art item from Crazy Redd was basically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a> prior to <em>New Leaf</em>. You never knew if the item was forged or not until you donated it to the museum. <em>New Leaf</em> onward turns this into a semi-easy challenge which changes the art piece in a minor way compared to original artwork, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGeniuses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGeniuses">sometimes it takes a keen eye to tell</a> (or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">strategy guide</a>).</li><li> If an animal wants you to deliver a package to another animal who is asleep, they'll say to wait until said animal wakes up, saving you the trouble of going to the animal's house and finding out for yourself.</li><li> Normally, when talking to the villagers, the game allows you to quickly select the last option by hitting the B button. However, when making an important choice (such as deciding whether or not to release a catch or choosing what to put in someone's coffee in The Roost), pressing B doesn't select anything, preventing you from accidentally choosing the wrong thing.</li><li> Looking for a specific villager for your village, but none of your friends have them, or they just don't want to trade? Don't feel like paying an arm and a leg of Bells to someone online to trade villagers with? Well, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Amiibo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Amiibo">amiibo</a><em> functionality of both </em>New Leafs' "Welcome Amiibo" update<em> and </em>New Horizons'' lets you use amiibo cards of villagers to have them move into your town/ island whenever you want them to, at which point you can convince them to move into your town.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Amiibo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Amiibo">amiibo</a><em> give you the opportunity to obtain a slew of previously unobtainable (or very hard to find) items, both new and old.

All they do is stand or walk around and mooch off you by asking for things. As an example, in <em>New Leaf</em>, your villagers will rarely contribute to public works funding, resulting in most of the funding coming out of your own pocket. <em>New Horizons</em> adds the mechanic of the higher the friendship level you have with a villager, the more they bells they will donate per day to projects.

Taken further in <em>New Leaf</em>, where villagers are now able to actively visit shops, use tools, shake trees, etc.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Art Evolution</a>: So far, there have been two major changes to the series' art style: <em>Wild World</em> added the now-famous "rolling log effect", and <em>New Leaf</em> features redone, slightly less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed">Super-Deformed</a> character models and a more "painterly" look to villagers and the outdoors. Over time the games have also changed villagers' general designs, such as pigs having floppier ears.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology">Artistic License &#150; Biology</a>:<ul><li> <em>New Leaf</em> and <em>New Horizons</em>: <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana">Banana plants do not look anything like palm trees, and in fact, aren't even trees!<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> And the fruit grows in a large bunch whose stalk must be hacked up to be split into combs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality">But that wouldn't have been as fun.</a> The biological requirements are also backwards, where planting the fruit on brown soil would cause the sapling to die but planting the fruit in sand would allow the sapling to thrive. In real life, banana plants require brown soil, and will wither and die if you attempt to plant it in beach sand.</li><li> The "bees" that occasionally chase after you when you knock over their nest are actually <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_giant_hornet">Japanese giant hornets<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Their nests resemble the typical football-shaped hornet's nests rather than the lotus pod-shaped wasp's nests seen in the game. The confusion likely stems from the Japanese word <em>hachi</em>, which is an encompassing term for bees, hornets, and wasps. Also, on the Harvest Festival, Franklin might require honey for a recipe which you apparently obtain from the "bee" nests, all the more jarring since the game also features actual honeybees, which do not swarm after you. This was corrected in <em>New Horizons</em>, where the bees were renamed wasps and the species changed from Japanese Giant Hornets to the Common Wasp.</li><li> Throughout the series: <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polemonium">real life Jacob's ladders<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> look nothing like the Jacob's ladders in-game. The "Jacob's ladders" in the games are actually <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily_of_the_Valley">lilies of the valley<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. This is due to a translation error; the Japanese versions correctly refer to the flowers as <em>suzuran</em> (the Japanese name for lilies of the valley), and <em>Happy Home Designer</em> finally uses their proper name internationally.</li><li> In the real world, "bug" refers to (scientifically) <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemiptera">a specific type of insect<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> or (colloquially) any terrestrial arthropod (so spiders and scorpions would fall under this latter definition). What the term <em>actually</em> means for <em>Animal Crossing</em> is "any animal caught using the net", which can range from insects and spiders to <em>hermit crabs</em> and <em>snails</em>. In a similar vein, frogs and tadpoles are "fish". Some dialogue will avoid using specific terms to mitigate this; for example, Celeste refers to the various aquatic donations as "sea and river species".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePaleontology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePaleontology">Artistic License &#150; Paleontology</a>: The series tries to avert this with Blathers' lectures, and yet the museum display places <em>Stegosaurus</em> in the Late Cretaceous. Blathers himself makes a few blunders by claiming dinosaurs are cold-blooded, <em>Dimetrodon</em> lived alongside dinosaurs, <em>Stegosaurus</em> couldn't feel pain in its tail for a long time because of its tiny brain, and <em>Apatosaurus</em> lived in swamps. In <em>New Leaf</em>, a museum plaque implies that <em>Pteranodon</em> was a bird ancestor.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Ascended Extra</a>:<ul><li> The island villagers in the GameCube version required a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a> connection to even get to before.[[note]]e+ does allow you to visit the island without GBA connection, but you still need to scan the islander's e-reader card in order to get them.

The original game features a few predetermined sequences of a generic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> doing things like fishing or chopping down trees.

In earlier games you had to hope they landed in a tree for you, but later games let you nab 'em with slingshots. What they contain varies depending on the game; in <em>City Folk</em> it's Nintendo furniture, and in <em>New Leaf</em> it's balloon furniture (though the <em>Welcome amiibo</em> update adds regular furniture to the mix once the full balloon set is collected). <em>New Horizons</em> made it so that balloons drop most items types as well as Bells.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BandagedFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BandagedFace">Bandaged Face</a>:<ul><li> You have the option of wearing bandages on your head.</li><li> Lucky the Dog has bandages wrapped around his face so that only a single eye is visible.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarelyChangedDubName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarelyChangedDubName">Barely Changed Dub Name</a>: Most English names are nothing like their Japanese versions.

Even Mr. Resetti usually caps out towards ten minutes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyHouse">Big Fancy House</a>: While the original game's aren't too big, they only grow from <em>Wild World</em> onward. They're at their biggest yet in <em>New Leaf</em>, where you can have a two-story mansion with three rooms appended on the first floor and a basement, with 8 x 8 as the max size each. That's a lot of floor! With the "Welcome amiibo" update, you also get a secret storeroom that fits in a whopping 360 items on top of the 180 slots provided by closet space. But there is one problem: The total cost to getting every single expansion is a whopping <em><strong>7,753,800 Bells</strong></em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo">Big "NO!"</a>: Peppy villagers will sometimes say that when they step on a pitfall trap.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirdsOfAFeather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirdsOfAFeather">Birds of a Feather</a>: Cranky and Snooty villagers get along well together, due to their more mature age and view on life than the rest and the fact that they both share a sense of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">snarkiness</a>. They're frequently seen together, which some villagers interpret that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">they're dating</a> although they both try to assure everyone that they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFriends">Just Friends</a>.

But since there's no real goal to the game, nor an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">achievement counter</a>, <em>every</em> reward is for bragging rights, or at least for leading you to <em>other</em> rewards.

The Silver Axe does too, at least in <em>New Leaf</em>, but it lasts a lot longer. In <em>New Horizons</em>, most tools (the only exceptions being the vaulting pole and ladder) will break after enough uses, even the golden ones; this makes <em>New Horizons</em> the first game where the golden axe has limited durability.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">Break the Cutie</a>: It's stated that back when he was young and idealistic, Tom Nook tried to enterprise in the big city. Which after many failures and betrayals broke him and in turn made him somewhat colder. In turn, this distanced him from his friend Sable, who also in turn had a huge fight with her sister Label. Label left.

The smoker contains some rather delicious looking fish or meat depending on the game (and cheese), there's a roasted Thanksgiving-style turkey, and <em>Happy Home Designer</em> had a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">[1]</a></em> crossover that included the spit roast with a Well Done Steak included.

This means that, while wearing it, they will trip, have a higher chance of being caught by a scorpion or tarantula, and increasing friendship with other villagers will be more difficult, in addition to other bad effects.

Ironically, passing out like that was implemented to allow players to <em>escape</em> being trapped in the scenery.

Sable and Blathers have both been largely decharacterized. Mr. Resetti is entirely optional, because Nintendo acknowledged that Resetti scared and upset many younger players. Tortimer used to be the mayor in previous games, but since <em>New Leaf</em> gives that role to the player, he's retired to the Island and hosts tours there. Even Tom Nook could be seen as this. In previous games, he ran the general store and unless his shop was closed, chances are if you played the game, you would be seeing him. In <em>New Leaf</em>, while he still features at the start of the game, he now runs a home improvement store and house upgrades are optional for the first time; it's possible after paying your first mortgage to never have to see him again. A few of these, but not all, returned to the forefront in <em>New Horizons</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesertSkull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesertSkull">Desert Skull</a>: This shows up as a furniture item in the "American West/frontier" set.

In <em>City Folk</em>, he outright hits on female characters. Relentlessly. And possibly the male characters if you read between the lines. It's largely gone by <em>New Leaf</em>, as he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a>, but he'll still occasionally sing love songs and ask couples about their relationships.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DitzySecretary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DitzySecretary">Ditzy Secretary</a>: Isabelle is clumsy and forgetful, but she's the mayor's faithful secretary.

That means to get all of his gifts, you have to build all, some, or none of his family perfectly for each gift. The Fishing Tourneys and Bug-Offs, for catalog completion, require you to place in first, second, and third place (on different events, not on the same day) if you want to have the gold, silver, and bronze trophies for each competition.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">Downloadable Content</a>: You can download free stuff in <em>Wild World</em> onward. <em>New Leaf</em> also has items exclusive to "Nintendo Zone" locations.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDriver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDriver">The Driver</a>: Kapp'n, whether it be a boat, taxi, or bus.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">Dub Name Change</a>: It's easier to count which villager names <em>didn't</em> get changed from the Japanese to international versions. Nearly every villager with a Japanese name had their name changed to one more common in the target language (e.g., Miyabi -&gt; Annalisa), with the notable exception of Genji. Some villagers also have many different names across languages; for example, Francine is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName">Francois</a> in Japanese, Nadine in French, Franca in Italian, and Manu in German.

For instance:<ul><li> The original <em>D&#333;butsu no Mori</em> on the N64 required players to set the clock when playing the game for the first time, since the system didn't have a built-in clock. Since the cart's RTC was battery-powered, this also meant that if the battery died, the game would not be able to keep time anymore. Starting with the GameCube, every installment syncs with its respective system's built-in clock.</li><li> Blathers, the Able Sisters, and Tortimer were not introduced until the GameCube iterations of the series. Similarly, features tied to them were not available: there were no seasonal gifts that players could earn from the mayor, clothing could only be purchased at Tom Nook's shop (which would still be the case until <em>Wild World</em> gave this role to the Ables), there was no way to make your own clothing, and there was no museum in the town (only a Faraway Museum for identifying fossils, which could still be used as decorations). <em>New Leaf</em> would phase out Tortimer, having him retire to a private island with the player taking his place as mayor.</li><li> The original Japanese iterations had a unique rotary-dial system for inputting characters. The English version used a more standard keyboard, which came to Japan starting with <em>Wild World</em>.</li><li> The N64 original, as well as the first GameCube iteration in Japan, had only a small handful of Japanese holidays. Additional holidays, such as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeanXmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeanXmas">Toy Day</a>" and Halloween, were added in the North American and European releases, then retroactively added to the Japanese version in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> <em>D&#333;butsu no Mori e+</em>. Other holidays were changed, such as the Shinto-style Bell Shrine being replaced with a wishing fountain for New Year's.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterCustomization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterCustomization">Character Customization</a> was highly limited in earlier games, with the player's appearance being dictated by a questionnaire at the start of the game. Later games would include more options for players to alter their appearance, with <em>New Horizons</em> eventually allowing players to dictate their appearance using an in-depth customization system at the very beginning, as well as allowing players to alter their appearance with certain furniture later.</li><li> Emulations of NES games were a popular feature in earlier games, but would be retired after the GameCube iteration with the advent of the Wii's Virtual Console.</li><li> Earlier games separated a town's acres with a distinct scrolling that would occur when crossing over from acre into another. Later games would feature seamless transitions between acres, though they are still counted internally.</li><li> The first games took placed from an overhead perspective, while <em>Wild World</em> coined the unique "rolling log" perspective that has become a trademark of the series. <em>New Horizons</em> has the option to use the original overhead perspective as an alternate viewpoint, however.</li><li> Mr. Resetti, the ornery mole who would chew players out for resetting or not properly saving the game, was a mainstay of the series until <em>New Leaf</em>, where he reveals that he had been laid off due to the Reset Surveillance Center closing down. Although players could help reopen the center and get Resetti his job back, the advent of auto-saving in <em>New Horizons</em> means that Resetti's old career is over (although, for a mercy, he is suggested to have found a new job with rescue services).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterBunny">Easter Bunny</a>: Zipper T.

In <em>City Folk</em>, he'll whistle it if the player waits a while. It's even on <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-3DS/Animal-Crossing-New-Leaf-273841.html">the official European website<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, where it can be accessed by clicking on K.K.

If you hit it with a silver shovel in <em>New Leaf</em>, there's a chance that some ores and gems will come out of it instead.</li><li> In <em>New Leaf</em>, at 3:33 AM on a Sunday or Monday, if the player turns on their TV, an alien will appear on the screen. It will then deliver a gibberish message before leaving a minute later. In <em>New Horizons</em>, it only occurs on Saturdays.</li><li> While the Famous Mushroom in <em>New Leaf</em> (which only grows near stumps with special patterns on them) is best sold for a large amount of money, the fact that it resembles a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> Super Mushroom is acknowledged in-game, as eating one causes the player character to temporarily grow in size, complete with a matching sound effect.</li><li> If you press A while holding a Dandelion Puff, you'll blow the seeds away. This also removes the item from your inventory.</li><li> In <em>New Leaf</em>, if your birthdate is the same as Isabelle's (December 20th), she will react accordingly.</li><li> If you ring a judge's bell with the Ringside Seating wallpaper put up, the audience will cheer, and several cameras will flash.

You have to remember what they usually order yourself. To make matters worse, even villagers <em>who have never ordered from you before</em> (and, thus, have never given you any hints) will ask for "the usual" at this point.

One of his first jobs requires you to greet everyone in town, which mandates exploring the map, and later jobs force you to write letters or run errands for the villagers. One side says "damn you, Tom Nook!" for forcing it on the player in the first place, while the other side is <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDpL2vloKxg">miffed that it lasts only a half hour<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourIsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourIsDeath">Four Is Death</a>: After the funky 4 AM theme in the GameCube game and the minimalistic equivalent in <em>Wild World</em> and <em>City Folk</em>, Nintendo decided to reference this by giving the hour an eerie tune in <em>New Leaf</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourthWallWillNotProtectYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourthWallWillNotProtectYou">The Fourth Wall Will Not Protect You</a>:<ul><li> In <em>New Leaf</em>, if the player is male, Cyrus warns the player not to have him catch the player "makin' goo-goo eyes at [his] wife, or [he'll] make ya see things in 4D!" Reese will make a similar threat if you are female.</li><li> In the original, if you quit your game without saving enough times, Resetti would pretend to reset your game in order to scare you straight. In <em>City Folk</em>, he does something similar by making you think he turned off your Wii.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnelMouthedCephalopod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnelMouthedCephalopod">Funnel-Mouthed Cephalopod</a>: Octopus villagers have the stereotypical funnel-shaped mouth.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FurryConfusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FurryConfusion">Furry Confusion</a>:<ul><li> One of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCartoonFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCartoonFish">fish</a> you can catch is a frog, and you can have frogs as townsfolk. If one of your froggy townspeople asks to have a fishing competition with you, and asks for a frog&mdash;for sushi&mdash;it gets kind of creepy. Lampshaded in <em>New Horizons</em>:<div class="indent"> "I caught a frog! Or it's a new neighbor... and I have some apologizing to do."</div></li><li> In <em>e+</em> onwards, one can also catch an octopus &mdash; and yet a rare few potential neighbors are also octopi. <em>New Leaf</em> even introduced Zucker, an octopus based on takoyaki (a dish made from fried octopus). There is also the birdcage item... which comes with a little songbird inside. To add to that is how one duck neighbor, at least in <em>Wild World</em>, actually has one of these birdcages in his house to start out with.</li><li> The doghouse item has a growling dog in it.</li><li> Gyroids are actually living creature seen hanging out in front of your house or running the auction house depending on which game you play. Yet, you can still dig them up out of the ground as an item.</li><li> Some cow villagers may even have cow skulls in their home. Yikes.</li><li> <em>New Leaf</em> gives us hamster villagers, and there has been an item of the same name ever since the first generation. It also introduced Tucker, a villager who is obviously based on the woolly mammoth (a collectable fossil since the first game), and two new "fish" that can be caught: tadpoles and soft-shelled turtles. Being juvenile frogs, tadpoles add an extra layer of creepiness to the same scenarios that frogs are already subject to. As for turtles, Tortimer is an old tortoise NPC that has been in all games except <em>D&#333;butsu no Mori</em>, and depending on your localization Kapp'n and his family might all be classified as turtles. In some island tours, which are hosted by Tortimer and are on the island Kapp'n apparently lives on, you can even catch turtles for fun and profit.</li><li> Invoked in a picture quote by Goldie, a dog villager, who considers the Lab on the cover of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nintendogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nintendogs">Nintendogs</a></em>, which is an actual dog, to be dreamy.</li><li> In <em>New Leaf</em>, a sisterly villager may ask you what kind of pet would suit her best. The options? Hedgehog (a la the Able Sisters), raccoon (Tom Nook and the Nooklings), pelican (Pete, Pelly, and Phyllis), and <em>the actual species of the villager</em>. If you choose the villager's species, she asks if they bite.</li><li> In <em>New Leaf</em>, the player character's mom may write a letter mentioning that the neighbors' cat had kittens. The only cats you see yourself are anthropomorphic.</li><li> As of <em>City Folk</em>, a yellow bird perches on the bulletin board when there are messages you haven't read. In <em>New Leaf</em>, it reappears and is replaced by an owl (the same species as the anthropomorphic Blathers and Celeste) at night. These birds also appear around town.</li><li> In <em>New Leaf</em>, Gulliver's rantings about other countries mention animals. From the way he discusses them, they sound more like non-anthropomorphic ones.</li><li> The rice maker item in <em>New Leaf</em> can be edited to feature chicken rice despite the fact you can have chicken villagers. In the original game, your father enjoys pork chops despite pigs also being villager options.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FurryReminder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FurryReminder">Furry Reminder</a>:<ul><li> A literal example in <em>New Leaf</em>. Sometimes Cranky villagers may ask you "If I were an animal, what would I be?". If you choose the first option, their actual species, they'll say that they get that a lot, then remember that that's what they actually are.</li><li> Frog villagers don't use umbrellas in the rain because they're amphibians who require water on their skin to survive.</li><li> Sometimes when you talk to Pete in <em>New Leaf</em>, he'll mention that when he gets off, he's going to eat a fish that he's been storing in his bill pouch. Other times he'll complain about the fact that the rarity of opposable thumbs leads to a lot of illegibly written addresses.</li><li> A few special characters enjoy eating animals suitable for their species, such as scallops or bugs.</li><li> Villagers' default houses occasionally reference their species. One duck villager frequently has water-themed houses, with his house in the first game literally just being a pool and sprinklers.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">Gameplay and Story Integration</a>: The infants that kangaroo villagers have are generally not treated as actual characters. They're not named or even referred to in-dialogue. They are simply an extension of their mother and repeat the same movements as them. Despite this, a few of the villagers base households relate to them being mothers. For example, Sylvia has a crib in her room.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a>: The museum's blurb for the piranha claims that they're actually fairly docile.

If you have <em>three</em> of them, you can commission a piece of the Golden Series (which was originally <em>City Folk</em> DLC) at Re-Tail. This will set you back 10,000 Bells, though.</li><li> Also in <em>New Leaf</em>, getting high scores in the HHA theme challenge unlocks golden exterior decorations for your house.</li><li> The best tools in the game are the Golden Tools, which are only obtained by accomplishing difficult tasks, which varies from game to game.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk">Gonk</a>: <em>Many</em>.

Unless you looked it up or asked a friend about the rare fish or bug you saw in their museum or room, it likely won't take a single cycle of seasons to catch every single one in the game.</li><li> There are a handful of K.K. airchecks you can only get by request. Most of them don't follow the "K.K. ____" format, so you would have to have seen a walkthrough to even know they existed. <em>New Leaf</em> remedies this by having the request-only airchecks being sold occasionally at the Nookling stores upon enough upgrades, and in <em>New Horizons</em>, interacting with a radio will tell you what song is currently playing (allowing you to potentially learn the request-only ones). The villagers will also occasionally tip off the request-only ones to you.</li><li> Obtaining the Golden Axe in <em>Wild World</em> involves a long trading quest that sometimes ends prematurely due to the randomness of it. You would need to first obtain a red turnip from Joan, have it ready for Wendell to eat and hope he gives you a turban in exchange. Next, you give the turban to Sahara, and hope you get a massage chair. Then take that massage chair to Tortimer for a scallop, which finally goes to Pascal, and hope you get the tool in question. Now, every time the word "hope" was written, there's a chance you won't get the item in question, stopping your quest cold until those events align again. The quest itself is incredibly obtuse on paper, as not a lot of players would think it'd be a chain of trades beyond giving Wendell a turnip that could sell for a good amount of bells for diligence.</li><li> Working at The Roost in <em>New Leaf</em>. You have to get all three aspects of an animal's coffee order correct, but they'll only tell you <em>one</em> aspect before you make it, or might not even say anything. They do tell you what was wrong with it afterwards if it's not correct, though, so it potentially becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrialAndErrorGameplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrialAndErrorGameplay">Trial-and-Error Gameplay</a>. This can be countered somewhat by talking to your neighbors while they're in the cafe, and they may describe how they like their coffee. Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> when random villagers that don't even live your town pop in for a cup. They may be helpful and tell you both clues, but sometimes they only give one. While there is a concession that regular villagers always have their milk and sugar in equal amounts (if someone asks for no milk, then they also want no sugar), the same doesn't apply for some important NPCs like Tom Nook, who wants a lot of milk but only a little sugar.</li><li> Getting the highest town rating in any main-line game since <em>Wild World</em> is this. Often, the NPC involved will only give you some vague comments as to what to do, without any indication of the specific thresholds required to achieve it. Particularly bad in <em>New Horizons</em>, because of its rather complex island grading criteria relative to earlier titles<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2ion7');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2ion7" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2ion7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Two scores, one simpler one for "nature" (quantities of trees and flowers) and one much more complex one for "development" (based on what furniture you place outside), which must <em>both</em> cross certain thresholds</span> and the need to raise your island's rating to three stars out of five to unlock terraforming!</li><li> Distinguishing authentic art from forgeries in <em>New Leaf</em> and <em>New Horizons</em>. The forged paintings have a slight difference from the real thing if you carefully look at Redd's wares, unlike in previous versions where you won't know if you're getting the real deal until you try to donate it to Blathers. It, however, requires knowledge of the real-world equivalent in order to succeed, and some of the forgery clues are more subtle than others. <em>New Horizons</em> does allow you to examine the pieces closely to catch those differences, but if you're not into fine art, this will likely have you looking up a guide like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GameFAQs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GameFAQs">GameFAQs</a> regardless.</li><li> In <em>Wild World</em>, you can change your bed by pressing "A" in front of the foot of the bed, and then selecting a bed item from your inventory. Does anyone ever tell you this? No.</li><li> Ever since flower hybrids were implemented, Blue Roses were quite difficult to cultivate. While it's justified that true, cultivated blue roses are a legend in real life (the family roses belong to naturally lacks the pigment needed to make blue petals), let's break down how convoluted growing them is...<ul><li> In <em>Wild World</em>, it requires Black<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3xyoy');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3xyoy" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3xyoy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Two red roses.</span> and Purple<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4ceie');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4ceie" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4ceie');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Two white roses.</span> roses. Though the combination is simple, you're still banking on luck that one will sprout, which can mean months of multiple non-blue roses before you get a single bunch growing.</li><li> <em>New Leaf</em> still requires hybrids, but changed it to something more ridiculous. You would need to pair Purple and Orange<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5uomw');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5uomw" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5uomw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Yellow and red roses.</span> roses, and they produce a special type of Red rose that creates the Blue rose. <em>They look no different from a regular Red Rose.</em> Unless you looked it up, you would never have guessed that. Even if you have two special red roses to hybridize, there's still a one-in-seven chance that it'll actually produce a blue rose, as they can produce all the other colors as well.</li><li> And in <em>even more</em> ridiculous fashion, <em>New Horizons</em> introduces flower genetics that can be quickly summarized as basic Mendelian genetics. As in the kind that may have been in a school science class. Each flower has a set of genes coded into the plant itself, and they vary between wild-grown flora and store-bought seeds. There is a very specific set of genes that produce the coveted blue roses, but unless you carefully plan out a garden and can hypothesize your odds via Punnet Squares, you'll more than likely brute force your way to get them, or not get them at all because your roses don't have the right genes.</li></ul></li><li> Unlocking Gracie's store "GracieGrace" in <em>New Leaf</em> can be a pain. What does she ask? She asks you to wear an ensemble consisting of one particular style, as part of the Fashion Check. Simple, right? <strong>Not really.</strong> Gracie herself only appears once a week like Saharah and Redd, except she starts making appearances once you spend enough at TIY. Secondly, the only source of clothing style in-game is what the storekeepers at Able Sisters and Kicks tell you. While you're allowed to mix styles to pass, they don't tell you which styles clash, garnering an instant-fail. You have to get four passes to unlock the store. Expect yourself to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RummageSaleReject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RummageSaleReject">Rummage Sale Reject</a>.

He explains his dire situation: He needs to retrieve five hitodama, which slowly float around the town. If you don't, his master (whose name changes every time) will be very displeased. If you collect them for him before 4 AM, he will perform a favor for you, one of which is simultaneously plucking every weed in town for you. This was dropped in Wisp's later appearances; in <em>City Folk</em> he instead behaves more like a genie (with his headgear changed to match this) and requires you to find his missing lamp, or else he is stuck in town for the night, while <em>Welcome amiibo</em> (in which he reprises his genie role) has the wishes he grants come in the form of summoning characters from amiibo cards or figures, as Leif already provides a weed-pulling service in <em>New Leaf</em>. <em>New Horizons</em> returns to his original role, though the hitodama are now actual pieces of his spirit and his hat has changed to a <em>Hitaikakushi</em> and changes his gift to be either an item the player doesn't own or one that's very expensive (which the player is unlikely to own either, early on at least).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolidayMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolidayMode">Holiday Mode</a>:<ul><li> Conifer and non-fruit trees get lights during the December holiday season.</li><li> In <em>New Horizons</em>, trees will have their leaves replaced with cherry blossoms for the first ten days of April and eggs will grow on Hardwood Trees for two weeks leading to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeanXmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeanXmas">Bunny Day</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollerButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollerButton">Holler Button</a>: Equipping the megaphone tool in <em>New Leaf</em> gives you one of these, letting you press A and yell into the 3DS' microphone in order to find out where a specific villager is, although it only works if the character you're looking for is in the main village and not indoors or on Main Street.

Averted since <em>City Folk</em>, since more hippos from the original games did come back.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">Leaning on the Fourth Wall</a>:<ul><li> Starting up the <em>New Leaf</em> after the "Welcome amiibo" update has you run into Isabelle on the train home. She asks if you've been away on vacation, which is a knowing wink to players returning to the game after years to see the update.</li><li> The Nintendo Switch item in <em>New Horizons</em> costs 29,980 bells, the same price as a real one in yen.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leitmotif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leitmotif">Leitmotif</a>:<ul><li> Each game has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeAndVariationsSoundtrack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeAndVariationsSoundtrack">Theme-and-Variations Soundtrack</a> that uses the main title theme as a leitmotif.</li><li> Every town can have a unique tune, as the player character can customize it. It plays every time you speak to a character, among other instances.</li><li> The Tom Nook stores in older games and Nookling stores in <em>New Leaf</em> all have their own leitmotif.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeSimulationGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeSimulationGame">Life Simulation Game</a>: One of the more successful examples, <em>Animal Crossing</em> is a simplified life sim. There's no dating, eating is for cosmetic reasons, and you cannot die, however it is still a life simulator nevertheless.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a>: Compared to the original, characters are much nicer in the newer games. Villagers used to make cruel remarks and force you to play "games" or buy items from them for a random amount of bells (often the exact amount you have on you) and give you junk in return. Aside from them, the snowmen went from outright hostile towards you if you mess up assembling them to forgiving of your mistake, Rover initially being passive aggressive if you refuse to let him sit across from you in the train after he comments about drooling on you, and Phyllis' snark was toned down from being passive-aggressive to just being stressed.<ul><li> Resetti is optional in <em>New Leaf</em>. If the player chooses not to build the Reset Center, Isabelle's "Oh, Mayor? Looks like you forgot to save last time." is <em>much</em> gentler then Resetti's former scoldings.</li><li> The entire series is this when compared to Nintendo's other franchises like <em>Mario</em> and <em>Zelda</em>, which tend to be grand adventures or action-packed romps.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighthousePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighthousePoint">Lighthouse Point</a>: Lighthouses are in the original and <em>City Folk</em> and are part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideQuest">Side Quest</a>. It's also a Public Works Project in <em>New Leaf</em>, but lacks the side quest. In <em>New Horizons</em>, it's a piece of "furniture" redeemable for Nook Miles.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LionsAndTigersAndHumansOhMy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LionsAndTigersAndHumansOhMy">Lions and Tigers and Humans...

In <em>Wild World,</em> you could at least try to catch fish that were somewhat bigger to try and get the biggest fish... but in <em>City Folk</em> and <em>New Leaf</em>, you've got to just keep fishing and hope the fish of type X you angle is the biggest, as their actual measurement is randomized.</li><li> Trying to get a silver or golden axe in <em>City Folk</em>. It seems to make absolutely no difference what you say; you lose your axe, get your original axe, get a silver axe or a golden axe pretty much at random. So you just have to stock up on axes and keep trying every day.</li><li> The paintings, specifically the usually forged ones you get from Redd. Averted in <em>New Leaf</em>, where forged works of art (which now includes statues and sculptures) now have visible differences, while some works of art are never forged. To balance things out, however, each player character can only buy one item from Redd per week.</li><li> Gracie's car washing minigame in the first generation. It acts like you just have to mash the A button enough times, but it's possible to fail <em>using a turbo controller</em>.</li><li> The Bug-Off (prior to <em>New Horizons</em> where it was simplified), for similar reasons as the Fishing Tourney. However, the Bug-Off is even more luck-based; instead of relying solely on the size of the bug, Nat also judges bugs by their rarity and their "color and luster." While you can control the rarity by only giving up rare bugs, the only way you can find out how good the color and luster of your bugs are is by giving them to Nat, and the results are completely random.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarketBasedTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarketBasedTitle">Market-Based Title</a>: The Wii installment has the subtitle <em>City Folk</em> in North America and <em>Let's Go to the City</em> in PAL countries. The entire series is also called <em>Animal Crossing</em> (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName">Punny Name</a> based on road crossing signs) in Western territories, with its title in its original country being <em>D&#333;butsu no Mori</em> (or <em>Animal Forest</em>).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MascotMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MascotMook">Mascot Mook</a>: OK, so there are no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">mooks</a> to speak of in <em>Animal Crossing</em>, but the Gyroids are almost as iconic of the series as the villagers.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Meaningful Name</a>: The dodos who run the airport in <em>New Horizons</em> are named Orville and Wilbur, as in fellow flight enthusiasts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWrightBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWrightBrothers">The Wright Brothers</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessageInABottle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessageInABottle">Message in a Bottle</a>: An item the player can receive in <em>Wild World</em>. The player can write a letter inside it and throw it out into the ocean, and may occasionally find one themselves. It could either be a randomly generated message, or another player's via Tag Mode. The mechanic returns in <em>New Horizons</em>, where they appear on your island once per day. In addition to a brief letter (this time from one of the many villagers), each bottle contains a DIY crafting recipe.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessyHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessyHair">Messy Hair</a>: Starting with <em>City Folk</em>, the player can get a bedhead if they haven't played the game in over a week. In <em>New Horizons</em>, doing so makes the hairstyle unlockable.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedWildlife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedWildlife">Misplaced Wildlife</a>:<ul><li> The animal neighbors might be justified as immigrants, but the <em>fish</em> and <em>bugs</em> you can catch? There are <em>piranhas</em> in your river. And <em>coelacanths</em> in the ocean. As for the bugs? You can catch birdwing butterflies, the largest in the world. And the <em>plants</em> are wacky, too&mdash;if your town is particularly unkempt, a rafflesia will grow there.

And then <em>City Folk</em> introduces the Asian <em>Velociraptor</em>, and <em>New Leaf</em> the African <em>Spinosaurus</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionPackSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionPackSequel">Mission-Pack Sequel</a>: Most of the earlier games were this to each other. The first generation mostly consisted of iterated versions of the original N64 game&#151;though only one of these was released outside of Japan&#151;while it became more apparent overseas with <em>Wild World</em> to <em>City Folk</em> (which is essentially just a Wii port of <em>Wild World</em> with most of the traveling characters moved to the city). As the developers realized this was a common complaint for the franchise, <em>New Leaf</em> shook up the series formula considerably, and <em>New Horizons</em> deviated even further.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoonRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoonRabbit">Moon Rabbit</a>:<ul><li> Ruby, known as Luna in the Japanese version, has a moon-themed house with a mochi pestle.</li><li> There's also Mira, a rabbit whose house is themed to a space station, and her catchphrase in the Japanese version is "the moon". Her appearance and name reference Sailor Venus from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>, with her species being a nod to Sailor Moon herself, Usagi Tsukino.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneMadeAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneMadeAwesome">Mundane Made Awesome</a>: How do villagers change clothes?

Same thing for the player.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicalNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicalNod">Musical Nod</a>: The <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXG9zU2Lb6g">5 PM theme<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in <em>New Leaf</em> is a bossa nova tune, just like the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wqu5UfBFUW8">5 PM theme<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in the first generation games.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag">Mythology Gag</a>:<ul><li> A tradition for each game is to have the "fake" songs that K.K. plays when requesting an invalid title become genuine hidden songs in later games. The GameCube installment had "Forest Life", "My Place", and "To the Edge", which became real songs in <em>Wild World</em>; <em>Wild World</em> had "Spring Blossoms", "Stale Cupcakes", and "Wandering", which became real songs in <em>City Folk</em>; <em>City Folk</em> had "Hypno K.K.", "K.K. Island", and "K.K. Stroll", which became real songs in <em>New Leaf</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note80dgz');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note80dgz" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note80dgz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">oddly, <em>City Folk</em> ended up only having two truly new K.K. songs, "K.K. House" and "K.K. Sonata"</span>; and <em>New Leaf</em> had "Animal City", "Drivin'", and "Farewell", which became real songs in <em>New Horizons</em>.</li><li> A few of K.K. Slider's songs are also derived from the background music of older games; "Forest Life" is based on the recurring theme from the first generation, while "Spring Blossoms" comes from the Cherry Blossom Festival theme from the Japanese versions of the original. <em>New Leaf</em> introduces "Animal City" (the city theme from <em>City Folk</em>) as one of his "fake" songs, and <em>New Horizons</em> does the same with <em>Wild World</em>'s title theme.</li><li> <em>New Leaf</em> has quite a few of these:<ul><li> Rover mentions he hasn't ridden the trains much since 2002, referring back to the first game's mode of travel.</li><li> When discussing your first down payment, Tom Nook mentions how much easier it is to make money on your own than to get low-paying part-time employment, lampshading the errands he would force you to do as part of the tutorial in the older games.</li><li> Timmy and Tommy sometimes say that their store does not have a points system, referencing the one present in <em>City Folk</em>.</li><li> Gulliver will occasionally mention that he has a hard time convincing others that he's been to space. In <em>Wild World</em> and <em>City Folk</em> he flew in a spaceship, instead of being washed ashore, as in this game and the first one.</li><li> Pete says he doesn't fly to deliver letters because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">someone</a> at his old job would shoot him with a slingshot.</li><li> Some characters will also talk about the game in terms of trains, like how the train is the fourth generation version and unlike the last two generations, is completely different, and that it had inherited some of the "DNA" of the first generation. <em>New Leaf</em> brought back several elements from the original version of the game, such as trains and the island. It also shook up the series formula after complaints that the last two installments of the series were too similar to each other.</li><li> TVs in the original <em>Animal Crossing</em> would only play one program based on what the TV was (for example, the Apple TV would have apples rolling across the screen). At certain times in <em>New Leaf</em>, the TV will play a moment of classic programs (the show that plays <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWcvbLpJhbI">in this video<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> comes from the Retro TV in the original).</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NationalAnimalStereotypes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NationalAnimalStereotypes">National Animal Stereotypes</a>: A fair amount of animal villagers have designs and/or names that evoke countries stereotypically associated with their species. For example:<ul><li> Several of the koalas and kangaroos are named after Australian locations or concepts. Alice, Canberra, and Sydney are all named after cities in Australia; Melba is named after Melba toast; Ozzie&#146;s name is a pun on the word &#147;Aussie&#148;; and Walt and Mathilda are named after the popular Australian song &#147;Waltzing Matilda&#148;. In addition, Gonzo&#146;s catchphrase is &#147;mate&#148;.</li><li> Apollo, a bald eagle whose birthday is on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanHolidays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanHolidays">the Fourth of July</a>. Additionally, he&#146;s named after Apollo 11, the spacecraft that first landed humans on the Moon; the Apollo 11 moon landing is widely considered one of the United States&#146;s greatest achievements.</li><li> Chow, a panda whose catchphrase is &#147;aiya&#148; and whose house&#146;s furnishings are very Chinese-looking. His name is even a variant of the common Chinese surname &#147;Zhou&#148;, which is in turn derived from the Zhou dynasty, the longest-lasting dynasty in Chinese history.</li><li> Cousteau, a frog with a mustache whose catchphrase is &#147;oui oui&#148;.</li><li> Deli, a monkey named after New Delhi (the capital of India), whose coloration resembles that of a gray langur, a species of monkey native to India. Additionally, in Happy Home Designer, he asks for a curry-themed home (curry being a well-known Indian dish).</li><li> Elina, an elephant with a bindi (a red mark worn by many women in India) on her forehead. In the Japanese version, her catchphrase is &#147;Namaste&#148;, a customary greeting in India.</li><li> Jitters, a bird with a color scheme based on the flag of Brazil, wears a yellow soccer jersey, plays K.K. Samba in his home, and has a home in <em>New Horizons</em> based on a soccer pitch. His Japanese name, Zinho, may possibly be a homage to Ronaldinho, while his English name likely refers to a side effect of coffee consumption, referencing Brazil being the largest producer of coffee.</li><li> Pekoe, a cub who resembles a panda, looks like an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeChineseGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeChineseGirl">Anime Chinese Girl</a>, has a very Asian-looking home, and is even on the cover of Imperial K.K. (a Chinese-style song by K.K. Slider).</li><li> Vladimir, a cub with a stereotypically Russian name whose catchphrase, &#147;nyet&#148;, is the Russian word for &#147;no&#148;.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureLover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureLover">Nature Lover</a>: Leif. He detests weeds and offers weed-pulling services once he is partnered with the Nooklings (T.I.Y.). On Grass Day he hands out flower-themed furniture for pulling weeds.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nephewism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nephewism">Nephewism</a>: The Nooklings to Tom Nook, depending on which story you agree with (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteToons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChasteToons">Chaste Toons</a>).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie">Never Say "Die"</a>: Actually averted, which sticks out in such a childlike E-rated game. When Sable discusses her life story as she opens up to you, she doesn't dance around saying her parents died when she was young. In most other cases, the actual term is avoided (the owl Blathers says "cross my heart and hope to molt," for example), which leaves more of an impact when Sable uses the terms "die" and "death" directly.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>: After the <em>Welcome amiibo</em> update, this became an option in <em>New Leaf</em>. If the player chooses to start a new town after putting enough effort into their previous town, Tom Nook will offer to buy the old town, depositing a large number of Bells into the new character's bank account to speed things up. Players may choose to receive the money gradually instead of all at once, which includes interest as a bonus for choosing that option.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a>: Lloid the Gyroid is an incredibly nice guy who's more than happy to help you with equipment or public works projects. He tends to end sentences with chummy phrases like "my special friend" and "my wondrous buddy".</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoAntagonist">No Antagonist</a>: Unless you view Nook as a greedy bastard, no one is really against what you try to do. Though Crazy Redd is closer to being a villain, he's outright admitted to being a sleazy crook, and Lyle in <em>Wild World</em> is implied to be his scamming partner with a "Forgery/Insurance" ring.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobodyPoops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobodyPoops">Nobody Poops</a>: There is no requirement to use the toilet, and a lot of the villagers don't have toilets in their homes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCartoonFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCartoonFish">No Cartoon Fish</a>: While most of the characters are depicted to be as cartoony as possible, nearly all the fish, bugs and sea creatures are depicted as realistically as possible (the only possible exceptions being the dab and olive flounder, who have googly-eyes). There are also frog and octopus villagers, which are just as cartoony as the others.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">Noodle Incident</a>: Whatever happened that caused the fallout between Tom Nook and Crazy Redd, as mentioned in <em>Happy Home Designer</em>:<div class="indent"> <strong>Tom Nook:</strong> I worked with a fox once in my life. Never again. Not after...the incident.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFairCheating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFairCheating">No Fair Cheating</a>: In a few ways:<ul><li> Earlier games discourage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a> by having Mr. Resetti chew you out any time you quit the game without saving. His speeches berating you for doing such an act get longer each time you do it, and eventually he'll force you to write an apology as well! He's mandatory until <em>New Leaf</em>, where he accosts you the first time, and can only continue if you build a Reset Surveillance Center- which actually is something of an inversion, as you don't get the option of building the Reset Surveillance Center until you've reset at least once!</li><li> Time traveling, the act of manually setting your system clock ahead or back to take advantage of certain features, is heavily discouraged. Along with turnips automatically rotting, setting the clock too far ahead or back at once can result in wilting of trees and flowers, cockroaches in your house, and villagers moving away. In <em>New Leaf</em>, your villagers will also tell anyone who visits your town that you're quite a time traveler.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFlowInCGI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFlowInCGI">No Flow in CGI</a>: This is presumably the reason why all hairstyles are either short or tied-up, and why all dresses only go down to the knees (and even then, they're stiff as if they've been starched). It's finally averted in <em>New Horizons</em>, which features longer dresses and hairstyles that sway and bounce appropriately. Also, some items may react with semi-realistic physics near each other, such as clothing on the drying rack swaying when near a fan.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHuggingNoKissing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHuggingNoKissing">No Hugging, No Kissing</a>: Despite being a life simulation game, there are absolutely no relationships, besides rumors and Pelly, Phyllis, and Pete's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a>. However, later games in the series have implied and explicit marriages, like Kapp'n and Leilani or Reese and Cyrus. What few relationships actually occur is between members of the same species, or never goes any further than a one-sided crush (Isabelle's toward the Mayor and K.K. Slider)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIronicClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIronicClown">Non-Ironic Clown</a>: Pietro, a clown sheep villager introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossingNewLeaf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossingNewLeaf">New Leaf</a></em>. Earlier there was Pierre the cat, who was exclusive to the <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry.

However, she uses the standard cat body model.</li><li> Coco has a Gyroid face, doesn't change facial expressions, and uses ceramic-like texture for her skin. It's implied she's a living <em>haniwa</em> statue like a Gyroid.</li><li> Zipper T. Bunny. His design looks far more like a cartoon mascot costume than any of the other characters, including a zipper on his back. Which he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial">assures the player isn't a costume, and is in fact his normal appearance.

It's a very common ocean fish, not worth a lot, and the player says "Not again!" whenever one is caught from <em>Wild World</em> onward. In <em>New Leaf</em>, the gag begins after the first catch, with the player saying "What, you again!?" whenever it happens.</li><li> Ever since the two were introduced in <em>Wild World</em>, player characters have trouble distinguishing a dab from an olive flounder, as pointed out in the text for catching them (more so with the latter).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveGameLimits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveGameLimits">Save-Game Limits</a>: Technically, you're never supposed to have more than one save file, to facilitate the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocializationBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocializationBonus">Socialization Bonus</a> inherent in the game's concept. In actuality this has become more stringent owing to the technical aspects of saving on each system &mdash; in the original game you could have as many towns as you had memory cards that could fit them; in <em>Wild World</em> and <em>New Leaf</em>, there are no memory cards so you have to get another copy of the game in order to have multiple towns (and need two DS systems to have the towns interact); <em>City Folk</em> and <em>New Horizons</em> save directly to the system and don't allow you to copy the file to an SD card (or cloud save, for <em>New Horizons</em>) so you'd have to get a separate console to have more towns in the same house.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a>:<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a>.

If you do reset the game (by dropping out to the Home Menu, pressing the Reset button on the console, etc.) without saving, expect him to come by and give you an earful, and at one point in all versions, even feigns deleting your save game!</li><li> In <em>New Leaf</em>, Mr. Resetti was made an optional feature, resetting the game the first time will prompt him to appear and suggest the Reset Center as a Public Works Project (so you actually need to do this once to get it). <em>New Horizons</em> outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Autosave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Autosave">autosaves</a>, so Resetti's role has been switched to rescue helicopter operator (he resets your position if you get stuck).</li><li> In <em>New Leaf</em>, there's a form of save scumming known as "The Villager Reset Trick". On a day you think a villager will move in to set up a plot of land, you need to create a new save file (loading an old one will make the game save and lock the location, which may not be ideal). Once you've gone through making a new player character, you can scout around to see if they've set up their plot in a location you like. If they didn't, reset and make a new save file. If they chose a location that you like, you can set up your house location and save the game from there. Then you can delete the save file and the villager will move into the right spot. Of course, there will now be a bare spot...</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareChord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareChord">Scare Chord</a>: Some piano chords would play if something bad happens, like if you shook a tree and a beehive drops or if your house is filled with roaches.

In the English versions of <em>City Folk</em> and <em>New Leaf</em>, the characters read the text in speech bubbles one letter at a time, which is sped up and slightly garbled. This is because unlike Japanese, where each kana glyph neatly maps to a syllabic sound (such as "da", "o", "ke", or "tsu"), languages written using the Latin alphabet (including and <em>especially</em> English) use phonemes and thus require letter sequences to be analyzed and mapped to specific sounds, taking extra computational power in the process.</li><li> They had a different sort of sound and were a little less garbled in the original English game, and some sentences can even luck their way into being audibly intelligible. When saving your game, for example, your Gyroid really does sound like it's saying "Please enter the house."</li><li> In <em>Wild World</em>, Animalese appears to sound like generic gibberish; it is unknown if the game is reading out the text with a text-to-speech program like in other games or if it genuinely uses gibberish. <em>Wild World</em> changed the sound of Animalese to be more like the Japanese version of Animalese.</li><li> There's also a second "language" called Bebebese that can be selected up until <em>New Leaf</em>; it sounds like a series of generic text-scrolling noises rather than any specific language. When Animalese is selected, Bebebese is used for a character muttering or whispering, as well as the snowmen and the human character speaking to themselves or reading signs.</li><li> The speech sounds in <em>New Horizons</em> have been updated to sound more like babbling, but NPCs may have their catchphrases spoken audibly like Tom Nook's "oho" and "yes," or Blathers's "Hoot".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotTheImposter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotTheImposter">Spot the Imposter</a>: <em>New Leaf</em> adds two examples:<ul><li> On April Fool's Day, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBlank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBlank">Blanca</a> appears and will take on the form of one of the villagers, leaving the player to guess which is the correct one.</li><li> Crazy Redd's art works are on display before you buy them, and the forgeries have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImposterForgotOneDetail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImposterForgotOneDetail">noticeable difference</a> with the real art.

The island minigames in <em>New Leaf</em>, as well as <em>New Horizons</em> incarnations of the Bug-Off and Fishing Tourney are also timed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>:<ul><li> <em>Wild World</em> is implied to take place after the original games. Blathers mentions how he couldn't identify fossils in the past.</li><li> It's implied that <em>New Leaf</em> takes place a few years after <em>City Folk</em>&mdash;Tortimer and Shrunk have retired (the former from his post as mayor to host tours on the island, and the latter from his job as a comedian to open a nightclub), Katie is now old enough to travel on her own, Kapp'n is married and has a toddler-aged daughter, and even Kicks appears to have aged, now owning a shoe store and occasionally addressing the player as if the player is younger in the coffee barista minigame. Tommy and Timmy seemed to have matured to the point that not only do they not need Tom Nook to supervise them, but are fully capable of handling the store with only one of them at a time. They seem like assertive teenagers compared to the shy little kids in previous games.</li><li> This is also the case with <em>New Leaf</em> to <em>New Horizons</em>, as more series mainstays have retired and passed the torch to newcomers: Joan's stalk market is handled by her granddaughter Daisy Mae, Chip's fishing tournament is now run by C.J. (implicitly "Chip Jr."), and the Bug-Off is now handled by Flick rather than Nat. Isabelle has resigned from her work as the Mayor's secretary to assist Tom Nook on the island, with her "prior experience" being explicitly mentioned.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a>:<ul><li> The term players use for setting the system's clock just to do different events and holidays on the same day.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme">Used in-universe</a> in <em>New Leaf</em>.

Originally you had to dig the raw fossils out of the ground, mail them off to be identified, then get them back to give to the museum. The later games simplify this by simply allowing you to take them straight to Blathers to be identified right away. A similar thing goes on with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMarket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMarket">Redd's art sales</a> in the earlier games (with the exception of the first, which lacked forgeries); while you know what you're buying, until <em>New Leaf</em> (which gives forgeries differing appearances), you have no way of knowing whether the painting/statue you just bought is real or fake until you try to donate it to the museum.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">The Unfavorite</a>: Judging from her letters in the GCN version, your mother doesn't like you very much.

There are reports of people having to restart their towns after not playing for several months due to bamboo effectively trapping the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> inside their house without an axe. This is changed in <em>New Horizons</em>, as bamboo shoots now only grow underground.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a>:<ul><li> The first game (originally for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64">Nintendo 64</a>) got a couple on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube">Nintendo GameCube</a>, with the first of the two being released internationally and the Japan-only seconding Japanese players access to things added to the international release with some extras. Incidentally, at least the first of the two ended up not using much of the GCN's larger storage, as they turned out to be direct ports of the Nintendo 64 version with added features &mdash; the entire game is loaded into RAM around the time the Nintendo logo fades out the first time, and can be played without the disc after that.</li><li> <em>New Leaf: Welcome amiibo</em> was released in late 2016 and adds features like new items and villagers, as well as amiibo support. Unlike the GameCube rereleases, however, owners of the vanilla version can update to this version by downloading a free update from the eShop, with the standalone release being intended for players who didn't previously own the original version of <em>New Leaf</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VagueAge">Vague Age</a>:<ul><li> Your neighbors: They're old enough to be living on their own, but the various birthday messages they get say things like "One step closer to being an adult!" Although this could just be sarcastic humour. About the only characters with even an <em>implied</em> age are the "Cranky" animals, who are at least suggested to be a bit older than anyone else.</li><li> Joan. She claims to have been selling her turnips 'round these parts for <em>over</em> sixty years. Assuming she was maybe fifteen when she started her business, she must be pushing the high end of the 70s when you start the game. She's probably an octogenarian in most established games. In <em>New Horizons</em>, she's retired and her granddaughter Daisy Mae has taken over. Even she's a bit vague; her design and runny nose imply that she's <em>very</em> young, but she's traveling on her own to run the Stalk Market.</li><li> The protagonist themselves. They look prepubescent (though that could be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticAge">Artistic Age</a>), but have moved out and are implied to be at least teenage. The fourth generation makes their appearances look older, and also has them working full-time in all future games (as mayor in <em>New Leaf</em>, at a home agency in <em>Happy Home Designer</em>, and as a Resident Representative in <em>New Horizons</em>).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VariableMix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VariableMix">Variable Mix</a>: The hourly themes have unique variants for snowy days, the cherry blossom festival (in the first generation only), and rainy days (starting in <em>Wild World</em>).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash">Vendor Trash</a>:<ul><li> <em>Everything</em>, mostly, but the most truly Vendor Trash-y items are the mushrooms which grow in the fall in the original, as they literally serve no other purpose. Mushrooms in <em>City Folk</em>/<em>Let's Go to the City</em> and <em>New Leaf</em> serve a similar purpose, though there's actually a reason to pick them in that they sometimes turn out to be special Mushroom-themed furniture that can only be found this way. The fruit in every game is like this as well, but in the original, it <em>did</em> serve one other, arcane purpose&mdash;for use in the Animal Island mini-game.</li><li> Most Bunny Day items in <em>New Horizons</em> were treated this way by the player base, since they sold for 400 bells per component egg (double the egg's selling price) and no one really wanted them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic">Verbal Tic</a>: The various "neighbor" animals; you can even give them new phrases, bucko. Permanent NPCs occasionally have this trait as well (with the exception that their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic">Verbal Tics</a> can't be changed), with the owl siblings, Blathers and Celeste saying "hoo" and "hootie-toot," respectively, and Brewster, the pigeon coffee shop clerk in the basement of the museum the owls work in, tending to say "coo" often. Tom Nook also tends to say "yes, yes" and "hm?" often, but unlike the previous examples, this is unrelated to his species. However, he and Timmy and Tommy share "oho!" as their tell-tale laugh, which is likely due to him training them as businessmen.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCaringPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCaringPotential">Video Game Caring Potential</a>: It's hard not to care when your villagers refer to you with such <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateNickname">Affectionate Nicknames</a> as "Cupcake" and "Powderpuff". There are also their joyous reactions when you give them what they asked you for.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">Video Game Cruelty Potential</a>:<ul><li> You can push your neighbors into holes or hit them with a butterfly net or an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAxeToGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAxeToGrind">axe</a>, deny them medicine when they're sick, let garbage stack up all over town without pulling weeds, and send rage-inducing mail in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeetLingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeetLingo">L33t L1ng0</a> or a foreign language. You can also teach them insulting or embarrassing things to say... you will never, EVER be punished for it either. Unfortunately, this also doesn't affect a neighbor's likelihood to move away. Later games seem to at least have ignoring them or hitting them make them more likely to leave, though it can still take quite some time.</li><li> You can release fish into any body of water, no matter where they would normally be found. This means you can put a freshwater fish into the ocean, and vice versa. Where the cells of the fish will shrivel up/burst and most likely be fatal, causing a slow and painful death for the fish. For an E-rated game... that's pretty damn cruel. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Unless it's a Sea Bass.</a></li><li> You can also do the same with insects, such as releasing a flea into a body of water and watch it immediately drown. Even if you aren't releasing them, you can chase them into the water by running close to them to make them flee.</li><li> <em>New Leaf</em> introduced the Toy Hammer, which can be bought at the Island Shop. Despite rarely showing up, it serves no other purpose outside the minigame you use it in, other than to smack your neighbors or friends senseless.</li><li> <em>New Leaf</em> also gives the player a box of Setsubun beans that can be thrown at people &mdash; even when it isn't even Setsubun. There's nothing stopping you from throwing limitless handfuls of beans at your neighbors just for the fun of it, or throwing them at fish to scare them off.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPunishment">Video Game Cruelty Punishment</a>:<ul><li> If you jerk the medicine away from sick villagers, it's positively heartbreaking at times, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">cranky</a> villagers especially being a <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a>.</li><li> In <em>New Leaf</em> villagers may ask you to bring them fruit. Usually when you are giving something to a villager for an errand, irrelevant items in your inventory are grayed-out and unselectable, however for fruit errands you also have the option of giving bugs. If you do try that, the villager will either comment on how unappetizing the bug is or that it's not a fruit and give it back to you, with no reward. A much nastier scenario can occur if you decide to give them rotten fruit. They eat it none the wiser (because it looks exactly like perfect fruit on the outside) until it's too late. They get angry at you for trying to feed them garbage and give you a good yelling before walking off in a huff with no reward.</li><li> If you push around the villagers too much, they'll eventually tell you off for it and be depressed or angry for a while afterwards. The same can be said with hitting a villager with a net repeatedly. Normal villagers, for example in "New Leaf", will start crying after they're hit with a net three times and then be sad afterwards.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGamePerversityPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGamePerversityPotential">Video Game Perversity Potential</a>:<ul><li> Blanca. Said guest shows up in your town either faceless and asks you to give it a face, or walks around with a face that the game downloaded from Nintendo's servers (but allows you to change it) if internet connectivity is available. Now, the game doesn't perform checks to see if you really did draw a face onto Blanca instead of random scribbles (or worse, offensive images). Also, what you draw on Blanca inadvertently gets uploaded onto Nintendo's servers if the console has Internet connectivity. And apparently, Nintendo doesn't do random sampling checks on the faces uploaded into their servers, and there is no way to report offensive images. Hilarity ensues.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note19wm2');"><sup>Protip&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note19wm2" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note19wm2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Turn off Blanca visits in the game if you're giving it to a kid.</span> Thankfully, Nintendo finally caught on and removed this aspect of the game in <em>New Leaf</em>, which gives Blanca a completely different role.</li><li> Making a design at the tailor with offensive content in mind, and hope that a NPC buys clothing with said design on it. It's even possible to "nude" an NPC by making a shirt using the NPC's skin color as the base and adding the usual things you would see on a bare chest, be it male or female. Hilarity ensues also.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense">Violation of Common Sense</a>: The only way to catch bees/wasps in all of the games is to anger a beehive/wasp nest and swing your net at the flying bees/wasps coming to sting your sorry ass. You somehow only catch one of them but this causes the rest of the bees/wasps to flee. Try this in real life and see how well it goes for you.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualPaperDoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualPaperDoll">Virtual Paper Doll</a>: In the original, you can buy both pre-made clothes and design your own clothing patterns. In <em>Wild World</em>, you can change your hairstyle and hat, while masks and other accessories were added into the mix. <em>City Folk</em> made it so you could change your shoes, and wear a Mii's face as a mask. In <em>New Leaf</em>, clothing was separated into tops, bottoms, dresses, socks, and shoes; additionally, it's no longer gender-locked, allowing males to wear skirts and dresses and females to wear shirts and pants. <em>New Horizons</em> goes even further by allowing the player to freely customize their character's face and skintone, and no distinction is made between genders (now referred to as "style", which can be changed at any time).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisibleSigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisibleSigh">Visible Sigh</a>: The "Deep Sigh" emotion.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalDissonance">Vocal Dissonance</a>:<ul><li> The Snowtyke of the Snowman family uses the Peppy voice, despite being a male too. Although, this may be because Snowtyke isn't at the point where his voice matures. Timmy and Tommy similarly have normally female voices, but are also half the height of anyone else and are likely still children.</li><li> Some villagers have species/personality combinations that can cause this. Boone is a big, hulking gorilla villager colored to look like a mandrill, but speaks in the same high-pitched voice all jock villagers speak with. Then there's Hamphrey, who looks like a cute little hamster, but speaks with the same baritone warble used by all cranky villagers.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalEvolution">Vocal Evolution</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakingSimlish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakingSimlish">Animalese</a> sounds different in each entry of the series:<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64">Nintendo 64</a> original and its various re-releases, Animalese is somewhat high-pitched, but is much deeper in the English version for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube">Nintendo GameCube</a>.</li><li> In <em>Wild World</em>, Animalese is noticeably higher-pitched in English, sounding like the Japanese variant of it; it also sounds more like gibberish in this game, rather than synthesized speech.</li><li> <em>City Folk</em> offers a combination of the original games' Animalese and <em>Wild World</em>'s, being higher-pitched but still discernible.</li><li> <em>New Leaf</em> takes <em>City Folk</em>'s version of Animalese and adds the gimmick of it varying in pitch based on a character's personality, much like how certain NPCs throughout the series<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note116eyd');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note116eyd" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note116eyd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Joan, Farley, Luna, and (in <em>New Leaf</em>) guest player characters</span> feature uniquely pitched voices.</li><li> <em>New Horizons</em> builds off of <em>New Leaf</em>'s Animalese, with a somewhat softer tone.

Exactly the thing many players wished to save by resetting the game for better results.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarmHeartedWalrus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarmHeartedWalrus">Warm-Hearted Walrus</a>: Wendell is a friendly walrus who loves art, and travels far and wide selling his artwork. When he comes to the player's town, he is so worn out and hungry that he will gladly give you patterns (used to decorate clothes, walls, and other objects) in exchange for some food!</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeBuyAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeBuyAnything">We Buy Anything</a>:<ul><li> Tom Nook, naturally. He doesn't technically <em>buy</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishingForSole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishingForSole">the garbage you might fish up</a>, but he will take it off your hands for free.</li><li> In <em>New Leaf</em>, you can sell your items to either Reese at Re-Tail or the Nooklings' shop. The Nooklings don't take everything, though, and give you 20% less than Re-Tail does for things they do take. You can also sell items to Kapp'n's daughter, but she only buys them at 5% of their normal value. Additionally, there are certain items you can't sell to Reese, who will instead make you pay a fee to dispose of them (or you can dispose of them in a garbage can for free).</li><li> In <em>New Horizons</em>, Tom Nook specifically mentions that Timmy will now accept absolutely anything including trash and weeds, lampshading that it's not the kind of business decision <em>he</em> would make but there might be merit to it anyway.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a>: Kaitlin, Katie's mother, is absent in <em>New Leaf</em>.

Although he <em>will</em> express his annoyance about you not letting him finish his song. Tapping the touch screen has the same effect. Kapp'n even pretty much says "Taptaptap!! Cut it out!"</li><li> If you refuse to take Katie to another friend's town, the poor girl will look like she's ready to start crying for her mother.</li><li> Make a snowman by putting a bigger snowball on top of a smaller one, and you'll get a Snowtyke that is none too happy about how it turned out:<div class="indent">Huh?!

From the beginning, some clothing items (such as the Sailor Uniform) that seem to be made for one gender have been openly available, though for most of the series the clothes would be altered based on the character's gender (boys would always wear clothes as shirts, girls would always wear them as dresses). <em>Wild World</em> and all games released afterward allow you to unlock the ability to have either gender's haircuts after you get your hair cut enough times, <em>City Folk</em> adds the ability to wear either gender's shoes, and the 3DS game simply makes skirts, dresses, pants, shirts, and shoes different kinds of items rather than altering clothing based on gender. So it's possible to start a game as one gender and eventually work your way to the point where the only way to tell the character's true gender is to look at their face (which may not help, since some faces are gender-neutral, and are able to be covered up), or the color of their ID card (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinkGirlBlueBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinkGirlBlueBoy">Pink Girl, Blue Boy</a>, naturally). They even facilitate it by altering the character's running style based on their clothes&mdash;if a boy is wearing a dress, they'll still do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlyRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlyRun">Girly Run</a>.

Sometimes he makes attempts to overcome his fear of bugs, such as opening the insect encyclopedia and forcing himself to touch every picture of a bug in it. Thankfully, his sister Celeste put a stop to his self-torture, telling him to just accept himself for who he is.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox">Wide Open Sandbox</a>: A relatively small one compared to most games of this genre, considering that all the games take place entirely in a tiny village, but the lack of endgoal and emphasis on doing whatever you want means the series still falls into this genre.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WindmillScenery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WindmillScenery">Windmill Scenery</a>: When donating 1,000,000 Bells to the City Hall in <em>City Folk</em>, the player can choose to build a decorative windmill on the town's peninsula (if they don't chose the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighthousePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighthousePoint">lighthouse</a> instead). The windmill returns in <em>New Leaf</em> as a Public Works Project.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WintryAuroralSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WintryAuroralSky">Wintry Auroral Sky</a>: The series is a big offender of misplacing northern lights: in both <em>City Folk</em> and <em>New Leaf</em>, auroras can appears several times during the cold winters, even though if the summer is to be believed, the town's climate is nowhere near polar.<ul><li> In several games, a shooting star named Wishy sometimes shoots through the night sky, and one can make a wish by pressing the A button fast enough. If successful, the player receives a letter from Wishy the next morning with a rare item inside.</li><li> <em>New Horizons</em> changes this to instead have star fragments appear based on how many shooting stars the player wished upon. There is always at least one, but the actual number received is somewhat random. A player could wish on 40 shooting stars and get anywhere from 15 to 25 fragments of varying size.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkOffTheDebt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkOffTheDebt">Work Off the Debt</a>: The games tend to downplay this as part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTutorial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTutorial">Justified Tutorial</a>. When you arrive with not nearly enough money on-hand to pay off your home, Tom Nook hires you as a part-time worker. However, once you've completed all of the odd jobs he had yet to get to, in spite of the end result being not nearly enough to pay off the whole loan, Nook lets you loose anyway, trusting that you'll get the money to him eventually.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfFunnyAnimals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfFunnyAnimals">World of Funny Animals</a>: With the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHuman">Token Human</a> (visiting friends notwithstanding).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair">You Gotta Have Blue Hair</a>: Justified; having your hair done at Shampoodle includes being able to dye it another color, natural or not.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveResearchedBreathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveResearchedBreathing">You Have Researched Breathing</a>:<ul><li> Laughing? Frowning? Waving your hand? You'd have to learn these emotions through Dr. Shrunk. In <em>Wild World</em> and <em>City Folk</em> you could only have four of them at a time and would have to forget one if you want another. Fortunately, you get to keep all of them in <em>New Leaf</em> onwards, with the last one you unlock being Dr. Shrunk's trademark dance. In <em>New Horizons</em>, you learn them randomly from villagers instead, though you get a basic set of "starting" emotions the first time you do.</li><li> Some of the unlockable Public Works Projects in <em>New Leaf</em>. You can build things like street signs and face-cutout standees right from the get-go, but public trash bins and drinking fountains are unavailable until suggested by villagers.</li><li> Some of the DIY recipes in <em>New Horizons</em>. For example, the DIY item "coconut juice" is basically a cut-open coconut with a straw in it. You can't make one until you get its DIY recipe. Special mention also goes to the Cardboard set, whose furniture items are basically piles of cardboard boxes, some with a flap or two taped upright to form backrests or armrests - all of which cannot be made until you acquire the relevant DIY recipe.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeanXmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeanXmas">You Mean "Xmas"</a>:<ul><li> Toy Day, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube">GameCube</a> version and <em>New Leaf</em>; in <em>City Folk</em>, the day is officially referred to as "the night Jingle comes to town", and referred to with a variety of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism">Unusual Euphemisms</a> by various characters.</li><li> Less literally, Easter is referred to as Bunny Day outside of Japan.
