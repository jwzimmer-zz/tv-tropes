It came bundled the <em>Dead Man's Switch</em> campaign. The second DLC campaign, <em>Dragonfall</em>, was later released as a standalone game with additional content and features. <em>Hong Kong</em> was released exclusively as separate game, with a short sequel campaign entitled <em>Shadows of Hong Kong</em> released later.

The Kickstarter was a huge success, hitting several stretch goals, with lots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Feelies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Feelies">Feelies</a> for backers and the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">Downloadable Content</a> pack (set in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Berlin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Berlin">Berlin</a>) included for free.

It takes place in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Seattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Seattle">Seattle</a> in 2054. In it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">you play</a> a down-on-their-luck Shadowrunner investigating the death of their old buddy Sam Watts in exchange for a substantial payday and/or personal vengeance.</p><p><em>Dragonfall</em>, released on February 27, 2014, sees <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">you</a> end up in Berlin, a.k.a. the Flux State, a utopia of anarchy where power shifts like the tides of the ocean. When what appears to be a milk run (slang for a quick and easy job) goes south, you and your new crew find yourselves drawn into a conspiracy surrounding the Great Dragon Feuerschwing, who rumors suggest survived her supposed death.</p><p>An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> of <em>Dragonfall</em> entitled <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.pcgamer.com/2014/08/17/shadowrun-dragonfall-directors-cut-coming-next-month/">Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> was released on September 18, 2014 for PC, Mac, and Linux. The update includes, among other things, new art assets as well as entire new missions, which really ended up taking <em>Dragonfall</em> outside the scope of "DLC" and made it more a full-blown sequel running on the same engine. Citing developers like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher">CD Projekt RED</a> as inspiration, the team behind <em>Shadowrun Returns</em> decided to release this update free for original backers and owners of the original <em>Dragonfall</em>. The update is also sold as a standalone product on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam">Steam</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GOGDotcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GOGDotcom">GOG</a>.

It was the setting of the third campaign. It <a class="urllink" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/webeharebrained/shadowrun-hong-kong">was funded through Kickstarter<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and released on August 20th, 2015. The campaign has you travel to Hong Kong in the year 2056 to reunite with your estranged foster family, only to be forced underground and into the dangerous world of shadowrunning. And of course get involved in a conspiracy involving your missing foster father and an infamous slum whose preternatural decay seems to be literally infecting the surrounding city.</p><p>Changes from the previous two campaigns include enhanced player controls and sound, animatic scene transitions, revamps to the Matrix and more options for cyberware and magic, making this, once again, a full-blown sequel. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue">Playable Epilogue</a>, <em>Shadows of Hong Kong</em>, was released on February 5, 2016 through the free <em>Extended Edition</em> update. <em>Shadows of Hong Kong</em> is set a few weeks after the end of the original campaign. In it, you and your team now have the opportunity to turn the tables on the corporate police force that once hunted you.</p><hr><h2>This game contains examples of:</h2><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirVentPassageway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirVentPassageway">Air-Vent Passageway</a>: Unlike the tabletop game, they're <em>all</em> too small for Shadowrunners. Not too small for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone">drones</a>, though...</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a>: Downplayed; there's no total magic immunity, but Adepts can learn Magic Resistance, which gives increasing levels of Cover against spells.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryHeadcountLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryHeadcountLimit">Arbitrary Headcount Limit</a>: You can usually only bring three other runners with you at a time, sometimes less. While it makes sense for the teams to stay small, it's especially noticeable in <em>Dragonfall</em>, where the total crew size (counting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a>) is five, meaning one person always has to sit out in every run. This gets even worse in <em>Hong Kong</em>, as you can have up to five teammates, meaning two members would sit out each mission. Asking those that didn't go on the last run about their opinions on it has them pointing out that they didn't go along, and possibly mentioning what they did in the meantime.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack">Armor-Piercing Attack</a>: In addition to the changes to armour in <em>Director's Cut</em>, there are now attacks that can degrade or ignore armor.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact">The Artifact</a>: Mercenaries. In <em>Dead Man's Switch</em>, hiring other runners was the only way to have any sort of backup on a run. They're still around in <em>Dragonfall</em> and <em>Hong Kong</em>, but the presence of a crew in those campaigns who can be brought on for free diminishes their usefulness.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance">Artificial Brilliance</a>: Improving on the below stupidity was a design goal for <em>Dragonfall - Director's Cut</em> that gets pushed back to the main game as well. Harebrained implemented a custom AI scripting scheme they call GumboScript that allows for AI agents to be adjusted by the designer for combat behavior, with the stated goal that they "not look dumb". For the curious, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/SheridanThirsk/20141105/229495/Cooking_Up_Gumbo_The_Evolution_of_TurnBased_AI_in_Shadowrun.php">Harebrained has written a piece on Gamasutra about it.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimbs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimbs">Artificial Limbs</a>: As in the source material, if you have the Nuyen and don't care about the magic penalties, there is nothing stopping you from getting chromed up.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimbsAreStronger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimbsAreStronger">Artificial Limbs Are Stronger</a>: Certain pieces of cyberware and bioware will boost your base attributes and/or offer you new abilities like spitting acid, reloading guns without spending AP, a guaranteed dodge, self-healing, or a special blinding attack, and with enough ranks in Cyberware Affinity (<em>Hong Kong</em> only), can boost them above what would normally be possible for your race, which can do things like give a chromed-up troll to have as much as 18 strength or an chromed-up elf to have 16 quickness and bonuses to their ranged combat and dodge skills.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Artificial Stupidity</a>:<ul><li> The enemy is reasonably smart in certain areas; they'll throw grenades at clustered player groups, know to use cover (most of the time), and tend to go for their special abilities when they can. However, much of this behavior depends on playing by their rules. The AI can be drawn into a turkey shoot through a simple strategy: hide all your people behind a corner, have one runner aggro the enemy, then run back to your corner and set everyone to overwatch. One by one, the enemy will file in to their almost certain deaths, and you'll get away with barely a scratch to show for it. It's not always a viable strategy, but it works for a lot of encounters.</li><li> The enemy has no concept of friendly fire and will gladly grenade their fellows if it means hitting your runners.</li><li> In <em>Hong Kong</em>, the enemy is incapable of recognizing when a character has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeHotPotato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeHotPotato">Magnet Arm</a>, and will fall for it several times in one round if conditions allow.</li><li> The AI is consistently terrible at dealing with pincer attacks. In responding to one side the enemies will make no consideration about how they are exposing their backs to attack. It is not uncommon to see enemies try to put distance and cover between themselves and your characters on one side, and in doing so run right next to your other characters on the opposite side. The AI never does maneuvers like retreating in a group towards a third direction so it can put up a unified front.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone">Attack Drone</a>: Riggers can control various attack drones. The Rigger loses one Action Point per drone as long as they're active, but the drones have their own Action Points. Drones can use their smaller size to do things like navigate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirVentPassageway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirVentPassageway">Air Vent Passageways</a> to flank enemies. They are a formidable force in the hands of a competent Rigger.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Autosave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Autosave">Autosave</a>: The game was criticized for only having autosaves (which are done whenever a new area is loaded), as the engine didn't originally support manual saves. Manual saves were added with the v1.2 patch.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>:<ul><li> The Adept's Chi Onslaught grants you three attacks on a target with increased <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit">Critical Hit</a> chance, but requires a whopping 3 AP to use. 2 AP is the default at the start of the game and you only get three after passing a certain point in the storyline. It also has a lowered hit chance.

This is partially because bright colors read well seen from a distance on a moving screen, but they also fulfill a stylistic function.

By selecting a weapon skill then using Overwatch to define a cone of vision, the user will automatically retaliate against any enemy which crosses their line of sight within the effective range of the weapon it is used with. The player must have enough AP to use the skill in question before triggering Overwatch. The idea is to position the character in such a way that they cannot be attacked without triggering Overwatch and damaging the assailant.

Summoning requires two skills instead of one, meaning twice the Karma cost, plus a one-time use summoning fetish which costs ten times the nuyen of a grenade or about half a drone (which is multi-use). The end result is a character who spends all his karma and nuyen to summon an actually <em>useful</em> character for three to four rounds of combat, albeit a rather powerful and versatile one, when any given mission has at least two or three combat encounters, many of which last far longer than the few rounds the spirit lasts. This is especially bad in <em>Hong Kong</em>, where money is extremely tight compared to the previous two campaigns. The same can be said for deckers that specialize in ESPs, but this isn't quite as bad since those cost less, are reusable, and multiple decking sequences in a run are rare.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit">Critical Hit</a>: This is based on how much Karma points you spend on your combat skills.

Further mitigated in <em>Hong Kong</em>, where the new "Cyberware Affinity" trait provides players with additional essence points.

Since the amount of karma you need to spend on a skill is equal to the next level of that skill, it becomes increasingly difficult to level up specific skills, making it tempting to branch out and grab the low-hanging fruit instead. This spreading out of skills, however, can make things difficult in the late game, which often require either high-level checks or significant combat investment.

Some examples:<ul><li> There is no Stun damage, you just get stunned from having negative AP. This makes the game more similar to other computer RPGs.</li><li> There are no initiative passes, so turns are simply done team-by-team, with each combatant having action points.

Some special locations may summon special or unique spirits as an added bonus.</li><li> In tabletop, the difference between Hermetic Mages and Shamans is in the stats they use to resist drain and which spirits can be used for combat. This was simplified so that there is no difference between mages and shamans in <em>Shadowrun Returns</em>, and all spirits are usable as combat spirits.</li><li> And in a collision of the above two points, characters who can conjure spirits can conjure Toxic Spirits, which in Tabletop are not conjurable by <em>either</em> Hermetic Mages or Shamans, but only by the separate traditions of Toxic Shamans and Toxic Mages... because with the system it uses for spirit conjuring and the decaying urban environments that dominate the game, sometimes the only plausible spirit conjuring point on a map is a pile of garbage or pool of toxic waste. <em>Hong Kong</em> dealt with this point by removing such instances. Any free summon is now a normal spirit.</li><li> Instead of having constantly on powers that are bought with Karma, Physical Adepts buy 'chi powers' for money that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HourOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HourOfPower">function like spells with a limited duration that only target the adept</a>.

Since the game uses archetypes instead of classes, there's nothing preventing a Mage or Shaman from having as many hit points as a Samurai character. The only real disadvantage that casters have is that installing cyberware will force them to cast spells less frequently, making defensive upgrades like Dermal Plating of dubious value.

Each time they are given AP, they have a chance to break free of the summoner's control, dependent on the amount of AP given on that turn (up to four) and how much AP they've been given previously. If they do break free, they are no longer bound to the summoner, so they won't die when the summoner does, and are hostile to everything on the field. Players can exploit this by making sure their summons are right in the middle of the enemy formation at all times. If the summon goes rogue, at least it's harassing them instead of you.

This is a departure from the Charisma score checks that you encounter earlier in the level. Also, the distraction which is created on this floor can only divert attention away from one of the two Matrix jack-in points. If you want to be thorough on this floor, you have to fight no matter what.

To deactivate them, the player has to play a timed minigame with two steps. The first is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimonSaysMiniGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimonSaysMiniGame">"Simon Says" Mini-Game</a> using a numberpad. Each successful repeat (up to nine) adds time to the clock, with the sequence increasing in length from four to seven for the final attempt. Messing it up subtracts a bit of time and the sequence is changed. The player can skip to the second step at any point during this, going back to complete it if they need more time. The second step has the player pick the right sequence of symbols out of a list. A display at the top will periodically flash pieces of the sequence. More time means the player can wait longer for the whole sequence to show up. Failing scrambles the sequence and has a bigger time penalty. The deck and programs the player is using can provide a bonus to the time available. If the player triggers the alarm, the Blocker IC turns into a regular enemy the player can kill to bypass.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a>: In addition to the returning Platelet Factory bioware, <em>Hong Kong</em> introduces the Cross Dermal Sheath, which heals 6 HP per turn for three turns when activated.
