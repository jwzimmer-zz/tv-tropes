It's quite easy to get lost down there if you don't watch your Pip-Boy map or mind the routing signs and subway maps at the stations, and if you're actively looking for another location when you get into them, <em>good luck</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality">Acceptable Breaks from Reality</a>:<ul><li> Even with the advanced (in spots) technology of the 2070s, it's pushing it to believe that the various office buildings, sewers, and underground bunkers mostly still have functioning lights, plumbing, gas mains, and ventilation. To say nothing of turrets, (some) terminals, robot recharging stations, and the robots themselves who are ticking along nicely despite 200 years without maintenance. What makes it acceptable is that otherwise, robotic enemies and working computers would be very rare, while the interiors of numerous areas would be very dark.</li><li> Apparently all monsters, even the ones that lack the digits, height, and/or higher intelligence to operate doors, can do so. Acceptable because otherwise the player could escape from a troublesome fight against non-human enemies just by running into a room and shutting the door.</li><li> When reloading guns that load from magazines, any bullets left in the current magazine remain in the normal ammo count, as the various alternatives to preserve realism would be a pain for players to cope with.</li><li> Bringing up your Pip-Boy stops time. Of course, having the world keep going in real time while you look at your Pip-Boy would make the game much harder.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb">Action Bomb</a>: A <em>Broken Steel</em> endgame perk, Nuclear Anomaly, turns <em>you</em> into one, sort of.

The teacher, Mr. Brotch, quietly mutters "Well I'll be damned, that little so and so...wish I'd thought of that when I was sixteen."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a>:<ul><li> US President (and head of the Enclave) John Henry Eden is quite charismatic, polite, and has a very calming, gentle voice (by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MalcolmMcDowell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MalcolmMcDowell">Malcolm McDowell</a>). He's also a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">genocidal supercomputer</span>.</li><li> Allistair Tenpenny, who is one of the nicest and most polite characters in the game.

To note:<ul><li> The Fat Man launcher fires miniature nuclear warheads. Its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">unique variant</a>, the Experimental MIRV, is a weapon that can fire <em>eight</em> mini-nukes at once. Problems: There's a limited number of mini-nukes (seventy-two in the entire vanilla game, with a handful more added by the expansions), and the toughest bosses in the game take two to three hits at most to kill with a regular Fat Man. Further, firing this weapon will very likely blow up the wielder along with the target. Overkill much? Fire it once for the "cool value," then sell it or stick it in a locker and never use it again.</li><li> The Minigun is useless in VATS, goes through ammo like a sieve, is too bulky to carry as a backup, does rather weak damage for what it is, and cannot score critical hits. It also has a long windup sequence to get the barrel spinning, during which your target is free to attack you. It is only really useful at close range, and is outclassed by the Flamer which has equally high damage potential and fires instantly when you pull the trigger.</li><li> The Missile Launcher has a clip size of one and takes too long to reload between shots to use as a primary weapon, and doesn't do enough damage per shot against high hitpoint targets to warrant carrying as a backup. It is also useless in VATS at long range as it will often miss.</li><li> The only Big Gun that seems practical enough for regular use is the Vengeance Gatling Laser. However, spare Gatling Lasers to use for repairs are rare, it deteriorates extremely quickly, rarely ever scores critical hits, and it can go through ammo quickly if you aren't careful. Also, the only place where it's obtainable is a sanctuary filled to the brim with <em>Deathclaws</em>.</li><li> The Rock-It Launcher, an improvised device that uses the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash">Vendor Trash</a> you pick up as ammo. Generally useless junk like bent tin cans and coffee mugs become lethal weapons with it. It's quite a bit of fun to watch a super mutant killed by a teddy bear. But in terms of utility, it's not all that strong as the ammo still has weight and weighs you down, and thus it can't even be as useful as a simple assault or hunting rifle with weightless ammo. Fun to play with just for the novelty, but little more.</li></ul></li><li> Many small guns and energy weapons also have this problem:<ul><li> The Scoped .44 Magnum and Sniper Rifle both break down too quickly, ammo is relatively rare, spares for repairs are difficult to find, and are almost always in poor condition when found or purchased. This means you need to find several so you can repair them into a single pristine gun which starts deteriorating rapidly with every shot.</li><li> The Alien Blaster will vaporize any standard enemy with one shot, due to its 100% critical hit chance and high base damage. But it breaks down very quickly (and can only be repaired by certain NPCs for cash) and has such a limited ammo supply that it's almost not worth using. Its best value is for headshots at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Elite Mooks</a> in VATS where more conventional weaponry won't take them down fast enough. With the <em>Mothership Zeta</em> expansion, it becomes more practical and downplays the trope, as you can keep it repaired with items found aboard the ship and can acquire significantly more ammo.</li></ul></li><li> Melee weapons as well:<ul><li> In general, melee are almost always suboptimal for anything other than sneak attacks. Why? Because most enemies will be shooting at you from a distance, and the ones that don't (like Deathclaws) have even stronger melee attacks of their own and should be dealt with at range anyway. While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing">Min-Maxing</a> your stats and perks to do insane damage with the Shishkebab while investing in the best-quality armor, defensive perks, and combat drugs to help you survive until you reach your target is a viable (and fun) option, it's never going to work as well as plain old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a> small guns.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName">Jack the Ripper</a> takes the cake. It's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainSword">Chain Sword</a> with strong base damage that hits (read: gives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit">Critical Hits</a> a chance to proc) over 30 times a second and has a great <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass">crit rate</a>, chewing through high-level enemies like nobody's business. In fact, with 10 Luck, a Melee Weapons skill of 100, and the perks Finesse, Superior Defender, Ghoul Ecology, Better Criticals, and Bloody Mess it can tear through Deathclaws in <em>2</em> hits and Super Mutant Overlords (Super Mutants that are one [big] step away from Behemoths) in <strong>4</strong>. It also degrades in quality incredibly quickly and can only be repaired by cannibalizing the already-rare standard Ripper for parts or spending lots of caps at merchants.

With relevant perks and the proper-name version, <em>shotguns</em> can do more damage from a sneak attack than the Fat Man.</li></ul></li><li> Despite all the flashy Power Armors and gimmicky clothes littered around the wastes, the Combat Armor is what you'll end up wearing for the vast majority of the game. You can buy it from Craterside Supply, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">the first shop in the game</a>, after a short, randomly generated time period. So short, in fact, you might not even use the Leather Armor at all, of which the Combat Armor's damage resistance is higher than, not to mention near equal with the much heavier Metal Armor and Power Armors which take up inventory space, slow your movement, and, in the case of Power Armor, penalizes your ability to Sneak. The unique Reilly's Rangers combat armor has the best DR in the game excluding power armor, doesn't slow you down or impede your Agility/Sneak, and can be repaired with normal combat armor found on Talon mercs all over DC. It also gives some nice stat boosts.</li><li> Several skills qualify:<ul><li> Repair is one of the most practical. It allows you to combine items of the same type, adding their durability together so that your weapons and armor keep functioning. Necessary, but not particularly impressive as far as combat goes. Or is it? In fact, it is a serious force-multiplier. As an item's durability value increases, so too does its related function (well-repaired weapons do more damage, good condition armor offers more protection, etc.) This means that a player with good Repair skill can outmatch their opponents even when the opponents use ostensibly the same equipment, since the player has them in better quality. Furthermore, better condition pieces of equipment sell for more money, meaning that the player can transform several low-value items (which would be too heavy to carry all of) into fewer high-value items which are easier to carry back to a merchant.</li><li> The Barter skill gets you better prices at merchants, which doesn't sound like much, but can make the difference between scrounging in the trash for loot to sell, obsessing over maxing out your price to weight ratio just to keep your weapons repaired, and enough healing items to not die versus rolling in enough caps to buy everything you need as well as pimp out a penthouse apartment.</li></ul></li><li> Several perks qualify:<ul><li> The Strong Back perk lets you carry an extra 50 lbs in your inventory. Stop yawning! That's enough to slap on a suit of Power Armor and strap a missile launcher or two to the back while still having room for the rest of your loot.</li><li> The Educated perk gives +3 skill points per level, an extra 78 by the time you hit the level cap if you take it as early as possible.</li><li> The Comprehension perk gives you one measly extra skill point (skills max out at 100) when reading a skill book, which doesn't sound like much. Then you realize that there are <em>324</em> skill books to be found in the wasteland, and suddenly spending that same perk slot on any of the "+5 each to two different skills" perks sounds like a ripoff.

Their unique variants are another step up though still not "Infinity Plus One" weapons.<ul><li> The Terrible Shotgun has one of the highest DPS scores of all small guns, but it struggles at long-range due to its very high spread. It also suffers from low item HP, but combat shotguns to keep it repaired aren't a problem to find.</li><li> Ol' Painless, the unique hunting rifle. Higher damage, better rate of fire, a spread of 0 giving it perfect accuracy at 100 Small Guns skill, and it can be repaired by the standard hunting rifles found just about everywhere. Certainly worth the long, dangerous trek to the Republic of Dave early in the game to get it.</li><li> The Xuanlong assault rifle, the unique Chiense assault rifle, is easily found, you'll probably complete the unmarked side quest to spawn it during the early-game Galaxy News Radio quest, and it's easily repaired with plentiful basic Chinese assault rifles. It deals more damage than its standard counterpart and has a larger magazine size.</li><li> Sydney's 10mm SMG is acquired in the Mall, where the GNR quest takes you, and offers higher DPS and a larger clip over the basic 10mm SMG.</li></ul></li><li> A3-21's Plasma Rifle. Found at the end of a comparatively short questline if you know how to complete it, can be acquired as soon as you can reach Rivet City (read: as soon as you head to downtown DC), and deals plenty good damage. It hurts that plasma rifles to repair it are <em>very</em> rare until the Enclave arrives, but its innately high HP and repairing merchants can help with that.</li><li> Lincoln's Repeater. Good damage, low spread, great against unarmored targets, and found easily in the Museum of History which you can find early in the game. Uses rare ammo, but that's what merchants are for.</li><li> The humble double-barreled shotgun from <em>Point Lookout</em>. It has to be reloaded between every squeeze of the trigger, but anything within ten feet of it will be blown to bits.</li><li> For melee characters, a fully-upgraded and perked-out Shishkebab is only out-damaged by one other melee weapon (and even that mostly only on paper), and the initial, still-very-powerful-for-the-early-game model can be assembled using easy-to-find materials and a schematic from a traveling caravan or early sidequest.

It's one of the best energy wepaons in the game for close-range engagements, though at long range that ridiculous spread is going to suck.</li><li> The unique gatling lasers, Vengeance and the precision gatling laser. Vengeance offers higher damage a shot, the precision variant offers higher critical hit chance. Both slice enemies up real good.</li><li> The Alien Blaster. 100 damage a shot, fires rapidly, and always scores a critical hit. It has <em>very</em> rare and limited ammo, though, only a few hundred in the base game, with the add-ons adding a few hundred more, so you'll have to be picky about using it. The unique variant, the Firelance, is only found through a random encounter, but with the Pyromaniac perk is essentially the Alien Blaster with higher damage and an effect to set enemies on fire for even more damage over time.</li><li> MPLX Novasurge, found in <em>Mothership Zeta</em>. 80 damage a shot, low spread, decent critical multiplier, and uses plentiful energy cells as ammo. Its low HP and clipsize (8 shots at a time) hurt, but it hurts enemies a lot more.</li><li> Most any of the alien weapons in <em>Mothership Zeta</em>, owing to high damage, low AP cost, no spread, and plentiful ammo after completing the add-on. The unique variants of the weapons, the Atomic Pulverizer and the Destabilizer, are naturally just better versions of the already great basic weapons.</li><li> The Gauss Rifle, found at the end of the <em>Operation: Anchorage</em> add-on. Only gets off one shot before you need to reload, but that's usually all you need - it has great damage, a scope, no spread, and on a critical hit knocks enemies down.</li><li> The Tesla Cannon, handed to you at the end of <em>Broken Steel</em>.

For players who really want to do <em>everything</em> in the game, there is one location that is nearly impossible to actually discover: Vault 87. Even though you go to Vault 87 as part of the storyline, you don't actually discover it on the map because you enter it through Little Lamplight. The entire area around Vault 87's door is fiercely irradiated. Even if you have 10 endurance, the best radiation suit in the game, Rad-X in effect, and all the perks that raise radiation resistance to as high as it can possibly be, you can receive a lethal dose of radiation within 5 seconds well before you even get close to the spot. This means that you need to stockpile on Rad Aways, as you'll be consuming 3 or 4 of them to drop from down to zero Rads literally every 3 or 4 feet while attempting to get closer. Also, don't even think about using fast travel to <em>escape</em> from the area after you discover it.

Tenpenny Tower has an exclusionary "no ghouls" residence policy, but being around Roy (a ghoul) for five minutes will clearly show you that he is every bit as a racist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> as the tower residents. Even if you work out a peaceful solution that will allow Roy and his ghouls in, Roy will eventually turn on the human residents and have them all killed. Sometimes you will meet people who cannot be swayed in their mindset or personal beliefs. But unfortunately, unlike every other evil character in the game, killing Roy will net you <em>negative</em> karma and the local DJ <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">will admonish you over the radio for it</a> because he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter">convinced that Roy is the real victim in this situation</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity">you are guilty of a cold-blooded racist "murder"</a>.

Aside from a young boy living there, the inhabitants aren't exactly pleased by the situation and feel those fights (The Mechanist has robots armed with machine guns and missiles, while The AntAgonizer controls giant ants) are much more dangerous for them than The AntAgonizer was initially. In other words, that how the muggles would probably feel in any setting where superheroic vigilantes are active.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealIsBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealIsBrown">Real Is Brown</a>: Or gray, if you're in D.C. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> since the region was nuked to within an inch of its life.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">Really 700 Years Old</a>: Most of your allies in <em>Mothership Zeta.</em> Justified as they spent most of it frozen with the oldest of them being a Edo-period <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Samurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Samurai">Samurai</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReluctantMadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReluctantMadScientist">Reluctant Mad Scientist</a>: John Malleus, the head researcher of Vault 92.

However, Malleus' audio logs reveal he had no idea what was really going on, he thought only a percentage of the populace was being subjected in a controlled environment he was observing and the suggestions were for harmless things like making them fix their hair or scratch their ears, gradually working up to implanting complex commands. It was the <em>Overseer</em> who had the noise filtered through the vault loudspeakers to affect everyone and drove them to violence, and Malleus was trying to get things under control and was horrified when he found out the truth.

Skill books are found all the time (there's 25 of each in the whole game, for a total of 25 free skill points, 50 with Comprehension) and +5 to a skill isn't worth the waste of a perk when you can just wait for another level up.</li><li> Swift Learner: +10% experience for each level, but there's an infinite amount of experience available. Even worse is "Deep Sleep", which lets you get the "Well Rested" bonus for +10% exp from any bed you sleep in, meaning it's like Swift Learner, but you need to sleep in order to get the benefits, and those benefits only last a limited time.</li><li> Any perk that affects how you handle radiation. Rad-Away to remove radiation and Rad-X to increase rad resistance are plentiful and nothing any anti-Rad perk does is worth the lost perk slot to save a few hundred caps.</li><li> Impartial Mediation: +30 to Speech skill at neutral karma, but remaining at neutral is tedious. Speech challenges can be exploited for a 100% chance of success, either through save scumming or maxing out the speech stat.</li><li> Chem Resistant lowers the chance to become addicted to chems. Just go visit a doctor when you're done what you're doing and spring 50 caps for him to cure you. Additionally, due to the way the game handles addiction chance, it's not foolproof anyway.</li><li> Animal Friend: Normally-hostile mammals become non-hostile. You can go for a second rank to get them to help you in combat, but they aren't usually that tough or annoying enough to be worth getting the perk.</li><li> Mister Sandman and Cannibal. The former lets you stealth kill sleeping people and the latter lets you eat corpses for healing, but they can glitch and cause entire settlements to turn hostile.</li><li> Mysterious Stranger: He'll occasionally show up in VATS to provide a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> to any enemy, but he can glitch up, anything he kills doesn't provide you perk or quest-related benefits, and he has a low chance of appearing at all. Besides, his chances of appearing are totally random and don't take the threat level in consideration. Which means he's just as likely to appear and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> that full-health <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingMook">Super Mutant</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Behemoth</a> you just engaged in VATS, as he is to casually waltz in and blow to shreds a half-dead Mole Rat you were too lazy to manually snipe yourself.</li><li> Night Person and Solar Power give you stat boosts depending on the time of day. The only worthwhile benefits of either perk can be replicated at any time by popping some chems.</li><li> Here and Now: Level up again instantly. Wasted perk slot due to the fact that infinite experience is available, the perk only functions at level up when you take it.</li><li> Master Trader: 25% discount buying anything, but most items aren't that expensive anyway and there's an infinite supply of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash">Vendor Trash</a> to loot from enemies.</li><li> Computer Whiz and Infiltrator: Can try to hack a terminal you get locked out of / pick a lock you broke. Save scumming fixes both problems, and specifically, Computer Whiz can be nullified by just logging out and back in to refresh your hack attempts, while locks never break unless you force the lock, which you never need to do.</li><li> Nerd Rage!: You gain a bonus to strength and damage resistance, but only when you're on death's door (Health &lt; 20%), making it far too tedious and fragile for actual use.</li><li> Concentrated Fire: +5% accuracy for each action in V.A.T.S. targeting the same part of the same enemy. Only useful for guns with low AP costs because you usually only get two-four attacks, maybe five or six with AP increasing chems.</li><li> Explorer: All map markers are revealed, but not counted as "discovered" so you can't fast travel to them, you just know they're there. The Pip-Boy has a compass that directs you to all nearby map markers as soon as you exit the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedTutorial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedTutorial">Forced Tutorial</a>, and any time you need to go to a location, it's usually marked on your map for you anyway.

Only available in Broken Steel, which causes Dogmeat('s Puppy) to have ridiculously high HP so he'll likely never die anyway. Useful only for the follower exploits.</li><li> Devil's Highway / Escalator to Heaven / Karmic Rebalance: Instantly sets your Karma to very evil, very good, or neutral. Karma is easily adjusted by theft, murdering respawning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPCs</a>, and donating to churches.</li><li> No Weaknesses: All SPECIAL stats below five increase to five: not bad in the unlikely case that you haven't used bobbleheads or Intensive Training to make it irrelevant, but made moot with the Almost Perfect perk (available just a few levels later) which raises all SPECIAL to at least nine.</li><li> Warmonger: Instantly get all weapon schematics to level three. Just find the schematics. Besides, only the Nuka Grenade and Bottlecap Mine really benefit from being level three by boosting the amount of items crafted, everything else just comes made with better condition, in which case just craft two and use one to repair the other.</li><li> Nerves of Steel: This is simply glitched. It's supposed to increase AP regeneration, but only by a rate of one per <em>minute</em>, while AP can usually regenerate from empty to full in half that. Even if it did work, useless since by the time you can get it, you probably have Grim Reaper's Sprint which fully restores AP when you kill something in V.A.T.S.</li><li> Nuclear Anomaly: At twenty HP or less, you lose all your radiation, your health rises to twenty HP exactly, and you create a small nuclear blasts where you're standing. Although it's an amusing gimmick, anything that could drive you to under twenty HP at level thirty is probably going to be dealing <strong>more</strong> than twenty damage per hit, the blast re-irradiates you, damages your clothing, often cripples your limbs, damages any friendly NPC in its radius, and occasionally it glitches up and fails to provide the healing; causing you to kill yourself.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">Utopia Justifies the Means</a>:<ul><li> John Henry Eden wants to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kill off every mutated human (read: 95% of the population) in the Capital Wasteland as he believes it is the only way to save it</span>.</li><li> In <em>The Pitt</em> DLC, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the leader of the slave-driving Raiders in the ruins of Pittsburgh is trying to resurrect Pittsburgh as a functioning, producing city, with the intention of ending the use of slaves... eventually.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VasquezAlwaysDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VasquezAlwaysDies">Vasquez Always Dies</a>: Averted, as none of the obvious targets die plotline deaths.

There are also ghouls that have survived since the Great War bomb drops, one of which says that her interesting story is somewhat boring.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponJr">Weapon Jr.</a>: The tutorial has the player learn to shoot with a BB gun on their 10th birthday.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRuleTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRuleTogether">We Can Rule Together</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a> President Eden suggests that there may be a place in the Enclave for the Lone Wanderer, perhaps even replacing Colonel Autumn as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">dragon</a>, if they agree to help Eden implement his Final Solution. Nothing ever comes of it, though, for two important reasons; 1) even if you don't destroy Eden yourself, in <em>Broken Steel</em> Liberty Prime will level Raven Rock, either destroying Eden or burying him under a few thousand tons of rubble. 2) Despite being raised in a Vault, the Lone Wanderer is descended from Wastelanders, so Eden's FEV turns out to be fatal to him/her as well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a>:<ul><li> The Vault 101 Overseer. He seems sour and unfriendly most of the time, but if you read his entry in his terminal, he really wished to have the vault residents lead a peaceful life and didn't proceed with Vault experiments.</li><li> Just about everyone in Canterbury Commons believes The Mechanist is doing more harm than good. While he's sincere about protecting the town, it's agreed that his heavily-armed robots are doing a lot more damage than the Antagonizer's mutated ants.</li><li> The Enclave. They're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">essentially Nazi's</a>, though their goal to restore America and humanity is respectable. Their methods certainly are not.</li><li> The adults of Andale. They're just trying to make a stable food supply and home for themselves. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Unfortunately, that involves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">relying on murdering people for food</a> and mass incest.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Mission</a>: <em>The Waters of Life</em>. Specifically, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the point when its revealed that not only are the Enclave still active despite the events of <em>2</em>, but they also intend to forcefully take control of Project Purity for their own sinister ends.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a>: Depending on your actions, you can get quite a few of these.<ul><li> Dad gives you one if he finds out you destroyed Megaton.</li><li> Three Dog will call you out almost any time you take the "evil option" in a given mission.</li><li> In <em>The Pitt</em>, you can also choose to deliver words along these lines to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Wernher</span> when you learn of his complete plan.</li><li> You get called on this if you kill the Overseer during your escape, or if you kill him in the sidequest "Trouble On The Homefront." If you kill the original Overseer and also the second one, Amata will accept the latter as self-defense, but you'll still get a lot of "what have you done?" from everyone else.</li><li> In the ending, Sarah Lyons will give you a lot of sass if you insist that she make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> rather than doing so yourself. The narrator will also do so in the ending voice-over, even if you send in one of two possible radiation-immune followers (which is easily the most logical choice).</li><li> In <em>Broken Steel</em>, if you choose to target the Citadel after reaching the Satellite room in the Mobile Base Crawler, upon landing back at the [now destroyed] Citadel, the Brotherhood of Steel will immediately find out that it was your doing. They will then declare you a traitor in their eyes, and will shoot you on sight.</li><li> A more subtle one happens if you kill Three Dog, as his DJ segments on GNR are replaced by a very unenthusiastic and bitter technician who talks about how "some asshole killed our DJ."</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">What Measure Is a Non-Human?</a>:<ul><li> A recurring theme.

The Enclave plan to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">use the modified FEV to kill all "meta-humans" with even the slightest degree of mutation</span>.</li><li> Three Dog often says "Ghouls are people too", which can either be ignored by the player or not, but even he admits that Feral Ghouls are dangerous to everybody, going so far as to say <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">"So kill as many as you damn well please"</a>.</li><li> The Replicated Man quest is about an android, and both his pursuer and "helper" give reasons on why or why not he's human.</li><li> Subverted at least once, though; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna">Moira</a> is convinced that Mirelurks must have a complex underwater society. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They don't.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark">What You Are in the Dark</a>: The main character has a Karma meter to track this, and it doesn't care whether there were any witnesses. The trope is also applied to a <em>lot</em> of the evidence you find of peoples' last moments in the Great War - evidence of selfishness, or tragedy, or heroism.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhileRomeBurns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhileRomeBurns">While Rome Burns</a>: Dukov and his two party girls spend every day huddled inside a building doing nothing but drinking, partying, getting high, and having sex. The fact that they are almost completely defenseless and surrounded by super mutants and other monsters is something they choose to simply ignore. It helps that Dukov is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass">Retired Badass</a> whose reputation as a mercenary was known to even Alistair Tenpenny.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox">Wide Open Sandbox</a>: The player is free to explore anywhere after leaving Vault 101.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears">Wise Beyond Their Years</a>:<ul><li> Most, if not all, of the residents of Little Lamplight. Their doctor, their merchant, their defenders...all are children no older than 15.</li><li> The Lone Wanderer him/herself. The character is <em>nineteen</em> during the Vault 101 escape, and some of the technical things expected of the character (such as disarming a nuclear bomb) would ordinarily not be entrusted to a nineteen-year-old.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl">Would Hit a Girl</a>: Colonel Autumn makes his character clear when he murders an unarmed female scientist in cold blood the first time you see him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstNewsJudgementEver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstNewsJudgementEver">Worst News Judgement Ever</a>: Three Dog of Galaxy News Radio talks about the player character and <em>only</em> about the player character. There are precisely two news stories in the entire game that aren't directly related to you or your father. This makes sense most of the time, as the player tends to do things that are noticeable enough to be considered newsworthy, but some of the things he reports on are less than noteworthy - he even does a story about you finishing a fetch quest involving collecting soda bottles for a strange woman out in the middle of nowhere. This is lampshaded with "Christ, talk about a slow news day..."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstWhateverEver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstWhateverEver">Worst. Whatever. Ever!</a>: An unmarked quest relating to the Citadel's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeatGrinderSurgery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeatGrinderSurgery">malfunctioning medical robot</a> is called <em>"Worst. Doctor.

Such as when you use a couple hundred mines to send a Behemoth Flying into the sky. The game tends to exaggerate the ragdoll physics more in VATS, so critting a Super Mutant with the Victory Rifle can cause them to go tumbling into the air because the weight of their own limbs pulled them into it while still in VATS.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench">Wrench Wench</a>:<ul><li> Moira Brown, Megaton's resident tinkerer and merchant.</li><li> A female Lone Wanderer with a high Repair skill qualifies.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenByTheWinners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenByTheWinners">Written by the Winners</a>: A terminal in the <em>Operation: Anchorage</em> DLC mentions that General Chase was constantly changing the Anchorage simulation until it was largely divorced from the reality of what actually happened out there.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy">Wrong Genre Savvy</a>: Both the AntAgonist and The Mechanist believe they are in a superhero comic... you can complete a quest by convincing them that they're not. In the AntAgonist's case, she's so far out of touch with reality that she believes she's living the <em>Grognak the Barbarian</em> comic of which she is based off of.</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder6');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tropes X-Z&nbsp;</div><div id="folder6" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantGoHomeAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantGoHomeAgain">You Can't Go Home Again</a>: Following the tutorial, you are forced to leave Vault 101 and go into the wasteland after your father escapes while the paranoid Overseer plans on killing you as a scapegoat. Later, the mission "Trouble On The Homefront" allows you to return to the Vault, which has fallen into chaos, and help sort things out. Of course right afterwards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard">you are told to leave</a> and this time you can't ever return (Although you can soften <em>that</em> blow, as you do have the option of forcing <strong>everyone</strong> out of the vault with you by sabotaging the environmental controls.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">You Have Outlived Your Usefulness</a>:<ul><li> If you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">tell Colonel Autumn the correct code for the purifier</span>, he will thank you and kill you, resulting in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver">Non Standard Game Over</a>.</li><li> A pair from <em>Point Lookout</em>:<ul><li> If you choose to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">side with Professor Calvert to kill Desmond, he will reward you with "The greatest thing any human could ever hope for", which is to say...

After you accomplish the mission and look at the extraction information, it's revealed that Chinese intelligence felt silencing the spy would be far easier than recovering him, so they arranged a booby-trap involving an irradiated room.</span></li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveResearchedBreathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveResearchedBreathing">You Have Researched Breathing</a>: You can get meat from anything from a dog to a giant bug, but you need the Cannibal perk if you want fresh human meat. Feral ghouls (and Swampfolk in Point Lookout) will occasionally carry around steak-shaped slabs of human, however. Justified in that taking a more active role in cannibalism is a major life choice.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMakeMeSic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMakeMeSic">You Make Me Sic</a>: The terminals in the LOB building reveal that the company is carrying out illicit weapons research for the Chinese, and the management fear the place inevitably being stormed by the government. A final email reading "MAN THE DOORS!

However, if you score a critical hit to their head, it will explode a few moments later. They don't even see it coming. The instruction manual the slaver gives you even says that it hasn't been fully tested yet, and a random side effect was that occasionally pressure builds up in the subject's head and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology">it explodes.</a></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal">Your Mind Makes It Real</a>: Tranquility Lane and the Anchorage Reclamation Simulation both use a biofeedback network that will lead to real death from virtual shock.
