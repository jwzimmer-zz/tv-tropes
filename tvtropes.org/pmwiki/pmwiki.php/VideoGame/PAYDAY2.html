A playable beta was released on July 24th, 2013 for players who pre-ordered the Steam version of the game. The game proper was released worldwide in 2013, on August 13th for Windows via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam">Steam</a>, August 16th for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360">Xbox 360</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3">PlayStation 3</a>, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UNIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UNIX">Linux</a> getting a port on March 21st, 2016. In June 2015, the "Crimewave Edition" was released for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxOne">Xbox One</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation4">PlayStation 4</a>, including all DLC content from the Steam version up to the Dragan character pack and the Bomb Heists, with a "Big Score" edition coming later on September 7th, 2016, including the rest of the DLC up to the end of 2015, a "Most Wanted" edition releasing in 2017, containing all of the DLC released up to July 2016, and a "Master Plan" edition released later in 2017 including content up to May of that year.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The game follows the same crew of hardened criminals &#151; Dallas, Chains, Wolf, and Hoxton &#151; who have moved on to bigger and better heists in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WashingtonDC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WashingtonDC">Washington, D.C.</a> and the surrounding area. This wasn't the case initially, due to a complicated situation involving the original voice actors being replaced. After fan outcry, the voice actors returned, save for Chains (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">who remained the same character in-story</a>) and Hoxton (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeUpMySword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeUpMySword">who was replaced in-story by Dallas's brother</a>). Eventually, the original Hoxton was brought back to the fold through a prison break, and his replacement was renamed "Houston" to avoid confusion.</p><p>Like its predecessor, <em>PAYDAY 2</em> involves hitting a target for huge cash bonuses, and carries <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">a lot of similarities</a>: guys in clown masks, tropes and ideas borrowed from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaper">heist movies</a>, and core mechanics that mirror the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a></em> series. Rather than having swappable classes, the game uses a more refined character class system; you spend skill points to level up different class trees that contain different abilities, allowing you to mix-and-match abilities. Supplementing class skills are perk decks that grant passive abilities (including four perks shared across every deck, like slightly higher headshot damage, and slightly faster movement while wearing armor, and five unique perks for each deck, like health bonuses for having hostages, regaining some health by killing enemies, moving faster, and having faster armor regen at lower health, etc.) that are applied to the player and sometimes the rest of the crew. The game also contains weapon mods that allow players to tweak and customize weapons as they wish for optimal performance, as well as customizable masks that have different materials, patterns, and colors.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>In addition to the game, Overkill Software created a promotional mini-series, simply called <em>PAYDAY: The Web Series</em>, which consists of six episodes (averaging at about 10 minutes each) based on the game. The series showcases the main characters in action while also showing minor characters that play a role in the overall story arc, or what kind of people they are. The series was produced and directed by Demian Lichtenstein, who also directed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeThousandMilesToGraceland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeThousandMilesToGraceland">3000 Miles to Graceland</a></em>, and was co-produced by Overkill Software. The series can be found for free on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Youtube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Youtube">Youtube</a> as well as several other websites.</p><p>The game had five DLCs planned, until Overkill's publisher 505 Games gave several million dollars in funding to ensure content and support for the game for the next 20 months. The successful beta test from the community had the developers release the first DLC, Armored Transport Heist, for free towards anyone who pre-ordered the game. The game is also receiving continued updates every few weeks, which as of Ultimate Edition, includes free content and bug fixes.</p><p>Especially of note is that, as a thank you to the community, free bonuses were released for the series' third anniversary: dubbed <a class="urllink" href="http://www.overkillsoftware.com/crimefest/">CrimeFest<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, the content is available to everyone enlisted in the <a class="urllink" href="http://steamcommunity.com/games/218620">official Steam group<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, with each reward given for passing member milestones before the anniversary. As reward for getting over 1.5 million members five days early, several major upgrades were released (some <em>still</em> ongoing). Furthermore, on October 25, it was announced that Overkill would be partnering up with their friends at Lion Game Lion, an independent studio that branched off from their company, to produce <em>another</em> series of new heists.</p><p>Like its predecessor, the soundtrack can be found on Steam as downloadable albums of <a class="urllink" href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/254260/">the game OST<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and the <a class="urllink" href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/267381/">GO Bank Christmas singles<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Almost all of the music can be heard via the in-game jukebox for free (provided you own the core game), and several can be heard for free on <a class="urllink" href="http://overkillsoundtracks.bandcamp.com/album/payday-2-official-soundtrack">the PAYDAY Bandcamp page<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and composer <a class="urllink" href="http://simonviklund.com/">Simon Viklund's site.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></p><p>2017 was a big year for the game - in April, <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/852287046303358976">it was announced<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> the game would be getting ported to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Nintendo Switch</a>, with the port releasing in February 2018. It was also announced the following month that the PC version of the game would be rebundled into the "Ultimate Edition", removing the need to separately buy its overwhelming amounts of DLC; said edition retails for $45, far less than the normal cost of all the DLC combined, with the bonus that anyone who already owned the base game and any amount of DLC can simply upgrade to the Ultimate Edition for a much-reduced price, close to the equivalent of the typical 75%-off sale for whatever DLC they don't own. On top of that, Overkill later revealed that the PC version would be getting support for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HTCVive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HTCVive">HTC Vive</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OculusRift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OculusRift">Oculus Rift</a>, bringing the entire game to VR and allowing for cross-platform play with non-VR players.</p><p>And finally, between December 2017 and November 2018, the game would see its seemingly final year of content updates spread across four events, which tell a new story arc revolving around an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIlluminati" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIlluminati">Illuminati-esque</a> secret society known as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Kataru.</span> OVERKILL had stated that they still planned on continuing to support the game until some point in 2019, but it was unclear what this entailed and when exactly support would end, especially with the issues surrounding Starbreeze at the time and the disaster <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OverkillsTheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OverkillsTheWalkingDead">their Walking Dead entry</a> had created.</p><p>In October 2019, however, OVERKILL released a statement that confirmed that the game would continue full development. Alongside it was the announcement that DLC would be available individually again, and the Ultimate Edition being replaced by the Legacy Collection. As for new content, OVERKILL willingly noted that they were breaking the free content rule they had instated by adding new paid DLC, but had also stated that free content updates would continue as well.</p><hr><h2>PAYDAY 2 provides examples of:</h2><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-F&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyHighLevelCap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyHighLevelCap">Absurdly High Level Cap</a>:<ul><li> Firstly, players can attain a maximum level of 100, and levelling slows to such a crawl that even Death Wish heists will provide only a fraction of XP than that of the later levels.

For example, in Watch Dogs, you can throw the bags into the water (netting you an achievement for the first one as well), but doing so will respawn them back at the truck where you started. Rather than taking a bag past an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleWall">Invisible Wall</a> or over an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsurmountableWaistHeightFence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsurmountableWaistHeightFence">Insurmountable Waist-Height Fence</a>, in this case cops will simply take the bag to a location which puts as many of them between you and said bag(s) but is still within the playable boundaries of the level to allow the player a chance to cut through them and retrieve it.</li><li> In the Transport heists, you need to secure a minimum amount of loot bags, with the exact amount depending on the difficulty. The game will always spawn enough trucks in with enough loot so that, even if you blow open all of the trucks with C4 (which destroys 3 of the boxes in the truck when you do it, potentially depriving you of some loot), you will still have enough potential loot left over to succeed.</li><li> Advancing to the next tier of infamy resets all your skill points, but as compensation, after the first Infamy level you can unlock bonuses which reduce the amount of points needed to advance to the next tier in two skill trees (Fugitive and another of your choice - and the latter part stacks, so by Infamy 5 you get permanent point-cost reductions for all five trees). Those bonuses also give a multiplier to experience points gained from heists so you can level up again faster. Perk decks are completely unaffected by going infamous, only unspent points are removed (so you can keep them by simply pouring them into a perk deck), and weapons are only locked behind their usual level requirement - you can immediately use it again once you reach its required level, no money needed to unlock a gun you already own or reattach whatever attachments you left it with.</li><li> Lower-level players are normally barred from hosting maps on Overkill or a higher difficulty until they have reached a certain level, so that they can take the time to learn the games' mechanics and (hopefully) have someone around to help them out. After you've accrued enough infamy levels, upon a reset you can instantly jump into higher difficulties to make the grinding to later levels easier. The trade off is this allows a player who just went infamous to get back dozens of levels, allowing him to jump start his next infamy level much faster.</li><li> Getting shocked by a Taser will have your current weapon instantly reloaded so that you can have a fighting chance to break free. Interestingly, The developers <em>tried</em> to remove this in the Day 3 update for the Hoxton's Housewarming Party event in 2016, only to end up having to put the mechanic back in the very next day after it broke other gameplay elements. Bolt-action rifles and other single-action weapons will also rechamber/recock themselves for you, even though visually both your arms are outstretched and probably waving about like limp noodles.</li><li> Many of the skills are designed to be this. Without any skills, you usually have to wait anywhere from one to <em>seven</em> minutes for a single drill to finish doing its job, even longer when you consider it will jam multiple times, sometimes not even <em>three seconds</em> after you fixed it previously. It's either that or trying to lockpick the object in question (which takes a long time, and sometimes isn't even an option without a very-high-level skill). Then there's moving the bags around, which can be downright hell if you're alone and have no skills to buff it. With the correct skills, drills finish noticeably faster, sometimes restart themselves after a jam or be restarted by you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PercussiveMaintenance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PercussiveMaintenance">smacking them with your melee weapon</a>, you can pick a wider variety of locks, including safes, in under a minute, bags can be quickly moved all around the map (either carried faster or thrown a few dozen feet at a time), and at times you can break open shortcuts that you would otherwise not get access to (especially with C4 and the Saw). However, by the time you've acquired these skills, you'll have moved on to higher difficulties, where waiting around outside of stealth is no longer an option.</li><li> The one saving grace from being kicked down by a Cloaker is that it doesn't count towards your down counter before getting into custody immediately. Depending on the skillset of whoever revives you, you could get around half your health back on Normal, Hard and Very Hard. This, however, does not apply on Overkill or above, where the most health you can get after being revived is about 25%.</li><li> All Infamy levels come with an experience bonus, although some come with a bigger one than others. This is to help with the level grinding back to 100 for those that went infamous, as it can be a chore otherwise. By Infamous level 20 or so, your Infamy EXP bonus alone is usually the same, if not higher, than the total amount of exp you would have gotten from the heist itself (even after all other bonuses have been applied). Overkill also gave a month of extra EXP to players during the Infamy 2.0 update, to jumpstart people's leveling.</li><li> The ability to intimidate police into surrendering, which acts like a normal hostage in heists where there are only a small handful of or even no civilians to take hostage, though it takes more effort to take police as hostages, and with other skills you can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">convert them to fight for you</a>, and can be traded between waves to bring back incarcerated teammates.</li><li> If a player holding a mission critical item leaves the game (keycards, C4, meth ingredients, etc.), the items are transferred to another player so that the mission isn't unwinnable. The Meth ingredients, upon Rats' Launch, wasn't stackable per-player until a later patch fixed the issue.</li><li> If there's only one player not in custody, or the player is solo without AI teammates, Cloakers can't use their instant down attack, to prevent cheap game overs.</li><li> In Hoxton Revenge, the FBI boss will always be relatively close to where the panic room is. This reduces both the distance the boss needs to be moved (if you are attempting the heist in stealth, and the room requires a retinal scan) and the time needed to find the panic room (if you find the boss first).</li><li> Captain Winters will not appear in offline play due to being very hard to tackle in co-op, let alone one man player and bots without advanced tactics, even more so when playing alone.</li><li> Playing offline since summer 2017 allow you access to AI exclusive perks that can be managed via the Crew Management menu.

The game also had a level limit penalty by reducing EXP gained on heists that are above your level, but it was changed to have the EXP gained be scaled to your level.<ul><li> The game's early single day heists <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3ubu4');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3ubu4" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3ubu4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Variants on Bank Heist, Diamond Store, Framing Frame Day 1, Four Stores, Jewellery Store, the Transport heists (except Train), Ukrainian Job, Rats, and Nightclub</span> include an escape sequence if you finish them loud instead of in stealth, forcing you to secure your loot and to not farm a level over and over. The chance of an escape generally seems to be linked to the total completion time. If you take more than a certain amount of time to complete a heist, then you probably won't get an escape sequence even if you do the job loud.</li><li> The booster system also discourages grinding the same levels by reducing your EXP gains while boosting gains for playing levels you haven't been playing. It was possible to have a 100% penalty, but that was only if you did nothing BUT play one specific job over and over. Patch 35 tweaked the boosting system by limiting it to 15% max while making penalties capping out to only 30% so that players aren't punished too heavily if they want to play specific heists multiple times.</li><li> Players gain more experience for retrieving more loot bags from a job rather than just more money, meaning that to get the maximum rewards, players will need to play the job as skilfully as possible rather than finishing their objectives as quickly as possible and sprinting to the exit with one or no bags. Alternatively this means that players can do the Rats, Cook Off, Santa's Workshop, and White Xmas jobs for hours on end if they're well prepared, as it's possible to receive well over a thousand loot bags for these jobs, which in turn means it's possible to level up <em>far</em> more than intended.</li><li> Previously, doing missions in Stealth would often grant a stealth bonus, which boosts the next contract's EXP bonus by a certain percentage. This led to many people doing missions only in stealth because not only is it easier to complete objectives, but you get more experience for it in the long run. The experience system revamp instead made it so that, while you still get a multiplier for your next heist after completing one in stealth, you also get more experience now if you do a heist loud, to encourage players to continue with a heist if it goes south instead of grinding the same stealth missions over and over again and restarting every time the alarm sounds, just for the bonus EXP.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless">Armor Is Useless</a>:<ul><li> A major reason for the Armor vs Dodge debate is because, without specific skills to boost your armor's effectiveness, it's not quite as good as it needs to be, especially on Mayhem and above. This is not helped by the fact that higher detection risk, which heavy armor adds a lot to, makes the cops able to accurately hit you from longer ranges, whereas a Dodge build will <em>legitimately</em> be dodging bullets past certain distances because the low detection risk makes the cops incapable of aiming accurately from there.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">Defied</a> by the Anarchist perk deck, which turns even a <em>two-piece suit</em> into a human tank suit, though at the cost that your health underneath that is reduced by slightly more than half. The idea is that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack">so long as you keep killing enemies,</a> the armor bar and health bar won't budge all that often.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack">Armor-Piercing Attack</a>:<ul><li> If the player aces the Surefire skill, then the armor of the tan Law Enforcers may as well not be there, since ranged weapons will be guaranteed to pierce it.</li><li> There are plenty of options for dealing with Shields that don't involve flanking them. Aside from their weaknesses to explosions and fire, a player can shoot them with a sniper rifle, a shotgun loaded with Dragon's Breath or AP Slug shells, or the 5/7 AP pistol to punch through the shields, but unless you hit them in the head through the shield, those aren't nearly as damaging as flanking the enemy.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Artificial Stupidity</a>: The sequel mixes this up. This time around, civilians are less likely to run around if a fire fight is happening near them, only if a cop manages to get them up and tell them to run for it. However, shouts and other intimidation sources now vary in strength meaning that shouting people down may take more or less time; a low level mastermind upgrade can even terrify people by sounds other than shouts.<ul><li> Sometimes occurs with friendly AI. Since starting a heist is only character specific (i.e. Player 1 can mask up and break in the back while Player 2 keeps watch without drawing a weapon) it's entirely possible to start a heist only to have an AI stand about outside unarmed; this can even extend to being downed in a firefight <em>only to have an AI stroll up all incognito, revive you, and wander off again.</em></li><li> Friendly AI can sometimes (for no discernible reason) either: 1. Charge into a swarm of enemies without regard for survival; or 2. Hide in cover when you really need help, such as staying hidden in Rats when SWAT start scaling the building. They also have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities">Skewed Priorities</a> when it comes to reviving players; they will generally only be able to pick between shooting an immediate threat or helping you up, without considering the possibility of changing tactics and often picking the least convenient option (e.g. coming to help you after a Cloaker's kicked you down, deciding to ignore said Cloaker who's preparing to kick them down too).</li><li> It often happens to the enemy AI as well - setting the gym on the top floor of the Mallcrasher mall on fire can occasionally lead to the cops <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">trying to take cover inside the burning room</a>. They don't survive very long. This is extremely useful on Death Wish, as the cops won't last very long even with their increased max health.</li><li> Headless Titan Bulldozer AI is intentionally crippled. If you look away from them, they don't fire at you. While this leaves you more vulnerable to cloakers that may approach, it allows players to easily complete Safehouse Nightmare by oneself, simply looking down and waiting at the drill (as cloakers don't tend to actively hunt the player unless provoked). Oddly, it's easier for one player to complete the Safehouse Nightmare achievement on Death Wish difficulty than it is on Overkill, as the "easier" difficulty requires collecting floating masks that may instantly incapacitate you.</li><li> The SWAT van turrets do a number on the friendly AI. They have over 25K health, deal lots of damage, and only have to reload for a short time. The AI, unless you very tightly control them, will run out to shoot it ineffectively and immediately get stunlocked by its gun, repeatedly going down over and over until you can get them up and back into cover while it's reloading or take care of it yourself.</li><li> Cops will gladly walk through any fires you created with a molotov and they either die or take a lot of damage. Panicked civilians will also run through molotov created fires, getting themselves killed and netting you a penalty for a civilian kill.</li><li> Mallcrasher has a similar version, thanks to the fact that it's not officially possible to stealth, but can be done that way with luck and skill. The skylight near the back breaks so Bile can extract the gang, which any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusuallyUninterestingSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusuallyUninterestingSight">untied civilians will dutifully ignore.</a> Part of this strategy also involves shooting out signs above the various stores, which, unlike almost any other breakable object hanging from a wall or ceiling (like the chandeliers), <em>no one will notice.</em></li><li> The Heat Street remake, unlike its predecessor, doesn't flood the first set of streets with waves of cops like in the original, and instead has pre-positioned cops and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SWATTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SWATTeam">SWATs</a> waiting for you to pass by. One of the easiest ways of beating the first portion of the heist on Mayhem or below, is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyLevelTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyLevelTrick">simply ''run as fast as possible'' to Matt's crashed van</a>, ignoring the litany of cops shooting at you, as it's not worth the time dealing with them, and subsequently getting stuck in the first assault wave in the street with little cover. Armor builds make this difficult to do, but dodge/ anarchist builds should be fine.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseGeography" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseGeography">Artistic License &#150; Geography</a>: The Counterfeit heist is supposedly set in Pensacola, Florida, right by the beach, with Pensacola PD responding, and tall, thin palm trees. There are numerous problems with this. Any house that close to the beach in Pensacola is on stilts and wouldn't have a basement due to the potential to flood during hurricanes, which is the same reason a thicker, shorter species of palm tree grows there. And the Pensacola Police Department has a very limited jurisdiction; the Payday gang would mostly fight Gulf Breeze Police or Escambia County Sheriffs. Also, there would be sand everywhere.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseLaw">Artistic License &#150; Law</a>: The FBI Files feature lets you see, among other things, the crimes you've committed in-game. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">It's actually quite comprehensive</a> for the most part, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderandJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderandJaywalking">even the smallest offenses listed alongside the most egregious ones</a>.

You need at least two bags of loot (gold, jewels, or plain old cash) to complete the heist - each van has at least two, though the exact quantity per van depends on difficulty and van count, plus the risk of some of the rarer loot being destroyed if you use C4 to blow the doors off.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme">Ascended Meme</a>:<ul><li> When you first start the game, you'll start a "heist" (actually just a tutorial) where you enter your safehouse. Bain will tell you to go inside, and the first command he'll give is for you to answer the phone on the table. You can't actually answer it, just like in the original game's Counterfeit - fortunately, Bain talks to you anyway, and says "See? I'm one step ahead of you, as always! You didn't even have to answer the phone!"</li><li> GO Bank and The Benevolent Bank also include phone-answering objectives as part of their stealth sequence. Failing to answer the phone can cause the mission to go loud.</li><li> When Hoxton was confirmed to return, people started calling Dallas's brother (who had taken up the codename) "Houston" to differentiate. That's precisely the name he's given from the Hoxton Breakout onward.</li><li> During the <em>Hotline Miami</em> heist, players can cook meth in The Commissar's lab or destroy it as they wish, with Bain noting the crew has probably burned a lot of labs in their time.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1g8o9');"><sup>exp.&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1g8o9" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1g8o9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Due to the high XP reward of <em>Rats</em>, plus the high difficulty in cooking meth and holding off the cops on Day 1, it's still common to find people deliberately cooking incorrectly to blow the lab and summon the escape sooner.</span></li><li> Almir, the lead producer of the game, is known by the fan base to have a magnificent beard. The Xmas 2014 heist takes said beard to another level by making it an actual in-game difficulty "mask" to wear.</li><li> Players who break open deposit boxes and safes will sometimes find a grilled cheese toast sandwich inside. The sandwich became a meme within the community over how ridiculous it is to find such a thing inside a safe. The White Xmas heist has one of the random pieces of loot be a giant piece of toast, and carrying it is as heavy as an artifact from Shadow Raid. Securing said toast can net players over a million dollars on Overkill difficulty. As of Hoxton's Housewarming Party, finding the toast in the manager's hidden safe in Big Bank gets you your own piece of toast as a trophy for the new safehouse. The trophy's name and description even lampshade the ridiculousness, naming it "It's Not Even Fresh..." and stating that it must have been one <em>hell</em> of a good sandwich for a guy to lock it away in a safe after one bite.</li><li> In a weird case of ascending an already ascended meme, when they re-released Panic Room for this game, they adjusted the Giant Toothbrush meme from a stationary item to a lootable item that spawns in one of several pre-determined locations on the map, and securing it adds the Giant Toothbrush to your Safe House, gives you an achievement and earns you about $1.5 million in cash (even more than securing one of the many bags of cocaine that are on the map.)</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The yacht that Dallas rides in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNowEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNowEpilogue">"Where Are They Now?"

This feature was removed for a year or so, but returned in 2016.</li><li> Also, if you join after the first day but complete the remaining part of the heist, you get rewards for all days completed.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">Blatant Lies</a>: Bain says there shouldn't be many civilians in the Car Shop Heist. <em>He is very wrong</em>; there are around a dozen in the map.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6pzqw');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6pzqw" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6pzqw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Depending on the difficulty, of course.

This feature wasn't added until October 2016, three years after the game was released, and even then it's an <em>entirely different safehouse</em> than the one you started with, of which Hoxton had to find, not Bain.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodlessCarnage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodlessCarnage">Bloodless Carnage</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Averted</a>; enemies unfortunate enough to be in the way of your bullets will introduce their insides to the walls behind them, leaving for a rather gruesome wallpaper. Jiro can cut off Cloaker heads with a katana, and Bodhi can leave a nice gaping hole in the skulls of Tasers if he headshots them with a sniper rifle. The Taxman in the Undercover heist gets heavily bruised and very bloody on his face the more you beat him up.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlownAcrossTheRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlownAcrossTheRoom">Blown Across the Room</a>: The Bronco Revolver, Deagle, Grenade Launchers, Rocket Launchers, and any shotgun is capable of sending a mook ragdolling through the air.<ul><li> This is often a viable tactic for hiding bodies in stealth, specifically with the silenced Loco or Judge.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BondOneLiner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BondOneLiner">Bond One-Liner</a>: Most units deliver at least one when fighting against you, though the Cloakers and Bulldozers get special mention for having the most of the lot.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusLevel">Bonus Level</a>: The "Escapes" can be considered this on earlier heists, as they happen close to randomly if the heist is done loud.<ul><li> The Armoured Transport: Train Heist was this until <a class="urllink" href="https://payday.fandom.com/wiki/PC_update_history_(Payday_2)_Old#Update_.2357">Update #57<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> changed it to be standalone.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a>: Sometimes, even the simplest things can pull you and the crew through a rough spot:<ul><li> Technician's drill upgrades. It is uninteresting and passive, but upgrading all of his drill perks earns you much faster, silent drills that can even self repair every other time they jam (and rarely be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PercussiveMaintenance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PercussiveMaintenance">whacked back into commission</a>), cutting chunks off heist times.</li><li> The Mastermind's Forced Friendship skill, which lets you tie civilians faster and carry more cable ties, and acing it gives your entire team slight damage absorption for each hostage you have tied. It may not be anything fancy, but tying up people quickly and having more ties to work with means better crowd control that can help your crew out whether the heist is in stealth or goes loud.<ul><li> The Ghost's Duck and Cover skill; which increases stamina regeneration and can be used earlier, both by 25%, allowing the player to sprint for a longer period of time before tiring out. Acing the skill gives you dodge bonuses for sprinting and using zip-lines. The adjacent skill - "Parkour", lets you sprint 10% faster, and lets you climb ladders 20% faster, and acing the skill lets you reload and run in any direction. Sprinting is the most basic action anyone can do, but the player not taking these skills can also be the difference between someone reaching the escape zone in time, or being shot down.</li></ul></li><li> "Transporter", in the Enforcer tree, is considered a mandatory skill for almost every build since it lets you throw bags farther and, when aced, move slightly faster with them when wearing heavier armor. This helps out greatly with the ubiquitous bag-moving that is required.</li><li> Another Enforcer skill, "Fully Loaded", has the amount of ammunition you can handle increased by 25%. Acing the skill grants you a 75% increase in the ammo that you receive from ammo boxes. It also grants you a 5% chance of getting a throwable when picking up ammo, with the chance increasing as you pick up more ammo. This, combined with the skills at the bottom of this tree, which improve ammo bags in a variety of ways. This can mean never running out of ammo for any weapons, such as the Thanantos .50 Sniper Rifle.</li><li> The Locomotive 12G shotgun. Given a massive buff from the notoriously mediocre incarnation from the previous game, this shotgun packs a punch, has a decent ammo pickup rate, and has all-round decent stats. But the main attraction is its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlownAcrossTheRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlownAcrossTheRoom">knockback</a>; this is used all the time to hide bodies in stealth, by simply blasting them across a low wall, into water, or generally anywhere else where they won't be found by pesky guards.</li><li> The CAR-4, for those who don't consider it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleYetAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleYetAwesome">Simple, yet Awesome</a>. It is a highly versatile all-rounder assault rifle with a good blend of accuracy, power and stability - though the fire rate could be higher. It is available at level 4 and easily affordable at $95,000. It can be fitted with a lot of different mods though still performs well without many of them, has clear iron sights, and it can achieve a good concealment value so stealthy builds can get use out of it.</li><li> The two piece suit. While wearing a fancy suit makes you a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>, it is also pretty much the only "armor" that gives the most concealment for stealth. The suit also has the most speed and stamina, which lets you zip around the map at hyper speed (and even more so if you are using speed enhancing perks and/or get "inspired" from another player) for a long time before tiring out. It also provides the best dodge value, making it useful when going loud as well.</li><li> From a practical standpoint, the latex gloves the whole crew (save for Jacket and Sydney, one wears bandages instead, and the other wears fingerless gloves) wears. Not only do the gloves conceal fingerprints, they also act like a second skin so that the crew isn't hindered when holding onto something.</li><li> In any Stealth heist where there is a camera room, watching the cams. It doesn't get more boring, as you're standing in one place doing nothing but staring at the screen while people are actually outwitting the guards. But since cameras automatically mark any visible guards, by doing this, you just made the heist a hell of a lot easier.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines">Bottomless Magazines</a>:<ul><li> The Enforcer's <em>Bullet Storm</em> skill grants temporary infinite magazines for 5 seconds after deploying or using an ammo bag, and acing this skill <em>makes it go up to 15 seconds!</em></li><li> The Fugitive skill "Swan Song", which allows players to continue moving slowly and firing at enemies for three seconds when downed. Acing the skill nets you six seconds of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">Implacable Man</a> status instead.</li><li> Some weapons are modelled with certain magazines that cannot realistically hold the amount of ammunition the game supplies for them.</li><li> All armed AI have infinite ammunition, friendly or not.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrandX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrandX">Brand X</a>: It seems most of DC uses Pear Computers desktops.

The Wild West pack and then especially the Chivalry pack go even further, the former adding stuff like a Single Action Army and lever-action Winchester, and the latter adding various medieval crossbows and swords. The later free World War II pack also naturally adds a few weapons used during WWII, starting you with push daggers and working your way up to a Luger, an MP40 and an M1 Garand.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">Bribing Your Way to Victory</a>: The weapon pack DLCs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope">varied between their releases</a> with some content either being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">Difficult, but Awesome</a> or useful only in the right hands:<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> with the weapons themselves, as each weapon pack has nifty weapons that have great (situational) advantages, but have some major drawbacks. Unless you're willing to spend a fortune on specific mods and perks, the guns don't overpower the vanilla guns: LMGs have massive ammo and high rate of fire, but have awful accuracy and lengthy reloads; and Sniper Rifles can one-shot multiple units and even pierce through shields (with massively reduced efficiency, but still usually enough to one-shot them with a headshot), but the ammo capacity is low, the refire rate is slow (no semi-auto sniper rifles until much later packs), and the reload times are lengthy.</li><li> Played straight, then later averted with frag grenades.

Update 100 introduced a free frag grenade, allowing anyone to start a heist with frag grenades.</li><li> Played straight, then later averted, with melee weapons, which come in several varieties provided you're buying the packs. While powerful alternatives require a wind up to maximize their power, non-DLC players are stuck with the default fists, similarly weak weapon butt, joke money bundle, a couple unremarkable knives, weak knuckle dusters (if the player joins the Steam group), and the fast-stabbing but otherwise unspectacular psycho knife (ditto). When Sociopath and Infiltrator was buffed in December 2017, Melee weapons, even the free ones, became viable choices for players. Melee before that was mostly used as a Utility slot, with most players taking the Buzzer (Paid) or the ECB's<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8oxc1');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note8oxc1" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8oxc1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Electrical Brass Knuckles</span> (Free), which stuns most units, basically anything that isn't a Bulldozer or Captain Winters!</li><li> Played completely straight with the Gage Mod Courier pack as, while it requires <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedLevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedLevelGrinding">level grinding</a> to find enough hidden packs, the outcome lands players with free weapon mods, which can lead to some seriously powerful combos normally unavailable to others (save for some alternatives which require specific card unlocks and tons of cash). Players who don't own the mod pack DLC can still earn extra experience points from the packages they find, though the amount depends on how many the team finds and it's still a paltry amount of points.</li><li> Also played straight with some DLC assets: the sniper pack, for example, grants the unlockable bonuses like two-way zip lines and vantage points which, like grenades, can be a huge advantage but require at least one player to have paid for the DLC. The assets also have their own downsides: vantage points can put you far away from the rest of the team, which means if cops swarm your location or take enough potshots at you, you're screwed. Zip lines, while cool to use, won't allow you to use iron sight aiming while using the line and you're also open to attack by enemies.</li><li> The Hoxton's Housewarming Party added Continental Coins to buy upgrades for the new safehouse, which allowed for directly purchasing weapon modifications. The only restrictions are Weapon Stat Boosts, and mods added in DLC that are locked behind achievements, since those are given in infinite numbers once you've pinged the achievement in question.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">Brick Joke</a>: In the Hoxton Breakout heist, Bain complains (after using the parking ticket to open the exit) that $7 for parking is robbery. In the Alesso Heist, a similar parking ticket machine shows up in the garage and you can blow up with C4, earning you an achievement for getting your $7 back.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletDodgesYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletDodgesYou">Bullet Dodges You</a>: The <em>Dodge</em> mechanic, which is more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets">Immune to Bullets</a> in practice due to gameplay limitations; it is a chance for shots that actually hit you (complete with impact sound) to be completely negated and do no <em>actual</em> damage.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">Boss in Mook Clothing</a>: The Commissar looks similar to his fellow Russian mobsters and can't be marked, but has <em>way more health</em> and wields the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">KSP</a>, a light machine gun utilized by the Bulldozers on Mayhem difficulty and above.

Bullet time also kicks in when you put on your mask near a guard and have a few slow seconds to dispatch him before he attacks you. However, it doesn't slow down for everyone else in an online heist, so don't be surprised if everyone in the county is calling the police for what seems like no reason at all.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameraSpoofing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameraSpoofing">Camera Spoofing</a>: The Camera Loop ability allows the player to render a camera useless without breaking it this way for 25 seconds.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarFu">Car Fu</a>: It is entirely possible to ram a cop with a vehicle that you're driving and kill them instantly.

On the flip side, the lack of friendly fire when using non-explosive weapons is fine, though annoying when AI teammates absolutely insist on standing right in front of you whenever you're firing your weapon, as your bullets don't actually pass through teammates. Civilians being immune to the cops' gunfire is a godsend. Cops also seem to not understand the concept of protecting civilians, and as soon as they get to one and untie them, the cop will start shooting at you again while standing <em>right next to the rescued civilian</em>, meaning attempts to fight back will very likely will get that civilian killed.</li><li> Whilst the friendly AI can only shoot, move, revive players, and carry loot bags if you toss one to them, enemy AI are capable of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRulesAreNotYourRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRulesAreNotYourRules">carrying loot bags and interacting with hostages</a>, among other things. The friendly AI can also make some movement types that players cannot, such as rappelling down from high ledges (trying to jump down would just make you take incapacitating levels of fall damage). Or in one heist's case, crawling through an air vent to bypass a closed door you spent probably five to ten minutes trying to break through.</li><li> Also, enemies are unaffected by item weight when stealing loot bags, so they can move at a brisk pace while lugging around that bag of gold or fusion engine that slows you (and AI teammates) to a crawl.</li><li> Flashbangs, for the longest time, weren't actual projectiles that got thrown by enemies. Instead, the game just periodically spawns one at your feet when you're not looking. This was later changed to actually be a projectile, by giving them a 4 second delay before detonation, complete with loud beeping and flashing beforehand, and giving you the ability to melee or shoot at them to disable them before they detonate - the very same thing the cops can do to your grenades if you try to throw one head-on at an enemy.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConcealingCanvas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConcealingCanvas">Concealing Canvas</a>: There is a safe hidden behind a painting in the manager's office of Big Bank.

The Hoxton's Housewarming Party a few years later then added "Concussion Grenades" which are a player-usable version of the infamously-annoying flashbangs.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspicuousGloves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspicuousGloves">Conspicuous Gloves</a>: Dallas, Chains, Hoxton, Houston, Wolf, Wick, Clover, Dragan, Bonnie, Sokol, Jiro, Bodhi, Jimmy, Rust, Scarface, Sangrez, Duke, Ethan, Hila, and Joy all wear latex surgical gloves with their attire, regardless of the mission. They're obviously to prevent leaving fingerprints, but they're always left on, even when a heist goes loud and bullets start flying. Averted with Jacket and Sydney as the former wears bandages over his hands, and the latter wears fingerless gloves.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nod</a>: The original safehouse in <em>PAYDAY 2</em> has a front as a dry cleaning store called Bodhi's Dry Cleaning, which is a subtle nod towards the front the crew used in the Counterfeit heist from the first game named Bodhi's Pool Repair. Boxes labeled with the names of previous heists also appear scattered around.<ul><li> If you have Alex drop off ammo bags for you in day 2 of Big Oil, he may sometimes drop them within inaccessible locations, like at the bottom of the cliff or on top of the trees. Bain may say "This is like Panic Room all over again!", referencing the time Alex dropped the bag of C4 in an undesirable location in the first game.</li><li> The GO Bank heist has you air lifting the loot via a plane with a hook. Bain references the event to Green Bridge, another heist from the first game which also had a similar event.</li><li> When you find the meth lab in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HotlineMiami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HotlineMiami">Hotline Miami</a> job, Bain will reminisce about all the other meth labs you've blown up, which is both a reference to the Rats job as well as a small <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> to players who always opted to blow up the lab in Rats rather than cook the meth, in order to try and speedrun it.</li><li> The Art Gallery heist will have Bain mention how they robbed the gallery for the Elephant the previous year <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9didr');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note9didr" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9didr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">2013 was the year the game launched and 2014 is when the Art Gallery heist was released[[note]] and this time, they are robbing the place <em>again</em> for themselves. Likewise, the Cook Off job, which is Rats day 1 as a standalone job, has Bain telling the crew that the meth lab they used for Hector's job is still intact and they can use it to cook meth again, but this time it's for their own gain.</span></li><li> There is a unique blue-shirted female FBI agent encountered in Operations during Hoxton Breakout Day 2. She is the same agent who was in charge of investigating the Payday gang and was last seen interrogating Dallas in the web series. Her corrupt partner is nearby. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheDead">Both are almost inevitably killed.</a></li><li> The plan for getting the vault car open in "The Bomb: Forest" is the same as the safe in Counterfeit: fill it with water, then blast it open with C4.</li><li> The evidence boards in Hoxton Revenge are loaded with photos and sticky notes of the jobs that came before it, including Election Day, Hoxton Breakout, and Big Bank.</li><li> The First World Bank heist is explicitly the second time the gang hits it - Bain talks a lot about the first one (which, naturally, was in the first Payday). Heat Street is also a rehash of the same route Matt takes.</li><li> "Meltdown" takes place in the same Murkywater warehouse the players infiltrate for "Shadow Raid". Vlad will even mention the gang's work on that when picking the heist from Crime.net.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolCar">Cool Car</a>: The Car Shop Heist has you stealing these, and you get to drive them to boot. Meltdown added the Longfellow, a muscle car from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a> supposedly originally owned by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuammarGaddafi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuammarGaddafi">Muammar Gaddafi</a>, which returns for the Goat Simulator heist.

The Infamy and Alpha masks, in particular, are noted to be awesome in their descriptions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShades">Cool Shades</a>: Unlocking your first tier of infamy gives you a pair of shades that you can wear during a heist instead of a mask. Two more pairs of shades were released alongside John Wick during CrimeFest, based on the iconic sunglasses from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Terminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Terminator">Terminator</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReservoirDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReservoirDogs">Reservoir Dogs</a></em> and three more were added alongside the Reservoir Dogs Heist.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptPolitician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptPolitician">Corrupt Politician</a>:<ul><li> The Elephant falls squarely into the trope; he wants a lot of shady and high risk criminal activity done under the radar in order to make him look good, benefit his agenda, or ruin the image of his political opponents while paying you handsomely for your work. This is why most of his Heists have a stealth option.</li><li> The premise of Framing Frame has you double crossing a crooked Democrat by stealing paintings for the Democrat and exchanging them for money, then proceeding to infiltrate his apartment to steal his illegal cache of gold (he got them from an arms deal) while planting cocaine. You <em>really</em> get to see how corrupt the Democrat is if the heist goes loud, as Bain will dig up dirt on him and find out that the Democrat not only exchanged arms for gold, but was also involved with drugs and other illegal activities, sometimes even sampling the 'product' as part of the deal.</li><li> Invoked for the Plan B of Day 2 of Election Day. If the heist goes loud while you're hacking the machines to swing the votes in favour of Bob Mckendrick, you instead have to hack the machines to make it look like they were being hacked to put Mckendrick's <em>rival</em> in the winning seat. The idea is that now the cops know the machines were hacked, they would obviously be after whichever candidate it was being hacked for. This way Mckendrick's rival would be implicated as the Corrupt Politician.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Counterattack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Counterattack">Counterattack</a>:<ul><li> The Shockproof skill in the Ghost tree gives you a small chance of staggering a Taser that is stunning you while the aced version of the skill lets you escape without another player's help.</li><li> There is also the Counterstrike skill in the Fugitive skill tree that lets you counter attack a melee attack while charging your own melee, which rather humorously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlownAcrossTheRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlownAcrossTheRoom">blows them across the room.</a> The aced version even works against Cloakers!</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Cowboy Cop</a>:<ul><li> Essentially, the entire police force in Washington DC. Every single cop that responds to one of your heists <em>will</em> shoot first and never bother with questions, violating every single police procedure for hostage situations and armed robberies. This goes double for the special units: Bulldozers and Cloakers in particular, who are violent and bloodthirsty.</li><li> A small subversion in the Hoxton Breakout trailer. At one point, a DCPD officer takes down Wolf, and begins to read him his rights.</li><li> If players have a lot of hostages and/or don't fire any shots (even the first uniformed officers on the scene), the initial assault will take longer to occur, and the cops won't shoot as they're assessing the situation.</li><li> Averted with all non-Murkywater security guards. Unless you attacked them first, they will always slowly walk up to you and try to cuff you. If you run though or fire back, they open fire. The cuffing can be a hazard since they can do this action while you're interacting with something, such as a pager.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCameo">Creator Cameo</a>: Simon Viklund, creator of the games' soundtrack, returns to voice Bain.<ul><li> Almir voices Vlad's brother-in-law in White Xmas and Stealing Xmas.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover">Crossover</a>: Quite a few:<ul><li> The GO Bank heist is a replica of a bank level from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CounterStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CounterStrike">Counter-Strike</a>: Global Offensive</em>. The terrorists that play on that map are called "the professionals", who also wear suits and sunglasses, much like the Payday crew does.</li><li> The Hotline Miami heist is inspired by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HotlineMiami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HotlineMiami">Hotline Miami</a></em>,with a 2 day heists that has Hotline Miami-inspired layouts and designs, along with the games first boss battle.

On top of featuring unique LED settings (the lights on the case matching up with assault phases), it would provide anyone playing on those machines two masks exclusive to those owners.

Players only start off with a weak and inaccurate assault rifle, pistol, and no body armor, though they quickly can unlock a new gun and better armor within the first few level ups. Buying weapons and new skills are <em>extremely</em> expensive, which is something the developers pushed for so that "every choice you make matters" (which runs into problems when, in the early game, you rarely get any choices to begin with, and the general lack of detailed information to make informed decisions doesn't help either).

The Death Wish update also added GenSec armored SWAT units, which are more accurate than the tan FBI SWAT and react faster too, and only appear on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Harder Than Hard</a> Death Wish difficulty.

The mooks wear suits just like the crew and they use a variety of weapons (revolver, shotgun, assault rifle, etc). Said mooks on day 1 can also barricade windows in the motel for cover and rig doorways with trip mines just like the players. The Commissar himself not only wears a suit, he also wears a bulletproof vest and uses a light machine gun, gear that is commonly used by players. The only difference between the Russian gangsters and the PAYDAY crew is the Russians are willing to get into some business that the PAYDAY gang refuse to get near, such as torturing hostages, unless absolutely necessary.<ul><li> The Commissar is also an evil counterpart (well, more evil) to Bain; they both use a camera feed and watch over their minions via a computer hub.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">Eye Scream</a>: In the Hoxton Breakout trailer, Wolf drills directly into a Bulldozer's eye for funsies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacelessGoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacelessGoons">Faceless Goons</a>: Especially so, compared to the first game, as the main characters went through several stages of actor changes and character appearances; only the masks remained the same. It's possible to avert this depending on the mask you wear, however, as several are actually hats that don't actually cover the player character's face, one of which is a tiara <em>you stole</em>, which the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlavorText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlavorText">Flavor Text</a> Lampshades:<dl><dd><div class="indent">Okay, it doesn't hide your face and it is certainly not going to stop any bullets whizzing your way... but, damn.

Sometimes a room will be located in a really bad spot, or a vault door you need to defend has no cover near it whatsoever. Sometimes, the loot vehicle will just keep missing its mark over and over again, or the escape vehicle will arbitrarily decide to set its landing zone across the map from your perfectly viable and already secured area.<ul><li> GO Bank's stealth runs can qualify as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Harder Than Hard</a> if the security call goes badly as, on activating the vault's time lock, Hilary from GenSec asks for Barney to confirm the time-lock check-in. She <em>demands</em> Barney call her back, meaning she sends GenSec officers (with pagers) over; players have to carefully avoid the vault lasers when it finally opens to reach the deposit boxes; the local police chief calls due to the GenSec tip-off and sends cops to investigate; when the cops don't report back, players are finally given an ultimatum of four (or less) minutes before he sends every available cop over, forcing players to then drop everything and run or go loud.</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Death Wish</a> difficulty can be seen as this, as the only way it makes cops harder to fight is to significantly increase their health and damage and increase the spawn rates of specials. Same goes for Death Sentence, which triples the damage rate of everyone on the map, and adds in more special units only found on that difficulty. Adding on the Modifier "One Down" can make this difficulty even more hellish.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBalance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBalance">Fake Balance</a>:<ul><li> Armor VS Dodge. Early in the game's life, heavy armor gave good protection while reducing the player's speed a little bit while light armor and the suit gave more speed and dodge. After several rebalances were implemented in the game, most heavy armors no longer had dodge values, were given a bigger speed penalty, and did not get buffed to compensate for the damage boost that enemies were given after their rebalance (Suits and light ballistic vests were the only armors that retain dodge values). Several perk decks also give bonuses to dodge, which made it possible for players to avoid the majority of attacks from enemies (including the <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">SWAT turret</a>). Dodge became the go to stat to build up on since it was easier to increase it with zero penalty whereas armor only offers limited protection in exchange for slower movement and no dodge. In a nutshell, dodge based builds have more benefits that outweighs any weaknesses they may have whereas armor builds can be a liability on higher difficulties because they have too many weaknesses.</li><li> Likewise, a similar phenomenon occurs for Armor VS Health in terms of recovery. A few perk decks in favor of armor either decreases the delay of armor regeneration or gives more armor for the user. The perk decks that favor health gives the player several ways to recover from it, such as picking up dropped ammo, killing enemies, and damaging enemies. While the downsides for perks that have health regeneration impose restrictions like limiting how much health per few seconds one can recover or requiring the user to wear light armor, a careful and skilled player can easily regain any health lost with several options on how to do it and can even go without the need of Doctor Bags and First Aid Kits whereas armor has nothing to aid it other than the player simply taking cover and playing carefully or using the Anarchist perk deck and killing enough enemies to keep their armour topped up.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FashionVictimVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FashionVictimVillain">Fashion-Victim Villain</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">Invoked Trope</a> by some players.

Due to the bug, the Cloaker was removed for the remainder of the beta and was not included in the final game until Patch 23, which reintroduced the Cloaker along with some achievements involving them.</li><li> <em>PAYDAY 2</em> on launch day had an extremely nasty bug that caused everyone's games to crash at the end of the heist or when an achievement was unlocked. Luckily, Overkill fixed the problem in less than an hour.</li><li> Patch 11 caused a terrible bug where all armor types had the same defensive value as a two-piece suit, meaning no defense. The bug alone made the Enforcer class nearly crippled because the exclusive full suit body armor now had no protection and the burden of slower movement speed. What made this even worse was that the same patch also caused blue SWAT and gangsters to have <em>triple</em> the amount of firepower, meaning even on Normal difficulty people could get shredded in an instant by regular cops. Incidentally, the latter bug with that patch was actually mildly popular, enough so that after Update 12 fixed 11's issues, Update 13 set it so occasionally a regular cop could use the much more powerful Bronco .44 revolver.</li><li> For a while, picking up the top secret blueprints in an armored heist mission would trigger a bug that caused the game to crash when it attempted to load the secret military train mission. Not only did players have to restart the mission, but they'd lose any money and experience they had accumulated in the previous heist.</li><li> The friendly AI still doesn't seem to be quite properly tested for Armored Transport heists. In any other heist, even if they're on the other side of the map from you, if you go down they will do their best to get over to you and help you up. Here, there are a plethora of situations in which they simply won't bother. Getting downed in one of the trucks is somewhat reasonable, since they can't go into the trucks. Getting downed in the middle of the street and being left to bleed out because they're too busy sitting in place in the nearby cafe isn't. There are also the occasional spots where, if you try to stash a loot bag along a wall, random otherwise-intangible scenery will prevent you from picking it back up.</li><li> It's possible in Diamond Store for a bug to result in the 'Escape Available' objective never activating if too many bags are thrown into the van at once, forcing a restart or termination.</li><li> A milder example than most, but in some stealth-only missions, there are certain spots where guards can detect players through walls, triggering the countdown to failure.</li><li> Hotline Miami had an issue where one of the objectives requires placing fuel cans on four cars and igniting them. However, if you placed more than 4 fuel containers and ignited a fifth before the objective updated, it caused the mission logic to glitch and the next objective never triggered. Thankfully, this was fixed later.</li><li> On Day 1 of Hoxton Breakout, the Parking Ticket can be accidentally removed from the game entirely and force a restart if a client picks it up. There is coding in the game where required objects like the ticket are passed on to a different player if the person holding them disconnects or is put into custody. If the player holding the ticket gets put into custody and disconnects <em>at the same time</em>, the two parts of the code conflict, and the ticket gets removed from their inventory without adding it to another player's, forcing a restart of the day.</li><li> The Hoxton's Housewarming Party event (aka Crimefest 2016) was this for users of the Linux version of the game. Of the 10 days the event ran for, 5 of those days broke the game in some way or another. Day 1 broke the game upon launching it, Day 2 broke matchmaking and the safehouse, the very point of that day's update. The Day 3 update failed to land for Linux users, while Day 4 broke concussion grenades for a few hours until a mid-day patched fixed all the above bugs. To add insult to injury, Day 10 broke the game entirely (making it impossible to launch) until the next day's bugfixes update.</li><li> Like with the Housewarming Party, Linux users suffered <em>yet another</em> 10 days of game-breaking bugs for the Search for Kento event (Spring Break 2017). This time, Overkill had gotten savvy to the constant complaints of massive downloads every day during an event, as well as the game breaking constantly, and so opted to patch the game every other instead of daily. Day 2 was <em>supposed</em> to add in Heat Street to the Linux port like it did for the Windows version, but it couldn't be found. The update also broke matchmaking for a few hours until a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">mod</a> was released to fix the issue. Fortunately, Day 3 fixed the above issues. Day 4 added in the game mode "Crime Spree", which was completely broken for Controller users, regardless of platform, and, of course, matchmaking broke again for Linux. Once again Day 5 fixed the Day 4 issues, bar Controller support for the new game mode. Day 6 broke matchmaking <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">again</a></em> for Linux users, while Day 8 didn't add updates to the base game, rather, they launched a beta to test out AI improvements.

There is actually a safehouse daily job named "Spacetime Paradox" that requires you to do this.

Most guns require two or three headshots to drop them at most.

It helps significantly if you have either a shotgun or rapid fire weapon, as the threshold for shooting the lock is not actually the amount of damage you do, but how many times you shoot it. Sniper rifles and the Bronco take the same four shots that a SMG does. Shotguns are the exception, because each shot impacts multiple times.</span></li><li> The old safe house has a section that lets you practice your skills on opening doors.

However, he has a dozen prototypes and Bain will only accept the correct one.

Unlike other mission critical set pieces, the computer that contains the P.S.I. info <em>can</em> be destroyed by gunfire and grenades, which makes the guesswork much harder. Good luck trying to complete the mission if none of the team can read the monitor, and there happen to be two or more machines that have both the same coloured gas tank and the same number of nozzles.</li><li> More generally, figuring out what some skills actually do. Their interactions with the game aren't always clear and some bonuses don't actually do anything - Hard Boiled, for instance, boosts shotgun accuracy, which actually makes shotguns <em>worse</em> by limiting their spread without increasing their damage against targets they do hit.</li><li> How to defeat a SWAT Van Turret: Uninformed people shoot at the turret and realize they aren't doing direct damage to the turret. The key is to shoot off the Turret's <em>barriers</em>, which will eventually pop off upon taking too much damage and expose the reflective targeting camera underneath the gun.

The trophies must then be put on display in the Safe House. You must enter your Safe House, grab the Medallion from Duke's desk, and open the three boxes, then assemble them into a floating object. You must then go to Scarface's room nearby and shoot some keys on the piano in a specific order. This causes the artifact to display a series of coded messages. Using a substitution cipher, you must translate the messages to find that they are a list of 20 of the game's achievements (which ones are different for each player, out of a list of 57), written from right to left. You must then complete all 20 achievements. Once they're done, you must start the White House Heist on Overkill difficulty or higher. You must then play until you reach the PEOC bunker, and find the Aztec painting; if you have accomplished all the previous actions, the painting will be glowing. After removing the painting, the hosting player will get C4, which they must use to blow open the wall, revealing a secret passage that leads to a puzzle wheel. You must solve the puzzle wheel four times using another cipher (all the while under attack), to gain access to a secret temple.

There is an optional objective to search for dropped Christmas presents the plane was carrying, since some of the presents are actually hiding smuggled cocaine and other valuables.

Acing the skill lets you instantly revive downed players from a distance by simply <em>shouting at them</em> and, provided you're close enough, works through walls and floors/ceilings. The skill was initially balanced by only having a chance to work... which everyone got around by hammering the shout button until the revival happened, hence the "Get the fuck up!" meme. Now it's a guaranteed instant revival but has a twenty second cooldown before you can use it again.</li><li> The Enforcer's "Iron Man" skill. Basic gives you 30% increased armor for every type of armor in the game. Acing it gives you the Improved Combined Tactical Vest, <em>the</em> single most effective armor available. Combine it with the earlier "Shock And Awe" skill and you <em>and your whole team</em>'s armor recovers 25% faster.</li><li> The Enforcer's OVE9000 saw. Capable of cutting straight through locks, it can completely bypass the 3 minutes it takes to drill a lock or the time it takes to pick a deposit box, and even doubles as a melee weapon.

One skill even lets you use one as a secondary weapon as well, allowing use of typically more powerful and versatile primary weapons for heists that the saw will be nevertheless helpful in, like Armored Transport.</li><li> Ghost's "Nimble", when aced, lets you pick locks twice as fast, and lets you silently pick the lock on normal black safes in about 42 seconds - about 25 to <strong>15</strong> percent of the time a basic drill would take! Stacks well as well with Clover's "Burglar" perk deck, the fifth-tier perk of which increases lockpicking speed by an additional 20%.</li><li> The Ghost's "Sneaky Bastard" skill increases dodge based on concealment level, acing it allowing you to have a detection risk of up to 25 while still getting the full benefits. What normally would be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat">Dump Stat</a> in a loud mission becomes relevant and can boost one's dodge levels to insane degrees when combined with other dodge-boosting perks.</li><li> Fugitive's "Messiah". Once per mission, getting a pistol kill when downed grants an instant self-revive, that's even refilled if you use a doctor bag.</li><li> The Fugitive's Swan Song skill is also incredibly good when aced, giving you a <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazine">Bottomless Magazine</a> for your gun and letting you move around for a full 6 seconds before going down. It allows you enough time to not only take out whoever might have downed you in the first place, but can let you run to get to cover or somewhere that'd make it easier for your allies to revive you. Another alternative (or good complement) to it is "Feign Death", which allows you to occasionally get right back up after being incapacitated; basic gives a negligible 15% chance, but aced buffs it to a much more reliable 45%.</li><li> The Thanatos sniper rifle. It can kill anything but Dozers in a single hit anywhere on the body, pierces through thick armor, and can kill those aforementioned Dozers themselves in three hits. Most players equip this sniper rifle when on a sniper-heavy map, such as Undercover or Cook Off.</li><li> The baseball bat, for melee weapons. It's tied for highest damage for a melee weapon, but also has significant knockdown power and the longest range of any melee weapon.

The "Ukrainian Job" heist even comes with an achievement for abusing C4; "Let's do th-": Complete the heist in under 30 seconds by charging to the safe, blowing the door off, and rushing back to the escape van. The C4 and Trip Mines are also given separate ammo counters, allowing a maximum of 6 C4 alongside 14 trip mines, meaning you can use trip mines offensively <em>and</em> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereWasADoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereWasADoor">blowing a security door apart.</a><ul><li> The Fire Axe.

Although they are still possible to fool or break, cameras sound the alarm if you stay in their view for too long (at which point not even breaking them will call off the incoming alarm) or destroy too many of them. In addition, the majority of the time, a guard will be paged to investigate any broken cameras, and if one sees it, they trigger the alarm. On the flip side, certain heists have security centers or purchasable camera access points that let you use the cameras to see what's going on in other areas. Killing the guard assigned to the security room renders the cameras harmless to players.<ul><li> Your concealment level makes a difference as to whether or not a camera can spot you, with heavy armor and big guns grabbing its attention instantly, while a two-piece suit and high-concealment weapons let you stand in its view for two or three seconds before the detection meter starts (slowly) rising.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedEquipment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedEquipment">Informed Equipment</a>: This happens with some weapons, as weapons need pretty high visibility to make you more noticeable.

While it makes sense to quietly do this if going stealthily, if you go loud, there's no reason why the crew doesn't just cross the Rose Garden and crash through one of the Oval Office's windows or the glass door to the Garden. Especially since, by the time you open the door to the West Wing, security lowers barriers over the doors and windows that you must breach with thermite.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew">Interface Screw</a>: Smoke grenades block your vision in the affected area as it has done in the first game. New to the sequel are flashbangs which create a flash and a loud noise to blind you and make you deaf for several seconds. You can lessen the effects of a flashbang by looking away at the right moment and the Enforcer has a skill to weaken flashbang effects as well. Flashbangs were changed back in 2016's "Hoxton's Housewarming Party" event, by making flashbangs actual projectiles, and once they land nearby, they can be destroyed by shooting them or hitting them with a melee attack. Doing this enough times nets you an achievement; simply called "Denied".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceSpoiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceSpoiler">Interface Spoiler</a>: In Rats day one, Bain sometimes reads out the wrong ingredient, which can cause you to blow the lab if he suddenly corrects himself <em>after</em> you add the indicated ingredient.

Players can spam attacks with the money wad to permanently stunlock enemies, which can buy you some time on stealth runs if you need to neutralize a guard but don't have any pagers left.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">Legacy Character</a>: The Hoxton alias that originally belonged to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeanBrit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeanBrit">Mean Brit</a> from the first game.

Even for straight gunfighting, all but the heaviest armor and largest guns tend to phase out in favor of highly-mobile dodge-based builds as the difficulty increases.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a>: Most missions can be approached with stealth, but factors like the AI Director and general luck greatly influence your success. If the stealth fails, you can still beat the level, just with more difficulty.<ul><li> The <em>Rats</em> heist is heavily luck-based, though most of the random elements are limited to Day 2. Day 1 is rather predictable, except occasionally Bain will tell you the wrong ingredient. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note282mk7');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note282mk7" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note282mk7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Not everyone hears the 'wrong' ingredient, so asking your team what they heard can prevent you from adding the wrong thing</span> For Day 2, you have to trade the meth you cooked in Day 1 (and kept through the Escape sequence afterwards, if there was one) with some gangsters and the deal can go sour if you failed to bring the minimum of 3 bags, and WILL go sour if you didn't bring any. However, if you do have meth, there are still several uncontrollable variables, such as if the gangsters decide to screw you over or if the cops just happen to turn up. Day 3 has no variance other than the C4 in the bus, which cannot be disarmed if you failed to take the intel from Day 2.</li><li> The Harvest and Trustee bank (Random version). There's always a chance the vault is empty, meaning you have to break into the safety deposit boxes. Granted, it's easily done with a saw, but lacking one means <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">you have to start picking into each and every one until the team can scrape enough together.</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note292hm3');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note292hm3" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note292hm3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">If you just want to leave ASAP, there's a little-known workaround: once the outer vault door is open, all you need to do is pick up sufficient loose cash to trigger an exit. The cash lying around in the teller area is enough, or you can pop an ATM, but you have to wait for the door to open; if you got bored and cleaned up while waiting, you'll still have to pick. OTOH you don't even need the inner cage door open.</span></li><li> The Armored Transport heist has a small chance of spawning military blueprints, which you will need if you wish to play the Train Heist.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note30d497');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note30d497" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note30d497');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">No longer true: as of Update #57, Train Heist is a separate job and picking up the blueprints does not trigger it.</span> Another smaller element in these jobs is that, on higher difficulty levels, the game can decide to spawn a massively-armored and highly dangerous Bulldozer enemy in the back of one of the armored trucks, just to keep you on your toes when opening them up. The type of loot you need to secure is also random ranging from easy to move (jewelry) to a pain in the ass to haul (gold).</li><li> Mallcrashers on Death Wish has an interesting variation. There are two police officers standing out front drinking coffee. Because Death Wish increases sight ranges, it is possible for these two officers to detect you and raise the alarm almost as soon as you load into the map unless you back up immediately. You probably weren't going to stealth it anyway, though, right?</li><li> GO Bank is so random it's cruel, especially as achievements require a zero alarm run and/or zero civilian casualties. Even if everything is perfect, stealth runs mean you <strong>must</strong> take a call to confirm the vault unlock, and the said caller can randomly ask to speak with "Barney" to confirm, or can be a police chief demanding to speak with an officer; if Bain can't convince them otherwise, either of the callers will send enemies to check out the bank <em>and then raise the alarm when they don't report back things are fine.</em> In other words, unless you're willing to leave a chunk of loot, you'll being forfeiting stealth achievements and XP and, since the driver flees at first alarm, you have to do the tedious "Plan B" method.<ul><li> If that isn't bad enough, do note that several random factors can sabotage the mission. Not only do passing civilians frequently spawn into the map, but even cops can sometimes walk past and sound the alarm; even one of the portable toilets out back can randomly open, resulting in a bank guard wandering in from the back <em>without warning.</em> Throw in things like, for example, how a blackmailer can call and demand you throw a cash bag over a fence or he calls the cops, and you've got some unleaded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">Fake Difficulty</a>. Finally, the vault is almost always secured by motion-sensing lasers, so it only takes <em>one</em> person on the team not knowing about them to rush in and ruin the stealth in the mission's final moments. Plus, the lasers <em>move</em> in a semi-random pattern, taking massive amounts of either luck or pattern-observation to get through the door safely. Repeatedly, since there is no way to disable them even once inside.</li><li> Not even Plan B is safe from the RNG gods. While you can buy the Ace Pilot asset to have a better chance that the pilot will use the roof as the extraction point for the loot, there will be times where the pilot will refuse to use the roof and opt to either use the street (which is filled with cops) or the parking lot (shootout for snipers) to pick up the loot. When the time comes for the pilot to pick up the loot, he can miss <em>several times in a row</em> if you're unlucky enough and each miss forces you to wait several more minutes until the pilot circles around to try again. If you're REALLY unlucky, the pilot can get shot down and crash, causing the loot bags that you secured to be scattered all over the place and force you to move them yourselves through the sewers while under a time limit. Even if the snag is successful, there's a chance the pilot just flew away with an empty cage because the cops took all the bags out before the pilot got there.</li><li> Basically the only thing about this heist that can be said to remain consistent is that 2 guards and 6 cameras will always spawn in the beginning... and the level geometry doesn't change. Everything else is completely up in the air, but it can also be to your benefit (Hillary can be fooled, and 1% of the time the vault can be completely open, lasers deactivated and the phone calls will never come).</li></ul></li><li> Being a purely stealth-based heist, Shadow Raid can be a lot easier or tougher depending of randomized elements in the map. Chief among them, there is a chopper that has a high chance to spawn minutes into the mission, carrying a varying amount of guards which will start patrolling. Plus, those guards may simply stay still, guarding key access points that you need to pass in order to access the loot. On the other hand, it's possible that the chopper won't bring any guards, but leave a crate containing a valuable but extremely heavy artifact.<ul><li> The assets available for purchase on this mission are incredibly useful, but completely unreliable. A loot-bag drop off point in the form of a zip line behind the warehouse, where plenty of loot is but not close to any other drop off locations? Good! A 50% chance for that zip line to spawn on the roof, away from all loot and lead back to the start of the level, completely eliminating the purpose of it? Bad. Another alternate drop off point, allowing you to throw loot over the main fence to instantly be collected in the courtyard, the location with arguably half the loot in the job? Good! A <em>25%</em> chance for that to be there, where otherwise the drop off point is in the form of one of three dumpsters, all of which are right next to the starting drop off point anyway? <em>Very</em> bad. Naturally, there's no way to tell where these are going to spawn until after you've already started the heist and spent the money. This however, was mitigated a bit by a later patch which enabled Preplanning.</li></ul></li><li> It's rare but possible for five guards to spawn in Ukrainian Job. If you don't know this and try to stealth the mission by getting all the guards down, as is standard procedure, then you'll run out of pagers and the alarm will go off.</li><li> If you do Election Day loud, there is a 50% chance that Bain will get the wrong location for day 2 if you only hack the computer once. Hack it twice and it bumps it to 25% chance. There is no way to guarantee the warehouse on a loud way (fortunately, the map is very easy to ECM rush).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LumberMillMayhem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LumberMillMayhem">Lumber Mill Mayhem</a>: The "Boiling Point" heist takes the crew to a remote russian lumber mill where a secret russian organization is doing research on super soldiers.

This includes 8 possible locations for the vault, which has to be opened from the side that is on the top, which is even more annoying, because the lack of cover means that most of the cops all around the hillsides will spot you and start firing, forcing you to stay away from whatever needs to be done, such as to fix the drilling sequence, until the heat dies down. The vault itself uses the water trick to open, so that's drilling and pumping water and blowing it up.

While the glass cutter in the first game was used only to extract the rare red diamond, the tool returns in the sequel to be used to steal optional loot without setting off the alarms. Another nod to the first game comes in the form of a puzzle you need to solve to obtain the diamond by carefully stepping on the correct tiles while stepping on the wrong one releases gas into the room, which is a reference to the secret vault in the First World Bank with a similar puzzle. To drive the point further home, the assault music for the heist is a remixed version of the original Diamond Heist's theme.</li><li> The original game's sole DLC was the "Wolf Pack", the major additions of which were a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeLauncher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeLauncher">Grenade Launcher</a> (the GL40) and two heists (Counterfeit and Undercover). Eventually, among all the other DLC <em>PAYDAY 2</em> has received, it got its own version of the "Wolf Pack" - the major additions with it being a different Grenade Launcher (the China Puff 40mm, since the GL40 came with a much earlier DLC) and ports of the same two heists as the original.

Mask mods were obtained too frequently over other payday bonuses, so the drop rate for mask mods were scaled down and a money bonus card was added to keep things interesting.</li><li> The Cable Guy skill used to allow the user to have 10 cable ties but it was reduced down to 5 ties after the developers saw players were easily tying up every hostage in the level to do stealth with little trouble; this was eventually pushed up to six ties with the skill, alongside the ability to rarely replenish ties from ammo boxes, enough to have up to nine hostages tied down with the skill.</li><li> The Mastermind's Dominator skill used to allow the player to intimidate multiple cops at once, making some stealth portions of a heist extremely easy.

While the latter could be expected given the odd situations it causes (such as a jokered guard calling in a busted camera, breaking your stealth attempt), the former was completely out of left field.

One interesting difference from its inspiration is that, for the most part, these remade heists are explicitly the <em>second</em> time the gang hits the location in question, which the characters will sometimes comment on.<ul><li> First World Bank, as of the 2015 CrimeFest, makes a return from the previous game and it plays exactly like before while having some minor changes and randomizations to make it feel a little different. Unlike in the original version, it's possible to finish the heist in stealth, with the addition of an insider who directs you on how to sneak through if you keep things quiet.</li><li> Slaughterhouse was added a few days later as well, featuring similar upgrades as First World Bank. Unlike First World Bank, this heist still can't be done in stealth.</li><li> In February 2016, the game got its own version of the first game's Wolf Pack DLC - including ports of the same Counterfeit and Undercover heists the original added, again featuring a few upgrades and changes, most noticably the ability to actually print counterfeit money at the end of the former. As a bonus, owners of the first game's Wolf Pack got this version for free.</li><li> The Hoxton's Housewarming Party event added a remade Panic Room heist on the last day.</li><li> The Search for Kento event added another two remade heists, with Heat Street coming on day 2 and Green Bridge on day 10, both with minor changes, both to gameplay as well as to their story to fit in with the event in question (such as the Chinese prisoner from Green Bridge being replaced with a Yakuza member named Kazuo).</li><li> Crimefest 2018 added the No Mercy heist, with small changes in the lore to fit the current storyline.

If even a <em>single</em> player is 5 inches away when the timer expires, the entire day is failed. While this behavior has been in Payday 2 since launch, it was exceedingly rare that this situation would come up, as the only non-escape heists that have this are the stealth-only heists, GO Bank (free DLC), the technically-an-escape Train Heist (paid DLC, bonus contract for the longest time). Of these, the stealth-only heists are the most likely heists where this can happen, due to it being possible to trigger the point of no return before the mission objectives had been completed, since it's triggered by setting off the alarm and breaking stealth.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheFallThatKillsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheFallThatKillsYou">Not the Fall That Kills You</a>: Falling from a great height will either severely damage your health or instantly incapacitate you, depending on the distance.

The developers then patched the game to include escape sequences in the most farmed levels if the players finish them loud instead of quiet in order to discourage them from farming the same level over and over. Additional patches also changed the layout of the Nightclub heist so the safe with the money is in a random location in order to discourage farming.<ul><li> The Death Wish update enhanced this further by introducing EXP reduction if you play the same level over and over while giving you an EXP boost on heists you haven't played in a while. The same update also introduced an anti-level grinding feature for the Death Wish version of Rats on day 1; trying to blow up the lab so you can skip cooking the meth? The lab still explodes, but the explosion and fire covers the <em>entire level</em>. Even if you try get around this, the escape van is programmed to never show up unless you cooked 3 bags of meth.</li><li> Newer stealth maps are being made resistant to the controversial tactic of ECM rushing. The Bomb Dockyard is impossible to rush since the Moretta takes so long to change berths. You can rush Car Shop, but breaking <em>anything</em> glass will set off the alarm and it's almost impossible to avoid someone (you or a guard) shooting a window during a rush since the whole front of the shop and half the second-floor interior are windows. Additionally, in Hoxton's Revenge your <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ECMs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ECMs">EC Ms</a> mess up the timelock on the panic room and it stops counting down when an ECM is active.</li><li> Update #75 changed the exp system from a set amount of exp per heist to a variable range, where you start out with a base set of exp and gain additional ones based on objectives being completed and loot secured. This was due to players sitting in Crime Net trying to "snipe" heists to get massive amounts of exp without doing any work, as well as people doing just the bare minimum of objectives and leaving the majority of the money behind since they usually take a long time. The most notable of these changes is Shadow Raid; prior to the patch you would receive almost 1 million in exp upon completion. Now even with many infamy points you would only receive about 300k on the highest difficulty unless you looted every piece of loot and the armor.</li><li> Jewelry Store can still be solo-ECM-rushed in under 30 seconds on Normal, and under 18 seconds with a coordinated team.

The gun's damage output is absurdly high and it has great concealment, which makes the Judge a perfect weapon to use for stealth as a backup plan if stealth fails. The Judge can also be fitted with a suppressor for stealth runs, a laser sight to aid in hip firing, and scopes for better iron sight aiming. Not only that, but because the Judge is a revolver, all the shells are reloaded at the same time rather than the one shell a time that most shotguns go by, <em>and</em> it benefits from the Enforcer's shotgun buffs. The only downsides to the gun are: extremely poor accuracy; low ammo count (25 shells total with Fully Loaded only giving another six); and, unlike most other community weapons, it costs almost a million (especially the Akimbo variant) to purchase.</li><li> One of the weapon rebalances that came about during the 2015 Crimefest, and which wasn't fixed until that Christmas, turned <em>every</em> pistol into some variety of this. Even the smallest, weakest pistols, with suppressors and the like that lowered their total damage, still dealt as much per-bullet as an assault rifle; slightly bigger ones were so damaging that below Overkill difficulty you almost didn't <em>need</em> a primary weapon. Even after they were nerfed, there are still some non-Judge standouts; the page image for this trope, in fact, shows off the "Baby Deagle" pistol (a Jericho 941) dealing three times the damage per-bullet as an AK-74.</li><li> The 5/7 AP pistol (FN Five-seven FDE) not only has a fairly high damage stats, but it will also pierce armor; it's also easily useable in a stealth build. The drawbacks? Hilariously poor accuracy, an excruciatingly low ammo pool and pickup rate (for every ammobox you pick up, you retrieve <em>a quarter of a bullet!</em>), and a fairly long reload time. This, coupled with a high rate of fire makes it <em>very easy</em> to chew through your entire ammo reserve.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a>:<ul><li> Hoxton, albeit briefly.

Hoxton burns down the original safehouse, explicitly granted to the gang in 2013, in 2016.

This is still a viable strategy, particularly for those players who prefer submachine guns over sniper rifles and shotguns. Light machine guns with decent accuracy and a bipod can work as well, if you can handle staying in one place and letting the Dozer unload back at you.<ul><li> Also, during stealth, detection of players is based solely on whether or not a direct line can be drawn from a guard or civilian's head hitbox to the player's. In certain maps with thick walls, a player can crouch in the corner and look directly down &mdash; the character's head will clip through the wall, and the player will go undetected as a guard passes behind him inches away (unless the guard actually bumps into the player). Most easily done on Shadow Raid, in the warehouse stairwell.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenaissanceMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenaissanceMan">Renaissance Man</a>: Encouraged. Since it's impossible to ace every ability of even <strong>one</strong> class, the overlap of abilities (e.g. Mastermind can carry more zipties, which is useful to a Ghost) means players are better off mixing and matching some skills. There are also plenty of high-level synergies, such as the Techforcer combo for massive amounts of armour. There is a Steam achievement called "I'm a Healer-Tank-Damage-Dealer" earned after spending 10 skill points in each skill tree.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolversAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolversAreJustBetter">Revolvers Are Just Better</a>: The Judge, a revolver that fires shotgun shells, somehow deals more damage than full sized shotguns despite using smaller shells. The Bronco also does more base damage than most of the other pistols. The Matever and Peacemaker revolvers are also pocket snipers in a pinch, though both suffer from strong recoil and long reload times, respectively.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>: Many of the optional safes and deposit boxes would have nothing but a partially eaten cheese toast sandwich. The toast came back in a massive pile in one of the large safes during the Halloween event and the toast was quietly removed from the game. Big Bank brought the toast back for the safe in the manager's office and one of the news feeds in the level shows sales of Cheese Toast Inc. had a rise in stocks. After the addition of the new safehouse with Hoxton's Housewarming Party, one of the trophies you can get for the safehouse is a partially-eaten cheese toast sandwich, unlocked for finding the partially-eaten cheese toast sandwich in the manager's safe in Big Bank - the name of which, "It's Not Even Fresh..." alluding to the ridiculousness.<ul><li> To say nothing of the rare giant "Almir's Toast" in the Xmas Heist.

Unfortunately, several post-release patches gave the shotguns an arbitrary cutoff past which they won't do any damage, thus playing this trope straight.<ul><li> Averted again with the Gage Shotgun DLC, which not only allows the player to load several different types of shells, from buckshot to slugs to explosive shells, but also makes the the shotguns decently long-ranged again with standard loads. Anything beyond ten to fifteen feet will take reduced damage from buckshot, but will still hit. Effectively, the range was corrected, but the lethality range was kept the same.</li><li> Shotgun spread itself is played differently from other games; unlike other games the shotguns in <em>PAYDAY</em> deal full damage if any pellets hit the target, and will cause a headshot in the same way. However, more than one pellet hitting the target will not increase the damage whatsoever, making it actually efficient to use the shotgun in the way it works in real life; to compensate for a lack of accuracy (you can shoot in the general direction and as long as one pellet hits, it's like the whole shell has hit, also allowing for easy multi-kills with one shell).</li><li> Due to the way shotguns work, this actually makes the Accuracy stat work in reverse; Accuracy in the game increases the likelihood of the shot landing to the center of the screen (where the crosshairs would be on another FPS). With shotguns however this reduces pellet spread, actually making it <em>harder</em> to hit something on target. Outside of messing around with slug rounds (which trade off the multiple pellets for armor-piercing capability), this completely invalidates a skill that increases shotgun accuracy, and means that people will actively mod their shotguns with <em>lower</em> accuracy to make them <em>better</em> at hitting stuff.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunsAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunsAreJustBetter">Shotguns Are Just Better</a>: Shotguns are very popular among players for several reasons. They are unquestionably the king of CQB but can also offer a lot of versatility between different types of ammunition - buckshot for extra power, flechettes to allow the shotgun to pierce armour and achieve parity with rifles at medium ranges, slugs and dragon's breath rounds to punch through shields, etc. They rival sniper rifles as the most powerful non-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">BFG</a> weapons in the game if a player puts points in the Shotgunner skill tree, but even without skill point investment they still pack a serious punch. And they have the most mechanical variety within any weapon class in the game - break-open, tubular or clip magazine, pump-action or fully automatic.<ul><li> The Locomotive is widely considered to be one of the best secondary weapon choices in the game. It has all the previously stated strengths of a shotgun, and it can also deal with Bulldozers very quickly due to its high stopping power and rather fast firing rate by shotgun standards. It is an excellent backup weapon for a sniper, machine-gunner or other heavy weapons specialist, and with the right mods it can achieve the same Concealment rating as a pistol at 26, so stealth players can get a lot of mileage out of it as well.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ShoutOut/PAYDAY2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ShoutOut/PAYDAY2">Has its own page.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShovelStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShovelStrike">Shovel Strike</a>: The K.L.A.S.

Likewise, you also get to carry engine parts at one point and you move even slower with them on your back than gold does while jumping is restricted to just an inch high.</li><li> The landscape of Washington D.C. isn't perfect, but it looks close enough to its real life counterpart.

As in most stealth games, guards have very poor peripheral senses, and can only really see what's directly in front of them. They mostly won't notice when normally locked doors have been opened, either. However, god forbid if you shoot a window or camera along their path, because they <em>will</em> notice it and proceed to call in the national guard to purge the entire area.

The drawback is that the gun doesn't have many rounds (it only has 20 bullets, 10 in a clip), and even with skills to boost the clip, it's an odd case of a weapon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse">simply being too OP to be useful</a> as the comparatively weaker sniper rifles have more ammo in reserve and can work in dodge builds.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys">Those Two Guys</a>: On Jewelry Store and Mallcrashers, you may notice a pair of off-duty police officers buying food.

In levels with stealth, if you go loud, your objective(s) may either change or adapt to the situation. The trope is more apparent in day 1 of Watchdogs where Bain summons Bile to airlift you out of dodge if your escape driver is killed by the police.<ul><li> And should Plan B fail in day 1, or the players mess up Plan A by tagging the wrong truck during Election Day, Bain comes up with a <em>Plan C</em>, which is to distract the cops by doing a bank heist while "accidentally" destroying the ballot machines.

The same goes for Day 2 of the heist <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> likely due to it being an improvisation on Hoxton's part</span>.</li><li> Most Loud-Only Heists have only Plan "B" as, obviously, you can't stealth them. In addition, some of The Dentist's Stealthable heists have a Plan B <em>for Plan B</em>, usually different escape plans that cost Favours; the more it costs the easier it is (with usually the most easy one costing almost all of the available favours for the given heist).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Title Drop</a>: A knowingly cheesy and homophonic one.

Since you cannot remove materials or colors applied to a mask, you better make damn sure that the colors and patterns you want on a certain mask are the ones you want to stay. Most players will never use their rare materials. Likewise the Thanatos .50 cal rifle and the rocket launcher are usually saved for the bigger nasties since the sniper rifle requires more ammo pickups compare to a standard gun and the rocket launcher can only get ammo from an ammo bag.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Took a Level in Badass</a>: The entire police force has received a significant upgrade since the last game. Not only the cops and SWAT units are more durable, they are also smarter by flanking you, pulling back and taking cover when needed, and bashing you with the butt of their guns if you try to take them on very closely. Cops are also smart enough to steal your loot bags if you leave them unattended. The Gage Weapons Pack #2 update also gave cops the ability to use knives against you.<ul><li> Cloakers have been <em>vastly</em> upgraded from the original game. Their original straight kick has been upgraded to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceLee">Bruce Lee</a>-like flying kick with an incredible range of at least 15 feet, and instead of charging players like other police units they now camp behind furniture or around corners in order to ambush players with their instant-down attack. They are also scripted to spawn right on top of you via air vents or sewer holes the moment you pass near. They also have a <em>lot</em> more health, having about 6 times as much health as the standard SWAT mooks, though they take significant damage from headshots.</li><li> Street cops can now use the Bronco .44 (a freaking hand cannon!)</li><li> The crew in shows shades of the trope; while they still rob the usual stuff like banks and stores for cash and jewels, they also raid an <em>FBI branch office</em> to steal intel and they also and steal <em>fusion engine parts</em> that could lead the way to renewable energy. Of course, the crew still get paid quite handsomely for their efforts. The Big Bank also gives you the chance to rob a bank that hasn't been successfully robbed for over 200 years.</li><li> Some of the weapons from the previous game also get quite a hefty boost in the sequel; the Locomotive shotgun was considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeWeapon">Joke Weapon</a> in the first game due to its short range and not so great power, but the same gun in the sequel now has a lot of power and decent range.</li><li> The entire SWAT force got a badass upgrade in the Death Wish update. The new SWAT teams can hit harder, move faster, and have better accuracy than their tan FBI counterparts. The Bulldozer also got a major upgrade by not only having his faceplate painted with a skull on it, but also carries a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">light machine gun</a>, the same heavy and fast firing weapons that players can use.</li><li> Vlad, of all people, took a level in Badass in Meltdown <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when he asks you to steal live (but mercifully not armed) nuclear warheads.</span> The crew itself also took a level in the mission as Bain initially deemed an all-out assault on the Murkywater compound to be too dangerous, but now has you assaulting the facility in broad daylight.</li><li> A minor one for Chavez, who was a mission critical NPC from the first game in the Panic Room heist. In the first game, Chavez is treated as a civilian and can be tied up. In the remake of the heist, Chavez is not only wearing body armor, but he also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">dual wields pistols</a> and will fight back. He can also withstand plenty of headshots despite not wearing a helmet.</li><li> The Hoxtons Housewarming Party added Mayhem and One Down (later reworked to Death Sentence) difficulties, the cops have gotten even more badass. However, the real badassery starts when people play Death Sentence and go up against ZEAL Team, a group of elite forces that make absolute mincemeat out of players. Even normal security guards on that difficulty can take a lot more punishment, but they're better than facing ZEAL Team.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainJob">Train Job</a>: Originally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusLevel">Bonus Level</a>, but as of Update #57, it is a separate heist called "Armoured Transport: Train", where you have to secure a turret and its ammo from an idle train.<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in the "The Bomb: Forest" heist. This time, they derail the train by blowing up a bridge and raid the wreckage for a thermobaric bomb.</li><li> Day 2 of the Biker Heist, which sees the heisters landing on a train in-motion, fighting to the front of the train through both hostile bikers and police, retrieving a specific piece of loot from the front of the train, then fighting again to the back of the train to deposit the loot.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrialAndErrorGameplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrialAndErrorGameplay">Trial-and-Error Gameplay</a>: Every heist, though moreso for stealth missions. Since spawns can make-or-break missions, and even render some stealth games <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake">unwinnable without alert</a> in certain circumstances, expect to restart an entire day on a single factor.<ul><li> Also the reason that Pro Jobs were initially added. Players got a higher cash prize, but cannot restart as failure kicked players back to the lobby. With no restarts available, the Trial-And-Error aspect becomes even more of a chore, requiring players to keep re-buying a map to guarantee another attempt. Pro jobs were eventually removed entirely with the Hoxton's Housewarming Party update.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a>: The crew. All the money and all the gold in the world doesn't convince Dallas to work with the Dentist. But as soon as the Dentist alludes to Hoxton's arrest and shows that he has Hoxton's transfer schedule on hand, Dallas doesn't bat an eyelid before accepting the nebulous deal. Also, one of Dallas's potential lines when succeeding at a heist is "Tightest crew ever!" Likewise, in the Hoxton Breakout trailer, Houston actually dives in front of Chains in order to shield him from gunfire (which ends up flooring Houston) - granted, he has a bulletproof vest and so can take the hits, but still, that's a level of loyalty that money can't buy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruerToTheText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruerToTheText">Truer to the Text</a>: The Scarface Mansion in the eponymous heist is a fairly faithful recreation of the one seen in the film, not the one that exists in reality. Changes made include making the driveway leading to the house being filled with flowers, the removal of a balcony in the main lobby, with everything else being created from scratch simply because we never see the rest of it on-camera <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3073452/California-mansion-Scarface-movie-market-17-9million-wanted-buy-35million-year.html#v-4225117093001">Though amusingly, the Mansion in-game is near the ocean, yet the real-life mansion is surrounded by trees on all sides.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncomfortableElevatorMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncomfortableElevatorMoment">Uncomfortable Elevator Moment</a>: Played with in the "Beneath The Mountain" Heist. A third of the way through the heist, your crew gets into an airlock, and you're stuck in an airlock for a good twenty seconds, and you're put in an awkward situation where nobody in the crew can really do anything while inside said airlock asides from stock up on ammo and patch up wounds and wait for the second airlock door to open. Bear in mind that there are SWAT teams on both sides of the airlock doors, so standing in the middle of a Loud heist doing absolutely nothing is a very strange thing to endure....<div class="indent"> Locke: Any second now!..(hums to himself)...does anybody know any jokes?</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndesirablePrize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndesirablePrize">Undesirable Prize</a>: Completing a heist allows you to earn a bonus item through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomDrop">Random Drop</a> system, ranging from weapon mods, masks, mask mods, extra cash, and extra experience points. Many players groan in disappointment when they get the cash card after already having several million dollars in spending cash, yet another completely useless mask pattern or color when they already have all their masks customized how they want, or an attachment that's a copy of one they already have and don't use or is for a weapon they don't own or plan to use. Suffice to say, whatever you <em>don't</em> want from the card drop is probably what you're going to get. The Offshore Payday option added around late 2016 has assisted in this, as the player can decide what they want and then "safe" any or all of the cards so that it will definitely have what they want, though at the cost of a good chunk of money from the otherwise-unusable (except for going Infamous the first five times) offshore account.<ul><li> Safes made this even worse from when they were first added up until Update 100. Instead of getting anything useful, you could end up with a safe that holds a random weapon skin... and requiring you to spend nearly $3 in real life just to open it. Technically, you could also get a drill instead of having to buy one, but they were naturally <em>far</em> more rare than safes - and there's also the possibility that the drill would be for a safe type you don't have. Even with the safes able to be opened for free now, there's still always the possibility that the skin you get is for a weapon you don't own and/or have any plans to use... or is even for something from a DLC you don't own. Though this is mitigated by the Steam Marketplace, where you can sell the skin if you don't have the weapon for it/ you don't like it/ <em>have gotten for the 5th time.</em></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGameplayChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGameplayChange">Unexpected Gameplay Change</a>: The Car Shop in more ways than one. Similar to Shadow Raid, it is a stealth-only heist. Unlike Shadow Raid, you start in casing mode instead of wearing your mask already, and with the exception of a handful of guards there are no enemies and a few civilians, whereas Shadow Raid at least had the highly trained Murkywater mercenaries. And finally, instead of bagging the loot, you get into a car and <em>drive away with them.</em><ul><li> The Hotline Miami heist takes this even further. On the first day, you kill all of the Commissar's henchmen in a motel, set their cars on fire, and blow up their gas station just to get the Commissar's attention. The second day has you confronting the Commissar himself within his penthouse and when you get there, you need to use a thermal drill to pop open the vault he sealed himself into while defending yourself from swarms of cops, snipers, and the Commissar's gunship! If that wasn't enough, the Commissar himself has nearly the same amount of health as a Bulldozer and he also wields a light machine gun to boot. The entire heist is done just to get the crew one step closer to breaking out Hoxton.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake">Unwinnable by Mistake</a>: Mission-critical notes, such as Day 2 on the Big Oil heist, the recipes in Hotline Miami and the whiteboard in Car Shop used to be too blurry to read on lower texture settings. Update #105.2 fixed this.<dl><dd><ul><li> Averted in Day 2 of the Watchdogs heist. Any of the bags that you throw into the water, either by mistake (from not realizing the boat that comes to get it has a limit on how much it can carry, for instance) or intent (just from the less-jerkish possibilities, there's an achievement for throwing a bag in the water here making fun of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyGhosts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyGhosts">Call of Duty: Ghosts</a></em>'s "innovative" fish AI) will respawn at the truck where they were at the start. Of course, with waves of FBI likely between you and that truck at this point, it might be as close to unwinnable as possible without <em>actually</em> being unwinnable. Shadow Raid gets a better aversion, as any bags that end up in the water near the zipline you send them off on will just respawn right next to that zipline.</li></ul></dd></dl><ul><li> Hotline Miami has a section where you have to torch 4 cars with gas cans. However, more than 4 gas cans and cars spawn. Before a patch, if more than 4 cars were torched before the mission objective disappeared (which can happen if two players shoot two gas cans at the exact same moment) the mission logic glitched and the next objective never came.</li><li> Sometimes the RNG can result in oddly-specific setups, such as having the Vault directly in front of a camera on Day 3 of Framing Frame.</li><li> A rare bug can occur on Day 1 of Hoxton Breakout if a player other than the host grabs the parking ticket. When a player leaves/disconnects or goes into custody, key items like the parking ticket are supposed to transfer to the next viable player. If the player disconnects <em>while</em> going into custody, the two scripts conflict and only get as far as removing the parking ticket from that player's inventory, without transferring it to another player, which results in the entire day being unwinnable as the team no longer has the key item necessary to unlock the escape sequence.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUsualAdversaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUsualAdversaries">The Usual Adversaries</a>: Gensec.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VariableMix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VariableMix">Variable Mix</a>: There are a few different tracks that can play during a heist, with varying levels of intensity - this often leads to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicalSpoiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicalSpoiler">Musical Spoiler</a>, as the music will start to build up about ten or fifteen seconds before a police assault wave actually starts. Stealth Heists like Shadow Raid, Yacht Heist and Murky Station deserve special mentions as the music changes in response to the progression of the heist instead of the status of an assault wave. There are usually at least three different mixes: the starting mix (which is timid), a slightly more intense mix that starts up closer to your goal, and the "alert" mix/buildup. The Yacht heist has <em>eleven stages to its soundtrack!</em></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">Video Game Cruelty Potential</a>: You can kill innocent civilians for no reason as they try to run away from you or call the police, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs">or even tie them up, and then kill them.</a> The hostage with a bomb tied to him in the Hotline Miami heist can be blown up with gunfire before or after saving him and killing him has no effect on the game at all. In some stealth runs, it's encouraged - shooting a civilian about to run and call the cops, or see the entire bank taken hostage, and taking the $3,000 or so penalty is a drop in the ocean, compared to the $6,000,000+ payout. Impatient players can also quickly wipe out an entire bank to find the manager and his keycard. It doesn't help that the game still considers a mission "Stealthed" as long as the alarm isn't raised, and the quickest and easiest way to do this is to drop an ECM and <em>murder every living thing on the map</em>.<ul><li> Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> with the BBQ Pack, where one can <em>incinerate</em> civilians.</li><li> Combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Disproportionate Retribution</a> in the Counterfeit Heist, where you can murder Mitchel, Wilson and all of their friends and families just because you want to steal their money printer.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPunishment">Video Game Cruelty Punishment</a>: Having an itchy trigger finger around civilians not only instantly saps your spending cash as a penalty, but also causes you to have a higher chance of being forced to do an escape sequence after the heist.

Due to the rampant cheating from people who used said cheats to boost their levels to the max, legitimate players that have reached the maximum infamy level are often kicked out of many games because people assume that maximum infamy is a cheater's calling card. Doubly so for max-infamy players who have their Steam profiles set to private, since many people assume private profiles means that person has something to hide, and acting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">Properly Paranoid</a> because of it. The same happens in reverse, where people will kick low level players because they believe they might screw them over due to lack of available weapons and character skills. Justified on high-difficulties such as Death Sentence, but complete nonsense on Overkill or Below.</li><li> Taken up to eleven with the "Dodge VS Armor" debate, where on loud heists you can get kicked for wearing too much armor, too little armor, or the <em>wrong kind of armor</em>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note515oyj');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note515oyj" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note515oyj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Dodge Build abuses the Dodge mechanic by avoiding damage altogether, but requires the player to equip themselves very lightly, resulting in someone who can't contribute much unless they have a very specific build. If they're also unlucky or unskilled, they will go down within the first 2 minutes of the heist going loud. Armor builds suffer from something similar in that it takes fully upgrading two specific skill trees to be survivable in heavy armor, and even then you're slowed to a snail's crawl the moment you have anything on your back, dragging everyone down to cover your ass as you crawl along a map. And god help you if you want to come in with anything in between; on lower levels it's forgivable but on Overkill or Death Wish, you better pick one or the other or else everyone will instantly brand you as dead weight, before unceremoniously giving you the boot.</span></li><li> There are several exploits within the game that seasoned veterans like and will exploit, as in some cases they're the only way you can survive on Death Wish. Grab a keycard on Hox Breakout when everyone else was trying to dupe it? Kick. Turn on the sprinklers on Hotline Miami Day 2 after someone just braved the fire to fix the drill? Kick. Take the Thermite before people could dupe it? Kick. Of course, there are people that will do the exact opposite and will kick anyone that even dares to suggest to go for any of these exploits on purpose.</li><li> It gets worse when you play Rats or Cook Off on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Death Wish or Death Sentence</a> as hosts start designating who cooks the meth. If you aren't one and even happen to pick up an ingredient...</li><li> The addition of microtransactions with weapon skins exacerbated the problem even further by people who will kick anyone on sight if they are using paid skin mods. This is due to the community's <em>overwhelming</em> negative response to the microtransaction system and believing that punishing the players who support it would send the devs a message. It even continued <em>after</em> the mandatory microtransactions were removed!</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDontLookLikeYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDontLookLikeYou">You Don't Look Like You</a>: An audio version, since we never see Bain's face (up until Hell's Island). A lot of the earlier heists (Ukrainian Job being the most obvious due to inordinate amounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinueYourMissionDammit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinueYourMissionDammit">chatter</a>) have Bain sound more like he does in <em>PAYDAY: The Heist</em>, quite unlike his present radio filter.<ul><li> On a lesser note, Hoxton and his live-action counterpart. Hoxton is played by Josh Lenn, while his Voice is Pete Gold.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveResearchedBreathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveResearchedBreathing">You Have Researched Breathing</a>: Some of the weapons have folding/telescoping stocks, but you have to actually <em>pay money</em> to fold/extend some of them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a>: Cops don't rush in as much as they used to in the first game, preferring to strategically flank you instead.
