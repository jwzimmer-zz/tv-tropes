It contains a very detailed setting and a well-designed scenario, as well as <em>vast</em> amounts of political backstory in the game's libraries, newspapers, and legends. The game retains a cult following similar to its cousin <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em>, and is additionally often very favorably compared to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateII">Baldur's Gate II</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment">Planescape: Torment</a></em>, although <em>Arcanum</em>'s detail focuses more on its setting's history and mechanisms than on its playable characters.</p><p>The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeppelinsFromAnotherWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeppelinsFromAnotherWorld">IFS Zephyr</a></em> has just begun her maiden voyage, a marvelous, high-society venture through the clouds. Aboard, the cream of high society enjoys the flight, playing chess, sipping fine wine, etc. Sadly, nothing good can last forever &mdash; and, out of the blue, the airship is attacked by a pair of ogres flying primitive fighter planes. Within moments, the vessel goes down in flames.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>There's only one survivor, the player character &mdash; and, as they crawl out of the wreckage, a dying gnome begs them to take <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">his ring</a> to "the boy". Immediately after the gnome succumbs to his wounds, the player character emerges from the rubble and is approached by a man named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">Virgil</a>, who claims to have found the reincarnation of a long lost prophet... and that's where the story properly takes off.</p><p>As they journey through Arcanum, the player can join up with a number of companions. Although their personalities are often not as well-defined as those of some non-playable characters in the game, many of them are (very nicely) voiced, and they all contribute to the plot and interact with each other. Many of them are hidden, and many of them require very specific alignment, charisma stats and dialogue from the player before they even suggest joining the party. Similarly, the player often needs to meet very specific aptitude requirements before certain quests are even mentioned, meaning that no two playthroughs are the same and that each new player character will have a unique experience.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p><em>Arcanum</em> has a level cap of 50, which encourages players to specialize in very specific types of magic or technology. (However, a no-CD-patch combined with a level cap remover patch can quickly fix that.) Uniquely, knowledge of technology in <em>Arcanum</em> disables magical aptitude, and vice versa, so that the player will always have to choose between the two (or find a very, very careful balance) and (eventually) be shunned by the other branch.</p><p>Remarkably, the game is still being tested and patched by a squadron of devoted fans today. The game is <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/arcanum_of_steamworks_and_magick_obscura">now available<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GOGDotCom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GOGDotCom">GOG.com</a>, with the notorious bugs fixed and the game adapted to modern systems. In August 2016, it made it onto <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam">Steam</a> as well.</p><p>A sequel &mdash; titled <em>Journey to the Centre of Arcanum</em> and using <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em>'s Source engine &mdash; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">was in its initial planning stages</a>, but Sierra and Valve had disagreements, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TroikaGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TroikaGames">Troika Games</a>' dissolution sealed the game's fate.</p><p></p><hr><h2>This game provides examples of the following:</h2><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentHeroismRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentHeroismRating">100% Heroism Rating</a>: The PC gets better reaction from other characters (including shopkeepers who give them discounts) if he or she helped the inhabitants of a given settlement. Additionally, characters sometimes mention specific deeds of the PC and act accordingly. Of course, evil deeds get attention and respect of shady characters (including party members who base their decision to join the PC on his or her karma meter).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyLowLevelCap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyLowLevelCap">Absurdly Low Level Cap</a>: The level cap of 50 can be reached before you've even finished half the game, quite easily at that. And because followers only level-up with player's character, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">it can get really tricky</a> to find and recruit them before you've surpassed their starting level, which in turn affects their competence.

Even though tricking him into revealing his true name and securing his freedom from his employer are both necessary steps to recruiting him as a follower, your character continues to refer to him as "Gar" for the rest of the game. The game hand-waves it, as he himself explains he still doesn't want to embarrass his family.

It is hands-down the best firearm in the game stats-wise. However, where most firearms use 1 or, in extreme cases 2, bullets per shot fired, the Mechanized Gun uses six. <em>Six</em>.

The latter requires maxed out magic rating to work to its full potential, but you'll probably have that if you're a spellcaster anyway.</li><li> There's also the humble Balanced Sword and Featherweight Axe, a pair of simple and easily-obtainable melee weapons that are easy to use, extremely powerful, light, and fast, and so will usually be a technological melee fighter's primary armament for most of the game.</li><li> Healing salves. The resources to make them are pretty plentiful, they require only a little investment in one of the tech skills (or a certain follower who can be recruited fairly early on) to make, and they restore 20hp per use, making them a solid choice of healing item for a technologist who can't benefit from Vergil's magic. They are also one of few technology items that can be freely used by magic users without any ill effects.</li><li> Worn boots. They can be easily found in trash bins in quantity. Wearing them provides any character with +3 Damage Reduction, which means 3% less damage from all sources. Until you can find, buy or steal better, it's worth the effort to dumpster dive. You can also sell them to General Merchants for a decent amount of coins. Very handy at low levels. Further reinforced with normal boots, which are a common and cheap item sold by pretty much all merchants selling clothes and also by lesser blacksmiths. They provide +5 Damage Reduction, which is more or equal to most early game armours.</li><li> For inventory management, the humble keyring. You are going to collect a lot of keys over the course of the game, which weigh nothing but each takes up an inventory square. A keyring takes two squares, also weighs nothing, and holds infinite keys. All you have to do is buy it for a few coins from a thrift merchant.</li><li> Once you make it to Tarant, there's a quest in the warehouse district which tasks you with clearing a warehouse of rats. The gold you get for completing it isn't anything special, but the warehouse has nine chests (or chest-like storage containers) which you can use as permanent free storage. It's placed closed to most of the stores, just over the bridge when you arrive by map, and near the dock if you arrive by ship. It's the perfect hub for any adventurer. As an added bonus, one of the chests has Dwarven Ores for crafting Featherweight Axes.</li><li> Fate Points have a wide range of applications. The most useful of these is the ability to infallibly steal whatever you want from whoever you want, regardless of your actual skill. Not very flashy, but you can pickpocket some very good gear if you know where to look.</li><li> Smoking Suits and Fancy Dresses have the simple effect of granting +20 reaction. Your reaction affects how much shopkeepers charge you, what quest givers are willing to pay you, and make people more willing to listen to you in general. It's invaluable for players who play as a half-orc, or those that have chosen backgrounds that have reaction penalties in exchange for bonuses (Escaped Lunatic, for example).</li><li> Melee fighters. Forget using magic or technological disciplines, just put your starting points into Melee, Dodge, ST and DX. By the middle of the game, your build will be complete, and you'll be strong enough to beat your way through almost any quest or area in the game. The only problem is what you do with the rest of your level-ups.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BountyHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BountyHunter">Bounty Hunter</a>: If you give Gilbert Bates' diary to Appleby and make it public that Bates didn't invent his famed engine, bounty hunters will start to spawn in random encounters, wanting to claim the price on Living One's head for betraying Bates.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BowAndSwordInAccord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BowAndSwordInAccord">Bow and Sword, in Accord</a>:<ul><li> Characters can be built who switch between guns or bows and melee weapons, but carrying multiple weapons of your chosen type is also common because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons">Breakable Weapons</a> is in effect and swords are no good for breaking open stubborn chests.</li><li> Played absolutely straight with Raven and Waramon, two followers you can recruit in the Glimmering Forest.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons">Breakable Weapons</a>: All weapons and armors in the game have a durability value. While they don't degrade from use alone, certain uses or attacks can damage them. Armors suffer damage when attacked, in proportion to the weapon and type of damage being dealt. Weapons suffer damage when attacking sufficiently hard or hot objects, or when you critically miss while using them. If an item runs out of durability, it is considered broken and is automatically unequipped (or dropped, if your inventory is full). Broken objects must be repaired to be used again. Repaired objects usually lose a small amount of durability, regardless of whether or not they were broken at the time. However, there are some exceptions to these rules.<ul><li> Axes do not suffer weapon damage when attacking wooden doors or chests. They will, however, suffer damage from rock, metal, and fire. The same is true of gauntlets.</li><li> Ranged weapons never suffer contact damage against objects, which sounds perfectly sensible until you realize that the same applies to <em>throwing</em> weapons like boomerangs.</li><li> Certain powerful melee weapons never suffer contact damage, even against things their lesser counterparts would.

A bog standard weapon with neutral amplitude, meaning it can be wielded by any character having even most basic melee proficiency. It deals great damage and has one of the highest speed ratings in the whole game. Despite that it costs pocket change and can be even bought in the shop <em>before the game starts</em>. The rapier is wickedly good and is by far one of the most powerful, yet widely accessible and common melee weapons, able to keep up with enemies up until about reaching Stillwater or so.</li><li> Recruiting Magnus in Tarant or investing just two points in the Smithy Discipline will allow you to create Balanced Swords, a very fast, decent damage weapon that's a solid choice for most of the game (unless your character is a mage, or a technophobe). Since it can be reliably crafted in the first town, it makes powering through the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate">Beef Gate</a> all that easier.</li><li> Extending from this is the Featherweight Axe, the Balanced Sword's slightly slower but stronger big brother, which can be upgraded into the (in)famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlade">Pyrotechnic Axe</a>. It can be made as soon as you set foot in Tarant. Four free Dwarven Ores can be found in a warehouse infested with rats and the Oaken Axe Handles can be purchased from Junk Dealers. Fuel is dirt cheap and can be picked up from the local general store. Simply put three points into Smithing or have Magnus make Featherweight Axes when he's at a high enough level. The schematics for the Pyrotechnic Axe can be found in a locked chest under Mr. Willoughsby's trap door guarded by three mechanical arachnids, which you don't even have to fight (they're slow, so you can just lead them around the room and break the chest while they try to catch up). Alternatively, the schematics can bought from the nearby weapon shop if you're willing to roll the inventory enough. Then all you need to do is buy enough manuals from the college to inflate your tech skill to craft it. Once you do, you have yourself an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">Infinity -1 Sword</a> which does not suffer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons">weapon damage</a> and does 30-50 fire damage a hit, which is broken in this game because the only things immune to fire damage are the things that can do fire damage themselves.</li><li> Humble healing salves. You start with around 30-36 hit points. A single salve heals 20, instantly, regardless of character. It takes a single point in Herbology to make them (or recruit Jayna Styles) and just the starting location has enough ingredients to make 16 of them. They are by far the most reliable and commonly used healing items in the game and certain builds' early survival entirely depends on starting the game with the recipe.</li><li> The Sword of Baltar, Lianna Del Par's blade, is a massive greatsword that does ridiculous amounts of damage (15-25 per hit). Now, it does take a high Strength to use, but even if you're not a Half-Ogre yourself, you might well have Sogg Mead Mug for a companion, and <em>he</em> can use it effectively, allowing him to tear down any opposition at lightning speed. It costs a fate point to steal, but who cares?</li><li> One rather often-overlooked, yet quietly exceptional, weapon is Almstead's Axe, the property of Blackroot's blacksmith. In terms of damage and speed it is slightly inferior to the Featherweight Axe, but it is aptitude-neutral and has +15 to-hit. In the early game most characters struggle to hit the broad side of a barn in broad daylight, making accuracy extremely valuable. It is definitely worth the Fate Point you'd spend plucking it out of Almstead's hands.</li><li> In similar fashion, one of the rewards from Doc Roberts. If you say you dabble in magic, the doctor will give you an Enchanted Sword. Not only is it the best weapon from all three options, it's not a standard Enchanted Sword either. It comes with extremely useful +2 Speed bonus. It can help immensely early on, especially if you decide to deal with the bandits guarding the bridge &mdash; if not you, then Virgil or Sogg can use it to great effect.</li><li> Another easily overlooked weapon is Sharpshooter's Pistol, a revolver carried by the gunsmith working in Tarant. It is arguably the best early firearm, thanks to +15 to-hit bonus, very good speed and range on tier with sniper rifles.</li><li> With a little bit of level grinding and the right background, mages can have access to 5th spell in a chosen college before the second plot-mandated dungeon. This includes the Disintegrate spell, which kills anything you can target with no saving throw allowed. Considering the second dungeon is full of very powerful things that do not drop loot anyway, this is a big help.</li><li> The Looking-Glass Rifle. It packs serious punch, dealing 10-30 damage at a range that exceeds any other weapon or form of attack. In some versions, it deals a fixed damage in 40-40, which allows to knock-out most of the early and midgame enemies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">with just one bullet</a>. Aside of that, it comes with nice +20 to-hit bonus <em>and</em> properties equal to being Master of Firearms &mdash; there are <em>no range penalties</em> added, regardless how far away the target is. The only thing stopping this rifle from being ultimate gun is relatively low Speed &mdash; it takes 4 AP to fire a single shot and that's after getting Apprentice training. It's perfectly possible to pick this gun and keep using it up until the very end. You don't even have the spend the points it would normally take to craft it, because the Master of Firearms in Ashbury carries a copy and will give it to you for free if you promise to <em>not</em> ask for Master training, which the gun renders irrelevant.</li><li> While you are in Ashbury to pick up that rifle, you should first go and rescue the dog. It's by far the most powerful follower you can get in the whole game and all you have to do is save the starving animal from being beaten to death by a random gnome. In turn, once healed, you gain a murder machine that can tear apart anything on its way. In the early game, the dog is worth more than a party consisting of 3 or 4 combat-oriented followers - and only gets stronger from there.</li><li> If one has a high pickpocket skill and/or is willing to spend a Fate Point, you can steal a Hand Cannon right out of Sammie White's hand as soon as your enter Tarant, giving you one of the more hard-hitting firearms early in the game without having to dump points into gun smithing for the schematic or invest in the needed Clarington Rifle and Fancy Pistol to put it together.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">Does This Remind You of Anything?</a>:<ul><li> An in-game character called Gilbert Bates.

It has no proper name and the game refers to it either as a dog or as "worthless mutt".</li><li> There is an unique, game-breakingly powerful sword to be found in Isle of Despair, that is simply called "Sword". It looks, weighs and has a shop price similar to a generic, standard quality one-handed sword. Its stats are anything but generic, however; it's the fourth best sword in the entire game, surpassed only by two-handed ancient artifacts that come to play in the final act.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">The Dog Bites Back</a>: The player can find several half-ogres magically bound to a cruel master in the Dark Elf village.

If you negotiate on the best possible terms for the Unified Kingdom, Caladon eventually will fade away in the shadow of Tarant, while the unification under more friendlier terms for Caladon brings both cities mutual prosperity.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DugTooDeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DugTooDeep">Dug Too Deep</a>: The Dredge in Wheel Clan mines is a subversion. Rather than actually digging too deep, the dwarves simply abandoned the corridors after digging out all the ore and the monsters nested in, eventually growing both in size and numbers to the point where the tunnels had to be sealed and guarded, because it's too late for cleaning. The maze of corridors is one of <em>the</em> toughest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonCrawling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonCrawling">crawls</a> in the entire game and the monsters can put a serious fight even without the end boss getting involved. Should the party come unprepared, it can easily escalate to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">Total Party Kill</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a>:<ul><li> Characters in-game frequently mention the island of Cattan, a tourist destination.

In particular, there are unused dialogue lines with the followers and citizens who, after being asked what to do now, say that the game is over and tell the player <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiPoopSocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiPoopSocking">to turn the game off</a> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">Breaking the Fourth Wall</a> manner:</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Raven:</strong> That's a foolish question.

It mostly only really helps to keep people from being hostile on sight and resolving a <em>small</em> few situations without combat. You can get by with a 2 (and even maximize your Charisma), and there are several items and blessings floating about that will bump it up about three or four points. There are some exceptions but the difference is minor and largely limited to a few minor quest rewards and merchant prices. Lampshaded in the game's manual, which tells the player that an intelligent, charismatic but ugly character will reap the full benefits of a speech-based playthrough more easily than a beautiful, but uncharismatic and stupid character.</li><li> By the same token, reaction modifiers as part of character backgrounds are pointless. Fancy clothing provides a hefty reaction boost which equals any positive modifier and will practically negate any negative modifier. This makes the Escaped Lunatic background pretty useful, as the -25 penalty to reaction is cut down to a mere -5 in exchange for major resistance boosts.</li><li> To a lesser degree; spending Skill Points on Health and Fatigue boosts alone. Yes, you gain more health and fatigue for each point spent than on Strength, Constitution and Willpower, but you'll gain health/fatigue boosts on level-up. You're better off with the additional bonuses to the above mentioned stats, like better melee damage and carry weight, poison resistance and healing rate or resistance to offensive magics. However, certain followers don't actually have anything else to do with their remaining points after maxing out their core abilities and stats, leaving them with no other option. The dog is probably the best example of this and it's the reason why he's by far the best melee character in the game, even if he can't wear armour.</li><li> The Only Child background makes Charisma an excellent dump stat for mages. Forget companions and forget diplomacy, because your points are going into a whole lotta magical firepower. (This does lock out some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a> quests, however.

The book series "The Orcish Question", found in the Tarant library, goes into a lot of detail about both sides of the debate, including some contributions by Orcs themselves. There are many almost-explicit comparisons to Africans and to Jews in the discourse, which neatly lampshades the trope: unlike in real world racism, Orcs <em>actually</em> tend to have lower intelligence and a more violent nature than the authors. Odd thing, though &mdash; if you play a <em>half</em>-orc they have the same base intelligence stat, and a lot of the orcs you can talk to don't really seem stupid or violent at all, just uneducated and underprivileged. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">As for the manual entry...</a></li><li> Good luck playing as a half-orc.

Although the Vendigrothian relics suggests that it is quite possible for the periods of uneasy coexistence to have both magic and technology be what the 'present day' of the game would consider high.</li><li> The game manual mentions an unexplained event some 900,000 years ago that caused the magickal energies of the world to suddenly skyrocket. Scholars call this time period in Arcanum's history the Epoch of High Enchantment. It is in this highly magickal time that the Elves and Giants evolved from humans, and many of the more fantastic creatures, that have since become extinct, came into existance by either transforming or merging together creatures that existed at the time. It is implied that ever since then magick has been slowly draining from the world.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicVersusScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicVersusScience">Magic Versus Science</a>:<ul><li> One of the best <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justifications</a> on record; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAndPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAndPowers">Magick</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">alters physics</a></em> to do stuff, Technology <em>uses physics</em> to do stuff. Machinery operating around people using spells are performing nonsense actions &mdash; powerful spells will break weaker machines just by being used in the vicinity. Likewise, spells used around machinery are basically inserted into said machinery &mdash; powerful machines will cause weaker spells to fail just by operating in their vicinity. As a gameplay mechanic, this means any bonuses granted by items of the opposing discipline will be reduced or completely nullified, and in the case of usable items (weapons, healing items, etc) will be more likely to critically fail, up to a guaranteed fail if either discipline is maxed out.</li><li> A hilarious and quickly-tiresome conversation occurs every time you try to buy a train ticket, basically boiling down to "Are you a wizard?", "Are you sure you're not a wizard?", "You might be a wizard, if-" and quickly turns out to be completely redundant, since the conductor has a device that detects hazardous levels of magic before letting you board a train anyway. Said magic-detecting device? A pocket watch, which will start going backward in the presence of mages.

The first level of a spell tree is some weak utility spell, the second is stronger and likely has some use in combat, the third is hefty, and the fifth (which requires a lot of dedicated status-requirements) is super-powerful. On top of that, spell strength is dependent on your magic rating; a truly powerful mage needs a full 100 rating, which requires putting points into several spell trees. Special mention goes to summoning spells, which summon different creatures based on your magical rating. The higher it is, the stronger the summon.</li><li> Technologists as a character build are an even greater example. While they get a far worse rap than they deserve from a lot of players, there are some serious issues with using them to their full potential, most notably the extreme cost in points to fill out their disciplines (seven compared to five for mages). Playing an effective technologist requires you to finesse your abilities and items for the utmost advantage, but a proper build can lead to a character who is mighty enough to defeat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Stringy Pete and his crew of the damned</a> by themselves.</li><li> Lockpicking on either side of the fence. Any lock you can pick without maxed out skill is probably a chest you could have beat open just as easy. Maxed out skill lets you pick storekeeper chests, for infinite money and free gear. Tech lockpicking has the benefit of being silent, letting you pick more chests without being caught than the noisy unlocking spell.</li><li> Backstabbing starts out as almost useless. It only works with daggers and knives, only when sneaking and attacking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBack">In the Back</a>, and with a pretty low chance to provide any bonus at all. The bonus itself is a joke due to how little damage daggers and knives deal. However, once you reach Expert status, you're able to use swords and axes with it, too. Master adds a gargantuan critical chance, making roughtly every even attack a critical.

The maximum possible value for a stat is 12 added to the starting value from race and background, and hitting 20 in a status gives you bonus (for example, doubling damage for strength) on top of normal effects for increasing stats, so females can't get that bonus without a background adjusting their strength value. Gender also affects dialog, though there's only a few times this is more then just sir/ma'am pronouns etc, such as the Gentleman's Club in Tarrant.

The mighty army of the kingdom of Cumbria, renowned for their skill at arms, consisted mainly of mounted knights and heavily-armored swordsmen. The poorly-trained conscript military of Tarant consisted of riflemen, artillery, and machine-gun teams. The battle is <em>exactly</em> as one-sided as it sounds. The Cumbrians only ever won any battles through ambushes in dense terrain, and these were few and far between.

You will probably need to spend money on manuals to inflate your skill in the disciplines you haven't chosen to make the good equipment. You'll also have more items that will need repairing/replacing. Meanwhile, being a Mage requires you to invest in Willpower (which raises your Mana anyway) and it only costs 5 points to master a School. The spells start from simple but useful (<em>Harm</em> is spammable damage spell, you can always heal yourself with White Necromancy School), but the final spells are downright gamebreaking (<em>Quench Life</em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> to living things, but there's always <em>Disintegrate</em> against nonliving ones if you don't care about loot. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill">Tempus Fugit</a></em> will see your enemies dead before they even get a move, and travel in style with <em>Teleport</em>).

You rarely encounter them lying around, and they cost a lot of money; even the nearly-useless ones. So they just end up sitting there, waiting for "that time" where you'll want that Scroll of Fireflash. About the only exception is the Black Mountain Mines, where the game makes it abundantly clear that it isn't giving you an abundance of Detect Traps scrolls for you not to use them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a>: Charles Bhrego murdered the family of a powerful mage-priest and was cursed to forever be barred from the afterlife upon his death. You find him after his partner turned on him, an agonized ghost begging for release. What's the first thing Charles does if the player is powerful and merciful enough to resurrect him? Attack for no reason, get slaughtered, and return to the state he begged for release from.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateEvil">Ultimate Evil</a>: In-universe example. Arronax is deliberately portrayed as this by the Panarii religion <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> or rather, by the Dark Elves running the church. Kan'Hua specifically states that "ultimate evil" is a fantasy that can be reasoned away or presented as a metaphor. The real idea of Arronax merely being a very powerful mage sealed behind magical wards is played down to avoid anyone seeking to repair the deteriorating seal.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnidentifiedItems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnidentifiedItems">Unidentified Items</a>: The game has magick items which must be identified to unlock their potential; this can be done by either learning "Divine Magick", a fifth-level divination spell, or paying 100 gold to a wise woman. Since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointBuildSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointBuildSystem">character points</a> are finite and gold isn't in short supply, the majority of sensible players tend to opt for the latter.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalAmmunition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalAmmunition">Universal Ammunition</a>: Pistol? Rifle? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon">Hand Cannon</a>? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">Elephant Gun?</a> Same bullets.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnproblematicProstitution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnproblematicProstitution">Unproblematic Prostitution</a>: Madam Lil's brothel is more or less portrayed as this. One of the sidequests involves a lower-class housekeeper who is mistreated by her rich masters, and there's an option to get her a job at Lil's so she can have a better life.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell">Useless Useful Spell</a>: Plenty, but the most notable is probably anything from the Meta school, which revolves around countering enemy spellcasters. Despite magick being a huge focus of the game, only a tiny fraction of the hundreds of enemies you'll kill use spells.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VaguenessIsComing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VaguenessIsComing">Vagueness Is Coming</a>: The dying gnome at the start of the game helpfully informs you that "unimaginable evil" is coming to "destroy everyone and everything".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">Video Game Cruelty Potential</a>:<ul><li> Use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharmPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharmPerson">Charm Beast</a> to befriend a wild animal, like a wolf or bear. Walk to the nearest town. Have your animal friend enter an occupied house while you wait outside. Magelock the door shut. Then dispel Charm Beast. (You might want to magically seal the windows, too &mdash; you don't want anyone to escape the wrath of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews">Mr. Disoriented Grizzly.</a>) Is also an effective means to assassinate someone without the guards finding out it was you (whereas if a cop NPC walks into a room and you're standing over a bloody corpse with a sword in your hand, they'll usually put two and two together and attack you).</li><li> There's also the fact that there exists only 1 NPC in the game who can't be killed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(The Silver Lady)</span>. Every major character can be murdered, then have their ghost summoned and interrogated. A true villain may kill the dwarf leader of the Isle of Despair, then raise his spirit just to tell him that you're going to travel to his home clan and kill everyone - oh, and that you'll drag the corpses into the daylight just to add insult to injury (sadly, you can't actually drag the corpses outside). There's almost no limit to how much cruelty you can inflict upon the populace of Arcanum.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPunishment">Video Game Cruelty Punishment</a>:<ul><li> While most things in this game can just be killed to deal with them, there are two instances where the game will punish you severely for trying. The first instance is a quest Raven sends you on. The area in question is cursed so that if you or your party harms anything there, you all die automatically. The trick is to get your targets to do this to you. The second is dealing with Stringy Pete. You have to do three quests to get his boat. You might wonder why you can't just kill him instead. After all, he's just one high-level skeleton. He is just one high-level skeleton... armed with the best magical armor available, and summons six similarly high-level skeletons to back him up. While it is <em>technically</em> possible to win, it's very unlikely unless you bring a huge group and prepare for it. Too bad one of his quests is impossible to complete if you pick up the Torin stone before speaking to him and the priests. Or if you lose the stone. Then killing him is the only way to get to his ship.</li><li> Killing the fat perverted Mr. Franklin who hires a female PC to sleep with him (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackWidow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackWidow">while he is fast asleep from the sex</a>) will result in the quest-giver attacking when going to pick up the payment. Can be averted by killing him <em>after</em> payment is received.</li><li> The fortune teller sidequest. To elaborate, Tarant has two fortune tellers, Madame Toussaud and a fraud in upper Tarant. Once you speak to the fraud, she'll ask you to steal Toussaud's crystal ball. Upon arrival, Toussaud will know why you've come and demand you choose a side. If you choose her side, you get the ball with no conflict and give it to the fraud, who dies upon touching it. You get a decent blessing (stat boost) for the trouble. Side against Toussaud, though, and you get hit with an equal curse (stat reduction), while the fraud rewards you with nothing worthwhile. No sane person ever sides with the fraud.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameStealing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameStealing">Video Game Stealing</a>: It is technically possible to steal equipped armor and weapons, just rather difficult. Fate Points let you get around the difficulty, assuming you're willing to spend them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBeatingArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBeatingArtifact">Villain-Beating Artifact</a>: One quest requires you to find a specific dagger so that you can kill a wizard whose soul is bound to a demon. Killing the wizard with any other weapon will release the demon into the world. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Also, the final boss can only be killed with one of two items, the Vendigroth Device or Kryggird's Falchion, or with a magical attack strong enough to bash through the shield.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolenceIsNotAnOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolenceIsNotAnOption">Violence Is Not an Option</a>: There is a quest where you have to get rid of explorers that are trespassing in elves' holy forest. You cannot attack them, because if you do, the spirits that live in that forest will promptly eradicate all aggressors. Subverted in that, while there is a peaceful solution, there's also nothing stopping you from provoking the explorers into attacking you, as long as you don't retaliate...</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTechbane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTechbane">Walking Techbane</a>: Due to the setting's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicVersusScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicVersusScience">Magic Versus Science</a> laws, technological devices malfunction in the presence of magick, or magically-inclined beings. As a gameplay mechanic, this means any technological devices either won't work for a mage (armor, for example, will only provide base protection, not any special bonuses) or will be more likely to critically fail in the case of weapons or items like healing salves, depending on your magic aptitude. At 100, failure is a complete guarantee. The reverse is true of technologists with magical items.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeBuyAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeBuyAnything">We Buy Anything</a>: Played with; vendors will only buy things related to their stock (smithy shops only buy armor and weapons, for example), except for the junk vendors, who will buy anything short of destroyed items - at terrible prices. Get your Haggle skills to Expert or Mastery level though, and they will not only buy anything, they'll sell you the clothes off their backs.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCannotGoOnWithoutYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCannotGoOnWithoutYou">We Cannot Go On Without You</a>: You lose if your character dies, though the game will allow your party members to attempt a resurrection if one or more of them have that ability. Just try not to get caught in a situation where your tech or magic resistance renders you immune to the type of resurrection they have.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kerghan wants to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">kill everyone</a> because he believes that the afterlife is better and more peaceful than life</span>. Interestingly, that particular theory is somewhat confirmed in-game, since one of your party members <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who dies and is resurrected</span> agrees with him but still thinks that people should be allowed to choose their own fate.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a>: Good party members will object to you killing good NPCs or doing quests that give you evil alignment, and will leave your party if you do it once too often.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer">When All You Have Is a Hammer...</a>: Virtually any problem can be solved with the right application of force. Locked door? Beat it down. Guy holding an item you like? Kill him. Interdimensional portal releasing demon hoards upon the land? Whack it closed. Note that while this method may work, it is not exactly the most <em>subtle</em> way of doing things. Also, some of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Endings</a> for various places require that you be skilled in Persuasion, such as taking a diplomatic solution to the matter of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Donn Throgg</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillOTheWisp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillOTheWisp">Will-o'-the-Wisp</a>: Several enemies are glowing balls of light found in swampy terrain. They come in several varieties, which can be annoying when you're searching for one of the rarer types.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardsLiveLonger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardsLiveLonger">Wizards Live Longer</a>: Wizards have several means of extending their lifespan. The human necromancer Kerghan was over 200 years old at the time of his banishment, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nasrudin is at least <em>four thousand</em> years old due to using a healing shell, when few elves reach one thousand. K'an Hua is also a mighty wizard of at least three thousand years, with no explanation</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Wretched Hive</a>: The Boil, located on the outskirts of Tarant, near where you arrive when traveling there from the world map. One of the city guards even delivers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a>, when warning you not to enter.

He's decided that because being alive is painful (summoned spirits suffer terribly from being forced back into life as well) and the final afterlife is perfect bliss, the logical solution is to end all life. He reasons that if living is unpleasant and death peaceful, then having to live must be a terrible crime to force upon a soul and one that must be permanently removed. Even Virgil will more or less confirm his opinion, though he isn't about to force it on others. Remarkably if the player can explain the flaws in his philosophy - that some souls never have the opportunity or sometimes even the ability to enjoy the pleasures life can bring - he'll willingly abandon his genocidal agenda and submit to having his soul banished forever in order to claim final peace. He even shows some slight regret that he never learned how to enjoy life himself: "Perhaps some souls are born into death... they never knew how to live."</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearOutsideHourInside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearOutsideHourInside">Year Outside, Hour Inside</a>: Played with inside the Void. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Stennar Rock-Cutter refers to the elderly Gilbert Bates as "the boy" because although time passes at the same rate as in Arcanum, no one ages and their mental state doesn't degrade. All the banished entities behave as they did 2000 years past, though Arronax and Kerghan managed to learn introspection in that time. If the PC tells Arronax they killed his father, he admits that he sometimes forgets how much time must have passed since his banishment.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YinYangBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YinYangBomb">Yin-Yang Bomb</a>: Bronwych's Gun uses mithril in the construction of a firearm, exploiting magic's and technology's tendency not to mix well to create a violent reaction.</li></ul><p></p><hr>
