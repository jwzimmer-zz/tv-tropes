The second one occurs when the first timeline's Missile-Prime goes back 10 years via Yomiel's body and takes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlowPath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlowPath">The Slow Path</a> to the present, then, under the guise of Ray, making Sissel think he's Yomiel to trick him into saving Lynne and everyone else.

The earliest this happens is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when you save Missile</span>. Many other puzzles can only be solved in the final seconds "until death". It gets pretty ridiculous, considering that the way to prevent quite a few deaths is to wait until the absolute final <em>milliseconds</em> before a person's death, one time to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">swap a bullet that's hanging in midair <em>centimetres from the victim's face.</em></span> Fortunately, the player doesn't have to time these, as the game pauses automatically at the crucial moment.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysMurder">Always Murder</a>: Subverted.

When she's facing right, it magically migrates to the right side. Emma also switches which hand she holds her glass in when she turns around.</li><li> It gets especially obvious with Jowd. The blue and red paint-stains on his shirt switch places!</li><li> Characters holding items (like the night-visions guards or the minister's wife) always have their items facing the viewer. Oddly, however, there are animations that show them changing hands whenever they turn around.</li><li> Beauty, interestingly, is a subversion, as her hair is always in the correct place regardless of which direction she's facing.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacDissonance">Amnesiac Dissonance</a>: The game spends a lot of time setting this up, displaying the seemingly nefarious doings of pre-death Sissel and making the protagonist wonder if he was really that bad of a person. Of course, the man in red is certainly a monster.<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">.. but Sissel's not the man in red.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmplifiedAnimalAptitude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmplifiedAnimalAptitude">Amplified Animal Aptitude</a>: Justified: In the ghost world animals can perfectly communicate with humans since human and animal souls are no different to each other, and since there's no language barrier in the world of the dead.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note06llg');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note06llg" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note06llg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Souls communicate by directly beaming and interpreting their abstract thoughts.</span> The only "barriers" between humans and animals is the latter's lack of understanding of more human concepts.

Kamila and Lynne will obviously die, but the other three will be left as ghosts to forever haunt the dark wreckage</span>. Scary enough. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">But in Ray's timeline, where Sissel never tried to help out Lynne, it still happened... except Yomiel was down there alone.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsInfancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsInfancy">And Your Reward Is Infancy</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After traipsing around the ghost world frantically figuring out the cause of his death, Sissel gets to live forever as a family kitten.

While the justice minister doesn't become important until halfway through the game, Sissel can visit him at any point starting with the second chapter. Doing so results in Sissel listening to the man's self-loathing rants. At least twice, Sissel immediately desires to leave.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalJingoism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalJingoism">Animal Jingoism</a>: Subverted in every respect. The black cat <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sissel</span> gets along incredibly well with the dog Missile and quickly makes friends with him. Also, he seems to have an aversion to hurting rodents. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Might have something to do that for 99% of the game, he doesn't <em>know</em> that he is a cat.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimateInanimateObject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimateInanimateObject">Animate Inanimate Object</a>: Ghosts can become these by manipulating inanimate objects.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeHair">Anime Hair</a>: Everyone has ridiculous hair. Sissel, Lynne, Beauty, and Emma stand out in particular. This <em>is</em> a creation of the same guy behind the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> series, after all, though special mention must go to Emma, whose rosebud-shaped hair <em>blooms</em> whenever she gets mad.

If the spirit is awake to see this occur, they will follow along the path to try to prevent said death. When the death is prevented, the event is erased and replaced with a new present, but the memory remains for those who were along with said Trick.

The only way to know what most of the objects will do once manipulated is to try, and a lot of them can only be used once, so trial and error is really your only option.
