The player is able to pick from one of nine Vocations that define their playstyle &mdash; from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Guts-emulating Warrior</a>, to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic">typhoon-summoning Sorcerer</a>, to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">agile and precise Ranger.</a> The nine Vocations are divided into three trees &mdash; magic, skill, and power, and three of the nine Vocations mix and match the Vocations into powerful specialist classes, such as combining Warrior and Sorcerer into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Mystic Knight</a>. You can also perform a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColossusClimb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColossusClimb">Colossus Climb</a> on larger monsters, and much of the combat is based around exploiting everything from enemy weak spots like a Drake's glowing heart to inherent weaknesses like a Goblin's distaste for fire.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>In addition, the game uses a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManualLeaderAIParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManualLeaderAIParty">Manual Leader, A.I. Party</a> system where you can recruit up to three "Pawns" as your party members. You create one Pawn of your own near the start of the game as your primary traveling companion: you can customise the appearance, class and equipment of your personal Pawn just like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a>, and they level up alongside you. The other two Pawns are recruited from "The Rift" (read: the Internet) and belong to other players, though they do <em>not</em> level up and must be continually replaced. An interesting note is that Pawns retain the memories of which quests they have been on, so if you recruit a Pawn belonging to a player who has already completed your current quest, that Pawn can actually give you hints and directions based on their experiences.</p><p>An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a>, titled <em>Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen</em>, was released in April 2013 and added a lot of new content and re-balancing, most notably a new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusLevelOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusLevelOfHell">optional challenge dungeon</a> called "Bitterblack Isle" (which takes more than a few cues from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em>).

The game chooses to have little exposition cluttering up the monster stabbing. More stuff is found in the Official Design Works artbook, such as monster origins and character notes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs">All Your Base Are Belong to Us</a>: One of the main quests involves defending a fort overrun with Goblins. It is possible to lose this quest if one of the major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">Non Player Characters</a> dies, but whether you win or lose, the reward is the same.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees">Aluminum Christmas Trees</a>: Gran Soren's fields area includes a herd of boars inside an enclosure. <em>Dragon's Dogma</em> is set in a classic Middle Age-like world and, in our own universe, pigs were domesticated thousands years ago, but the pink, smoothed skinned pigs we all know didn't exist in the Middle Age. Those "boars" are supposed to be domesticated pigs, because historical medieval pigs looked like boars.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazingTechnicolorPopulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazingTechnicolorPopulation">Amazing Technicolor Population</a>: Not normally, but the colorations for Arisen and Pawns can be decidedly "not human."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonianBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonianBeauty">Amazonian Beauty</a>: It is possible to create an Arisen or a female Pawn with these characteristics, especially if the class is Fighter, Strider, Warrior or Ranger.

This comes in handy when a weapon or armor's second stage enhancement requires an extremely rare drop, such as the Dragon's Toll and the Dragon's Faith.</li><li> The game has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarpWhistle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarpWhistle">Fast Travel</a> system using the Ferrystone item and Portcrystals, though initially you can only fast travel back to Gran Soren. Late in the game and into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, you get portable Portcrystals which you can place anywhere you want. If you buy <em>Dark Arisen</em> (and you already have a save from vanilla <em>Dragon's Dogma</em> or are playing the PC version), you get the eternal ferrystone, a permanent, reusable ferrystone. Even without the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus">Old Save Bonus</a>, the price of Ferrystones has been reduced to 1/10th of their original price, the Black Cat now sells an infinite amount of them, and you find multiple portable Portcrystals by just playing the game normally.</li><li> NPCs respawn 7 days after being killed (as long as they don't die a plot-related death), which prevents you from making the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake">Unwinnable by Mistake</a> by going on a massacre. It also means the knights and merchants which patrol the roads won't run out, despite often being killed by random wandering monsters.</li><li> If you plan on doing an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission">Escort Mission</a> and have a spare Portcrystal handy, there's nothing stopping you from rushing to the destination beforehand, placing a Portcrystal right outside it, then taking the quest and using a Ferrystone to warp you and your escort right to the destination.</li><li> If your main Pawn gets lost in the Rift (either through dying and not being revived in time or accidentally falling off a cliff and being claimed by the Brine), you need merely touch the nearest riftstone to call them back to you; what's more, their inventory and equipment will be left unchanged rather than sent back to storage like with recruited Pawns, allowing you to keep adventuring immediately rather than going back to an inn and putting everything back the way it was.</li><li> If a Pawn dies in your service, any items it picked up are automatically sent into your storage rather than being lost.</li><li> Postgame is built with this in mind, in an attempt to make your life easier, and it works well:<ul><li> All the shops are moved around in Gran Soren to be closer to each other, cutting down on maintenance time &mdash; in particular, the inn moves to the Pawn Guild, while The Black Cat moves to the Alehouse.</li><li> You can enter the dungeon in two ways &mdash; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">falling from the crater or walking down from the Pawn Guild</span>. Since the curative and weapon shops are situated in the same places they were before postgame, this makes entering the dungeon quick and easy.</li><li> While the areas you visit in the dungeon are FILLED with <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

Once a Pawn learns a weakness, they will try to use it against the enemy if they have the means for it. For example: When you have a mage Pawn in your party with a holy spell, they will cast it whenever they fight undead enemies, who are weak to holy based attacks. They learn quest information and the geography of the world from traveling with players, and will lead you through areas they learned from other players. They will also mimic you, using items and tactics that they observe you using, which molds their inclination (which can still be manually tweaked at the inns in the game). It's surprisingly nuanced.<ul><li> This is the result of well-made and fully-trained Pawns who can dismantle enemies of all kinds with startling ease. The problem is this takes three rather tedious things: Figuring out which moves for their classes Pawns use to the greatest effect, the dedication to fully teach the Pawn all the right information by demonstrating it first hand, and a solid understanding of the Inclination system. Needless to say players willing to do all three are few and far between, making such Pawns a rarity.</li><li> Pawns are very good at hitting their targets and rarely miss, especially archer Pawns.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Artificial Stupidity</a>: However, the AI is still not without its blind spots. Pawns will occasionally try to rush into melee when equipped with ranged weapons, or enchant your weapons with elements to which your enemy is immune. While they will promptly come to your aid when a smaller enemy grabs you, they have more trouble freeing you from larger ones. This is a problem when fighting boss enemies who one-shot you if you're not freed in time, like hydras.<ul><li> Pawns with inclinations that poorly suit their vocation and/or skills will struggle to do what they're supposed to. The most common inclinations tend to be the Scather and Guardian inclinations - which direct a Pawn to attack strong enemies head-on and prioritize protecting the Arisen, respectively. Very effective for Strider or Warrior Pawns, but on a Sorcerer it will cause the Pawn to annoyingly run and jump around in the middle of casting their <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

Since most players don't know about the mechanics of the inclination system and generally don't spend a lot of time tweaking their Pawns' AI at the Knowledge chair, it can be difficult find other Pawns with AI best tailored to their intended fighting style.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission">Escort Mission</a> characters are particularly bad, especially those who have no attacks of their own (which is most of them). They'll consistently run straight at enemies for no reason and take hits, and you can't even order them to regroup to get them to stop doing that like you can with your Pawns.

Since you have no direct <strong>"Grab the annoying Fucker!"</strong> command, you have to rely on the game's AI to make the grab and sometimes your Pawn is all too happy to just wail away at him endlessly <em>even while reminding you repeatedly that <strong>they</strong> must grab him and <strong>you</strong> must deliver the killing blow</em>.</span><ul><li> Alternatively, you can <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">grab the Seneschal and hope the Pawn will attack before you get blown up.

The game helpfully points out you can engage in another quest while you're blundering around clueless. While you can mark a quest as a priority, which adds some markers to your map that point out NPCs and locations essential to it, it doesn't help much with some of the more obscure requirements. Other quests have alternate outcomes or options which are very difficult to find besides through accident, blind trial-and-error, or checking a guide.<ul><li> There are a lot of quests you can undertake, and some have a strict time limit which will cause them to be automatically canceled if you finish too many plot-related quests. The game will never inform you of this.</li><li> The introductions for Madeleine and the Elysion are incredibly easy to miss because they're only available between two specific missions, and the end of the first dumps you right on top of the starting point for the second.</li><li> Both of the missions that feature Selene have blink-and-you-miss-it starting points.</li><li> The Arisen's Bond, a unique item that you can gift to NPCs for a massive affection boost, is found in the deep Witchwood, sitting on the grave of Selene's mistress. The problem is that it's not there during Selene's missions, so you'll only discover it if you happen to trek through the entire area strictly on a whim.</li><li> The duel between Mercedes and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Julien</span>. The game tells you simply to observe, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you can intervene and kill Julien. You can even intervene, kill Julien, and bring him back to life with a Wakestone so he can stand trial, which is also the only way to have a relationship with him and get the Wizard's Vizard item.</span></li><li> The Golden Idol is an item which can be obtained in two ways, and they are not that easy. The first way is by escorting Fournival's daughter Symone, never bumping into her (so go slow), finding her quickly during hide-and-seek (look at either the Inn, or the Alehouse), and allowing her to win the race by a slight lead... anything less may not be enough. The second way is, if you found Fournival guilty, buy it from Symone at 100,000 gold. Finally, unlike most items of which you can make forgeries, giving the fake item to the shopkeeper will deny any new weapon updates (since the person who made the original can obviously tell it's a fake), although thankfully keeping the fake version for yourself still gives you the real deal's shop discount.</li><li> You can use the Chamberlain's Affidavit to help clear Fournival's name...unless you want to complete an alehouse notice board quest later in the game, which requires it.</li><li> Certain quests in the From a Different Sky line only become available during very specific story quests and can only be completed while completing those quests.</li><li> Shopkeepers sell better items if you raise their affinity high enough.</li><li> Hell, the affinity system in general. See, what the game tells you is that by doing tasks for certain NPCs and/or giving them gifts, they begin to warm up to you, granting you some small bonuses (shopkeepers lower their prices and buy your loot for more, among other things). What the game <em>doesn't</em> tell you is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when you reach the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss">Disc-One Final Boss</a>, the NPC who has the highest affinity for you automatically becomes your permanent lover.

Fair enough, but the fact that you have no way of knowing about the quest means you have no initiative to gain his favor at all. Oh, and if you complete A Warm Welcome - a major post-game story quest - all affinity drops to zero and you're permanently locked out from getting the quest. The only way to get the quest is to gain his affinity <em>then</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> drop into the Everfall</span> immediately upon reaching Gran Soren.</li><li> Monsters can have very hard resistances to certain builds. A golem, for example, is highly magic resistant but very vulnerable to climbing and physical attacks. If you stumble upon a story golem fight and you happen to be a mage, you will have almost no impact on the fight, needing to rely on your uncontrollable Pawns to figure it out (assuming they're physical attackers), which can take quite a while. This means you need to either run away to the nearest rest stop to change classes or endure through a very long and tedious battle. Since there's little way to know about many boss fights beforehand, your first run through becomes a trial and error ordeal depending on how much time it will cost you to cope.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery">Happiness in Slavery</a>: The Pawns fit this trope.

Notably, hanging around their Arisen will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityIsInfectious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityIsInfectious">eventually lead the Pawn to gain emotions and free will</a>, but even these "liberated" Pawns still retain traces of their master/servant relationship with their Arisen.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardModePerks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardModePerks">Hard Mode Perks</a>: <em>Dark Arisen</em>'s Hard Mode may double the damage taken from enemies and increases your Stamina consumption rate, but it also doubles the amount of Experience Points &amp; Discipline Points you earn and increases the amount of gold enemies drop to make up for it.

Of course, they might just be imitating humans.<ul><li> Pawns also show great concern for the Arisen and get very upset if anything happens to them. The game frequently discusses the deep and unique bond between an Arisen and their main Pawn, sometimes outright describing it as love - in fact, at least one Arisen in the game's lore was in love with their main Pawn. It's also revealed later on that Pawns become more human the more time they spend with an Arisen; this process is known as the Bestowal of Spirit.

At three stars, they gain the ability to inflict Torpor, which is an <em>extremely</em> useful debilitation that slows its sufferers' movement and attack speed to a crawl, and only a few monster types are immune to it. At Dragonforged levels and above, their attack power increases dramatically, and their chances of inflicting Poison and Torpor are increased as well. For example, Rusted Daggers have an attack power of only 7 with no special properties. At the highest enhancement level, Gold Rarefied, they have a massive 405 attack power, <strong>and</strong> can inflict Poison and Torpor.
