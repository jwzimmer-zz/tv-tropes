Unrealistic? Stretching it just slightly beyond breaking. Acceptable? Seeing that it is such a tiny change and it speeds up the grenade throws, acceptable.</li><li> Teammate gas will not damage teammates, but will deny healing and apply heavy suppression effects on them. This is a compromise between the lack of friendly fire in most of the multiplayer and the reality that one is expected to wear a gas mask in lethal chemical gas. In addition, the effects of the gas are heavily downgraded as to not slow down the game too much. Instead of causing blinding and other other long-lasting symptoms, it just drains your health.</li><li> Anti-Tank grenades, both their heavy and light versions, don't do as much damage as their frag grenade counterparts do against infantry, even though the Anti-Tank Grenade is visibly larger and powerful enough to destroy vehicles. For the sake of balancing, they needed to do less damage against infantry as there'd be little reason to use frag grenades over a grenade that can do the same amount of damage while also granting its user anti-vehicle potential.</li><li> Tanks drive <em>way</em> faster than they did in real life. If they were in historically-accurate speeds, playing through the entirety of Through Mud and Blood would take <em>hours</em> if not <strong>days</strong>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>:<ul><li> Zara of the "Nothing is Written" war story is one, and as the codex notes, it was not entirely unheard of for women to serve on the front lines. Some, such as <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milunka_Savi%C4%87">Milunka Savi&#263;<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_Sandes">Flora Sandes<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> even served openly as women, and didn't have to resort to disguising themselves as men. World War I even saw <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade">Amazon Brigades</a> like the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_Battalion">Russian Women's Battalions<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> take the field. The in-game codex in fact mentions these female soldiers by name.</li><li> Battlefield 1 was also the first game in Battlefield series that has female character model in Multiplayer mode in the form of the Scout class of Russian and White Army factions. They are supposed to represent the real-life Russian Women's Battalions mentioned above.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvertisedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvertisedExtra">Advertised Extra</a>: The Harlem Hellfighters, the all-black infantry regiment who were featured heavily in marketing leading up to release and are represented on the game's cover, are only playable in the game's brief prologue, after which they are never seen again in the campaign (although they are mentioned in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyChatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyChatter">Enemy Chatter</a>, and the narrator for the beginning of each War Story is from the Harlem Hellfighters, not to mention some of the American multiplayer models).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AKA47" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AKA47">A.K.A.-47</a>:<ul><li> The Beretta M1915 pistol and M1918 submachine gun are referred to as, respectively, the "Modello 1915" and "Automatico M1918".</li><li> A more glaring example: the Browning Auto 5 is referred to as the "12g Automatic". Especially odd as a trailer for the game referred it as the "Automatic 5". In a similar vein, the Remington Model 8 is referred to as the "Autoloading 8".</li><li> More examples include the "Mle. 1903" (FN 1903), the "Taschenpistole M1914" (Mauser M1914 pocket pistol), the "Repetierpistole M1912" (Steyr M1912), and the "Gewehr M.95" (Steyr Mannlicher M1895).</li><li> A more minor example: the Wechselapparat flamethrower is referred to by its shortened "Wex" nickname.</li><li> The 1.59-inch Breech-Loading Vickers Q.F. Gun, Mk II is called the AT Rocket Gun in-game. It's a deliberate choice, given that the real artillery piece is used against <em>bunkers</em>, and since the gun needs to have more uses than just shooting at the environment, it was renamed to imply that it was primarily an anti-vehicle weapon.</li><li> A somewhat historically justified example is the Thompson SMG that was added in the May 2018 update, which is refferred to by its original nickname - <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Annihilator</a></em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees">Aluminum Christmas Trees</a>:<ul><li> Airplane rockets?

Every piece of weaponry and technology used in the game either predates or was developed during the war, if it wasn't actually used to some extent, but most were either too obscure or too impractical to see widespread service. There are however still some cases of this happening:<ul><li> Straight examples of anachronism stew:<ul><li> The stick grenades used by the Central Powers Nations (and by extension, the Anti-Tank grenade) are based on the interwar M24 stick grenade, as opposed to the more period-appropriate M17 model <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1c9cg');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1c9cg" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1c9cg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A noticeable clue is that the M17 <a class="urllink" href="http://www.imfdb.org/images/c/c3/German_ww1_hand_grenade.jpg">has a belt clip on on its warhead<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.imfdb.org/images/e/e3/Bf1-Grenade.jpg">which the in-game stick grenades lack<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small></span>.</li><li> In a similar vein, the M1911 isn't an original model 1911; it's a mishmash of both the original 1911 and the M1911A1 (developed in 1924), with the most glaring detail being the curved mainspring housing, which is straight on an original M1911.</li><li> The interface icon for the B.A.R. actually depicts the WWII-era M1918A2 variant, as opposed to the original M1918. The Telescopic variant of the B.A.R. likewise has the bipod of the M1918A2. In fact, even the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.imfdb.org/images/c/ce/BAR_ADS.jpg">iron sights<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> are taken from a WWII-era B.A.R.

The later MP28 could mount one, although even this looked considerably different from what's shown on the weapon in-game.</li><li> Limpet mines were actually developed ca. 1939. While some forms of sticky naval mines similar to limpet mines may have existed near the end of World War 1, the limpet mine itself was never developed and named until after World War 2 started.</li><li> The first Char 2C super-heavy tanks weren't built until several years after the war ended.</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8723/27927773170_730a6e1425_h.jpg">Allied gas mask<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> is modeled after a <a class="urllink" href="http://equipment.wikia.com/wiki/Mk_IV_General_Service_Respirator">Mk IV General Service Respirator<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, which was first issued in 1926.</li><li> As mentioned below, the model of the Villar-Perosa is actually based on a prop mock-up of the weapon used in the 1987 film The Sicilian.

That's not even getting into the fact that Bishop actually runs into a guy with a <em>flamethrower</em> at one point.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1jpc2');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1jpc2" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1jpc2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">And this happens <em>twice</em>!</span></li><li> "Friends in High Places" is set in the spring of 1917, but again, some German troops are equipped with MP18s. Not to mention that all of the German fighters are Fokker Dr.I's, which didn't see widespread service until the spring of 19<em>18</em>.</li><li> While most multiplayer maps are carefully selected from battles happening around the end of the war at 1918 (when most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareGuns">Rare Guns</a> had been developed), there are a few exceptions. Fao Fortress is set during the Fao Landing in 1914, Suez is set during the Raid on Suez Canal in 1915, and two of the <em>They Shall Not Pass</em> DLC maps are set during the Battle of Verdun, in 1916.</li><li> The <em>In the Name of the Tsar</em> DLC likewise has two maps set during the Brusilov Offensive (1916), as well as one set during Operation Albion (1917).</li><li> The Gallipoli levels in <em>Turning Tides</em> happened in 1915, and the two Battles of Heligoland Bight (either of them could be the one the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BF1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BF1">BF 1</a> is depicting) are set in 1914 and 1917. The Zeebrugge Raid is set in 1918 though.</li><li> The three infantry <em>Apocalypse</em> maps are all set before 1918. Battle of the Somme happened in 1916, while Battle of Passchendaele and the Battle of Caporetto happened in 1917.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutomatonHorses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutomatonHorses">Automaton Horses</a>: This game <em>loves</em> this trope! Not only can the horses survive ridiculous amounts of damage that you'd swear they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTerminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTerminator">Terminators</a>, but they're also capable of leaping onto buildings!</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryGunPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryGunPower">Arbitrary Gun Power</a>: While this trope is par for the course for the <em>Battlefield</em> franchise, this even happens to one specific weapon, the General Liu self-loading rifle, depending on what fire mode it's in. In semi-auto, it shares its damage model with the Mauser Selbtslader 1916, as both are chambered for the 8mm Mauser round. Shutting the gas system off and putting the rifle into bolt-action mode however, and it switches to the Gewehr 98's damage model (again, same chambering), including the bolt-action weapon's "sweet spot" mechanic.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseGeography" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseGeography">Artistic License &#150; Geography</a>: While the tradition of locations in the Battlefield franchise being much closer to each other than they actually should be continues as usual, it's taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> with the <em>They Shall Not Pass</em> map Soissons. The actual battle for Soissons was spread apart for miles long across the land, with towns of interest scattered about along the country side. Here, they're a mere couple meters from each other in the form of small towns as objectives for teams to capture. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> in the sense that it would be incredibly difficult and rather glaring to create a map that large in comparison to the rest of the maps.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory">Artistic License &#150; History</a>: The single-player storylines revolves around an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes">embellished</a> version of WWI. Everything historical still roughly happened when they were supposed to happen, but in the interest of drama and fun, the battles were condensed, the war machines more nimble (and not to mention, <em>numerous</em>), and the advanced weaponry more widely-used (whereas in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> they were relegated to limited-run or prototype phases).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCape">Badass Cape</a>:<ul><li> A few of the characters (including the Harlem Hellfighter on the game's cover art) wear a rubberized groundsheet cape.

Gun Mk.II is a portable artillery piece carried by Assault class (as simply the AT Rocket Gun). Like the Tankgewehr, it forces the wielder to prone in order to use it. That said, for a class focused on close ranged combat, the AT Rocket Gun is actually a useful ranged weapon for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">shooting infantrymen</a></em> from afar like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheIntendedUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheIntendedUse">modern day grenade launcher</a>.</li><li> The Sentry kit also provides a hand-held MG08/15 to provide ample firepower.</li><li> The massive artillery gun on the back of the armored train in "Nothing is Written".</li><li> In the <em>They Shall Not Pass</em> DLC, the Siege Howitzer is a rather large artillery gun to be placed around similar to Field Guns, and meant specifically to rain down hell on anyone in range.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackVikings">Black Vikings</a>: While the black (and for the British, Sikh) models in <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/369th_Infantry_Regiment_(United_States)">American<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troupes_coloniales">French<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_West_Indies_Regiment">British<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs_in_the_British_Indian_Army#World_War_One">Forces<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> do indeed make sense given their history (along with a lack of variation for multiplayer models), finding black German troops (German Scout and Cavalry Kits) fighting on the Western and Eastern Fronts is less so, given the fact that Germany hardly used colonial forces in Europe.

The new music is also darker in tone as well.</li><li> <em>Apocalypse</em>, the final announced DLC expansion, is set to tip things even further in this direction, if the early information about taking place in the most infamous battles of the war and <a class="urllink" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dice-wp-prd/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/28170615/XP4_concept_1-web.jpg">this concept art<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> is any indication.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGas">Deadly Gas</a>: A staple of the Great War, chlorine or mustard gas is now available weapons for usage by infantry from gas grenades, or deployed via canister shells from vehicles and artillery.

If the amount of ammunition you're missing equals the size of the clip (five for rifles, ten for the C96), the soldier will simply load a clip. If the amount missing is two clips, like with rifles, you'll load one after the other. However, if you're missing, say, 7 rounds from a 10 round rifle, the soldier will load one clip, and then individually load the last two rounds by hand. This means that reloading your rifle when you're missing 5 or 10 rounds results in more efficient reloads. If you don't have enough backup ammo for a full clip, then the reload will be made with individual rounds.</li><li> The Steyr M1912 mid-magazine reload ejects the exact amount of bullets that are left, an interesting detail for something that happens for a split-second.</li><li> Similar to the Steyr 1912 mentioned above, some of the weapons in the <em>In the Name of the Tsar</em> DLC have different reload animations depending on how many ammo is left.

Being one of the first automatic rifles on the planet, only around 100 were made.</li><li> The total production run of the Mauser <em>Selbstlader</em> M. 1916 was 1000 rifles. Like many early semi-auto designs, the <em>Selbstlader</em> required grease-lubricated ammunition in order to function properly. This obviously meant it didn't get along well with dirt, kind of a big deal in trench warfare.</li><li> 4,000 Mondrag&oacute;n Automatic Rifles were manufactured in Switzerland for the Mexican army <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2k0b5');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2k0b5" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2k0b5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The rifle's designer was Mexican, but production had to be outsourced due to a complete lack of functional factories in Mexico in 1911</span> (compared to 17 million Lee-Enfields and <em>tens of millions</em> of Mauser 98s), but the first 1,000 proved extremely finicky about their ammo, causing the Mexicans to change their minds. SIG managed to offload the other 3,000 on the Germans, who found the same problem. Most Mondrag&oacute;ns spent the war on armory racks, considered more trouble than they were worth.</li><li> The Luger Selbstlader Model 1906 was an experimental toggle-action rifle (essentially a scaled-up Luger P08 firing rifle rounds) that never entered production. Only a few prototypes were made.</li><li> Downplayed with the Springfield M1903 rifle which, while common enough in the hands of American soldiers after 1917, was less common than the M1917 Enfield<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3g5l9');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3g5l9" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3g5l9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For context, more Enfields were produced in just a year of war (roughly 2 million from 1917-1918) than Springfields were produced in almost 15 years of peace (roughly 800,000 from 1903-1917)</span>. The Pedersen Device, a drop-in conversion that changed it from a bolt-action .30-06 to a semiauto chambered in .30 Auto Pistol, was never deployed in combat, though it was technically a service weapon with a production number higher than most other weapons on this list.</li><li> The Webley-Fosbery Automatic Revolver actually turned out to be a terrible combat pistol, jamming quickly when exposed to the mud and dirt of trench warfare. The few officers who brought their auto-revolvers to the front lines quickly abandoned them in favor of the much more reliable and widespread Webley Mk VI.

It works like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">BIG</a> rifle grenade launcher, firing large grenades with blanks. It was ridiculously ahead of its time (to near <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk">Steampunk</a> levels) for being a shoulder-fired grenade launcher, but was never ever trialed by any military of the time.</li><li> While the C96 is a common pistol, the derived <a class="urllink" href="https://jamesdjulia.com/item/3100-394/">M1917 Trench Carbine<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> found in <em>Turning Tides</em> is most definitely not.

Only a few prototypes were made, in both the 8+1 magazine model seen here and a later 20-round Chauchat magazine version, but was eventually abandoned for being too powerful for its self-defense role.</li><li> Support gets the experimental air-cooled version of the MG 08, MG 08/18. Trialed towards the end of the war, it was only used in small numbers and the attempts to lighten it resulted in insufficient cooling; combining this with a still heavy barrel that lacked a quick-exchange feature meant overheating was a major issue and it ended up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>.</li><li> Medic gets the Steampunky <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U682yOpNafg">Howell Automatic<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> conversion for the Lee-Enfield. While relatively cheap and utterly spartan in its conversion, using most of the original rifle's parts with only a few new additions bolted on, the resulting Frankenstein's Monster of a rifle was unergonomic, heavy, and difficult to control. The sights were moved down the left side of the rifle and multiple guards installed to prevent the user from suffering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">Eye Scream</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fingore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fingore">Fingore</a> from the moving bolt. It also clashed with British Army doctrine, which had no use for a self-loading rifle, and thus never went anywhere.</li><li> Finally, Scout gets the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReliablyUnreliableGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReliablyUnreliableGuns">notorious</a> Ross Rifle, from which the above mentioned Huot Automatic is built from.</li></ul></li><li> Post-DLC, a few final rare weapons were added: the Thompson Annihilator prototype and the Burton LMR, both of which are prototype weapons and the latter of which only has one example ever made.</li><li> There are also rare weapon variants in the <em>Battlefield V</em> pre-order weapon variants. The Fedorov-Degtarev is an experimental LMG version of the Fedorov Avtomat, and the M1919 SMG is an early version of the M1921 Thompson.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareVehicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareVehicles">Rare Vehicles</a>:<ul><li> All four of the armored cars in the game were not common vehicles during World War I. The British Rolls-Royce Armored Car (RNAS Armored Car in-game) was the most common one relative to the other three, with 120 produced. The next was the German Ehrhardt E-V/4 (EV4 Armored Car in-game), which only 53 were built. The Italian FIAT-Terni Tripoli (F.T Armored Car in-game) only had 14 vehicles built. The biggest example however, would be the Austro-Hungarian Romfell Armored Car - only <em>2</em> were built in real life.</li><li> There's a case of Rare Tanks too with the A7V. In "Through Mud and Blood", Black Bess' crew has to fight at least four A7V tanks. In reality, only about 20 were ever made so it's really astounding to see Black Bess account for the destruction of 1/5 of all of them.<ul><li> <em>They Shall Not Pass</em> adds the Char 2C super-heavy tank, which wasn't built until 1921.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedplicaBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedplicaBaron">Red-plica Baron</a>:<ul><li> Richthofen is prominent character in the game since it's based on the WWI, even having his own DLC, the <em>Red Baron Pack</em> included in the Heroes Bundle.</li><li> All German fighter planes in the campaign <em>Friends in High Places</em> are painted like Richthofen's.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegeneratingHealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegeneratingHealth">Regenerating Health</a>: Infantry as per normal are granted this, with Medics speeding up the process by a bit. Averted for vehicles, however: they can only be repaired by a player equipped with a Repair Tool. All repairs to a vehicle must be manually carried out, whether by banging on the vehicle with a Repair Tool from the outside, or activating the self-repair function, which takes some time, prevents the vehicle from firing or steering, and is cancelled by any damage incurred during the process.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>:<ul><li> The reason rare semi-automatic rifles and sub-machine guns that did exist in the Great War are ridiculously common weapons in the game.</li><li> Airships or zeppelins fly well low enough in-game just to present themselves in all their glory.</li><li> Every German fighter plane you fight in "Friends in High Places" is a red Fokker triplane.</li><li> The existence of offensive-based armored infantry, as seen above in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut">The Juggernaut</a> example. This one is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> as the Italian Arditi did have armor.</li><li> Giant's Shadow has you fighting inside the ruins of a crashed airship. The battle it's based on, the Battle of the Selle, had no records of there being a crashed airship. However, some records indicated that some airships had crashed near the region, and that might be the inspiration.</li><li> Cavalry with horses had largely disappeared after the first year of fighting. This, however, is no reason not to include it in the game alongside late-war weapons and battles, since it is cool and fun to play.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun">Rule of Fun</a>:<ul><li> The general speed at which the game plays is far faster than what the setting would make you expect. The gameplay, unlike say, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Verdun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Verdun">Verdun</a></em>, de-emphasizes the slow trench warfare elements, and instead focuses on the open and mobile battlefields that the <em>Battlefield</em> series is known for. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality">Acceptable Breaks from Reality</a> (e.g. prevalence of automatic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareGuns">Rare Guns</a>) speeds up the combat gameplay, all so that the game would still feel like a <em>Battlefield</em> game at heart but with significant changes to accommodate the setting. To be fair, the entire <em>Battlefield</em> franchise had always sped up the pace at which warfare goes for fun, much like the rest of the FPS industry.</li><li> This also applies to the tanks in-game. Just like in previous Battlefield titles, some of the more redundant crew positions (loader, etc.) are not filled by the player. This leads to the British Mk.V tank only needing three players when its actual crew count is 8, and the A7V being able to have six players when its actual crew count is <em>18</em>.</li><li> The Limpet Charge sticks to everything, even though the real thing uses a magnet and can only stick to metallic things. What makes it really fun is that with the destruction system and the Limpet's high explosives, you basically have a mobile demolition charge that can bring down any structure it sticks on with ease.</li><li> Parachutes issued to pretty much everyone, in a time when it was still in a highly experimental phase; and worse, was even considered <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SafetyGearIsCowardly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SafetyGearIsCowardly">cowardly</a></em> by some, resulting in hundreds of British pilots plummeting to their death when their plane was shot down.</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/rQFrBS6KGsg">The actual interior<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of Fort De Vaux is filled with cramped tiny hallways, and during the fighting the electricity inside had been cut off, leaving the whole fort dark. Obviously, both of these are not good for gameplay, so the in-game Fort Vaux is more akin to a large 1930s Maginot Line-style fort containing large and open hallways and being well-lit with electric lights.</li><li> In real life, what little we know about the Hellriegel SMG states it fed from either a 20-round stick magazine or a 120-round "snail" magazine with a chute that required the user either be stationary, or for a second person to hold the magazine as he moved. For the sake of usability, here the gun is given a totally fictional 60-round drum magazine.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn">Scenery Porn</a>:<ul><li> The first level in Friends In High Places has you flying a plane over the snowy French mountainside.</li><li> Despite still being in a warzone, the map Rupture features large patches of bright red poppies largely untouched by combat, creating a surprisingly beautiful scene in a dark and violent game about war.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryGorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryGorn">Scenery Gorn</a>: Even more so than its previous titles. Due to the increased destruction capability, <em>Battlefield 1</em> maps have the ability to start off pristine and beautiful (trenches and some scorched land notwithstanding), to a crater-wrecked, mud-filled, burnt-out hellscape after one round. The map Verdun Heights deserves special mention, being set in the infamous Battle of Verdun itself, features and entire hill set <em>ablaze</em> by artillery shells, and you will fight within the hellish landscape at the heart of it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveHistoricalArmoury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveHistoricalArmoury">Selective Historical Armoury</a>:<ul><li> While there are many WWI standard-issue weapons in the game, the British service Webley Revolver is noticeably absent from the base game. With the British characters in "Through Mud And Blood" all using the much rarer Webley&#150;Fosbery Automatic Revolver, presumably to stand in for the Webley Mk VI Revolver. It's only later that the Mk VI Revolver appears in the <em>Apocalypse</em> DLC.</li><li> Bolt action rifles are limited to the Scout class in the normal game, but the "Standard Issue Rifles" custom game mode averts this for primary weapons; Each class can only use the standard rifle issues to the player's faction (i.e, the Germans get the Gewher 98, the British get the SMLE, etc). The only exception are the Italians, whose standard issue Carcano rifle is introduced post-release in the <em>Turning Tides</em> DLC, and they use the Winchester 1895 as their Standard Issue Rifle in-game. The Ottomans used to be another exception to the aversion, using the Martini-Henry (which was used by the Ottomans, but is not what one would call "standard-issue"), but the game later switched it to the far more plausible Gewehr 98.</li><li> A smaller example than most, but the M1903 Infantry is only available in singleplayer. In multiplayer, you can only use it by playing as Americans on the Standard Issue Rifles mode. Arguably subverted in a way when a patch added it in the form of an alternate firemode for the Experimental variant.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunsAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunsAreJustBetter">Shotguns Are Just Better</a>: Shotguns are available for the Assault class and they are as every bit deadly in close-quarters just as they were in real life. It is telling, though, that in the base game, all three shotgun makes are American made.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a>:<ul><li> 'Storm of Steel' takes heavy inspiration and scenes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Passchendaele" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Passchendaele">Passchendaele</a></em>, such as an Entente soldier getting a bayonet through his palm and how the battle ends <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">quietly with the rain stopping and the sun rising.</span><ul><li> <em>Storm Of Steel</em> is also the title of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StormOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StormOfSteel">famous work of literature</a> about the first World War by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ErnstJunger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ErnstJunger">Ernst J&uuml;nger</a>.</li></ul></li><li> Many of the Legendary weapon skins are named after important people and battles of the era, even the low profile conflicts before the Great War.</li><li> One of the multiplayer maps, set on a large <em>ch&acirc;teau</em> complex, is named "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sweet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sweet">Ballroom Blitz</a>".</li><li> &#321;upk&oacute;w Pass has an objective named "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarAndPeace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarAndPeace">Rostov's</a> Hold".</li><li> The war story "Nothing Is Written" naturally references the famous epic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LawrenceOfArabia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LawrenceOfArabia">Lawrence of Arabia</a></em>. Both the name of the story and the chapter "Young Men's Work"'s name are based on quotes from the movie.</li><li> The 3D model of the Villar-Perosa machine gun used with Sentry kits is based on the prop mock-up of the weapon used in the 1987 film <em>The Sicilian</em>.</li><li> If the defenders win an Operation on the first map, the resulting voice-over commends their "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ValiantHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ValiantHearts">Valiant Hearts</a>".</li><li> The version of <em>Dream a Little Dream of Me</em> that plays at the beginning of the campaign is the exact same version that plays in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoardwalkEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoardwalkEmpire">Boardwalk Empire</a>.</li><li> The Sawed-off Shotgun has a special reload that pays homage to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a> II</em>'s Super Shotgun, right down to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">deliberately jerky animation</a>.

The Hellriegel 1915 is a shining example since the weapon never went into production, there are only a few photos of it, and there is practically no commonly available information about how it is operated.</li><li> The "Apples", "Butter", "Duff" military alphabet that the announcer uses is the period-correct military alphabet used by United Kingdom's Royal Navy during World War 1.</li><li> On a minor note, if you pause it right and look VERY closely enough at the Singleplayer Trailer (when you're in the first-person view of the Italian Ardito wearing armor), you can notice that there are soldiers that are also wearing blue and red uniforms. Even though some French units fought on the Italian Front, the uniform is that of an Austro-Hungarian soldier, since the French blue and Austro-Hungarian blue are different shades.</li><li> There seems to be a very heavy emphasis on making sure that the weird WW1-era weapon reloads are portrayed correctly:<ul><li> Some of the clip-loaded rifles will eject a round when opening the action with rounds remaining. The non-empty reload animations for these rifles account for the ejection by having a quick animation showing the soldier covering the ejection port before placing the other rounds in.</li><li> The Steyr Mannlicher M1895 uses an en-bloc clip, meaning that it cannot be "topped off" with spare rounds. In addition, once the M1895 chambers the last round in its magazine, the en-bloc clip falls out of the bottom of the rifle. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">However</a>, reloading the M1895 while there is only one bullet left will still result in the animation of the clip being ejected. The player also doesn't eject the clip if he uses K-bullets.</li><li> The Bodeo 1889 is reloaded with a loading gate with an unusual technique where the soldier pulls the trigger after loading a round to spin the cylinder to the next position. The Bodeo can do this without fear of accidentally firing because the hammer is disconnected from the trigger while the loading gate is open.</li><li> The Lebel Model 1886 rifle has a very counterintuitive reload animation where every reload is finished up by pulling and pushing the bolt twice. This is because the gun features a cartridge lifter that holds an extra round. In non-empty reloads, the player character also loads another round before the second push. This may seem strange at a glance (you may think that you loaded an extra round after reloading all the rounds you fired), but if you look closely, the player character did not cover the magazine when opening the action (it's because if you do so in real life, you will mess up the bridge, which must be pushed down to load more rounds), causing an extra round to be ejected, which is where this extra round came from.</li><li> The reload for the Perino Model 1908 machine gun added in <em>In the Name of the Tsar</em> correctly depicts its rather unusual reload of filling up a hopper-like box magazine with strips of 20-round clips.</li><li> The tactical reload of the Farquhar-Hill rifle has player character disengaging the magazine switch before removing the magazine, while the empty reload animation simply shows the empty magazine being removed. This is because the rifle lacks feed lips and uses the magazine switch to lock ammo feeding. Were one to simply remove a non-empty magazine without using the swithc, the remaining rounds would instead come flying out in a spectacular shower of failure. The empty reload animation also shows the bolt being released via pulling the trigger, which is also consistent with the real weapon.</li><li> The Nagant Revolver normally reloads via a loading gate; however, reloading it from empty has the player remove the center bar, detach the cylinder entirely, and replace it with a full one. While this might <em>seem</em> made-up, it is in fact a real thing people did with loading-gate revolvers, especially cowboys. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome">Don't Try This at Home</a>, however.</li></ul></li><li> A quirk of the Model 1897 Shotgun is that it will be <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slamfire">slamfired<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> if you hold the fire button as the real weapon was designed to do this, allowing it to fill the role of a semi-automatic shotgun in gameplay terms.</li><li> Details about Conquest Flags:<ul><li> The U.S. flag correctly has only 48 stars on it.</li><li> The Germans use the <a class="urllink" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/War_Ensign_of_Germany_1903-1918.svg/640px-War_Ensign_of_Germany_1903-1918.svg.png">Imperial War Flag<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>, as opposed to the <a class="urllink" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Flag_of_the_German_Empire.svg/640px-Flag_of_the_German_Empire.svg.png">National Flag<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>.</li><li> The Austro-Hungarians use the <a class="urllink" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg/640px-Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg.png">Flag of the Habsburg Monarchy<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3t37m');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3t37m" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3t37m');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> <a class="urllink" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Flag_of_Austria-Hungary_%281869-1918%29.svg/640px-Flag_of_Austria-Hungary_%281869-1918%29.svg.png">This flag<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> was actually a merchant ensign</span></li><li> Arguably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory">subverted</a> in <em>In the Name of the Tsar</em>, which gives the Russians <a class="urllink" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Flag_of_Russian_Empire_%281914-1917%29.svg/1280px-Flag_of_Russian_Empire_%281914-1917%29.svg.png">this flag<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>.

They also deal 'critical' hits depending on where you hit the vehicle (each vehicle has a number of critical hit locations), causing bonus damage, and they can also disable components, if the shot and the vehicle's condition are right, including treads, weapons and engines. K Bullets have no effect on behemoths. Their nature as AP rounds also comes into play against Elite Classes and Cavalry, who all wear heavy body armor. Normally, this renders basic bullets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">almost worthless</a> against them, but K-Bullets punch straight through, making them ideal for countering these juggernauts.</li><li> By design, the Tank Hunter totes a colossal anti-tank rifle as his primary weapon, which is essentially the K-Bullet's purpose-built, juiced up brother. Unlike the K-Bullet, which depends on the material properties of the bullet's metal to do its job, the tankgewehr banks on the massive size of its bullets, making it monstrously lethal to infantry as well.

Despite all firing the same rifle bullets as Scout and Medic weapons, their damage models are generally only slightly better than those of the submachine guns.</li><li> The Sentry elite class is a Support writ large, with an accompanying firepower increase, as they wield <em>aircraft machine guns</em> as their guns of choice.</li><li> Tank Hunters are likewise equipped with a monstrous version of a more basic weapon. In their case, they have the Tankgewehr, a huge rifle intended to blow holes in tanks. It's so enormous they absolutely cannot fire it unless it's been braced first, usually against the ground.</li><li> Behemoths, as their name would imply, are colossal war machines, and carry weaponry to match. The main guns of a Dreadnought, Heavy Tank or Armored Train are cannons so large a man could fit his arm quite comfortably inside, and all of them are covered in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">autocannon turrets</a>. While the bombs of an Airship are similarly destructive, they are not, however, actually a gun.</li><li> Attack Planes can take a tank hunter loadout, which features a 37mm cannon normally mounted on actual tanks now strapped to a plane. Often, your only warning of one of these monsters flying around is a nearby vehicle or <em>building</em> suddenly detonating, followed by the plane lazily buzzing past.</li><li> The level 10 rifle for the Scout, the Martini-Henry, is a big, long, breech-loading single-shot rifle chambered in .577 rounds. It has a very good one hit kill range, and its damage even goes above 100 in a part of it allowing it to ignore bodypart damage reduction completely.</li><li> A BFG less for its caliber but more for its size, <em>Turning Tides</em> is set to feature the M1917 MG as a new Support primary. Browning M1917 is a <em>heavy machine gun</em> that weighs 103 pounds (or 47 kg) when the gun, tripod, water for the water-cooling, and ammunition are combined. For a comparison, that's about the weight of <em>five M249s</em>, and the Support can run around do parkour and hipfiring it while carrying his other massive gadgets. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePacific" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePacific">John Basilone</a> would be proud.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindedByTheLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindedByTheLight">Blinded by the Light</a>: The Scout's flare gun, in addition to phosphorus flares that spot enemies, can fire magnesium flares that burn on the ground and blind anyone nearby.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a>:<ul><li> Most of the Scouts gadgets are this.

This might sound weird and unrealistic, but it could be an interesting representation of a phenomenon in real life, simplified into a game mechanic, where some rifles deal less damage to their targets at closer range due to the higher bullet velocity making the bullet pass through the body quickly, while at slightly longer ranges the slowing bullet tumbles within the body and tears up a massive cavity inside, causing lethal damage, and at further ranges the bullet slows down to the point where the amount of damage to the body decreases again.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SawnOffShotgun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SawnOffShotgun">Sawn-Off Shotgun</a>: A double-barreled version is used as the sidearm of the Tank Hunter class and can be unlocked as the primary weapon of tankers and pilots.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShmuckBait">Shmuck Bait</a>: The Sniper Decoy that Scouts can use, which is a fake head on a stick.

It might even be more effective than real life thanks to also having infinite fuel, whereas the real Wex can only afford to fire in short bursts. Of course, just like real life, this makes flamethrower troops a higher priority target and comes with the downside of forfeiting your more versatile weapons in favor of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">flamethrower.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense">Violation of Common Sense</a>: There are a lot of things that could be done in the game (due to gameplay mechanics) that would be otherwise stupid or suicidal in real life. Observe:<ul><li> Some of the fighter aircraft in the game have two seats &mdash; one for the pilot and another for the rear gunner. The expectation is that one player would be flying the plane, and another will man the rear machine gun to guard against any enemy getting on their six. However it's entirely possible in-game for a single player to fly the plane, quickly <em>hop into the second seat the man the rear machinegun</em> and take care of any pesky pursuing enemy plane, then hop back into the pilot's seat to take control again once the enemy was shot down.</li><li> The standard grenade has the ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> any player caught in its immediate blast radius. However <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOnAGrenade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOnAGrenade">jumping on top of the grenade</a></em> in a prone position actually reduces the damage enough that it won't outright kill the player.</li><li> The flare pistol is intended to be fired into the air in order to spot enemies, however it's possible to fire it at the ground (specifically, at the base of a doorway) as an impromptu area denial tool as enemies that pass over it will be set on fire.</li><li> Has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">Flametrooper</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">Sentry</a> been mowing your friends down and causing havoc? Bayonet Charge/Melee them, as they're still vulnerable to the bayonet and don't take much of a damage reduction from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuickMelee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuickMelee">Quick Melee</a> attacks. It's even very possible to charge right into their gunfire/stream of fire and plunge a bayonet into their chests, and come back out <em>alive</em> thanks to speed boost and damage reduction that charging players receive.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">War Is Hell</a>: Mentioned in the operations several times:<div class="indent"><strong>[Ballroom Blitz cutscene]</strong>: We have nothing to fear from these Americans.
