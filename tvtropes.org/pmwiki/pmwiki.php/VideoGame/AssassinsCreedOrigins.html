Some of the DLC was free, including "The Trials of the Gods" (timed events that have Assassins fighting Animus-renders of the Egyptian Gods) which was available fifteen days post-launch; a Horde Mode, and most importantly the "Discovery Tour", available early 2018, which is an entirely new mode of the game without any action NPCs and violence, and serve as an entirely educational mode with commentaries by Egyptologists describing the research that went into the games.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Paid story DLC became available in 2018. The first DLC, <em>The Hidden Ones</em> takes places 4 years after the base game. The people of the Sinai are revolting against the Roman occupation, with the assistance of the Hidden Ones led by Tahira. However when two of the Hidden Ones die in a massacre, Tahira contacts Bayek, pleading for the mentor of their order to join them to rebuild the Sinai branch of the Hidden Ones and throw off the Roman occupation.</p><p>The second DLC, <em>The Curse of the Pharaohs</em> goes to Thebes and the Valley of the Kings, featuring a large new landmass. The Hidden Ones hear rumors of a new Isu Relic surfacing in Thebes. Bayek goes to investigate, but things prove more complicated as the city appears to be under a curse causing the old pharaohs buried in the nearby Valley of Kings to rise from the dead and attack the city.</p><p><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUuKIpCM2o0">''World Premier trailer''<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6jmYWdEd7A">Cinematic Trailer<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/uUKMc2LbsUw">Launch Trailer<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</p><p>The game was later followed by a prequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/AssassinsCreedOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/AssassinsCreedOdyssey">Assassin's Creed: Odyssey</a></em>, taking place in Ancient Greece.</p><p></p><h2><em>Assassin's Creed Origins</em> contains examples of the following tropes:</h2><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyLowLevelCap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyLowLevelCap">Absurdly Low Level Cap</a>: Zigzagged, in that Bayek stops levelling at 40, but still gains experience and ability points, he just doesn't level up any further. <em>The Hidden Ones</em> raises the level cap to 45, while <em>The Curse of the Pharaohs</em> further raises the cap to 55.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>:<ul><li> Jeska, a smuggler in Sais, who had been taken by Sefetu's men. She still manages to escape after being tortured, and when Bayek finds her she's single-handedly fighting off several hippos.</li><li> Zahra, a farmer in Faiyum who assists Bayek with the Sons of Ra, in-between flirting with him.</li><li> Shaqilat, a one-woman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La R&eacute;sistance</a> operating in Sinai who slaughters her way through some Roman slavers before Bayek meets her. She impresses him enough to ask her to join the Hidden Ones.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">Adult Fear</a>:<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Crocodile murders Shadya by throwing her in a river with a weight around her legs in front of her mother.</span></li><li> A side-quest has a woman mention her town's well-being was held by the local commander taking her child hostage, then later killing her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Only to turn out instead he'd <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish">raised her as his own child</a>, with the child being so young she actually forgot her real mother.</span></li><li> A woman whose village was attacked by bandits mentions that she's already seen her father and son die at their hands.</li><li> Bayek's reason for revenge is three layers of adult fear. Not only being tied up and watching your child being threatened, not only being unable to stop men from attacking him, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being the person to actually stab him in the heart when one of the targets redirects your thrust!</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">A God Am I</a>: One of Bayek's targets, the Son of Ra, has convinced the followers of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cult">Cult</a> that he is an invincible deity, giving orders to his followers from prison. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When you find him, he is nothing but a weak, babbling madman who goes down from a Hidden Blade just as easily as any other target, though at least he makes you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaseScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaseScene">chase him down</a> first.</span> Still, there may be some validity in his egotism, as he's the only sidequest target to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">get a white-room scene when he's assassinated, and there are inconsistent hints that he may be a Sage</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AintTooProudToBeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AintTooProudToBeg">Ain't Too Proud to Beg</a>:<ul><li> A corrupt merchant in Faiyum, when caught selling rancid food by Bayek, will do this (assuming the player lets him live long enough), along with trying to bribe Bayek.</li><li> Gaia, who has been kidnapping and selling children from Memphis, tries pleading to Pluto to spare her when faced with Bayek (after he's mowed through her guards). It doesn't help.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt">Ancient Egypt</a>: Billed as this, but the Ptolemaic Era of Egypt, especially the time of Cleopatra's (where it would be occupied by Rome), is a good deal more recent than you would expect of this trope. The Great Pyramids were more ancient to her time (2500 BCE to 1 BCE) than her times are to us (1 BCE &mdash; 2017 CE). The developers chose this era because they noted that a truly ancient era would not quite provide them cities like Alexandria (which as the name suggests comes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat">Alexander the Great</a>'s invasion), and this era allowed them a huge swathe of architecture from multiple eras as well as monuments that no longer exist (such as the Pharos of Alexandria, Cleopatra's Palace, and the Library of Alexandria).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsClothes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsClothes">And Your Reward Is Clothes</a>:<ul><li> Some quests do give out new outfits for Bayek, but the biggest one is for the Isu outfit which involves having visited all 12 stone circles and gotten 50 silica from the tombs, which you bring to a room under the Sphinx.

If you're having trouble, the game will take pity on you and give you a glowing line showing which way to go, and if the player is getting close, there's an increasing sound of rushing wind.</li><li> One of the Ancient Mechanisms is underwater, but once the message starts playing, Bayek's air-meter is paused, allowing him to hear the whole thing without concern of drowning.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypticLog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypticLog">Apocalyptic Log</a>: Common to a lot of animal lairs is a note nearby with someone remarking on the local wildlife.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryMissionRestriction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryMissionRestriction">Arbitrary Mission Restriction</a>:<ul><li> The gladiator arena missions limit Bayek to a predetermined load-out that varies between fights rather than the gear the player has.</li><li> Aya is equally restricted to her basic weaponry whenever she's playable, her missions never giving her the ability to loot different weapons.</li><li> In a departure from this trope, returning to <em>I</em> and <em>II</em>, <em>Origins</em> does away with arbitrary optional mission targets, leaving you free to conduct your operations as you see fit.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcSymbol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcSymbol">Arc Symbol</a>: The Assassins' sigil is noticeably absent for the vast majority of the game, until the very end, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when Bayek drops Khemu's eagle skull necklace on the beach.

Not only do they have archers in bright red robes (at this time the only archers in the Roman armed forces would be non-citizen auxilliaries), they also have a greater variety of equipment than is historical (some run around with long spears, others are giants with large clubs).</li><li> Bayek uses a <em>khopesh</em> more than 1,000 years after they were replaced with straight swords among the Egyptians. He also uses a Roman <em>spatha</em>, which wouldn't see widespread use for at least a century after the birth of Christ; legionaries were using the gladius during the Late Republic period.</li><li> The game has Cleopatra speaking with an English accent to emphasize her Greek origins as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentAdaptation">Accent Adaptation</a>. Similar to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedUnity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedUnity">Assassin's Creed: Unity</a></em> and Napoleon's lack of Corsican-tinged French, this ends up neglecting a crucial aspect of a historical figure, namely that one of the few very well-known facts about Cleopatra was that she was the only known member of her family to speak Egyptian fluently and communicated in it, appealing more to the people than her brother Ptolemy XIII (who only spoke Greek), so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfPerception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfPerception">she should ideally</a> sound the same to players as Bayek and Aya.</li><li> Their half-sister Arsinoe IV (captured by Caesar and put under house arrest at the temple of Artemis in Ephesus until murdered by order of Mark Anthony some years later) and their younger brother Ptolemy XIV (installed as co-ruler with Cleopatra after XIII's death, died not long after Caesar's assassination in 44 BCE) are not mentioned at all. Ptolemy XV Caesarion (offspring of Cleopatra and Caesar) has a brief appearance at the end of the game, but looks much older than the slightly less than three years old he would be at the time.</li><li> The finale of the game <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is set in Rome during the Ides of March, and Caesar's assassination. The meeting convened is explicitly about Caesar asking the Senate to confirm him as King and tyrant. In actual fact, Caesar at the time of his assassination was en route to Parthia to avenge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MarcusLiciniusCrassus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MarcusLiciniusCrassus">Marcus Licinius Crassus</a> and the Senate meeting was in his eyes, a minor call-to-order of no importance whatsoever. Likewise, the Assassination is shown to be quite clean and smooth, when in actual fact multiple senators tripped and injured themselves as they ganged up on Caesar, and Caesar himself used a stylus to vainly try and defend himself. The actual Assassination was a far more tawdry and pathetic affair than what you see here</span>.</li><li> Both Alexandria and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rome</span> were cities in the Ancient World that had large populations, a million people each and as such both of them should have NPCs on the level of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Paris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Paris">Paris</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedUnity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedUnity">Assassin's Creed: Unity</a></em>, but the game greatly limits the number of foot-traffic in both on the scale of the first two medieval-Renaissance games. One of the reasons both cities fascinated historians and authors is that after the fall of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire">The Roman Empire</a>, it would take more than a millennium for cities of that size and scale to rise again. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Roman Forum we see in the finale, is empty of crowds and shown as a militarized zone that Aya moves through but it should be packed full of people and NPCs since Caesar's assassination was an immediate public event</span>.</li><li> Cleopatra is shown <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to have attempted to court an alliance with Pompey first, and then turn to Caesar. There is no record of her attempt to court Pompey's favour at all. The game also dramatizes her famous meeting with Caesar (being rolled into a carpet) by Apollodorous the Sicilian, as Plutarch described, but Plutarch describes that happening privately while in the game it happens in the presence of her own brother. She also immediately offers a marriage proposal to Caesar, when in reality, their relationship was controversial because Caesar was already married, and it would be hard to convince the Republic to accept Cleopatra, a foreigner, as a wife over a Roman woman of patrician stock (as Caesar's wife was at that time), and Cleopatra at the time of Caesar's death was anxious about getting her child with Caesar, Caesarion, Roman citizenship, which even Caesar, after becoming <em>dictator perpetuo</em>, found it hard to do and too controversial to support, and in any case, his will listed his nephew Octavian, the future <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Augustus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Augustus">Augustus</a>, as his heir</span>.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tutankhamun's ghost (or whatever it's supposed to be) is shown to be a large, physically imposing bruiser who can and <em>will</em> kill even a fully levelled up Bayek.

Shields are among the most important pieces of combat equipment on both sides of the conflict as they reliably block both melee strikes and arrows, provided the wielder knows how to use them properly. Given the prevalence of hostile archers and the heavy focus on Bayek's own archery skills, anyone going into battle without a good shield won't last very long. It's the main reason why virtually no "must-have equipment in <em>Assassin's Creed: Origins</em>" list includes any set of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">dual swords</a> despite their great damage output.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium">Made of Explodium</a>: Refreshingly averted when it comes to the big red containers standing around in enemy camps, the usual suspects for this trope.

Oddly enough, jars gathered around trees, in brush, or near hay bales/leaf piles <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">will not burn said objects</a> despite them being perfectly flammable in real life.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeAnExampleOfThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeAnExampleOfThem">Make an Example of Them</a>: One quest in Siwa has Bayek going to rescue a friend of his, only to find the man dead in his cell, and his family dead after their home was burnt down to punish him, while his wife and child were still inside.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane">Maybe Magic, Maybe Mundane</a>: Despite <em>Assassin's Creed</em> as a series generally considering the supernatural as merely baseless superstition or the actions of Those Who Came Before, some of the more esoteric happenings in the game are ambiguous to whether they're merely hallucinations or real, such as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Khemu coming to Bayek during Flavius' death scene to tell him he'll be free and will be waiting for him in the Field of Reeds.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a>: "The Curse of the Pharaohs" might well be the most out-there piece of Assassin's Creed yet. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bayek travels to multiple afterlifes, and interacts with the dead, solves quests, and meets and talks with Anubis.

The simple reasons for this is that Caesar had briefly ended the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge">Cycle of Revenge</a> that had gone on for a century in Rome where polarization in Rome saw purges and counter-purges, and which Caesar put a stop to, and which his assassination triggered again, leading to the end of the Republic and the rise of the Empire. In the finale, Aya tells Cleopatra that the people call her a "dead tyrant's whore", which implies that Caesar was seen as a tyrant by the people of Rome when in fact the opposite is true, and the demonization of Cleopatra would happen decades later under Augustus</span>.</li><li> Much of the game focuses on Siwa oasis and its history, and Bayek is identified as being tied to its history and origins. One of the most famous facts about Siwa was that <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siwa_Oasis#Siwan_homosexual_tradition">it nurtured acceptance and celebration<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of homosexuality, and even same-sex marriage, with traditions dating back to the ancient era, suppressed only recently in the 20th Century. Yet there's barely any mention of this in the game, or hints in the background, with nearly all of Bayek's friends and associates being female (Tahira, Kensa, Rabiah) and no mention is made of any same-sex marriages there. The only acknowledgment of same-sex relations is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a> in Herakleion where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">one can surreptitously glimpse two Greek men having sex through a window</span>.</li><li> Caesar's contempt for women fighters is depicted as unmerited and naive. Yet due to the infant mortality rate, the far greater deaths via childbirth, and the lower life expectancy of the time, women often needed to bear as many children as possible to keep the population afloat (there was also the legitimate fear of being outnumbered by rival clans or nations). Every time a woman died in battle, her unborn children were perceived to die with her, so most cultures were reluctant to allow or encourage them to enter into harms way. (Female gladiators were an exception; most were criminals who were condemned to die anyway, and even they were railed against by writers such as Juvenal, before being outlawed by Septimus Severus.)</li><li> The place of slavery in Ancient Egyptian and Roman society goes almost completely unmentioned. This is important as the Greco-Roman period is when slavery really boomed in Egypt. This is relevant especially as the Assassins/Hidden Ones' entire thing is to fight for people's freedom. You'd think the whole slavery thing <em>would come up</em>.</li><li> In the Library of Alexandria and associated university, as well as other locations in Alexandria and Cyrene, you see tutors teaching both male and female students in equal numbers. In real history, these students would be almost exclusively men. In the Discovery Mode update, a behind-the-scenes segment even admits the developers knew this and intentionally chose not to display it in order to, in their words, "prioritize inclusive gaming over historical sexism." There are a few other cases, generally in the culturally Greek areas, where women are anachronistically seen doing jobs that would likely be males-only. A loading screen text actually points out that Egyptian women generally had more legal rights and equality than Greek or Roman women, and that many historical Greek writers wrote disdainfully of the practice, casting Egyptian men as emasculated and Egyptian women as domineering.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">Precision F-Strike</a>: Most of Bayek's swearing is Ancient Egyptian curses, which makes his angry declaration to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Suphia</span> about how <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her</span> "fucking lover" killed his son stand out all the more.

The all-powerful block-and-counter mechanic has been replaced with a hitbox system that requires precise timing and a lot more situational awareness. Many enemies use attacks that can't be blocked and need to be dodged in a specific direction; others are immune to attacks from the front and need to be staggered or flanked, something that is often more easily said than done. As in <em>Unity</em>, enemies defy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookChivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookChivalry">Mook Chivalry</a>, which turns being surrounded into the dangerous situation it actually is in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> &mdash; it's no fun fending off the shield-bearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook">Elite Mook</a> in front of you while archers are merrily shooting you in the back. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle">Boss Battles</a> are a lot more prevalent, each of which requires studying the boss' unique attack patterns to figure out a viable strategy to defeat him.
