It's not a problem if there are no enemies left, but as soon as one comes, if you want to keep the beatdown you have to counterattack the coming mook and reposition yourself into the former, whose direction is changing constantly.</li><li> It's also (albeit in a much smaller scale) a problem in predator challenges. Entering an air vent will always turn Batman's view to the inside, even if you enter backwards with the intention of seeing if mooks are looking at you. Grappling will always turn the camera up, which seems logical at first but it's completely unnecessary once you initiated grappling. Speaking of which... want to grapple to a certain point on the scenery? Well, make sure you rotate the camera to the <em>exact</em> position. Just because <em>you</em> can see the point you want to grapple to, doesn't mean the game does.

He'll also do so if you just choose to run across parts of the electrified floor to skip most of it.</li><li> In the beginning of the game, after beating up Penguin's mooks, the player could just leave Penguin alone without knocking him out and go up the ladder. The Dev team anticipated this possibility, so they had Penguin say something specifically for that occasion, which is where he taunts Bruce Wayne about him always knowing that Wayne was a coward.</li><li> If the player decides to stick around during the "countdown" on the clock tower, Joker will end up summing up the final events of the game before telling Batman that he really needs to get out of there.</li><li> Batman can find and destroy five out of the six Titan containers he needs to destroy for Bane's side-quest before ever even speaking to Bane; his dialogue will change to reflect this.</li><li> Catwoman has a surprising number of lines that play in specific circumstances. You can go back during the epilogue and visit any of the villains that are locked up or incapacitated (Bane, Mad Hatter, Ivy, etc.), where you will get special one-off conversations where they ask her to release them (which she refuses every time, for various reasons). In addition, she will have a unique conversation with Calendar Man if you visit him, where she says she won't release him after "what happened with the Falcones" (a likely reference to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkVictory">Dark Victory</a></em>).</li><li> It's entirely possible, using a glitch involving standing on a ledge and continually throwing Freeze Grenades on end, to glitch yourself up high enough in the game world to glide over the barrier surrounding Arkham City. Using this method, you can actually fly around and explore the rest of Gotham City. Yes, that big skyline you see in the background throughout the game was actually constructed and was fully detailed by Rocksteady (although the buildings are all hollow inside). You can glide around and watch cars passing back and forth on the bridges, fly to Arkham Asylum (which is also present, although significantly scaled down) and fly up high and see that the game world goes much further than just Arkham City. Most players won't even glimpse most of it (and it will glitch your save file out if you haven't backed it up elsewhere), but the fact that they put all this work into something most players would never see up close is nothing short of incredible.</li><li> Several puzzles in the games require you to throw an electrified remote control batarang to hit control boxes out of reach. If you hit a thug with one of these, it'll knock them out instantly. However, there are only two places in the game you can do this, on the Joker's goons when you follow the ninja into the sewers, and on the Two-Face thug you rescue in the steel mill. There's no practical way to use it, it seems to be there just because it makes sense.</li><li> In the Iceberg Lounge, if you try using the explosive gel while walking across the ice, Batman will point out that using the gel on the ice is a <strong>very</strong> bad idea.</li><li> When you are fighting <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Grundy</span> and use the REC on him, Penguin will comment on how that was a bad idea.</li><li> It's possible to unlock the Riddler side-mission almost as soon as the game begins by finding a trophy (as early as getting the bat-suit), at which point the Riddler will introduce himself to the player and mock you for finding one of the 'easy' trophies. You still aren't able to solve any riddles themselves, but you can begin working on the trophies and challenges immediately with this method.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedByTheSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedByTheSexy">Distracted by the Sexy</a>: Seems to be a tactic Catwoman can use to her advantage, as one of her counters involves kissing a mook right before tossing him to the ground with a Judo throw.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Disproportionate Retribution</a>:<ul><li> Ivy, as fitting her character.

To make things even more unfair, there will always be a thug with a detective vision jammer thrown in, who always either a) has an incredibly awkward route that overlaps with other mooks and/or goes to a difficult to reach area; or b) must be taken down last for all level medals. And most mooks will be armored, which will make most silent takedowns impossible. <br><br>There's more to this. Whenever someone spots you or you take down an enemy, mooks will look at whatever vantage point you're grappling to and inevitably see you. Even if you're far away of the taken down enemy, or you took him out with a ranged attack, they will still somehow know exactly where you are. Hidden below a grate or on a certain vantage point? Expect mooks' patrol routes to converge near you constantly, making it ridiculously hard to pick them off one by one. Falling behind a mook to take him down silently? He will, more often than not, choose that exact moment to turn around (though this only applies to the random routes they take after you're first spotted or you take down your first enemy, as their starting patrols are set). And know how mooks will look at the grates if there's a fallen comrade nearby? That happens even if the grate had nothing to do with the takedown and everyone saw it. Threw the enemy off the balcony? Well, though luck, now the grate he fell on top of is suspicious forever. <br><br>Mooks will also sometimes sense ranged attacks before they reach them, even when they have their backs to them. No matter how fast you shoot batarangs, electric charges or hooks, they <em>will</em> move out of the way with speed The Flash himself would envy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeKillScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeKillScare">Fake Kill Scare</a>: Done by Strange in the Catwoman trailer; see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMonster">You Monster!</a>, below.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero">Fake Ultimate Hero</a>: Quincy Sharp took the credit for saving the day in the first game, which let him become mayor.<ul><li> Strange's goal is to become this, to be seen as the hero after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killing off everyone who ever gained a criminal record in Gotham</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemaleGaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemaleGaze">Female Gaze</a>: Most character trophies zoom into the face. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice">Nightwing's</a> zooms into his groin while his animated skin zooms into the face, so it's clearly not an accident.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor">Felony Misdemeanor</a>: As shown in the first cutscene, Bruce Wayne was arrested and thrown into Arkham City simply for <em>embarking on a peaceful protest against the facility</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudingFamilies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudingFamilies">Feuding Families</a>: The Waynes and the Cobblepots were rivals for decades, and Penguin blames the loss of his family's fortune on the Waynes.

Joker has Clayface impersonate him to keep up appearances, and kidnaps Mr. Freeze's wife to force him to make a cure for his disease. Penguin kidnaps Freeze to prevent his hated rival from getting said cure, as well as for his "collection," forcing the Joker to then infect Batman and thousands of ER patients to get him to rescue Freeze. Two-Face is building up his gang and preparing to go to war with Joker and Penguin. Riddler's once again out to prove he's smarter than Batman, and is willing to kill to do it. And to top it off, Catwoman plans to loot the prison's confiscated goods vault and escape. To cap off Hugo's scheme, Ra's is also running this as a test to see if either Batman or Hugo is a worthy successor, and is more than willing to execute <em>both</em> if they fail. And that's not even counting the smaller-scale schemes being run by Bane, Hush, Zsasz and Mad Hatter.</span> In short, this game gives the dubious honor of having nearly every A-list Batman villain participating in a scheme worthy of their comics legacy (although <em>some</em> do get left out).

This, in turn, can confuse some players on what exactly they are supposed to be looking for. Here are some examples from the Spanish version of <em>Arkham City</em>:<ul><li> "Who's crazy enough to <em>date</em> this guy?" was translated to "&iquest;Quien esta tan loco para andar con este sujeto?" ("who's crazy enough to hang out with this guy?"). The translations gets rid of the only clue about Calendar Man's riddle, as <em>date</em> has no translation that carries out the pun with the calendar theme.</li><li> "I wonder how could you land an appointment with this miller? Perhaps it would be best to <em>book</em>" was translated to "Me pregunto como puedes concretar una cita con este sombrerero. Tal vez sea mejor reservar." (I wonder how could you land an appointment with this hatter. Maybe it would be best to book)." While the translation is correct, and any player would understand it involves The Mad Hatter, the <em>book</em> pun is lost in the translation, as the riddle is the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlicesAdventuresInWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlicesAdventuresInWonderland">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a></em> book in Hatter's table.</li><li> "Would an invitation to party like the gods be a <em>bolt out of the blue?</em>" was translated to "&iquest;Una invitaci&oacute;n a festejar como los dioses sea algo inexperado?" ("Would an invitation to party like the gods be something unexpected?"), effectively getting rid of the clue to the blue bolt statue in Fun Row.</li><li> "You don't want to be caught off-<em>guard</em> in this place, do you?" was translated to "No quieres que te agarren desprevenido en este lugar, &iquest;o si?". While an accurate translation, it doesn't translate the "guard" effectively, losing the riddle of the dead guard in the entrance to Arkham City.</li><li> "Do you really need to <em>hammer</em> it home? Everyone knows Harley's stupid" was translated to "&iquest;En serio tienes que remacharlo? Todo el mundo sabe que Harley es estupida" ("Do you really need to point it out? Everyone knows Harley's stupid"). An accurate translation that misses the "hammer" pun, as the answer to the riddle is Harley's iconic hammer.</li><li> "Who can Boyle and Freeze at the same time?" was translated to "&iquest;Quien puede hervir y congelarse al mismo tiempo?" ("Who can boil and freeze at the same time?"). A very literal translation that kills the point of the riddle, pointing out at Boyle's company.</li><li> "You're a <em>dummy</em> if you don't try and buy one" was translated to "Eres un bobo si no intentas comprar uno" ("You're a fool if you don't try and buy one"). An accurate translation that misses the riddle, refering to a puppet's shop. Dummy can both mean puppet and fool, but in Spanish this translation is impossible.</li><li> "Can anyone <em>top</em> the Penguin when it comes to the full VP treatment?" was translated to "&iquest;Puede alguien superar al Pinguino en cuanto al trato VIP completo?" ("Can anyone surpass the Penguin when it comes to the full VIP treatment?"). A literal translation that gets rid of the pun, as Pinguin's hat is the answer to the riddle.</li><li> "Brothers in arms, brothers at war, who is right? Who is...left?" was translated to "Hermanos armados, Hermanos en guerra. &iquest;Quien tiene raz&oacute;n? &iquest;Quien...queda?" ("Armed brothers, brothers at war. Who is correct? Who's...left behind?"). A very tricky translation trying to make sense of the puns in the riddle. For starters, "brothers at arms" was translated to "hermanos armados", which has no pun related to arms, instead "armados" refers to them wearing weapons; "Who's right? Who's left?" is translated to "who is correct? Who is left remaining?", a very literal translation with no pun whatsoever in Spanish. However, an avid player (or a dirty cheater) will know it refers to the Abranovich brothers.</li><li> Averted, but still worth pointing out. "This place has taken a <em>turn</em> for the worse. Is it a little <em>bear</em> for your taste?" was translated to "Este lugar ha dado un <em>giro</em> para mal. &iquest;Muy <em>osado</em> para tu gusto?" ("This place has taken a turn for the worse. Is it a little brave for your taste?"). While the "giro" part makes no sense in the riddle, "osado" is a very similar word for bear in Spanish, "oso", making it effectively a clever pun about the Toy factory Bane is hiding.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckilyMyShieldWillProtectMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckilyMyShieldWillProtectMe">Luckily, My Shield Will Protect Me</a>: The thugs eventually arm themselves with riot shields (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprovisedWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprovisedWeapon">discarded car doors</a>), the only way for Batman to hurt them is jump on them.<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShieldBash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShieldBash">Shield Bash</a>: They can also hit you with it, which is unblockable.
