Your overall completion percentage is also prominently displayed right in the main menu among others.

Assuming the DLC takes place after the end of the main campaign, and this is the ultimate end of Ajay's and <em>Far Cry 4</em>'s story, it comes pretty close to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShockInfinite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShockInfinite">BioShock Infinite</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/BioShockInfinite/BurialAtSea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/BioShockInfinite/BurialAtSea">Burial at Sea</a></em> levels of WHAAAAT?!.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note06mve');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note06mve" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note06mve');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The game's creative director has clarified that, while <em>Valley of the Yetis</em> takes place after the end of the main campaign, its plot shouldn't necessarily be taken literally. In other words, Ajay's not a giant monkey if you don't want him to be a giant monkey.</span></span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalsHateHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalsHateHim">Animals Hate Him</a>: Just like Rook Island, Kyrat is full of animals who want to <em>destroy</em> Ajay. Crocodiles, super-tough rhinos, tigers, dholes, honey badgers, bears, and demon fish all want a bite of him. Even eagles get in on the action.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotifs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotifs">Animal Motifs</a>: Elephants and tigers, mainly. The elephant represents wisdom and defense, while the tiger represents ruthlessness and offense. The elephant covers all the defensive or crafting abilities in the skill tree, and stealth and shooting is covered by the tiger. This is also the main divide between the two would-be leaders of the Golden Path: Do whatever it takes to get an edge, even if it means sacrificing all traditional morals, or stick to what you know, even if it stands in the way of progress.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingArrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingArrows">Annoying Arrows</a>: Thoroughly averted. <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

If you're low on supplies in the arena &mdash; health syringes, ammo, grenades, etc. &mdash; audience members may toss those supplies down, yelling something along the lines of, "I'm betting on you! Don't die!"</li><li> Speaking of the arena, your arena level isn't reset upon starting a new game, though you have to at least <em>participate</em> in one full match, win or lose, in the new game to register your previous level. This essentially means you only have to farm for arena levels for the Bushman once.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryMissionRestriction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryMissionRestriction">Arbitrary Mission Restriction</a>: The game has several examples.<ul><li> The "Hunting" and "Eye for an Eye" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideQuest">Side Quests</a> require the player to track down specific animal or human enemies and kill them, but like the "Path of the Hunter" and "Wanted Dead" sidequests in <em>3</em> the deed must be done with a specific weapon. This is in stark contrast to most of the game, which encourages the player to use whatever tactics and equipment they see fit. Stealth-centric players aren't likely to ever <em>touch</em> a shotgun during the campaign, but some of these side missions require it.</li><li> The "optional objectives" variant is featured on some assassination missions, where an extra cash bonus can be obtained by hiding the target's body in a specific location before fleeing the area afterward.</li><li> In what is probably an unintentional example, the game has very restrictive ideas about what constitutes "out of the mission area", to such an extent that some missions make it <em>very</em> difficult to use a "long-range sniper" play-style, as the game simply won't let the player get far enough away before failing them for going out-of-bounds. The entire opening act is a particularly noteworthy case of this, as you're not allowed to leave the area covered by the first bell tower you deactivate until doing <em>multiple</em> missions there.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrowsOnFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrowsOnFire">Arrows on Fire</a>: Army Hunters again, as mentioned under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingArrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingArrows">Annoying Arrows</a>. You like to snipe unsuspecting outpost guards while squatting in a nearby bush? Nice and cozy, sure - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">until some sneaky hunter you didn't notice before sets you, your favorite bush and the entire undergrowth around it on fire with a single arrow out of nowhere</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">Which also tends to alert everyone still alive in the outpost to your position</a>. There are two small upsides, however. First one: hunters don't just nock fire arrows like their normal ones, they do an elaborate twirl beforehand that looks really cool but leaves them open for retaliation, if you're lucky enough to spot the bastard before he turns you into a crispy pincushion. Second one: players can deploy bows and fire arrows themselves and thus potentially turn these tactics against their enemies. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByTheirOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByTheirOwnPetard">Nothing more satisfying than offing a hunter with a flaming</a> <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

He also points out that once he brings the ashes to Lakshmana he would lose all connection with the pre-Kyrat Ajay, the one his mother wanted to keep out of the conflict</span>. Though to be fair, this may be a bad idea: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by becoming Pagan Min's student and heir, Ajay would effectively be <em>hated</em> by Kyrat, whereas by massacring the army and saving innocents along the way, he becomes a heroic dictator</span>.

Throughout the game quite a few characters including the main protagonist, his father, Bhadra and Pagan Min take or get elevated to this status. <em>Far Cry 4</em> shows how it can be used, abused and downright manipulated to cause others to commit horrible atrocities in the name of whoever achieves such a status. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">A prime example is the post-credit sequence with Sabal</span>.</li><li> <em>Far Cry 4</em> also takes time to savage the idea of clearly defined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality">Black-and-White Morality</a> in war. While Pagan Min runs a authoritarian narco-state and violently oppresses the population of Kyrat, he tried to bring some order (although such efforts were intended to eliminate those hampering the development of his heroin fields) to a country which had suffered an 80-year civil war before he even arrived and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">was allegedly on the verge of phasing out the violence his army utilized and negotiating a peace settlement with the forces opposed to him at the gradual prompting of Ishwari Ghale, his lover</span>.

Ultimately, neither <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">rival vision for Kyrat benefits the people,</span> especially considering one is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a nation consumed by religious fanaticism and purges while the other had Kyrat becoming something akin to Pol Pot's Cambodia</span>.

He doesn't become king, the Royal Army doesn't surrender or leave, and you still keep fighting as though Pagan was alive (albeit in an eternal coma, FINALLY).

Undoubtedly useful, but it comes with the risk of leaving yourself exposed and unable to retaliate to enemy fire as the player direct the rocket to its target. One needs to secure a well-hidden vantage point before using it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">Disc-One Nuke</a>: It is possible to acquire many top-tier weapons before they are unlocked in shops just by looting them off slain enemies. Also, if the player is willing to grind the appropriate sidequests, they can unlock some of the best Signature Weapons fairly early into the game.<ul><li> Doing Himalayas missions (such as the DLC missions or Hurk's missions) will pit the player against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Royal Guard</a> much earlier in the game than you're normally supposed to encounter them, and subsequently lets you loot their endgame-level weaponry (most notably the .50 BMG sniper rifle) within the first couple hours of the game. Even better, unlike <em>Far Cry 3</em>, they're properly added to your inventory and allow you to buy attachments for them as soon as you get to a shop with them, rather than having to wait until they're "officially" unlocked by reaching the second half of the map.</li><li> The Bushman assault rifle exemplifies this best. The player gets the chance to unlock it barely a third into the storyline, long before its stock version, the P416 is introduced. It has an excellent fire rate, solid damage, a silencer, and a decent scope for mid-range sniping, making it a very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">versatile weapon</a>. It's somewhat balanced out by the fact that Ajay has to reach rank 10 in the <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneSidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneSidequest">Shanath Arena</a> just to get it; fortunately, it's easier to rank to 10 if you link your Uplay account with the free "arena companion" mobile game, and your Arena progress carries over to a new game, so if you ever restart the game, you just need to unlock access to the Arena to get the Bushman again.<ul><li> Capturing two cargo trucks is very easy to do very early in the game and unlocks the Warrior, the AK's signature version that's basically the poor man's Bushman. Most of its stats are inferior to the Bushman's, but it boasts the same per-shot damage and comes with a red-dot sight and a silencer to boot. Stealth-centric players probably won't be using anything else for taking out enemy infantry at short to mid range until the Bushman becomes available.</li></ul></li><li> The player can get the M79 grenade launcher after liberating a mere eight bell towers. It can take out many vehicles in one hit and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavilyArmoredMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavilyArmoredMook">Heavies</a> in just a couple. Unlike all other grenade/rocket launchers in the game, it fits in a sidearm slot, making it possible to use in vehicles (devastatingly effective for road chases and general mayhem) while keeping a beginner's single primary slot free for a longarm. Plus it reloads more quickly than the other launchers and the player can carry a lot more 40mm grenades than rockets. One of these versatile devices is available for free in the very first real fashion mission at what is probably going to be the second outpost the player liberates, or via an Armored Escort mission, where they always provide this weapon free of charge.</li><li> If the player know where to look you can score a Z-93 sniper rifle within five minutes of unlocking the first outpost. It requires a long hike via Buzzer and Ajay dispatching a handful of dangerous enemies but the Z-93 is more than worth it. It is only slightly less powerful than the signature Anti-Materiel Rifle but can be outfitted with a suppressor, making it much more useful to a stealth-focused player.</li><li> The Recurve Bow can be obtained as soon as you can afford it, and is a superb early game weapon. It can kill unarmoured enemies in one shot anywhere on the body. It is silent, which is always useful. It can fire explosive arrows and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrowsOnFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrowsOnFire">Arrows on Fire</a>, which also count as silent. If you attach a sight, it has better Accuracy, Range and Damage stats than early sniper rifles. Arrows have a flat trajectory, so it's easy to aim. It loses the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> ability in North Kyrat, but you should have an adequate sniper rifle by then.</li><li> The Sandman Pistol, Driller Machine Gun, and Elephant Gun are all immediately available if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">the player purchased the Season Pass</a>.

These guys are the real deal - unlike the rest of the army, they respect the traditions and culture of Kyrat, and then use those traditions and culture to murder everyone in their way. These guys have brains - they perform stealth (basically, they are resistant to the game-breaking tagging system, and have their own detection system which you won't be warned about), keep their distance and use bows to deal high damage without tracing themselves, shoot at anything close to Ajay that explodes, and can use traditional Kyrat drugs (with some hallucinogens in the mix) to become beastmasters and instantly convert powerful wild animals to their side, forcing Ajay to fight the animals and army instead of having them fight each other like they usually do. It's implied that using bows in a world of guns has honed their skills and brains... or that all the dumb archers were naturally selected already. These guys become player characters in the multiplayer, they're that good with bows and hunting.<ul><li> Interestingly, there are elite Hunters encountered <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">during the fight against Yuma</span>. The only difference between them and their regular counterparts is that the elite Hunters are wearing body armor, allowing them to take an extra arrow shot (headshots still level the playing field, though, not to mention <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the time dilation while aiming</span>).</li><li> A more mundane variety appears later in the game. Unlike the Kyrati-based Royal Army, the elite Royal Guard consists almost exclusively of Chinese mercenaries fighting for Pagan Min. They are first encountered when the player gets access to Northern Kyrat. They use superior tactics, utilize heavier body armor, utilize Heavy troopers of both the flamethrower and machine gun varieties more often, drive around in more heavily armed vehicles, carry more powerful weapons compared to the Royal Army and generally carry themselves with more professionalism. Essentially they're the equivalent of Hoyt's Privateers from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry3">Far Cry 3</a></em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment">Establishing Character Moment</a>: Pagan Min arrives in his crazy outfit, corrects one of his subordinates on failing to carry out his orders, executes him, and then takes a blood-splattered selfie with Ajay.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasLovedOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasLovedOnes">Even Evil Has Loved Ones</a>: Pagan Min claims to have felt this for Ajay's mother. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He did</span>.

The second is Pagan Min's cult of personality, in which Pagan Min sets himself up as the divine ruler of Kyrat, and that anyone who questions this will be ripped to shreds by wild animals that are supposedly bent to serve his will.

However, it is unclear if any fictional language is ever used in the game.<ul><li> Almost all present-day characters speak in English, though some of them occasionally swear or exclaim in Hindi. The only exceptions are the soldiers in the opening cutscene, who speak to each other in Hindi, and a pair of unnamed characters outside the Shanath Arena who speak to each other in some other language (possibly Nepali?).</li><li> Kalinag's narration is in modern formal Hindi, which may be anachronistic since formal Hindi is the result of 19th century efforts to distinguish Hindi from Urdu, and neither Hindi nor Urdu were used in formal contexts before the British era. Yuma says that Kalinag's written accounts were in Sanskrit, so the narration is probably a translation of his writings into modern Hindi.</li><li> The names of the Kyrati main characters appear to be from Hindi and Nepali, but pronounced as if by an American reading the English spelling. Rabhi "Ray" Rana even insists that this is the correct "Kyrati" way to pronounce Ajay's name in a hilarious radio rant.</li><li> The writings in Shangri-La appear to be gibberish, and not an actual language.</li><li> Signs above shops are an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CypherLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CypherLanguage">English cypher</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbrokenFirstPersonPerspective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbrokenFirstPersonPerspective">Unbroken First-Person Perspective</a>: Much the same as with <em>3</em>, the game never breaks from Ajay's perspective - we only see what Ajay looks like in-game because one of the first things that happens to him on entering the country is getting posed for a selfie with Pagan Min.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGameplayChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGameplayChange">Unexpected Gameplay Change</a>: Shangri-La episodes change the game formula from shoot-em-up RPG to action adventure. Your only ranged weapon is a bow, but it gets bullet time and multi-shot upgrades. Instead of throwables, you command an unkillable homicidal stealthy sand tiger <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and in one episode, an elephant with an umbrella on its back</span>. You are expected to rush enemies and use melee attacks. You will fly across valleys all Superman-style. And unlike the regular game, there is an epic boss fight against a giant enemy: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Rakshasa Raven, which can magically summon enemies and shoot fireballs. Aim for the mouth with EVERYTHING you've got</span>.<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After Yuma drugs you for the first time in the mountains, you end up in a prison cell and have to escape the mountain prison. And then the game goes all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivalHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivalHorror">Survival Horror</a> on your ass; without any weapons or gadgets, you have to stealth and evade a homicidal Shangri-La demon who roams the labyrinthine caves.

Now there's closer to twenty of them, so many that some of them have ridiculously-easy unlock requirements (the Stormer requires tearing down a <em>single</em> propaganda poster) and that some of them really aren't much of an upgrade (even the in-game store menu can't find much to talk up about the Sixer, which is unlocked simply by <em>visiting the store</em>). Where some underwhelm, however, there are others that are even more ridiculous than the old ones - the Buzzsaw, the Signature MG 42, pretty much <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

The only one who doesn't lie, to himself or to others, is Pagan Min, perhaps his only real virtue. Although, while Pagan never outright lies, he conveniently 'forgets' to explain crucial information to Ajay.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameFlamethrowersSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameFlamethrowersSuck">Videogame Flamethrowers Suck</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Nope!</a> <em>Far Cry 4</em> is one of the rare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter">First-Person Shooter</a>s that not only <em>doesn't</em> have its flamethrower suck, but it's <em>extremely</em> useful. On top of having a surprisingly good range, Flamethrowers utterly destroy anyone unlucky enough to be in the range, and to make matters even better, fire spreads rapidly and makes a stupidly-good AOE effect. Even more awesome than that is that for the Southern part of Kyrat at least, Flamethrowers are one of the handful of weapons that can reliably defeat Heavy Soldiers, which serve as <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.
