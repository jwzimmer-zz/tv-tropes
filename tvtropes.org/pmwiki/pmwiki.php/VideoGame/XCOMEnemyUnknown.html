A second <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DLC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DLC">DLC</a>, <em>Second Wave</em>, was released in January 2013 for free.

However, you can restart both the first (if the tutorial isn't activated) and last missions if you fail them. The first is so you can start over without having to set up an entirely new game, the second is because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Volunteer is one of a kind <em>and</em> activating the Ethereal device stops all progression.</span> <em>Enemy Within</em> also allows the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">XCOM Base Defense</span> mission to be restarted on both regular and Ironman runs.</li><li> Unit equipment doesn't vanish if they perish. This means that even if you lose most of your team wearing end game armor and using expensive plasma weapons, you can equip their replacements with the same loadout. This helps mitigate some of the end game losses by allowing your rookies to at least have a fighting chance in late game encounters should you lose your best and brightest, and hopefully level up from the experience. Of course, there exists a Second Wave option to disable this <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">should you want more difficulty</a>.</li><li> AI priorities in Terror missions might be intentionally set up to alleviate potentially frustrating scenarios. There are times when you'll be in a really bad position relative to an enemy, yet the enemy will often choose to kill a civilian even if they could realistically benefit more by killing a soldier. A Chryssalid can be surrounded by three juicy soldiers ready to shoot it the next turn but still opt to kill a nearby civilian instead. As a result, it can be a lot easier to kill the Chryssalid and zombie in subsequent turns than it would be to lose a soldier and try to do the same with reduced firepower and some potentially panicked soldiers. If the implanted corpse is nearby, you can even use a grenade to damage the Chryssalid while also killing the zombie before it gains its full strength.</li><li> If enemy advancement outstrips your tech, it is possible to start facing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Elite Mutons and Heavy Floaters</a> while still using laser weapons and carapace armor. If this happens, you will likely get TPK after TPK. If you have full satellite coverage you can't get a game-over this way, because you won't have any panic penalties<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0w6ch');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0w6ch" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0w6ch');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Satellite coverage prevents alien abductions from occurring within the borders of the covered country, so full satellite coverage functionally prevents abductions. UFOs only increase panic if they're <em>not</em> shot down, with the actual result of the ground mission not affecting panic in any significant way. The only concern is Terror missions, which can be prevented by shooting down UFOs, but the panic from those (failing is actually <em>worse</em> than not responding at all) can quickly and devastatingly build up over time</span>. So you're stuck in and endless loop of sending underequipped rookies against the toughest enemies in the game, and they can't level up because they keep getting wiped out, and you can't build them better equipment because you need resources you can only get from completing missions. This is especially a problem in Ironman mode, where you can't abuse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a> to complete tough missions.

They make very good use of the flanking mechanic - most of a player's introduction to flanking will be by having the technique used against them (on higher difficulties). They'll also throw grenades when they can't get a decent shot, will use Overwatch themselves if they know you're there, attempt tactical retreats, and most funny of all, accidentally use up their movement turns blundering into the middle of your units leaving them without cover and ripe for the slaughter. Basically they act like players, occasional missteps and all<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12q0ht');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note12q0ht" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12q0ht');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">for example, be wary of attempting to suppress an alien when its allies are about: on higher difficulties, the suppressed unit's allies <em>will</em> attempt to counter-suppress you if they lack a clear shot, freeing the suppressed unit back up to take unfettered action; alternatively, if they have a clear shot, they will simply just blast the suppressor in the face</span>.</li><li> Sectoids deep in cover tend to Mind Merge those in front of them, and will stay hunkered down. They'll also scurry away behind their compatriots if they're not already there.</li><li> Thin Men in particular are very intelligent, and will actively seek rooftops and proper sniping positions from which to support other aliens, particularly when supporting "heavy" troops like Mutons. They will also use their gas-spit attack to deny you the use of good sniper spots, but only if you are already in position.</li><li> The invaders will also "panic" (not the in-game debuff kind) if you trounce a squad with overwhelming force. Removing all but one of the invader units in the same turn that you discover them frequently sends the survivor fleeing from your soldiers for their lives. Of course, this becomes less likely as the strength of the invader unit goes up, or if they lack the intelligence to do so (Berserkers and Chyrssalids).</li><li> The civilians in Terror missions are miles better than the ones in the old games. They will run away from the aliens, up to and including <em>diving through windows</em> and <em>shimmying up drainpipes</em> to get away, at least after the first turn.</li><li> Berserkers have the ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierBustingBlow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierBustingBlow">break down some types of cover</a>, causing damage to any XCOM soldiers near it in the process. Berserkers tend to specifically target XCOM soldiers behind breakable barriers when possible, in order to expose them to fire from the other aliens.</li><li> Seekers cloak and specifically wait until they can hit an XCOM soldier who is isolated from the rest of the squad. They also often wait until you're fighting other enemies before striking.</li><li> Aliens mind controlling troops will often have them run towards your own soldiers and then use explosives to damage their pawn along with their target. Either it forces you to kill the mind controlled soldier, or it weakens them for when the mind control wears off, a win-win scenario.</li><li> EXALT troops <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByTheirOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByTheirOwnPetard">use all of your favorite tactics</a>: Grenades to destroy cover, smoke to protect their allies, splitting up and flanking, using rooftops to position their snipers... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">at least until they run wide in the open to reach an objective like the encoder in Data Retrieval missions</a>.</li><li> Alien behavior on terror missions fits their described characteristics / personalities. Enemies like Chryssalids or zombies are mindless and aggressive, and will gleefully attack anything they can get their claws on. Floaters are semi-intelligent but also in a constant state of berserker rage, and are just as likely to fire on civilians as they are XCOM operatives.

At least on Classic Difficulty.</li><li> Seekers seem to be spotty on their AI, sometimes choosing not to engage any of your soldiers even when they're under fire from their own allies, or suddenly attacking when the immediate area is clear of enemies and your whole team is on Overwatch (specifically waiting for a Seeker attack).</li><li> In Terror! missions, aliens will sometimes ignore wounded soldiers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities">and target harmless civilians</a>, allowing the same soldier who would have been dead otherwise to shoot them dead the next turn.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14vin9');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note14vin9" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14vin9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This isn't necessarily <em>stupidity</em> so much as <em>odd priorities</em>: different aliens have different priorities when it comes to Terror missions. Floaters and other aggressive, relatively-unintelligent units will attack civilians because they're much easier targets, and their mission is "kill civilians". Mutons, Elite Mutons, and other high-thinking units will <em>generally</em> (but not always) take a shot at XCOM soldiers if their chance to hit is approximately the same as hitting a nearby civilians. Essentially, the Mutons recognize the threat XCOM presents, and will fight back effectively (or kill civilians if they can't fight back effectively), while terror units will gladly slaughter whatever's nearby.</span></li><li> For whatever reason, aliens always skip their turn when under suppression or seeing soldiers on Overwatch, at least if they don't have an easy shot. This happens even if they're being flanked at the moment (and the possible death from reaction fire is preferable to the certain death next turn), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveStupidity">or if they're hiding behind a car</a> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto">THAT IS ON FIRE</a></strong>.

This tends to be pretty rare though, so don't count on it happening as a matter of strategy.</li><li> EXALT members are fond of using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a>, even if the numbers <em>aren't</em> on their side. Apparently, capturing the encoder is what enables their intelligence, because if someone's not on it, their operatives will expend both of their actions to get into the area and ignore your soldiers while doing so. Since getting into cover is apparently optional, they'll often get roasted the next turn. As a result, they usually won't give half a damn about going Overwatch if they're in a good defensive position or if the vehicle they're hiding behind bursts into flames.</li><li> It's worth noting that in Normal and Easy mode, the enemy AI is limited<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15vpnl');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note15vpnl" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15vpnl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The computer is essentially not allowed to consider some options or actions</span>, which causes a number of seeming stupid actions.

This is given a nod, as the personnel remarks how lucky they were to be able to sequence it using their existing methods. Naturally, this is pure fiction. All existing genetic sequencing methods rely on exploiting quirks of the unique chemistry of the ACTG-based DNA strands and their natural polymerisation mechanisms (such as during cell division), often by using a pool of "labelled" nucleobases that make it visible if the genetic strand at any given position is an A, C, T or G, or by using methods that cause a premature end of polymerisation if a specific nucleobase is integrated. Needless to say, it would be extremely unlikely for alien genetic material to be literally identical on a chemical level with ours. Even more, <em>if</em> sequencing did work, actually <em>annotating</em> the genome, i.e. matching genes to actual function, is a process that takes years of research and experimentation even for normal Earth organisms. Similarly, there is no way the team would be able to conclusively say that any given feature in an alien body is the result of genetic modification as opposed to being a different species, or having undergone physiological treatment or simply lifestyle. Earth biology is so diverse in the variety of forms it can produce from the same template even within the same species that there's no way anyone could make a blanket statement on something alien being genetically engineered with that little data.<ul><li> Furthemore, the 'Genetics Lab' and everything associated with it. The idea that the aliens would use genetically modified troops is not far-fetched. However, using genetic modification to change the physical abilities of existing, adult soldiers completely ignores what DNA is actually for in the body. That kind of technology (which is to say, selectively modifying the genetic content of only specific adult somatic cells, such as for gene therapy) is still decades away from us in the real world, if it's possible at all.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseChemistry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseChemistry">Artistic License &#150; Chemistry</a>: It is stated in the report of the Ethereal autopsy that the science team used carbon dating to place the Ethereals at several thousand years of age.

For some reason, the target almost always shoots at your soldiers when it panics (it almost never shoots at its allies or retreats, unlike your own panicked soldiers), so it's usually easier to kill it outright.</li><li> Snipers have choose between Squadsight and Snap Shot early on. Squadsight lets them fire their sniper rifles at <em>any</em> alien <em>any</em> member of your squad can see, provided the sniper's line-of-effect to that alien isn't blocked. Snap Shot lets them fire their sniper rifles after moving, but at a significant -20 Penalty to Aim. And sniper rifles gain an Aim Penalty for being within less than 10 tiles of the target. Further throwing the benefit into Squadsight's favor, are the Sergeant rank options of Gunslinger and Damn Good Ground. Gunslinger gives +2 damage with Pistols. Combined with all the foundry projects, they will do damage comparable to the same tier Assault Rifle in the hands of a sniper, and with good accuracy, making the purpose of Snap Shot almost pointless. Damn Good ground, gives a +10 bonus to Aim and Defense, which combines with the default +20 Aim for having the high ground on an enemy. Combined with Archangel armor, Snipers in open environments can just fly up and rain death down upon any alien that pops their head outside of a building, while remaining almost completely safe at the mission's drop zone.<ul><li> <em>Enemy Within</em> however, changes this up to push the issue into making both options look tempting. Squadsight is nerfed to be unable to score critical hits with such aided shots without the use of the Sniper's Headshot ability being activated. Snap Shot in the meantime, was buffed by reducing the Aim penalty to only -10. The addition of the new Seeker alien unit, means leaving your sniper in the back without any means of preventing strangulation, is very risky until appropriate items, melds, or armor is developed.</li><li> Later, they have to choose between Double Tap and In The Zone. Double Tap lets you shoot twice, every time, if your first action was to shoot. In The Zone lets you shoot as many times in one turn as you like, provided <em>every</em> shot kills a flanked or out-of-cover alien. In The Zone could wipe a whole map of aliens in a single turn, but this requires a fair amount of setup and least a little luck to pull off.</li></ul></li><li> Assault abilities tend to come in two flavors: Increase damage or increase suvivability. You can give them abilities that let them shoot twice in a single action, increase damage and critical chance the closer they are to enemies or with more enemies visible, or give them increased HP from heavier armors and decrease the enemies chance to hit the more of them are around. Basically a choice between mitigating the risk of their high-risk, high-reward playstyle, or increasing the reward.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast">Badass Boast</a>: Soldiers and special characters have many badass lines when activating their abilities and taking actions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCrew">Badass Crew</a>: A team of experienced soldiers turn into this, mowing down the aliens with ease.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassInANiceSuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassInANiceSuit">Badass in a Nice Suit</a>: Thin Men (especially in higher difficulties) can mess you up to kingdom come in early game.

It is very cheap and available almost from the very beginning, and can be upgraded through the Foundry to also give a +10% critical chance. Even by end game, Snipers and Heavies will still get use out of them. There is virtually nothing better for the Snipers given the habit of leaving them as far back as possible, and thus, not in need of any additional armor, and unable to make efficient use of medikits and grenades; it also makes shots more likely to hit even against targets with very high innate defense, behind high cover or within a smoke screen. Heavies still need it to buff their mediocre Aim score of 75% at Colonel and is one of their few options to have the ability to score critical hits, which is normally 0% for them unless targeting a flanked or exposed non-Hardened opponent.</li><li> The Medikit. Can be used to heal 4HP to a friendly soldier or stabilize a critically wounded one. In addition, a soldier carrying one is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">immune</a> to poison. Can be upgraded through the Foundry to heal 6 HP.</li><li> Support class soldiers. They're not especially extraordinary stat-wise, but they have access to a variety of useful abilities such as making Medikits much more effective with extra uses and more healing power, extra uses for all limited use items (in <em>Enemy Within</em>) or an extra 3 tiles of movement range. Nodded to by Bradford's description: "They make everyone around them better.". One single Support with Deep Pockets, Field Medic and Savior carrying a fully upgraded Arc Thrower is a MEC Trooper's best friend.</li><li> The Tactical Rigging Foundry upgrade from <em>Enemy Within</em>. Enables all soldiers from that point on to carry two items, in case you don't want to choose between two equally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a> items, and puts the health-increasing items on the table for flimsier soldiers with choice items already like Medikits for Supports, Reaper Rounds for Assaults without Scatter Lasers, the S.C.O.P.E. for Snipers and Grenades for Heavies. Especially useful for covert operatives, who can't use armor.</li><li> The Ammo Conservation upgrade from the Foundry. All soldiers can make twice as many attacks before reloading. Not exactly glamorous, but damn near required to get full use out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">Heavies and MECs</a>.</li><li> Damage-wise, explosive grenades pale in comparison to the advanced tech you can have later on, but they remain a method for destroying cover and opening sightlines, mopping up weak or nearly dead enemies, or weakening a capture target just enough to use the Arc Thrower reliably on.

While later abilities can allow you to do things like Mind Control your foes, chances are that Mindfray will remain a good choice because it recharges quickly and is often a 100% guaranteed 5 damage attack against many non-robotic low-Will enemies, even flying ones that can be hard to hit with conventional weapons.</li><li> Neural Damping, one of the genetic modifications, negates an otherwise successful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a> attempt by stunning the soldier, forcing them out of your control for a turn. Given the massive disadvantage mind controlled soldiers cause, this is a far better alternative than fighting against them for 3 turns or being forced to rush to kill the controlling alien. It also prevents panic, so it's a double bonus for low-Will units like the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran">Shell-Shocked Veteran</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines">Bottomless Magazines</a>:<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">Downplayed</a>.

At this stage in the game, your weapons are still killing enemies in one shot, so upgrading armor is more important as the aliens can often kill you in one or two shots as well. By the late game, you need to upgrade your weapons to compensate for the increased health the aliens have.</li><li> The first Terror mission, due to the heavy concentration of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseRangeCombatant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseRangeCombatant">powerful melee enemies</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness">lots of health</a>. Before, successful tactics tended to involve getting into a good formation and creeping forward, staying in cover, and trying to take out the enemy from afar. Now, cover is useless, the enemy is too fast to stay far away from them for long, and you can't afford to dilly-dally lest they convert too many civilians into zombies, so your only hope is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketTagGameplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketTagGameplay">kill them before they kill you</a>. It can be a rude awakening if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">you've invested too much in long-range Snipers and not enough in close-range Assaults</a>.</li><li> The higher difficulties can require different tactics both in the field and in the base. On Impossible, chances are good that until you get some heavy duty armor, nearly any non-hunkered down damage will be a one hit kill (and even then non-critical attacks can still badly hurt or kill you). So in that case you can focus on maximizing your offensive research and equipment in the hopes of having unstoppable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> soldiers until you can get decent armor. Enemies cannot attack (other than ones that can't use cover going on Overwatch) on the turn you discover them, so if you only tackle one pod at a time it is possible to kill every enemy without ever getting shot at or hurt. As for the base, you'll lack useful things like the Officer Training School, meaning you may have to rely on the initial four squad limit more than you'd have to otherwise, as an extra soldier or two can make a big difference. Furthermore, panic from abductions becomes significantly harder to control, likely putting multiple countries into full panic by the end of each month. Rushing satellite production (and the prerequisite uplinks, power, and engineers) can feel damn near necessary as you can only afford to lose seven countries at most, which is only two to three game months of not rescuing full panic countries before you lose. And if you are rushing satellites primarily to save panicked countries, chances are you won't be able to clear entire continents at once, meaning you very well many have to do the Alien Base Assault and EXALT HQ Assault missions sooner for their global panic reduction even to save countries that already have satellites over them.</li><li> Tougher aliens and squishier soldiers on higher difficulties also make item priority shift from grenades to health-increasing items like the Nano-Fiber Vest and Chitin Plating. That way at least the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMeat">New Meat</a> should be able to survive more than a single burst of plasma.</li><li> "Damage Roulette", a Second Wave option where every non-explosive, MEC subsystem or psionic attack is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomizedDamageAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomizedDamageAttack">Randomized Damage Attack</a>, makes critical hits and explosives the only source of consistent damage. With this in mind, it's perfectly viable to field ballistic weapons with the Reaper Rounds instead of lasers when going against high-health targets like Cyberdiscs early on. This ends up modifying research and engineering priority from weapons to armor, since even normally ignorable non-crit shots can one-hit soldiers with decent health<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note21kg9w');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note21kg9w" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note21kg9w');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">such as a Thin Man dealing 9 damage non-crit against a 4HP squaddie with Carapace Armor</span> if you're unlucky. In <em>Enemy Within</em>, the "can't crit on Squadsight unless on Headshot" penalty gives Snap Shot Snipers a more prominent role, as Headshot has a 1-turn cooldown. It also makes "Double Tap" and "Rapid Fire" more effective than against very high-health targets, just in case you <em>need</em> a certain alien dead and gone.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterCustomization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterCustomization">Character Customization</a>: You can <a class="urllink" href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v348/CFace/uXx3k.jpg">customize<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> the visual appearance and names of the soldiers.

This is to guarantee they can get into cover so they won't be easy kills, but they still get the free move even when it's already their turn, though they will be unable to do anything else for that turn either way. Needless to say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRulesAreNotYourRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRulesAreNotYourRules">your soldiers don't get the same luxury</a>, but luckily, they still trigger Overwatch.<ul><li> This can be partially circumvented using the Ghost Armor, or, in <em>Enemy Within</em>, the Mimetic Skin gene mod or the Ghost Grenade. Any of these allows the cloaked unit to discover alien pods without automatically granting them their move to cover. Now, if you have a Heavy or grenade-launching MEC-trooper in range, you can remove those annoying packs of floaters and thin men in their entirety as they stand about, or give a Squadsight Sniper a free shot to pick off a dangerous unit standing out of cover. Melee aliens won't use it to get into cover, because they <em>cannot</em> take cover; they use it to get closer, even if they used their turn to get into visual range. If you're extremely unlucky, you'll spot them on the final move of your turn, and they use their free move to get very cozy with their next victim. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsGonnaSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsGonnaSuck">Cue 'ALIEN ACTIVITY'</a>.</li></ul></li><li> An unfortunate bug can cause aliens to spawn right within your group entirely without reason or warning. This is due to the fact that enemy 'patrols' in the fog of war are nothing more than the groups of aliens sitting in a small group, waiting several turns, and then instantly teleporting to a different location on the map instead of actually moving around like they should.<ul><li> Fixed as of <em>Enemy Within</em>: aliens now move around the map as they should, with defined, consistent positions every turn. You can even manipulate their movement with the Mimic Beacon to draw unseen enemies to a specific area of your choice.</li></ul></li><li> In general, alien units follow the same rules you do: they can move twice, move once and shoot, shoot to end their turn, or move and set up Overwatch. Sectopods, being giant, massively armed war machines, can shoot twice and still catch your soldiers with reaction fire (but only if they don't move) in a single turn. Combined with their massive HP totals (more than any other unit in the game) and extremely high defense (-30% to be hit), they're incredible devastating when you encounter them, breaking the rules you've been following for the whole game. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And the final mission throws TWO of them at you at once! Fortunately this is why the Volunteer was given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastDiscMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastDiscMagic">the "Rift"</a>.</span></li><li> While they generally manage to rein in the AI's knowledge of your position, certain enemies like Thin Men seem to have the uncanny ability to run exactly the right distance to enter your field of view (and subsequently, theirs) to fire on your troops <em>without</em> provoking Overwatch shots, which only trigger when an enemy moves from a tile in sight to another tile in sight.</li><li> A strange case can be seen in Terror missions. Depending on sound cues, line of sight quirks and cloaking (especially notable in Enemy Within due to the early game option of Mimetic Skin), you might be able to "know" where untriggered and non-patrolling enemy pods are in relation to civilians, yet civilians can still die seemingly at random. That's because civilians in the fog of war have a chance of dying (and even getting zombified should Chryssalids be present) if enemies are merely present even if not actually attacking, and the higher you set the difficulty, the more civilians die each turn. Normally this AI shortcut would not be too noticeable, but there are cases where your entire squad could be covering all routes of entry for an enemy yet a civilian mysteriously dies in the fog of war behind a wall or something. Can be particularly nasty if a zombie sneaks up on you from behind this way.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConcealmentEqualsCover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConcealmentEqualsCover">Concealment Equals Cover</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZagged">Zig-Zagged</a>. Seemingly played straight, as all forms of cover only provide a Defense bonus (which reduces the chance of being hit) rather than reducing or stopping damage entirely, and can be shot through by any kind of weapon when the target using it is hit, essentially meaning all cover in the game is really being valued by their ability to provide concealment against shots. This means large garbage cans provide better cover than a low stone wall, and a bar tap or cash register is the difference between half- and full-cover. Averted by how nearly all cover can be destroyed by explosives or taking a direct hit by laser/plasma weapons, which makes it very clear the only purpose of the cover in the game is to provide concealment against enemy shooters. Played straight for conventional ballistic weapons when they shoot and don't hit their targets as the shots go into cover like the aforementioned large garbage cans, as bullets would logically tear through such materials.<ul><li> Mostly kept the same in <em>Enemy Within</em>, though weapons can destroy cover even if the shot hits the target (previously, cover would be left completely unharmed if the shot hit the target) and heavier ballistic weapons, like LMGs and Sniper Rifles, can now destroy certain types of cover much like laser and plasma weaponry.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfNinjutsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfNinjutsu">Conservation of Ninjutsu</a>:<ul><li> A pair of mutually exclusive Assault class abilities have higher benefits for having multiple enemies in sight.

Heavies with the "Holo Targeting" skill are fantastic babysitters for low-ranking squaddies with bad Aim, helping them get those vital kills. By mid-game, you'll still find Heavies fairly useful in the role of fire support, but it'll be your Snipers and Assaults getting the big kill counts.

All told, it's a staggering <em>210 Meld</em> to create and field a single fully upgraded MEC Trooper from scratch, which is a substantial amount, given that you can only collect 20 units of Meld during most missions until Heavy Floaters and Mechtoids start appearing in force. However, it's definitely worth it if you can collect enough Meld, as you get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> capable of taking on anything the aliens can throw at you if properly supported.</li><li> Fully gene-modding a soldier is also this.

In both cases, it's detrimental if a high-ranking soldier randomly scores a critical hit that finishes off your selected target. Pistols (and grenades, though those are more finite) can help intentionally deal less damage to soften up an enemy for an arc thrower shock, but then there are the stronger alien versions of them as well as Foundry upgrades to make them even more deadlier, meaning you might have to put off otherwise beneficial upgrades if you want to capture a bunch of aliens for free weapons. And there is incentive to get an alien as close to dead but not actually dead as possible, as your chances of capture increase with the less health they have, having a big jump between even 4 and 3 HP. Thankfully certain abilities like the Heavie's mayhem and rockets, the Mec Trooper's collateral damage, flamethrower, and Kinetic Strike Module, and grenades in general do precisely the number stated and no more, letting you shave just the right amount off of an enemy's HP.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">Downloadable Content</a>: Aside from releasing the pre-order <em>Elite Soldier Pack</em> bonus to the public, there's:<ul><li> The <em>Slingshot</em> Content Pack, which includes a special series of Council missions and additional customization options for the XCOM troopers.</li><li> The free <em>Second Wave</em>, which includes 16 difficulty modifiers, some of which must be unlocked by completing the game on certain difficulties.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticGunCock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticGunCock">Dramatic Gun Cock</a>: Snipers dramatically reload their ballistic bolt-action rifles after each cinematic shot, complete with a casing flying through the air in slow motion.<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHandedShotgunPump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHandedShotgunPump">One-Handed Shotgun Pump</a>: Assault-class soldiers do this after each cinematic shot... even if it's a <em>laser</em> shotgun.

Additionally, if the player knows that an enemy is in Overwatch (which grants a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack">reaction shot</a> if a target in range moves), they can move an Assault with the Lightning Reflexes skill (which forces the first reaction shot that targets them to miss) or a unit far enough away to be difficult to hit first, triggering the reaction shot so that other units can move into position safely.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">Dumb Muscle</a>: Mutons fit the trope to a tee. They're physically imposing and have strong tactical knowledge, but aside from that, they're thicker than an asphalt milkshake and have no effective independence or initiative, depending on their mental programming instead. Fittingly, they have a Will score so low that any psychic soldier will easily mop the floor with them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat">Dump Stat</a>: There's little need to acquire additional scientists most of the time. Research gets done over time and can often by sped up simply by doing Council Missions. There's literally no need to build a Laboratory in Enemy Unknown. Science gets nerfed in Enemy Within, as more scientists are required to get research done swiftly, and a Laboratory can counter EXALT sabotage as well, but it's still far more prudent to focus on Engineers or money instead.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBypass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBypass">Dungeon Bypass</a>: Quite a few, on both the enemy side and your side:<ul><li> When outside of a building, Floaters can launch to any other point on the map. You might think you're being clever by trying to bait them into an overwatch trap, but it's possible they'll just launch past the entire trap and go behind your defensive lines, causing you to scramble to kill them or at least move into new cover before they flank you.</li><li> Chryssalids don't need to climb pipes or ladders like some other ground units and are instead able to leap straight up tall buildings <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InASingleBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InASingleBound">In a Single Bound</a>. This means that civilians and soldiers perched atop rooftops may not be as safe as they think they are.</li><li> In <em>Enemy Unknown</em>, your soldiers' options for bypasses are quite contextual until the late game, generally involving either going around a windowless portion of a building containing an ambush, climbing onto a roof and then dropping down on the other side, using the grapple feature of certain armors or expending some of your limited supply of explosives to clear a new path. In the late game, you can instead just use Archangel Armor and Hover S.H.I.V.s for truly bypassing terrain restrictions, doubly so with the Advanced Flight Foundry project that doubles the flight fuel for both and can potentially allow someone to remain in the air for the entire mission even if they fly around a lot.</li><li> In <em>Enemy Within</em>, you have quite a few more options: you can leap up tall buildings with the early Muscle Fiber Density gene mod, you can have a MEC with the jetboot modules skill rocket onto otherwise inaccessible ledges (potentially available even before Skeleton Suits), you can have a MEC use a Kinetic Strike Module punch or a Collateral Damage shot to blast through walls, or you could use the Mimetic Skin gene mod available much earlier than Ghost Armor to set up ambushes and more easily avoid triggering pods of enemies.</li><li> Perhaps the most literal dungeon bypass can be found in the Site Recon mission in <em>Enemy Within</em>. Normally you'd have to trudge past a hive spawning Chryssalids and take quite a few turns to walk up the stairs of the ship and get to the transponder. Flight is an obvious bypass, but not one you're likely to have by the time the mission shows up. However, both Muscle Fiber Density and armor with grappling capabilities (most likely Skeleton Suit) could be available to you if you see this mission in the early to mid game. With either of those, you can just leap or grapple up to the top deck of the ship from its entrance and be very close to the transponder. Chryssalids are mobile enough that it's not fool-proof (you'll still probably want other soldiers close by to thin their spawn numbers), but it can at least save you multiple turns getting to the transponder otherwise.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The Dreaded</a>:<ul><li> To many X-Com players, The Sectopod. Due to its devastating array of weaponry, near-perfect accuracy and absolutely <em>insane</em> damage resistance, you know you're in for a hard time when one of these behemoths thud into view.

However, if you know they're coming and plan accordingly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">you can net one of those Plasma Rifles to research and reverse-engineer and the Muton himself to interrogate and cut down on the plasma research time by a LOT</a>.</li><li> Continuing the trend, you can encounter a Cyberdisk in the final mission of the DLC.

You also don't have to worry about having proper storage facilities for alien corpses, power generators, Elerium, or anything else you recover. It's merely held for you until you're able or willing to use it for something.</li><li> One less obvious logistics-related thing is that you need to make sure that you have an Interceptor available at every continent that can detect UFOs via satellites, or you won't be able to actually shoot them down once they're detected.

It gives you the chance to recover as much usable alien tech and materials as possible, but using the weapon means the fighter has to get very close to the UFO, while dodging enemy plasma shots. More useful with the Firestorm, which can withstand a lot more hits than the regular Interceptor.

We aren't shown the details (as a shutter closes when interrogation starts), but it involves two arms radiating some energy, getting information straight out of the alien's brain and lots of sedatives. Also, the subject <em>never</em> survives the process and you always get their corpse added to your stockpile after the interrogation.

Presumably, the risk of having a Berserker around meant it was simply killed afterwards. Likewise, the Heavy Floater Interrogation seems to involve figuring out how to puppet it mentally, then having it run tests, as neither has much in the way of actual knowledge desired by XCOM. Indeed, the research credits they give are related to their physical capabilities (Armor for Berserkers and Flight for Heavy Floaters).</li><li> Not to mention South America's continent bonus - "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveWaysOfMakingYouTalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveWaysOfMakingYouTalk">We Have Ways</a>", making both Interrogations and Autopsies instantaneous, banking on the reputation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BananaRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BananaRepublic">certain South American dictatorships</a> and their employment of these.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission">Escort Mission</a>:<ul><li> Target Extraction Council missions. Unlike just about every other game ever, the Escort is fully controllable and has a special ability that raises their defense, though only if they're in cover and haven't dashed to get to said cover. It's a bit strange in the case of one potential escort, who protests loudly about being extracted against his will by XCOM while the aliens gleefully shoot at him; presumably he plays like the others because of gameplay limitations, or because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun">having to have a soldier push him around would be too much of a hassle to be enjoyable</a>.</li><li> Covert Extractions in <em>Enemy Within</em> play like this. The covert operative has to hack a few comms relays and hightail it to the Skyranger, and it's up to the rest of the squad to protect them or the mission will be a failure. The kicker is that the operative is one of your own soldiers, toting a pistol and whatever items you gave them when you sent them off, plus whatever gene mods they had implanted. A high-ranked soldier with a Plasma Pistol can be a bigger, tougher and badder unit than most in the extraction squad sent after them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto">Every Car Is a Pinto</a>: Unsurprising, given how many laser and plasma weapons are getting thrown around.

On rare and deeply ironic occasions, "Intimidate" will cause a soldier whose already acted for the turn to panic and shoot the Muton who just used "Intimidate" dead.</li><li> Berserkers have an ability called "Bloodlust" that makes them take a free move towards the soldier that shot at them every time they are hurt. Since they are melee only fighters, it may look like a good idea, but it ends up doing them much more harm than good. The reason is that they just get a free move, not a free <em>attack</em>, so even if they completely close the distance and reach their attacker they can only stand next to him and do nothing until the next turn. Which they usually never live to see, since they are now standing without cover in the middle of a squad of angry XCOM soldiers who will slaughter them at short range. It is even worse if you have the perk that grants your Assault soldiers a free reaction shot against any enemy that moves within 4 squares: two such Assault soldiers close enough to each other will brutalize a trapped Berserker.</li><li> When an enemy psionically attacks a soldier with the Neural Feedback gene mod, the attacker suffers massive damage and gets all their psionic abilities put on forced cooldown. Not even the mighty Ethereals can defend against this passive ability. The feedback damage is enough to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> basic Sectoids and grievously wound more powerful enemy types.

Aliens attack Earth with vast technological superiority, and Earth fights back by <em>taking</em> that technology and <em>improving</em> on it. The Firestorm interceptor is more powerful than anything short of the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Temple Ship</span>, and aliens never field Alloy Cannons or Plasma Sniper Rifles because those are completely custom XCOM designs.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine">Hold the Line</a>: Two variant mission types in <em>Enemy Within</em>:<ul><li> One of the EXALT mission types, Covert Data Recovery, involves protecting a transmitter that is feeding XCOM intel on their operations. You have to defend an encoder, which is hiding the location of the transmitter, and if the encoder is disabled by EXALT, you have to defend the transmitter itself; you do that in traditional King Of The Hill fashion, by staying within a certain distance of the encoder/transmitter to block EXALT from "capturing" the equipment (i.e. being the only ones within the perimeter for a certain number of turns). Once you've killed all the EXALT waves, the mission is successful; if EXALT hacks both the encoder and the transmitter, or the transmitter is destroyed by any cover-destroying damage, the mission fails. If you manage to protect the transmitter <em>and</em> the encoder, the mission reward is more generous.</li><li> The other variant is Operations: Ashes and Temples, where you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">defend the Delta section of XCOM's headquarters</span> against multiple waves of alien invaders <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">some time after you destroy the alien base</span>. There are four waves of enemies and you start with your three highest units on the soldier's list, with more coming as reinforcements, and there are also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy">Base Defense troops</a> (essentially slightly worse rookies that always have frag grenades) to assist your squad.</li><li> Furthermore, the entire game is basically an example of "hold the line", as the player is required to fend off endless waves of alien assaults until he can find and assault the alien command ship. This is particularly true early on, as the player is in a desperate struggle to keep the panic rating of council nations low and handle the constant alien abduction missions until they are all under satellite coverage.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HologramProjectionImperfection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HologramProjectionImperfection">Hologram Projection Imperfection</a>: The aliens use plenty of holographic interfaces for the computers on their ships and bases.

If it's a miss, it's a miss, no matter where the in-game representation of the shots land; even if an entire burst hits the head, chest and belly of the target's model, if it's a miss, no damage is dealt. Because the game rolled "failed" or if it's suppression (which doesn't do damage unless Mayhem, a Colonel rank Heavy-specific skill is chosen), the representation just generates fire in a random cone, which means even missed shots could drill the target right between their eyes. Of course, those shots don't do any damage, even if your barrage of suppressive fire hits that Muton in the face, and vice-versa.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowDareYouDieOnMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowDareYouDieOnMe">How Dare You Die on Me!</a>: One of the upgrades from the Officer Training School is "Don't Die On Me", which increases the chances that soldiers will simply be critically wounded when their HP drops to 0.

At the beginning of the game, XCOM has ballistic weapons, mostly ineffective armor, and little else, while the aliens field the much weaker Sectoids and Thin Men, armed with plasma pistols and light plasma rifles at worst. By the time XCOM has started to field advanced equipment in the form of laser weapons and armor forged from the alien alloys, the aliens up the ante with Mutons and Floaters, some armed with full-sized Plasma Rifles.

The lower the soldier's Will score, the more likely they'll panic when another soldier dies or is mind-controlled, when they take a hit, or when a Muton calls them out with their Intimidate ability. When they panic, they can shoot a random target (with an Aim penalty and randomly chosen from your other troopers, visible aliens and civilians), run for cover, hunker down or just run in general.</li><li> Aliens (and EXALT soldiers in <em>Enemy Within</em>) can be forcibly panicked by Psi-Panic, and will act much the same way as a panicking XCOM soldier. They will not do so normally, however, though they will temporarily retreat and/or call for help if you quickly kill enough of them.</li><li> In a metagame sense, you'll be saying this a lot when you encounter a new alien unit and they unleash an ability you haven't seen before. Additionally, every time you see Chryssalids (early-mid game) and Sectopods (all the time, especially if there's more than one). You'll also be saying it an awful lot when you send a trooper into a room to take cover and clear up the fog of war when raiding a landed or crashed UFO... and then it turns out he's running into the middle of a group of Mutons.</li><li> One of the most common reasons for this is on your orders for the last soldier who hasn't acted yet. Dash forward without caution, and you may encounter a group of Chryssalids or a Berserker, who use their "enemy spotted" action to get as close to your troops as possible... then it's their actual turn to act.</li><li> MEC Flamethrowers in <em>Enemy Within</em> can make any organic enemy panic.

In <em>Enemy Within</em>, Sectopods are so tough because of Reinforced Armor that it's unlikely you'll be able to get rid of them in a single turn, and if you leave their Drone allies alive they can effectively erase any damage you dealt on their turn. As such, it makes a lot of sense to kill the Drones first, especially with AOE attacks like rockets, grenades, or proximity mines that can kill the Drone outright and possibly damage the Sectopod as well.</li><li> In Terror Site missions, Drones will forgo their repairman roles to attack and kill civilians, which they're annoyingly effective at thanks to flight and innate defense. Shooting them is an absolute priority if you're going for the best ratings.</li><li> If you have Drone Capture developed in the Foundry, in non-Terror missions it's not bad to save Drones for last so they can be hacked with the Arc Thrower. A hacked drone is permanently in XCOM's side until the mission ends, and can serve as a risk-free disposable scout or autonomous grenade; if you're running a S.H.I.V., they can repair it from a considerable distance. But the most crucial aspect of hacking Drones is in <em>Enemy Within</em>: they can also repair MECs, and from far away.

The problem is that rookies are much less capable, so there's a vital need to train them up - and the only way to do that is to send them on missions. The lucky ones get to tag along with the vets on a mission, which means that it's entirely likely that the first alien they'll see will be a Muton or Chryssalid. But if you have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">Code Black</a> with your vets, you may end up sending an entire squad of rookies on a mission that will definitely get some of them killed.

Sometimes, they'll do it even when they're in a secure position and your soldiers make easier targets.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpySatellites" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpySatellites">Spy Satellites</a>: Used to search for UFOs outside of your main base's radar coverage. Keeping satellite coverage heavy is important to keep the various nations from withdrawing from the Council (and more importantly, funding <em>you</em>, as only countries with satellite coverage will give you monthly donations) and the aliens visible and chaseable. If you don't diligently shoot down UFOs with your interceptors, your satellites can be shot down, necessitating an expensive and time-consuming replacement. Fortunately, you can also research stealth enhancements for your satellites at the Foundry, making them harder for the aliens to find.<ul><li> Satellite coverage has another, less-advertised result: if a country has coverage at the start of a month, it will no longer be possible for the aliens to start abductions in that country. Thus, in addition to giving you the continent-specific bonus, locking down a continent with complete coverage will stop its panic level from rising (assuming you don't fail any Interceptions, Raids or Terror Missions).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StaticRoleExchangeableCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StaticRoleExchangeableCharacter">Static Role, Exchangeable Character</a>: "The Volunteer".

Assaults gain an ability that gives them bonus health based on the armor they wear. With both the armor and plating equipped, an Assault can have up to 29 hitpoints, making them far more durable than even an Alloy SHIV, which can only have up to 18 hitpoints.<ul><li> Subverted with the inclusion of the MEC Trooper, which can have the same amount of hitpoints by using a Tier III "Paladin" MEC Suit with the "Shaped Armor" Foundry Project. Coupled with abilities that allows a MEC to reduce incoming damage and even repair damage taken, MECs can often soak up more damage than an Assault can.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">Stuff Blowing Up</a>: Grenades and rocket launchers are extremely effective at completely blowing the stuffing out of the aliens. The downside is that they blow up any salvageable material (including Weapon Fragments, if you kill an alien with them) in their blast radius, but hey, if you get the opportunity to completely waste a group of weak enemies, then by all means, annihilate them! Better than losing your squad. Also, melee-only aliens like the Chryssalids don't provide Weapon Fragments in the first place, so feel free to blow them to pieces. They also tend to be bunched up when initially encountered.<ul><li> You can also use them to just blow up the aliens' cover, allowing your other troopers to shoot them without an accuracy penalty. Using them to soften up a group of very tough enemies is also viable, as Weapon Fragments are only lost if they're <em>killed</em> with explosives (or if explosions hit their dead bodies and dropped hardware).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption">Stupidity Is the Only Option</a>:<ul><li> The tutorial involves the initial squad charging into unknown territory and subsequently getting ambushed while investigating a German soldier acting oddly. Because of the structure of the tutorial, it happens while trying to disarm the (armed, unresponsive) German soldier by sending one man to him in plain view before the team establishes Overwatch.</li><li> Even if you know your mind control ability is only temporary, you can't have your squad shoot or stun your mind controlled subject until he breaks free, unless you use up your limited amount of explosives. Having the aliens kill it for you gives your squad a Will penalty for the rest of the mission, since it's marked as a teammate while mind controlled, so that's out too. It gets ridiculous when one of your squad <em>panics</em> because a mind-controlled Sectoid gets blown up.<ul><li> The Will penalty was removed in a patch, but you still can't preemptively apply a shotgun slug or Arc Thrower to their head. Of course, this also means that the aliens can't do so when they have <em>your</em> forces mind controlled.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalOverconfidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalOverconfidence">Suicidal Overconfidence</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope">Zig Zagged</a>. Most aliens avert this; they'll sound the retreat, fall back to better cover and call for help if they feel they're outnumbered and/or outgunned. Chryssalids and Muton Berserkers play this straight; these two will (usually) charge ahead instead (note that they can move, but not attack in your turn), allowing you to shoot them point blank in the face. In the case of the Berserkers, there's a good chance an Assault can shoot one 3 times in one turn with the right abilities and when in the right position. Even Chrysallids will panic if flamethrowered, though for only one turn.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery">Superpower Lottery</a>:<ul><li> How receiving the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">the Gift</a> works.

It's established early on that XCOM is more of a black-ops unit tasked with assaulting key objectives, while leaving the heavy fighting to the rest of the Earth's militaries. Additionally, XCOM's mandate isn't to fight the war directly, but rather to <em>win</em> it, by identifying the aliens' weaknesses and exploiting them to stop the invasion.

Your base includes a laboratory full of scientists feverishly reverse-engineering captured alien tech and sending your soldiers into the field with hastily cobbled-together prototypes based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBox">principles that aren't fully understood</a> and concepts that were entirely unknown mere days before. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">They all work perfectly</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstableEquilibrium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstableEquilibrium">Unstable Equilibrium</a>:<ul><li> Early-game is typically the hardest part of the game. You've got no territory, little income, inexperienced soldiers, no technology and the aliens outnumber you. Later on, you have the option of getting goodies that even the aliens wish they had and soldiers with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">Improbable Aiming Skills</a> who can mow down aliens like Rambo even with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBeatsLaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBeatsLaser">basic ballistic weapons</a> and snipers who can pop the aliens' heads from across the map. Then psi powers enter the game, and the rules change... and again, once you have one or more psi troopers of your own. By the time you get the first Council request for plasma weaponry with a profit of over 1,000 credits, you're set for the rest of the game money-wise and will only have to grind some for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">alloys and Elerium</a> to fuel Firestorm and plasma weaponry production and the later Foundry upgrades. Some veteran <em>XCOM</em> players call this the "snowball effect": at first, your chances of victory seem very low, as low as a snowball's chance in hell, but as you gain momentum from research, development and more advantages, the snowball quickly gets bigger as it rolls until you're overpowering your previously unstoppable enemies.</li><li> Another, shorter term example can be found in missions themselves. Having a squad member (or multiple) panic puts them out of commission for at least one full turn, making it harder to take out the enemies that caused the panic in the first place. Having a squad member downed (either critically wounded, stabilized but not revived, or outright dead) makes the entire mission harder, as every remaining turn will force you to exercise less firepower (and lose limited usage skills and equipment as they're unavailable for other soldiers to pick up and use). If you start with a squad of 4 - 6 and get down to just 1 or 2 soldiers, your chances of success drop so dramatically that you're better off restarting or hightailing it back to the Skyranger to abort. This is especially notable on Terror missions (or any early game mission with Chryssalids, really), as losing a soldier to a Chryssalid's bite (not the poison) will turn it into a durable and strong zombie that can eventually turn into another Chryssalid, potentially causing a downward spiral into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">Total Party Kill</a> if you're not careful. In the late game, just replace Chryssalids and their ability to reproduce with Sectopods and the sheer firepower that they tote and that you need to bring one down.</li><li> Panic causes every mission to potentially be this on higher levels. Panic can be triggered by many things, such as seeing an ally hurt or killed, but also from being shot or blown up or attacked in general. This can easily cause 'panic chains', where one ally panicking triggers a second to panic which triggers a third to panic etc. Panic soldiers can also sometimes shoot allies, and since your soldiers usually are not positioned to cover themselves against their allies and are very close a panic soldier is far more likely to successfully hit an ally then the enemy is. This can do damage or kill other soldiers, which can *also* trigger another panic. The end result is a single unit panic can result in most of your team panicking and then being left vulnerable for the enemy to next turn, allowing the enemy to potentially land hits or kills next turn, which can of course trigger a new chain of panic. If all this wasn't bad enough, high difficulty games tend towards a variant of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketTagGameplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketTagGameplay">Rocket-Tag Gameplay</a> where the priority is to avoid attacks because most can be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a>. This all combines to missions tending towards one of two outcomes: either you move in quick and kill the enemy before it can hit you, clearing the fight without any damage, or the enemy lands a hit on you, often scoring a kill, and the resulting panic and lost firepower means you suffer large casualties or TPK. There is little middle ground. Later on, when you have access to the panic-nullifying Neural Damping and soldiers trained under the enhanced Will gains from the Iron Will upgrade from the Officer Training School, it's harder to lose control to panic unless you're taking several rookies to earn promotions and their colonel nanny gets unfortunately splatted.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanWarfare">Urban Warfare</a>: All alien abductions and Terror missions take place inside major population centers. <em>Enemy Within</em> adds Covert Operations against EXALT and even a few urban UFO crashes to the list.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a>: Unlike the PC version, <em>Enemy Within</em> was released as the <em>Commander Edition</em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PS3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PS3">PS3</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XBox360" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XBox360">Xbox 360</a>, which includes the base game and all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DLC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DLC">DLC</a>.<ul><li> The PC version plays with it.

Early on your need to assign them to your team to have any hope to survive the early game; however, it's possible for your original soldiers to fail to become pyshics, and game mechanics mean newer teammates will often have better Will, used by psychics and to defend against it, then your original soldiers. Thus at some point your likely want to retire your original batch of soldiers for newer pyshic powerhouses. This is when you discover you can't reassign medals from the old ones to the new. You could sacrifice useful medals by leaving them on unused soldiers, or you could remember that medals can be reassigned after death and 'retire' the old medal winner by arranging for an unfortunate accident during a mission.</li><li> Have four Heavies?

Killing a Cyberdisc with a Kinetic Strike Module will send its explosive corpse flying like a flipped coin, allowing it to be used like a grenade against other enemies or even its own Drone allies. Similarly, a MEC can launch a proximity mine near one or more Drones so that they'll instantly get killed the moment they try to move to heal one of their allies.</li><li> Chryssalids are <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

It's effective on every singe situation where this scenario pops up, as 'lids never have more than 8 health on any difficulty and mines deal exactly 8 damage, so it's a guaranteed kill on every single one within the blast radius. It's guilt-free, too: since 'lids don't drop weapon fragments or Meld, you're 100% free to wreck their faces with explosives. Good way to give that low-rank inaccurate MEC Trooper some combat experience, too.</li><li> The Flamethrower is the earliest hard counter to Chryssalids: MECs can pick it as the very first level, a basic one will bring them down to 2 HP, and Jellied Elerium or "Absolutely Critical" enabled equals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">instant death</a> if it touches the buggers.

If they get close to an offense-oriented MEC Colonel, a claw-kick won't do much besides provoke a monstrously combat-capable cyborg with poison immunity and far too much HP for them to one-shot, <em>and</em> trigger a reaction shot from Reactive Targeting Sensors <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoRangeLikePointBlankRange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoRangeLikePointBlankRange">at a range that even the most aim-deficient MEC won't miss</a>.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense">Violation of Common Sense</a>:<ul><li> One wrong click, and you sent a soldier out of cover with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsGonnaSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsGonnaSuck">a Sectopod warming its laser cannon in anticipation</a>, and your remaining two soldiers have no moves that can affect the enemy's hit chance. If the Sectopod is the only enemy, just have them run out of cover as well, standing two tiles apart from each other. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait">When presented with a delicious cluster of enemies stacked too far away to hit with one laser blast</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">the Sectopod will use its first turn to charge Cluster Bomb</a>, ending its turn and giving you a free move to escape.</li><li> Sometimes, if you're very confident in your air defense network, it can be wise to completely ignore an alien UFO contact. If you do that, be sure to purchase some of the Interceptor modules and prepare for the battleship that will come for you. The reason is that a battleship can be quite lucrative if you manage to take one down and secure the remains, and they're quite rare (especially on lower difficulties) unless you let the game drag on for quite a while.</li><li> Have a soldier about to be killed by a wounded Chryssalid? Throw a grenade at them. If the Chryssalid has only three HP it'll be killed no matter what, and even if the damage kills your guy you don't have to worry about him becoming a zombie.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViralUnlockable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViralUnlockable">Viral Unlockable</a>: The achievement "Bubonic" is unlocked by playing an online game with someone else who already had the achievement unlocked.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualPaperDoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualPaperDoll">Virtual Paper Doll</a>: You can customize your soldiers to a great degree, particularly in <em>Enemy Within</em>. Names, nicknames, physical appearance, armor color, voice, language, and hats are just some of the things that can be modified, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">which makes it all the more painful if they get killed</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VomitIndiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VomitIndiscretionShot">Vomit Indiscretion Shot</a>: Zombies will violently heave on their third turn. It's a helpful visual reminder to deal with it before you have to stop worrying about the zombie and more about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestBurster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestBurster">that new Chryssalid</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkieTalkieStatic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkieTalkieStatic">Walkie-Talkie Static</a>: "EXALT Activity!" plays this sound when it's EXALT's turn during a covert op, and they also seem to make this noise to each other when communicating. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnintelligible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnintelligible">It's completely undecipherable</a>. If an XCOM soldier under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a> calls out, they'll make the exact same noise.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss">Wake-Up Call Boss</a>:<ul><li> The Chryssalids, especially on harder difficulties as losing the first Terror mission will squad wipe, automatically cause the targeted country to withdraw, and probably put nearby countries into full panic as well.</li><li> Regular Mutons and Heavy Floaters are not-so-subtle nudges that it's time to upgrade to Laser and Plasma weaponry respectively if you haven't already.</li><li> On Impossible difficulty, Thin Men. They appear before the first month is over, have 6 HP each (double what they have on Easy/Normal) and can do up to 6 damage on a non-critical hit. Given that most of your soldiers won't even <em>have</em> 6 HP at this point, nearly any successful shot from a Thin Man will result in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a>. They also often attack in groups and have very high aim, not to mention also being able to poison you. They are still threats on lower difficulties, but not to the same extent.</li><li> The first EXALT covert mission in <em>Enemy Within</em> can be a jolt to players used to fighting only aliens, particularly if an EXALT heavy manages to kill two or three of your troopers will a well-placed rocket on the second turn.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallOfWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallOfWeapons">Wall of Weapons</a>: Between the Barracks and the Control Room is the Armory, which naturally sports one of these. It only displays ballistic weaponry, however.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarMemorial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarMemorial">War Memorial</a>: In the Barracks you can go to a memorial to fallen soldiers, which will list all of the units that have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath">fallen in gameplay</a> (including the three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust">killed off in the tutorial mission</a>). Strangely, any base security personnel killed during the Base Defense mission are not listed on the wall. Apparently, they're not important enough, despite being willing to defend their base from heavily-armed aliens with the most basic body armor and weapons.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a>:<ul><li> The Sectopod has <em>two</em>: a fusion lance for burning your dudes to a fine, <em>fine</em> ash, and a plasma beam for the reaction shots.</li><li> The Battleship UFO has one, which can be researched for your Firestorms if you salvage an intact Fusion Core. They're also used for Blaster Launchers.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAllLiveInAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAllLiveInAmerica">We All Live in America</a>: No matter which country you deploy in, the buildings and cars (especially the yellow cabs) will often look like American cities or towns, not to mention the complete lack of accents for your soldiers prior to <em>Enemy Within</em>. And while EW does offer a new language customization options, all troops start out with English as their default language, and the language of many nations, such as Japan and Egypt, are not available. Occasionally, you'll also find maps which are inexplicably European or Chinese urban areas. Since each map is hand-crafted, however, this is understandable.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAREStrugglingTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAREStrugglingTogether">We ARE Struggling Together</a>:<ul><li> Averted for the most part. The Council is made up of most of the G20 countries and a few others that give you money and support to keep everyone alive. That said, countries will bail if they feel they would be better off on their own.</li><li> Several news blurbs mention how many rival political and intellectual groups are blaming the alien attacks on each other.</li><li> This is why Zhang defects to XCOM during the special Council missions included in <em>Slingshot</em>. He realized that the Triads squabbling for money and power is kinda pointless when the Aliens are attacking everyone.</li><li> Finally played straight with <em>Enemy Within</em>. EXALT is another human faction that seeks to use the alien's "gifts" to empower themselves and directly opposes XCOM.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeBuyAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeBuyAnything">We Buy Anything</a>: The good ol' Gray Market is the secret auction house for XCOM's funding nations. If you don't think you're going to be using that pile of already autopsied corpses and wrecks you don't use in crafting items or Foundry projects<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16ol9q');"><sup>list&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note16ol9q" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16ol9q');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Sectoid Commander and Muton Elite corpses and Mechtoid cores</span> you may as well sell them for money<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note53tcia');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note53tcia" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note53tcia');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">try to keep around 8 on stock whenever possible, though, as sometimes the Council requests a bountiful of bodies for a very nice price</span>. In the early game, this will probably be your primary means of income.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim">We Can Rebuild Him</a>: <em>Enemy Within</em> offers some... possibilities, here. Got a really badly wounded soldier who won't be back in action for a month or more? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyTransformation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyTransformation">Turn them into a MEC</a>! Sure they're stuck as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManInTheMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManInTheMachine">Man in the Machine</a>, but they'll recover in half the time (or less!) and they have shiny new robot limbs!<ul><li> Unfortunately, you can't rebuild a MEC Trooper (or any soldier for that matter) that was KIA. You <em>can</em> repair the MEC and place a new MEC trooper inside, though.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">We Have Reserves</a>: The aliens certainly seem to work off this mentality, as does EXALT in <em>Enemy Within</em>. Losing several high-ranking troopers midway through the game can make you do it as well. Throwing dozens of rookies into the meat-grinder can yield a handful of solid squadmembers via Darwin.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdMoon">Weird Moon</a>: Each return trip from a mission shows your Skyranger flying toward a full moon on a clear night, no matter what the date or Mission Control time actually is. To top it off, it's an unskippable in-engine animation so you <em>will</em> be seeing it quite often.<ul><li> Additionally, most maps take place either at night or at day. Most maps don't switch between the two time periods, so it is very likely that your soldiers will arrive to the mission at noon only for it to be as dark as midnight. Also inverted by the times you deploy on a map where the sun shines bright even if it's 3 AM.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WelcomeToCorneria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WelcomeToCorneria">Welcome to Corneria</a>: The original game had this problem with Bradford's limited, often-repeating mission briefings, but <em>Enemy Within</em> rectified it somewhat by adding more descriptions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a>:<ul><li> One of the Large Scout ship maps has an empty, still-running truck belonging to someone who came to investigate and left a trail of flares leading to the ship. This isn't commented on, and nowhere in the map is this person's body, living or otherwise.</li><li> Most of the Escort mission VIPs as well. Anna Sing, in particular, should be able to provide information on the Alien's abduction methodology, but nothing further is heard from her.</li><li> You never find out what happens to the gassed people that you saved by completing an abduction mission. Same for the people trapped in the alien stasis tanks and surgery tables.</li><li> Considering all the peculiarities of the Outsiders (they're beings of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PureEnergy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PureEnergy">Pure Energy</a> with a biology completely unlike any other alien, likely have a different origin, and are crucial to entering the alien base), you would expect them to have an important role in the game's plot, but after the skeleton key has been built, it is never seen or mentioned again.</li><li> The EXALT supreme leader doesn't even show up in the game, has no model, and isn't there when you blow up his base. Neither the sequel nor The Bureau provides any clues.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellPlayer">What the Hell, Player?</a> Dr. Vahlen gets pretty pissed off if you repeatedly capture aliens without an Alien Containment Facility to house them in. She also gets annoyed if you keep killing Outsiders instead of stunning them, regardless of whether you've already successfully captured one.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveResearchedBreathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveResearchedBreathing">You Have Researched Breathing</a>: Your supposedly elite soldiers need promotions just to acquire basic abilities that any real life soldier fresh out of basic training has, such as the ability to carry multiple grenades or use a first aid kit more than once in a mission. The use of suppressing fire to prevent an enemy from maneuvering or returning fire is one of the fundamentals of infantry tactics, but only two classes of XCOM soldiers are capable of doing this, and those classes must gain multiple promotions first.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouLoseAtZeroTrust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouLoseAtZeroTrust">You Lose at Zero Trust</a>: Nations have a Panic Meter that goes from 1 to 5. When it hits 5, they are in grave danger of pulling their funding from the XCOM project by the end of the month (if you fail a Terror mission in their country or incorrectly accuse them of harboring EXALT HQ in <em>Enemy Within</em>, they pull funding immediately, even if they have less than 5 panic), as they decide to redirect their funding to keep their own people under control. You lose the game when you lose eight nations total (half of the founding nations, in other words), regardless of the panic levels in the other nations, as the Council of Nations decides that the project is a failure. This will happen a whole lot more often on harder difficulties.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouRequireMoreVespeneGas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouRequireMoreVespeneGas">You Require More Vespene Gas</a>: You've got four basic resource types in this game:<ul><li> Money, the Gold equivalent. It's used for pretty much everything. You get awarded by the Council on a monthly basis based on which nations have satellite coverage, as well as for some Abduction missions, Council missions and requests. You can also sell scavenged alien materials on the Grey Market if you're strapped for cash.</li><li> Alien Alloys, Weapon Fragments, Elerium and various specialty items like UFO computers, power sources, and occasionally dead bodies, the Lumber equivalents. These are all used for the research and manufacture of advanced tech, but you can only get them by scavenging after missions. <em>Enemy Within</em> adds "Meld", which can be collected during missions and is used for Genetic Mods and MEC Troopers. Meld is collected from canisters that degrade over time, so they need to be collected quickly lest they expire. Killing Mechtoids and Heavy Floaters also provides a small amount of Meld.</li><li> Power is actually the Population equivalent, despite its name. All the facilities in your base need power to run, which is provided by constructable Generators. You can't build a facility if it requires more power than is available, but there is no other penalty to having insufficient Power, making it more of a cap on how many facilities you can have at the same time. Power demand also cannot exceed its supply under normal circumstances<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note549r9r');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note549r9r" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note549r9r');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The only way to do so is to play on Easy, which grants bonus Power, then switch to a harder difficulty mid-game</span> and existing facilities continue working at full efficiency even if you manage to do so.</li><li> Engineers and Scientists are a different kind of Population from Power, and serve as another hard cap. This is especially true with Engineers, as each project and facility have a certain minimum number of Engineers on staff requirement to construct and operate them. Some facilities, like the Generators mentioned above, have a scaling requirement where each facility built requires a higher minimum number of Engineers than the one before it. New Engineers and Scientists are provided monthly from member nations, with some giving more than others, and can also be granted as rewards for certain requests and missions.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a>: Surprisingly, not usually used by the aliens, but by the human EXALT. Their fanaticism and superior numbers means that when they want an objective, many members will dash out into the open to get there faster, knowing that you can't kill them <em>all</em> before they start flanking your guys.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a>:<ul><li> Chryssalids can easily cause one if left unchecked during Terror missions, due to those 18 tasty civilians running around.</li><li> "<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Site Recon</span>" in <em>Enemy Within</em> takes place in the aftermath of one. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> A fishing village has been completely overtaken by zombies (and the Chryssalids that made them).
