It is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox">sandbox-style</a> game, set in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalEuropeanFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalEuropeanFantasy">medieval-ish land</a> of Calradia, where you begin with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithThisHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithThisHerring">a lame horse, a rusty sword, a bent crossbow, and some tattered rags</a>, and are then expected to impress a king of your choice and conquer the world for him (or whatever else you feel like, really). You can hire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiredGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiredGuns">mercenaries</a>, train them, trade between cities, fight bandits, and even become a vassal to a lord and be granted a village, castle, or town.</p><p>The game has both third person and first person view, the former better for melee and the latter better for ranged weapons. The combat uses a physics engine that determines the speed of a swing, relative to the target, and gives a percentage bonus (or penalty) to the damage of the attack based on its relative speed. Missiles like arrows all travel in arcs and bows are less accurate the longer the shot is drawn, accounting for fatigue.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The game (and Taleworlds) started as an indie project by two people, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCouple">a married couple</a>. Before its 2007 release, the game spent three years in public beta testing, inspiring a highly active <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">modding</a> community that continues to this day. Some modders went on to join the official developers.</p><p>An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> called <em>Mount &amp; Blade: Warband</em> came out in April 2010, featuring a significantly improved combat model, a revamped single-player campaign with more in-depth political system, new items and locations, and probably the most called-for feature, multiplayer.</p><p>Released in late 2009 in Eastern Europe and May 2011 in North America and the rest of Europe was <em>Mount &amp; Blade: With Fire and Sword</em>, effectively a mod for <em>Warband</em> developed by the Ukrainian group SiCh Studio and Russian Snowberry Connection (former Snowberry Connection). It adds early guns, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SienkiewiczTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SienkiewiczTrilogy">historical (fiction) setting</a>, improves town-management and gives more options than just "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic">put a single ladder with room for 1 guy up the wall</a>" in sieges as well as a storyline to follow.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>In April 2012, an updated version (multiplayer-only) of the popular mod <em>Mount &amp; Musket</em> was released as official DLC for <em>Warband</em>, titled <em>Mount &amp; Blade: Napoleonic Wars</em>, which takes place, of course, during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars">The Napoleonic Wars</a>.</p><p>Another official historical-themed DLC (this time with a solo campaign), <em>Mount &amp; Blade: Viking Conquest</em>, was released in December 2014; it is set in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLowMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLowMiddleAges">The Low Middle Ages</a> British Islands and has been developed by the creators of the famous mod <em><a class="urllink" href="http://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php/board,189.0.html">Brytenwalda<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>.</p><p>The <em>Warband</em> engine has also been licensed out twice for games published outside Taleworlds, resulting in the pirate-themed <em>Blood &amp; Gold: Caribbean</em> (from the makers of <em>With Fire and Sword</em>) and the China-themed <em>Gloria Sinica: Han Xiongnu Wars</em>, both released through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam">Steam</a>.</p><p>A proper sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MountAndBladeIIBannerlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MountAndBladeIIBannerlord">Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord</a></em>, serves as a prequel to <em>Mount &amp; Blade: Warband</em> with an engine overhaul and gameplay improvements. After a very long development cycle, the game was released into Early Access on March 30th 2020, following a multiplayer beta in the latter part of 2019.</p><p>In addition to its modding community and the mods own pages, <em>Mount &amp; Blade</em> also inspired <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/ThisNotchedAndRustedBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/ThisNotchedAndRustedBlade">This Notched And Rusted Blade</a></em>, a machinima made with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnnoDomini1257" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnnoDomini1257">Anno Domini 1257</a></em> mod.</p><p>Tropes appearing in mods which don't have their own pages now go at the bottom of the page.</p><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><hr><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Present in <em>Mount and Blade</em> / General Series Tropes&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyFourHourArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyFourHourArmor">24-Hour Armor</a>: No matter how high its encumbrance is.<ul><li> Averted with NPC lords, who switch to civvies when resting in a castle or town.</li><li> The player character will also take off his helm and weapons while visiting.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality">Acceptable Breaks from Reality</a>: It might not be very historically correct to have Vikings fighting Mongolian horse archers, but boy is it fun.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>: Lady Isolla of Suno, Arwa the Pearled One, and a few of the companions (Ymira, Klethi, Deshavi, Katrin, Matheld). And the player, if they so choose.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyFourMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyFourMooks">Actually Four Mooks</a>: The game does this on the world map, but the actual number of troops + prisoners is displayed alongside the sprite, and as you get closer, you can see the number and type of troops in each party. The exact same system is applied to each of the parties in game, including the player's one.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamSmithHatesYourGuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamSmithHatesYourGuts">Adam Smith Hates Your Guts</a>:<ul><li> Items you buy are generally really expensive, especially high end armor. But if you sell said gear back to the merchants later, they'll only offer you a tiny fraction of the cost. The trading skill mitigates this, but either way unless you obtained said loot from fighting, don't expect to get back what you paid for it.</li><li> The above applies mostly to arms, armor, and horses, however. Trade commodities can be profitably traded between cities, assuming you know the best locations to buy and sell a given good.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureFriendlyWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureFriendlyWorld">Adventure-Friendly World</a>: The constant wars between the various kingdoms create opportunities for wandering adventurers to make a name for themselves, and the bandits that pop up in the absence of any effective police force (because most of the kingdoms' resources are going into fighting the wars) ensures there are plenty of targets for guilt-free looting and level-grinding.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedSteed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedSteed">The Alleged Steed</a>: The one you start with, usually. The description given lists it as "<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lordosis#In_animals">swaybacked<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>," implying old age, overuse, or injury in its past life (or any combination of the three).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllSeeingAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllSeeingAI">The All-Seeing A.I.</a>:<ul><li> Computer-controlled ranged troops see perfectly through fog, shooting at you long before you get close enough to see them. Fortunately the same applies to your hirelings.</li><li> Lost track of where the enemies are in battle? Just follow the AI! They know exactly where those last remaining horse archers are. They also know exactly when the final enemy is slain, even if it took place a distance away.<ul><li> Or you can just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneSolution">open the minimap</a> and see where everyone is.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade">Amazon Brigade</a>: While it's pointless to use one in late game, it's possible to assemble one early on. All your female PC needs is to do solo runs against outlaw warbands (hey, nobody said it would be easy!), until she liberates and recruits some peasant women. Then, with her following, she can liberate more women (and perhaps hire a female NPC or two). Sure, at first the troop are little more than pretty cannon fodder, but survivors will eventually grow into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Sword Sisters</a>, and that's about as Amazon-esque as women in this game can get. As a bonus, Sword Sisters are among the strongest non-mounted units in the game, and have the fastest upgrade progression.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries">Amusing Injuries</a>:<ul><li> Can occur when your character or your horse is impaled with a lot of arrows and thrown weapons. Nothing like riding a horse that has five thrown spears sticking out of it, while your character becomes a human pincushion with multiple arrows sticking out.</li><li> Better still, if your horse's injury is a single arrow between the eyes, you get a unicorn.</li><li> Take out a mounted enemy while he's charging full steam. Watch the rider end up rolled over by his mount's corpse.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">Anachronism Stew</a>:<ul><li> As far as all the medieval weapons and armour go, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">they are portrayed very accurately, including their proper names</a>. The only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality">exception to this rule</a> would be that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponsKitchenSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponsKitchenSink">they come from</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAgeEurope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAgeEurope">slightly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLowMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLowMiddleAges">different</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighMiddleAges">time</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLateMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLateMiddleAges">periods</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMiddleAges">The Middle Ages</a>).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAxeToGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAxeToGrind">An Axe to Grind</a>: Axes have a bonus against shields and throwing axes are one of the signature weapons of Nord Huscarls.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnEntrepreneurIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnEntrepreneurIsYou">An Entrepreneur Is You</a>: Trading goods is one way to make money, and <em>Warband</em> allows investing in personal enterprises.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotifs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotifs">Animal Motifs</a>: Each kingdom has a particular beast sign in their menu. Swadians have the lion, Rhodoks the bear, Vaegirs a snow leopard, Khergits a wolf, Nords a raven and the Sarranids have a falcon.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingArrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingArrows">Annoying Arrows</a>:<ul><li> Played straight except for headshots, usually. Though there's still sometimes the amusing sight of one of the tougher units charging on with an arrow sticking out of his eye. Hey, at least the flinching animation can interrupt the attack animation of an incoming cavalier and save your life.</li><li> Rarer when full damage is enabled; two arrows are usually lethal unless their target is wearing plate armor.</li><li> Still played straight for the player, in that they'll never actually <em>kill</em> you (outside of <em>With Fire and Sword</em>, anyway). Then again, neither does anything else.</li><li> Horses can take quite an amount of punishment, sometimes needing 3 arrows to the head before dropping.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">Anyone Can Die</a>: Generally completely inverted prior to <em>Bannerlord</em>; apart from scripted story events, no named character (including you) can ever die. Lords might go into exile outside the game world, Kings just vanish once their realms are conquered, and your companions might vanish for a bit, but so long as you have a name, death was not something you feared.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToForce">Appeal to Force</a>: King Graveth won the Rhodok election by coming in armed and announcing that there was a Swadian raiding party that was coming to kill the electoral council, and that he'd only defend them if they elected him immediately. Graveth lauds this; he despises the patricians of the towns and considers their democracy a sham.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryHeadcountLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryHeadcountLimit">Arbitrary Headcount Limit</a>:<ul><li> Averted, the limit is based on skills and renown. It's still strangely specific, but at least it's based on something.</li><li> That said however, there are mods out there that lets you adjust how many troops are present on the battlefield. So if you have 150 men, and you want all of them out there, you can modify the number so that all of them can be on the field at once. However, this trope also comes into play, because increasing it too much will slow your computer down during these fights, hence why they attempted to limit the number of troops at any given time, and as troops were killed and taken off the field, more could be presented in the form of reinforcements.

Smarter then you think...until they realize your cavalry forces suddenly show up en masse behind them because they were too distracted by you.<ul><li> Note that they <em>still</em> do this even if you have a tower shield pasted to your back, falling back into stupidity.</li></ul></li><li> Played straight if you auto-resolve a battle. Unless you outnumber the enemy group vastly, you're going to suffer quite a few casualties on your side, including supposedly "elite" troops. You're almost always better off just jumping into the battle, and if you don't really feel like fighting, just hang back and watch your guys slaughter the enemy forces, especially if they're mostly low level units.</li><li> Also played straight if you use the cheat to let the computer takeover your character.

Occasionally this will force the enemy to attack you in an attempt to save their village.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking">Authority Equals Asskicking</a>:<ul><li> A common occurrence with the faction lords, who after all lead armies as part of their job description. Specific levels of asskickery vary between individuals, but most can outfight their own elite troops. If you see someone with distinctive armor riding around the battlefield scything down your troops <em>with an actual scythe</em>, it's probably a lord.</li><li> Of course, them being so distinct (and you not actually being bound by any rules of chivalry until after the battle, what with being a player character out to win,) this lets the player home in on them quite easily; especially if the Lord has already suffered several defeats in a row and is leading an army of recruits. It's not hard to single out the one guy in full heraldic platemail <em>on a horse</em> amongst an army of barely-trained militiamen on foot with spears! (Cue the player's bag of bodkin arrows.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutomatonHorses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutomatonHorses">Automaton Horses</a>:<ul><li> Horses are basically treated like any other equippable item, never tire, never panic, and are perfectly willing to run headlong into obstacles like walls or trees at full speed unless steered clear by the player. They can be injured in battle, though, and have a chance of becoming lame or dying when they run out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a>. They also have their own AI while not being ridden and will bolt off if hit.</li><li> As of <em>Warband</em>, warriors with long spears or pikes (you can tell which will serve this function&mdash;they can't be used on horseback, and compare the image of that to that of the soldier type in question; also some mods call such arms a "pike" or such troops a "pikeman") can and will cause your horse (or an AI horse for that matter) to rear back and stop on a dime, if they are pointing it at you and/or stabbing it forwards, or at the very least, you're riding head-on at said person(s). One can only imagine how well this barely-noticed change in mechanics could serve in multiplayer....<ul><li> Any spear-like weapon has that effect in <em>Warband</em>, not just pikes...the pikes are just REALLY long, so it gives more room to work with. Also any spear or lance can be foot-couched by pressing X while unmounted. This causes tremendously magnified damage to any unit who runs into the tip while couched...not quite as OP as a mounted Couched lance, but way more then you'll likely do otherwise (greatly increases the speed-based damage bonus), and can even take out a charger in 1 hit, if they're coming at full speed.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy">Badass Army</a>: Any force composed of top-level units. They will make <em>hay</em> out of a lord's army. You can even wipe out several hundred men with your tiny force of 50-90 elite units, especially if they're mounted or waiting for the enemy atop a nice, tall wall.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingEvilSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingEvilSucks">Being Evil Sucks</a>:<ul><li> Downplayed, it's easy and profitable to do "dishonorable" missions, such as assassinations, kidnappings, and starting wars, with little consequences aside from ticking off the victims. However, dishonorable acts such as pillaging villages or kicking around the local peasantry will draw the ire of the local Lord, who can usually (at least early-on in the game) kick your tail pretty soundly.</li><li> In <em>Warband</em>, you also have to take into account the opinion of your companions; many come from the peasantry and aren't too fond of watching their kind get murdered and looted, especially as they are supposed to take part in the pillaging.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingGoodSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingGoodSucks">Being Good Sucks</a>:<ul><li> The benefits of having a high honor are dubious at best. You have to turn down often needed rewards for quests, release valuable prisoners, skip lucrative quests, refrain from beating down on the peasantry, and make enemies of the "dishonorable" nobles across the realm. All to make friends with some "honorable" ones. And prior to <em>Warband</em>, it didn't even properly do that.</li><li> Honor does have one benefit, namely becoming marshal. If your honor is high enough, a lot of lords will like you enough to vote for you to become marshal without you having had to bother doing a million quests for them, saving you time that can be used to make the money you're missing out on from dishonorable acts by battling, which also trains your men and keeps morale high. The dishonorable lords never go below -3 relation with you no matter how high your honor is either, you need to do other things to make anyone hate you more than that.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">BFS</a>: Obviously, the two-handed swords, but a few weapons used to be <em>way</em> oversized.<ul><li> Straddling the line between this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeOnAStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeOnAStick">Blade on a Stick</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterScythe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterScythe">Shortened Military Scythe</a> is a scytheblade facing upwards.</li><li> The Sword of War is the longest non-polearm in the game, needless to say, it's a very big sword.</li><li> The War Cleaver, which is rather shapeless, beyond the notch on top, while not heavier than most other two-handed swords, it's weight is distributed to make it hit harder than say, a generic greatsword.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a>: Can be done anytime you help a friendly force when you see them fighting the enemy on the field map.

Unfortunately, this made them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">crazy dangerous</a> even to lords and kings, which threw off world balance rather fast.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeOnAStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeOnAStick">Blade on a Stick</a>: Spears are best used only against cavalry, and most other polearms are best used only by cavalry.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">Boom, Headshot!</a>: Doable with every ranged weapon in the game for double damage.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a>:<ul><li> Hunting down bandits and deserters for loot may be more fun, but if you're looking to turn a consistent profit or support a larger force, commodities trading and enterprises are much more reliable sources of income.<ul><li> That said, the "trash mobs" are a better source of exp for your units rather than using the training field. Sure, they could get killed, but you get much better exp killing bandits and you can get loot as well, and prisoners if you knock enough of them out. And the units that survive repeated fights can get promoted to better units faster.</li></ul></li><li> Mounted players using a polearm may get into the habit of using the "couched lance" charge attack as much as possible. However, you're usually better off just doing a drive-by stabbing, as a regular attack can sometimes do enough damage to kill enemy units, especially low level or weakly armored ones. And simply attacking with it can be faster than waiting for the couched lance cooldown.</li><li> The Crossbow. It can't really be made into a viable primary weapon on par with regular bows, requires two slots unlike the throwing weapons, and can't even be used on a mount. So what's the upside? It requires basically nothing to get working. You just need the strength to pull it back, and that's about it, allowing you to put your stats and skills into more important things, such as increasing army size and morale or boosting your profits with trading and bartering.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornInTheSaddle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornInTheSaddle">Born in the Saddle</a>: The Khergits were originally steppe nomads before settling down in the lands they currently occupy, and their armies still have a heavy emphasis on cavalry.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BowAndSwordInAccord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BowAndSwordInAccord">Bow and Sword, in Accord</a>: Commonly used by NPCs and the default setup of the player. Useful as there will be situations where getting into melee or standing off at range is inadvisable or even suicidal. NPC archers and crossbowmen always carry melee weapons and sometimes shields, and the highest level ranged attackers can be used as middling infantry in a pinch.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxedCrook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxedCrook">Boxed Crook</a>:<ul><li> You can recruit captured looters, bandits, and their ilk into your warband. Since they tend to be lower-tier troops and take quite a bit of extra effort to level up compared to recruits and mercenaries, they're often useful for little more than cheap cannon fodder to preserve the rest of your army.</li><li> Also, while the basic units (Looters, etc) are extremely cheap (1 gold per unit per week), their advanced levels (Mountain Bandit, Forest Bandit, etc) are extremely expensive (up to 35 gold per unit per week), and separated by a mere one level of advancement, making them impractical to level and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverratedAndUnderleveled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverratedAndUnderleveled">Overrated and Underleveled</a> if you bother with it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap">Cap</a>:<ul><li> No attack can ever do more than 500 damage. Considering that 80 hit points is an exceptionally high amount for a human character and 175 is the most a horse can have in an unmodified game, and that doing so much damage is nearly impossible without an extremely fast horse and delivering a couched lance charge to a lightly armored target, it isn't really a hindrance.</li><li> Attributes cannot be leveled past 63, though character profile editing can set them higher and the values will be accepted.</li><li> Character level is functionally capped by an experience overflow that happens when attempting to level up past level 62.</li><li> The total number of troops has an adjustable cap, though even the highest unmoddified value of the cap, 150, is still small enough that two lords may well be unable to commit all their forces at once. When the battle starts, the game splits this cap between the two sides based on the difference in the overall sizes of their armies, which is then modified by the highest tactics skill on each side. As troops are killed, reinforcements arrive in periodic waves.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes">Cast of Snowflakes</a>: The face generator allows an impressive array of variations, and the game makes good use of it.

The war goes on until you either decide to stop supporting them, or you takeover all of the rival's castles and towns. And should the claimant win, they become the new faction leader.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ACommanderIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ACommanderIsYou">A Commander Is You</a>: Pick (and mix, if you have the patience) units from a choice of different factions:<ul><li> Swadians: Generalist, elitists. Most powerful Heavy Cavalry with an overall balanced force.</li><li> Rhodoks: Technical, elitists. Most powerful defensive force in the game bar none, but requires carefully organized formations of their Sergeants and Sharpshooters to excel, which is why the computer controlled Rhodoks tend to get rolled easily when not defending castles. Sergeants counter heavy cavalry (spears) and keep arrows and melee (huge shields and heavy armor) away from the Sharpshooters, who kill everything else easily when given space to shoot. Slower than a pack of Huscarls or Swadian Knights at winning, but basically unstoppable with no real weaknesses if used properly.</li><li> Nords: Brute force, elitists, Huscarl specialists. Strongest offensive infantry in the game, with Huscarls being excellent at assaulting defensive lines or fortifications. Nord ranged units tend to be short-ranged (due to using throwing axes or javelins) or just adequate for providing covering fire. The Nords have no cavalry to speak of, relying instead on smashing their way through shields and defensive lines with their axes.</li><li> Khergits: Rangers, horse archer specialist. Heavy cavalry focus, with both melee and ranged variants available.</li><li> Vaegirs: Rangers, technical. Their top-tier infantry and cavalry are shock units and lose in prolonged melee, meant to win using lightning assaults and flanking maneuvers. They possess the best bowmen in the game, only outdone by their Rhodok counterparts in terms of damage.</li><li> Sarranids (<em>Warband</em>): Technical; the faction requires a fundamentally different mindset from the others. They tend to have light armor on their melee units, and less range on their ranged units, but as a whole, they hit much harder and tend to move somewhat faster than other factions. That being said, they tend to eschew horses (with the exception of high level units), so cavalry is a uncommon. They are extremely powerful if used carefully, but easily overwhelmed if not.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommissarCap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommissarCap">Commissar Cap</a>: Various Russian and Prussian units wear this in the <em>Napoleonic Wars</em> DLC.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">The Computer Is a Cheating Bastard</a>: Other lords do not lose anything after being captured, avoid being captured 70% of the time, and are all equipped with some of highest level equipment (even the the most minor lords are armed to the teeth). They also recover their armies rather quickly even if you wiped it out just moments earlier. Granted, they're not always high level units, but they also don't have to walk around to various villages to recruit.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConstructedWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConstructedWorld">Constructed World</a>: Calradia is a continent of a world that is clearly not our own, and while much of its history is quite vague, it was once united by an empire similar to the Roman Empire and the continent broadly resembles medieval Europe, plus the Near East and the steppes of Central Asia (albeit a couple centuries of their medieval histories all at once).

Well, you can try not reloading a save, but you will have likely lost valuable and rare equipment, a sizable chunk of money, and all of your soldiers and companions. And your companions could be waiting for you in any tavern somewhere in Calradia, causing you to do a grand tour of the country just to get them back.<ul><li> Gets nastier if it happens to be bandits who captured you in an isolated area. That's a long walk back with likely even more of the bastards spawning to rob you of your dignity. And then we get the mounted Steppe Bandits in and near the Khanate, who make the above look like a walk in the park.</li></ul></li><li> Doubles as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">The Computer Is a Cheating Bastard</a>, as while other lords spend a sizeable amount of time in captivity as well, immediately upon becoming free they regain their entire army and do not have any disadvantages.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolVersusAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolVersusAwesome">Cool vs. Awesome</a>: You want Viking Huscarls throwing down with Egyptian Mamlukes?

Finally, they tend to be pretty slow on the overmap, so, combined with the above, lets you get some early levels and money by soloing these guys and selling what little they have in nearby towns.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrailInTheGarbage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrailInTheGarbage">Grail in the Garbage</a>: Due to the randomness of items, sometimes you can find a really good lower tiered weapon or piece of armor for sale on merchants that has really good stats on it and isn't too expensive.

The drawback is that they take a very long time to load, even with simple pistol weapons, and if you're on foot, that's a <em>very bad thing</em> (on a horse, you can at least continue to dodge effectively).</li><li> On the other hand, especially early on, said guns can also be rather inaccurate; it's possible to miss a bandit at <em>point blank range.</em> But even as you gain firearms experience and better weapons down the line, there's still the chance that not every bullet would reach its mark, making every shot count.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardCodedHostility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardCodedHostility">Hard-Coded Hostility</a>: The game has major factions which can be joined by the player and a faction of several kinds of bandits and deserters, who are always hostile to the player and the major factions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardHead">Hard Head</a>: NPCs and redshirts saved by the surgery skill are knocked unconscious and make a full recovery within a few hours (days at most) with no lasting effects, even if they got a spear to the gut or an arrow through the eye.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelmetsAreHardlyHeroic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelmetsAreHardlyHeroic">Helmets Are Hardly Heroic</a>: Sword Sisters have what seems to be a 50/50 chance of going into battle without a helmet (the better off to show their flowing hair, presumably). Along with various recruited bandits and Khergit Lancers, they are the only unit type to do so.

It also doesn't help Graveth that he approached the defenseless council armed, told them of the war party, and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blackmail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blackmail">told them he wouldn't save them unless they made him king immediately.</a> At least, according to Kastor...</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings">Horny Vikings</a>: Nords are an aversion, being settled-down and more similar to Danish-like Vikings or proto-Normans.

When all of a faction's fiefs have been conquered, said faction will be deemed extinct. When this happens, ALL the lords of that faction, excluding the king, will just join a different faction. Considering that for 85% of the game your Right-to-Rule (a hidden stat that dictates how likely you are to recruit lords to your cause) will be well below that of the remaining monarchs, this eventually leads to battles against +15 lords at the same time once enough factions have been defeated.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal">Hyperspace Arsenal</a>: Attempted aversion, as you can only ever carry at most four weapons on your person.

Either they'll be defeated by an enemy force piecemeal when there's no marshal, or they just lose interest and don't bother taking more than one fort or city at a time. In contrast, they will always try their hardest to regain recently lost territory.

Enemy lords, once free, can simply raise a new army and resume whatever they were doing earlier, be it plundering trade routes or razing villages, and it would benefit <em>everyone</em> on your side if they were simply taken out of the picture &mdash; especially if they have several fiefs and are capable of fielding armies over a hundred strong.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JoustingLance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JoustingLance">Jousting Lance</a>: Naturally present as a weapon choice in tournaments, though of limited use in actual combat.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut">The Juggernaut</a>: Full-plated knights on Charger horses can quickly turn into these if you don't have pikes.

It basically means that it is indeed possible to gain money by buying supplies in a city to sell them elsewhere; there's actually a feature in the market's menu allowing to estimate which goods can be more profitable to bought here.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Karma Houdini</a>: Roughly every rival lord battling with you.

They do, however, give increased relations, and letting the villagers keep the reward, increases the relations even more. This is essential to keeping a large and well trained army, as higher relation villages give 5x as many troops, often times two or three ranks higher (which is just about the gap between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy">Redshirt Army</a> and just strong enough to not get killed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeystoneArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeystoneArmy">Keystone Army</a>:<ul><li> Averted with enemy lords.

And then they dismantle the tower, so you have to build a new one.</li><li> <em>Warband</em> and <em>With Fire and Sword</em> avert this. Getting KO'd in any battle, even single phase battles, causes it to auto-resolve based on the remaining troops on both sides. You only get captured if your army is completely defeated. You might still lose due to the auto-resolve being a $%#^, but it at least can be construed as your troops being demoralized and fighting worse then normal and it at least eliminates the chance that a single defender will hold a castle against an entire army just because the leader was KO'd.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeakedExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeakedExperience">Leaked Experience</a>: Normal exp is granted for killing things yourself, and then battle exp is granted for being on the winning side.

They have high amounts of hp and defense, and while on a horse are much faster than foot soldiers. And the ones equipped with a lance can often 1-shot almost any unit, including your own character if they're on the receiving end of one.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a>: Your companions and the various lords and ladies of the five factions.<ul><li> In numbers: 16 companions, 5 kings, 5 claimants to their thrones (with the only female AI fighter that is not a companion or Sword Sister), 20 lords in each of the five factions (make it 100) and a few ladies (who only stay in their castles and give missions but won't fight; about one for every three lords). All of them are named and have a few traits. <em>Warband</em> added another faction with another claimant and ruler, and added about 10 unmarried women to each faction for Male players to romance.</li><li> Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in <em>Bannerlord</em>, which will have a cast that rotates as generations pass (peacefully or otherwise) and heirs take up their forefather's positions.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowFantasy">Low Fantasy</a>: A borderline example; it's debatable if the game qualifies as <em>any</em> kind of fantasy.

It is possible for the player to be doomed to a loss at the beginning if he is assigned equipment he is not proficient with, or worse, a bow. (Though waiting until someone goes down or, if you're good enough, shooting them down first, before nicking their melee weapon can create an effective bow/melee combo.) <em>Warband</em> helped this a little bit, by allowing players to wield Throwing weapons in the melee and giving archers in the Arenas a tiny dagger.</li><li> And it <em>really</em> helps to be lucky enough that the AI doesn't decide to gang up on you. Which it will. Even if all five spawns have to charge across <em>the entire damn field</em> to do it.</li><li> At the beginning of the game, where you start is randomised, so you may have the misfortune of spawning right next to a party of mounted bandits.</li><li> Any quest that requires you to go outside a town and search for someone (bandits, thieves, particular enemy units to be taken prisoner), since you aren't guaranteed to actually find them. While they are somewhere on the map, asking NPC's for help usually won't get you much initially, since said bandits also move around on the map and will run from your big army once you find them.</li><li> And heaven help you if you get the 'Enemy Spies' mission at low levels. The spies are not only faster than you, they're a single person(making them nearly impossible to track), they can easily travel all the way across Calradia, and they get a three hour head start. Given that the player is usually outfitted for battle, not high speed pursuit, there's a significant chance you'll never see them again.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckilyMyShieldWillProtectMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckilyMyShieldWillProtectMe">Luckily, My Shield Will Protect Me</a>: With skill, shields are capable of emitting arrow-stopping force fields.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPants">Magic Pants</a> : All undressed characters.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">Magikarp Power</a>:<ul><li> Ymira may seem completely useless, being level 1 and having nothing but a kitchen knife to defend herself.

While the Rhodoks have very powerful tier-5 crossbowmen and infantry, giving them a very good defensive mindset, the Nords eschew tier-5 marksmen in favor of the tier-6 Nord Huscarl, which is arguably the best heavy infantry in the game, as well as the only tier-6 unit available.</li><li> Conversely, the Rhodok troop tree is a direct copy of the Swadian infantry tree, just with no cavalry support and with Rhodok infantry being generally better equipped (particularly Sharpshooters).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiMeleeMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiMeleeMaster">Multi-Melee Master</a>: Each weapon proficiency category covers several different types of weapons.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast">Multiple-Choice Past</a>: How you choose your stats.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutuallyExclusivePartyMembers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutuallyExclusivePartyMembers">Mutually Exclusive Party Members</a>:<ul><li> Each NPC companion has two others that they don't get along with, and will eventually make this known to you. If multiple members of the party are antagonistic and/or morale is low, some may eventually leave (take your stuff back before they do).</li><li> <em>Warband</em> adds another layer of complexity in the system: each party member dislikes a specific party member (causing a progressive drop in morale) if he/she serves as an emissary to support rights of the player to reach the throne. Note that this relation targets someone with which he/she has usually a neutral relation and is described as the emissary using a particular argument that offends that character's sensibilities.</li><li> <em>With Fire and Sword</em> has an even more complex system of relations inside the party: some party members like one other, some like two others, some dislike only one, some others dislike two or even three, and those feelings are not always reciprocal (there is even the example of Ingri-Algidras: Ingri dislikes Algidras but Algidras likes Ingri).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRulesAreNotYourRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRulesAreNotYourRules">My Rules Are Not Your Rules</a>:<ul><li> Every time you lose a battle, you get taken prisoner and dragged around for a while; however, whenever an NPC Lord loses, he gets away 80% of the time, and then he's nowhere to be seen.</li><li> When you're incapacitated in battle, your troops immediately retreat and lose morale, no matter how close you are to victory. However, enemy armies will happily continue fighting after their commander receives two arrows to the head and smashes into a tree.</li><li> While the player must recruit members of his party, AI lords and kings are instantly assigned troops as needed, even though they only occasionally stop at villages to recruit base troops. But at least this cheating goes both ways and also applies to lords allied with the player.<ul><li> Lords get troops based on their fiefs. More fiefs means more troops. Kings, on the other hand, get troops based on the fact that they're kings. So <em>if</em> you manage to defeat a King's sizable personal force (200+ troops), then <em>when</em> they escape, they'll disappear for a few days and show up with their entire force replenished. Particularly devastating if you're trying to take the king's last city, and they keep respawning to smash into your forces.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">Nerf</a>:<ul><li> Horse archer player characters can no longer access an infinite supply of arrows by running to and from their baggage thanks to a patch; you have the arrows you start with and any spares you left in your baggage train. This prevents players from simply picking off entire infantry armies on their lonesome at level one.</li><li> Of course there's nothing to stop you from picking up your (or their ammo) ammo off the ground or pulling it out of enemy corpses to re-use (only gun ammo can't be recovered). It's basically the only way to make un-modded thrown weapons viable as a ranged option, due to their tiny stack sizes.</li><li> Also - couched lance damage - a form of attack that in the original M&amp;B would allow a starting player with a half-way decent polearm to solo entire armor-clad armies was made more difficult to achieve. The player has to manually aim the lance whereas aiming was automatic in the original.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoArcInArchery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoArcInArchery">No "Arc" in "Archery"</a>:<ul><li> Averted.

All weapons (except the Hafted Blade) are used one-handed when on horseback, but two-handed weapons will run off the two-handed skill and prevent the use of a shield anyway, in addition to suffering a penalty to swinging speed and damage per attack. Even with these penalties and restrictions, their great reach makes two-handed sabers appealing for mounted combat on uneven ground where it may be diffcult to connect attacks with shorter, one-handed weapons on unmounted enemies. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">Played with</a> in the case of the bastard (hand and a half) sword and other one-handed/two-handed weapons, which are, as their name implies, usable as one-handed weapons or two-handed weapons, and when used on foot without a shield, can freely switch between the two modes with the X key (on horseback, whether they run off the one-handed or two-handed skill depends on if a shield is equipped, and obviously even on foot, using a shield precludes two-handed use).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a>:<ul><li> The player character. While getting between more than one enemy is almost always capture, it is quite effective to run ahead of your army and slaughter enemy troops by hit and run tactics (lightly armoured troops will normally die in one hit), often killing a platoon of enemies before they are in range of your men.</li><li> This is also sometimes a cause of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Artificial Stupidity</a>, as sometimes the enemy stay in formation and wont dare to fight you until they meet the rest of your army.</li><li> Its quite possible to kite enemy armies on your own, on foot no less, in <em>Warband</em> provided they have no cavalry, projectiles or good polearms.</li><li> You can also do this by waiting on top of a small ramp used to invade a town or castle, ready a 2-handed, preferably block-breaking weapon, and cut down quite a few of the enemy yourself as they walk one-by-one into your weapon with just enough time to raise it again in between.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneStatToRuleThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneStatToRuleThemAll">One Stat to Rule Them All</a>: Intelligence.

It is noted in-game by some companions as being thick with outlaws.</li><li> The mountainous region at the borders of the Vaegir and Swadian kingdoms also hosts <em>entire droves</em> of bandit bands. These Mountain Bandits are a little hardier though, and also one of the few highwaymen types that use light cavalry units in addition to infantry.<ul><li> Sea Raiders, in <em>Warband</em>, are a large source of good equipment, money AND experience. To elaborate: each Sea Raider is worth about 130 experience points (quite a lot for M&amp;B), they all have good equipment like mail armor, axes, bows, decent shields and helmets allowing the player can farm them for large amount of cash (or keep better items for himself). The downside is that Sea Raiders carry said decent armor and very damaging throwing weapons and some of them even long bows. Careful players can ride around them, dodging projectiles, until they all exhaust their ammo. And the best part: you can do this all by yourself, meaning only you get all the experience and more items can be found after the battle</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">Plot Armor</a>: Any named character can only be captured, not killed.

Steppe Bandits become Khergit Tribesmen, Taiga Bandits become Vaegir Recruits, and so on), which are usually 7-10 levels lower than the bandits were. This is especially pronounced with Sea Raiders, which are level 16 and are decently skilled melee and ranged fighters with decent armor and shields, while Nord Recruits are level 6, are melee only, have virtually no armor, and only might have a shield. Also, unlike the units they promote to, bandit units are "neutral", meaning that they don't lose morale when at war with their home country.</li><li> Thanks to the semi-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProceduralGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProceduralGeneration">Procedural Generation</a> of troop attributes and skills, certain troop upgrades, especially those where the unit's equipment loadout doesn't change much, may prove underwhelming, and given the cost increase, may not be particularly productive, save for as a stepping stone to the next promotion of the unit. However, cases where a promotion is actually weaker than what came before it as a result of this are extremely rare.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PretextForWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PretextForWar">Pretext for War</a>: One mission type is having a noble ask you to find reason to start a war.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProceduralGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProceduralGeneration">Procedural Generation</a>: The various non-hero units have pre-defined baseline stats, but also receive random or semi-random allocations of attribute and skill points on top of this that are set when you start a game and permanently fixed for all units of that type every time that save is loaded. Weapon proficiencies, however, are always their defined values. This means that, for example, in one game Sarranid Mamlukes might have a clear advantage over Swadian Knights, in another, they might be virtually identical, and in yet another, the Swadian Knights might be the better cavalry.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Warrior Race Guy</a>:<ul><li> Several, notably Baheshtur and Matheld.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings">Naturally</a>, the Sea Raiders and (to a lesser extent) the Nords and Khergits.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurelyAestheticGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurelyAestheticGender">Purely Aesthetic Gender</a>:<ul><li> Very slightly averted, in that gender will affect a player's initial stats. However, the female NPCs are oppressed, and the female player character is not (in gameplay anyways, escaping such is an option for motivations in the background questions at the start of the game).</li><li> Also there is a huge difference in captured female and male peasants. Male farmers will train up to become mercenaries like the ones commonly hired in taverns who are useful but expensive, while female peasants will become Sword Sisters, a rare but cheap and fairly powerful mounted unit.</li><li> <em>Warband</em> has a different method of courtship for each gender (males must woo a lady and convince her guardian to let the marriage take place), while females have to court roaming lords.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposelyOverpowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposelyOverpowered">Purposely Overpowered</a>:<ul><li> Cavalry dominates most battles without conditions working against them (hills, sieges).</li><li> <em>Warband</em>'s multiplayer sieges remove the siege from being a negative condition; circle round the whole castle and get all the ladders up on the wall or charge through the sally port and butcher anyone in the courtyard.</li><li> Nord Huscarls take a long time to train, but are by far the best infantry in the game, able to fight greater numbers and win with few if any losses.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits">Ragtag Bunch of Misfits</a>: The player can recruit troops from all the factions as well as mercenaries to create one big motley crew - and as one can recruit from their own prisoners and those they rescue from the enemy, pretty much any unit can end up in the player's service at some point, including bandits and raiders.

One quirk is that mounted archers build proficiency stupidly quick, as the the increases are based on the supposed difficulty of a shot (How far the target is, how fast you are moveing, bonus for head shots), but fails to account for how easy it is to hit shoot as a large mob during a full gallop (which you should be doing) and have it hit <em>someone</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayingAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayingAlive">Staying Alive</a>: Thanks to the surgery skill, your veterans can survive some <em>nasty</em> wounds.

Even if COMPLETELY outmatched (IE: Peasants vs Knights) Averted on the overmap, though, unless they vastly outnumber your army size. In which case the trope is played straight, as your ten high level cavalry units and yourself will probably wipe out those forty looters pretty quickly.</li><li> Some of the more hilarious parts of this are watching peasants gleefully charge fully-armored swordsmen one-after-another, with the swordsman 1-hit-killing each one. Or heavily-armored footmen trying in vain to chase down horse archers...</li><li> Finally averted in the <em>Warband</em> extension. Now, enemies will run when their morale is low and when they understand that the battle is lost. Small parties of bandits that you chased will still try to take their chance against large armies rather than just trying to bribe you, though.</li><li> All said, it's played straight when you <em>do</em> catch up to people on the overworld map. You can ride your army of 100+ cavalry right up to a dozen unarmored, shirtless looters, demand that they "surrender or die," and they'll immediately retort with something along the lines of "I'm not afraid of you!

This makes them easy to single out and pick off with a well-placed couched lance attack or other attack with a significant speed bonus behind it. Even in other armies, nobles may have unusual equipment like winged great helms that redshirts don't, again singling them out for quick elimination with their own higher-quality gear.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming">Theme Naming</a>: For most of the original game's development, Marnid and Borcha were the only companion NPCs. <strong>M</strong>arnid and <strong>B</strong>orcha, <strong>M</strong>ount &amp; <strong>B</strong>lade.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTents">There Are No Tents</a>: Averted. You have the option of setting up camp anywhere and anytime on the world map.

Some of the villages look barely enough to house twenty people whereas you can be recruiting a half dozen volunteers from them every day. A village with nearly max disposition can offer 70+ recruits with frightening regularity.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a>: The AI will always provide you with endless hilarities by following this trope.<ul><li> Both sides during a multiplayer siege battle will treat a defender who repeatedly opens the sally port door as this and will promptly ban the offender for their stupidity/poor sportsmanship.

It does have some use for keeping many companions though, as you can persuade companions who want to leave because of others to stay. It's more useful on certain NPCs, since you can send them on diplomatic missions to other Lords to butter them up about you and make it easier to earn Fiefs or recruit them should you form your own nation.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>: Deliberately invoked. You're told up front that, as the game is heavily based on the Middle Ages, the most powerful people in Calradia tend to be of noble birth and male. Indeed, in the early stages of the games, most NPC's will treat a female character like a joke. Of course, there's really no penalty for playing as a girl, and in fact there are several achievements that require you to accomplish certain impressive feats with a female character.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp">The Vamp</a>: According to Hakim Sultan, Arwa the Pearled One is this; a woman who seized power in the Sarranid Sultanate by charming the old Sultan, Ayzar.

Firstly, you can only get things that your opponents wield (Looters will not magically yield plate armor, for example). Secondly, the quality and quantity of loot is determined by your Looting skill (which serves no other purpose). Thirdly, the more troops and companions you have the less loot you get. The net result is that post-battle looting tends to yield dangerously subpar equipment only fit for selling off. You have a much better chance of finding high quality items by using that money to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringbutPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringbutPractical">go shopping</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">Vestigial Empire</a>: At some point in the distant past, all of Calradia was united under a single empire. It's long since broken up, but some people still remember their ancestors' roles within that empire fondly. And, of course, the whole reason that all the factions are fighting in the first place is because each monarch wants to reforge the empire in their own image.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">Video Game Cruelty Potential</a>:<ul><li> Want to level up your allies, but have a battle they aren't going to win on their own?

But it can and WILL draw attention from, at the very least, the local Nobles. And early in the game, a noble with several dozen of the best troops in the game at his side will be more than you can handle! Even later in the game, raiding villages enough will have entire kingdoms ready to attack you on sight!</li><li> It also takes a while, during which you're helpless, the village is constantly reporting your location to any friendly lord within range, and enemy lords can and will form parties to kick your ass.</li><li> Villages are also the most common source of recruits. If you make them all hate you and then get your army wiped out...</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense">Violation of Common Sense</a>:<ul><li> Jumping down onto the spikes around a castle wall will result in less damage than avoiding the spikes (assuming you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telefrag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telefrag">don't get stuck in the object</a>).</li><li> Opening the maingates or the sally port in multiplayer sieges is pretty much this, as it's generally a foregone conclusion on the Mahdaar Castle map that if the sally port is breached before the final minute, the defenders will lose as the attacker's spawn is right outside it and the besieging side will just keep sending cavalry through in a constant stampede.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeBuyAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeBuyAnything">We Buy Anything</a>: Any shop in town will buy any item.

And book merchants.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCannotGoOnWithoutYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCannotGoOnWithoutYou">We Cannot Go On Without You</a>: The battle ends as soon as you are knocked out, no matter how close you are to victory. This doesn't mean you lose, but your men will retreat and lose morale. While you can send your men in to fight without you, this is something you should NEVER do as they are much less effective when unled (an army that can inflict a 10-1 casualty rate on the enemy in a proper battle can easily suffer a 2-1 casualty rate if you use autoresolve for the same battle).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox">Wide Open Sandbox</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WimpFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WimpFight">Wimp Fight</a>: If two AI in the arena spawn with bows next to each other, they will proceed to punch eachother for minimal damage until one is KO or (more likely) someone kicks both their asses.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardNeedsFoodBadly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardNeedsFoodBadly">Wizard Needs Food Badly</a>: A lack of food causes morale penalties and eventually desertion.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>:<ul><li> Releasing an enemy lord that you just defeated will earn you honor, and most lords will raise their reputation with you. However, some will see this as an insult and releasing them will actually make them hate you more. A high reputation with an enemy lord will sometimes allow you to avoid a fight with them at the cost of a small reputation hit with them. But it's very useful if you're outmatched and are simply trying to get back to friendly territory.</li><li> Averted with the player character being defeated; they will always be dragged around as a prisoner.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAllMeetInAnInn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAllMeetInAnInn">You All Meet in an Inn</a>: Companions and mercenaries are acquired in taverns.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWillBeSpared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWillBeSpared">You Will Be Spared</a>: If you let lords go free, they may give you the quick and painless variety.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a>:<ul><li> Swadia's main advantage is their overwhelming numbers, with a sizeable number of cavalry attacking the enemy first, followed by an extremely large number of ground troops that gang up on soldiers thanks to starting a full town bigger than every other faction, although Swadia itself is liable to be Zerged on the strategic scale thanks to its larger size.</li><li> Rebel factions deal with this a lot. Chances are lords won't join the Rebels until dozens of in-game days after the faction is created, and players will have to risk being ambushed to meet with lords to convince them.

However, if you fight a much larger army with a smaller one, and win, you can still gain a lot of renown, and the bigger the difference in size the better. This works even if you're by yourself or with a very small party, and get attacked by a group of say, 40 bandits. However, keep in mind that unless you're using high level units and utilizing them where they work best, such as cavalry in an open field battle without hills or a river, it can be difficult to fight off a larger force.

This is, however, a very important distinction as Ashigaru tend to get unimpressive Power Draw skill levels and relatively weak bows, especially compared to Master Archer or Hatamoto Archer Samurai units, while guns aren't dependent on a skill like that and a massed formation of gun users, even if they're just Ashigaru, can be extremely dangerous. Similarly, which two of the four possible Hatamoto level final promotions (Guard, Cavalry, Gunner, or Archer) are available for Samurai units depends on where they come from, and unlike Native factions, other than their final promotion, they're identical, which means that you can easily wind up recruiting Ji-zamurai without knowledge of what their final promotion is, and thus, how best to promote them.</li><li> Also in <em>Gekokujo</em>, that some lances even <em>can</em> be couched - the AI rarely uses mounted lancers, tournaments are entirely on foot, and such weapon use in Japan isn't nearly as famous as in Europe, so it's not readily apparent, but the Fukuro Yari, Su Yari, Jumonji Yari, and Katakama Yari, but NOT the "Yari Pike" versions can be couched.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousGerman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousGerman">Gratuitous German</a>: The sheer amount of mods that attempt to add Germany-based factions or units into the game and fail at properly utilizing German spelling and grammar is astounding.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroOfAnotherStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroOfAnotherStory">Hero of Another Story</a> : The popular <em>Floris Expanded Mod Pack</em>, which includes a variety of quality of life and variety mods, includes the titular companion Floris, who <a class="urllink" href="http://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php/topic,115780">literally has his own story<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

While this is not strictly inaccurate, it avoids actually giving any of their real names.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicDomainSoundtrack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicDomainSoundtrack">Public Domain Soundtrack</a>: <em>1429 : La Guerre de Cent Ans</em> has "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CarminaBurana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CarminaBurana">O Fortuna</a>" and "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZbQQaMuatE">Douce Dame Jolie<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6426a');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6426a" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6426a');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">English translation in the link</span> among its main menu themes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketTagGameplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketTagGameplay">Rocket-Tag Gameplay</a>: In mods where firearms exist and are common, ranged combat tends to be very decisive in comparison to Native, as most units go down in one or two bullets. This is taken even further in mods like <em>Gekokujo</em> or <em>Red Wars</em> where there are few or no shields, which makes combat even more decisive.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse">Shared Universe</a>: In <em>The Wedding Dance</em>, the companion Fawzia states that she is an exiled D'Shar princess from Pendor, implying that <em>The Wedding Dance</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProphesyOfPendor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProphesyOfPendor">Prophesy of Pendor</a></em> are set in the same universe.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a>: For a mod focusing on recreating a realistic Sengoku Era Japan, <em>Gekokujo</em> is probably the least likely place you'd expect to find, fight with and even marry the likes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TouHou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TouHou">Ran, Meiling and Lunasa</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundtrackDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundtrackDissonance">Soundtrack Dissonance</a>: <em>Gekokujo</em> soundtrack originally contained Metal and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapanesePopMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapanesePopMusic">Japanese Pop Music</a>. It is a serious mod about Japanese history... Eventually averted with 3.0, which replaces the soundtrack with more period-appropriate music. However, the old tracks are still in the mod folders, if anyone wishes to enforce this trope for themselves.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">Weak, but Skilled</a>: The female troops in <em>More Women</em> tend to have slightly lower minimum Power Strike/Draw/Throw ranks than their male counterparts (though, of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProceduralGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProceduralGeneration">Procedural Generation</a> can turn this on its head), but greater weapon proficiencies. Of course, "weak" is relative and a Swadian Iron Lady or Nord Steelheart (equivalent to a Swadian Knight and a Nord Huscarl, respectively) is still a force to be reckoned with, and for units like Rhodok and Swadian crossbow(wo)men that don't depend on these skill ranks, this makes for an unambiguous upgrade.</li></ul></div><hr>
