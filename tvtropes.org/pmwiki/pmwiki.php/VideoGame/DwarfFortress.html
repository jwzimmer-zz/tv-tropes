The brothers began work on the game in 2002, and it saw its first alpha-release in 2006. Strictly speaking, the game is really two games: the game it is right now, and the game it hopes to be. Its goal is to be nothing less than a fantasy world simulator, simulating dozens of nations and hundreds of thousands of characters over a thousand years or more, where you can watch history unfold from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimulationGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimulationGame">godlike perspective</a>, or take the role of any character or civilization and make history.

Both modes have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndlessGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndlessGame">no way to win</a>, but hundreds of ways to lose, and thus, Losing is Fun. If you intend to play this game, <a class="urllink" href="http://imgur.com/mHXiz.png">keep that in mind.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small></p><p>The key word for describing <em>Dwarf Fortress</em> is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplexityAddiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplexityAddiction">complex</a>". The game attempts to simulate real physics, biology, and even chemistry as accurately as possible, with a surprising degree of success, at the cost of user-friendliness. For example, in lieu of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a>, the game has a detailed, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IterVehemensAdNecem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IterVehemensAdNecem">IVAN</a></em>-esque <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubsystemDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubsystemDamage">Subsystem Damage</a> mechanic for all dwarves, monsters, and other creatures, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrapplingWithGrapplingRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrapplingWithGrapplingRules">and an attack targeting system that allows any unit to attack or grapple any part of its opponent's body with pretty much any still-attached prehensile appendage.</a> The game only gets more convoluted from there, becoming denser with each update. The fans joke that Tarn Adams, who remains the primary developer on the game, will continue to make the game more and more granular until it reaches the subatomic level and begins to simulate quantum mechanics and particle physics. Judging by the way the game is growing, that prediction may become true.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p><em>Dwarf Fortress</em> is free, with further development paid for by donations.

Any glass but green glass, however, needs wood ash to turn into pearlash, beds must be made of wood, and wood is the preferred material for bins, so elves are notoriously unpopular. Even a single wooden decoration in a craft will make them storm out of the trade depot and probably later send archers to your front gate by the hundreds.

It's not only possible, but easy, to build a perpetual motion machine, and melting a metal item returns a fixed amount of metal which is almost never the amount that went into it (in fact, sometimes it's <em>more</em>). The same unit block of stone can be used to make a one-tile wall, three mugs, or as little as one toy boat, with no waste material in either case. Some of these will probably be fixed eventually.</li><li> The perpetual motion machine issue actually arises from trying to apply the laws of physics too accurately, while simultaneously trying to bend them in the name of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun">Rule of Fun</a>. The flow rate of screw pumps is two orders of magnitude greater than it should be for the power applied due to using a one dimensional quantity (liquid depth) as if it were a three dimensional one (liquid volume). Correcting this "bug", however, would result in the pumps either moving liquids so slowly they would evaporate before reaching a depth greater than 1, or require 100 fully powered water wheels per pump (assuming tiles are 10 x 10 liquid levels in size, as their power generation seems to indicate for a given liquid flow rate).

Gibs, represented as red '2's&mdash;or green, or grey, depending on whether it bleeds blood or goo&mdash;will litter the surrounding environment if enemies are dismembered, disemboweled, hacked in two, or thrown into a wall with enough force to blow apart. It gets even better in adventure mode, which lets you take control of a single adventurer. This mode includes a blow-by-blow account of every fight, and the ability to pick up and throw the severed bits of enemies: or anything else, for that matter. Thrown objects&mdash;even <em>socks</em>&mdash;will often hit with deadly force, breaking bones, damaging organs, or splattering brains across the floor. Ludicrous gibs indeed.<ul><li> If an axedwarf is sufficiently experienced, he/she can eviscerate goblins so spectacularly <em>the goblin's left leg ends up in a nearby tree</em>. Meanwhile, if a mace- or hammerdwarf gets a sufficient velocity on his goblin, the goblin can explode into every single one of his components. "Where did that guy's arm go again?"</li><li> Something similar can happen to your dwarves at the hands of goblin wrestlers.</li><li> A <em>basic</em> dwarf recruit, who hasn't had time to go grab a weapon, can still beat up a kobold so spectacularly that the kobold's left arm ends up in two pieces.</li><li> Even kobolds get the opportunity to do this. In Kobold Camp, a modification for the game, champion level kobold soldiers, using bone armor and copper weapons, can easily knock the limbs off goblin raiders, who use iron armor and weapons.</li><li> It doesn't stop at melee combat. When something is burned ludicrously, you get to pick through the burning corpse. You see such awesome things as "xx!!cat brain!!xx" (The !!s mean it's on fire, the xx meaning there's not much left of it.)</li><li> This can come back to bite the dwarves in the ass when in evil biomes, as every severed part reanimates as an individual enemy. As a result, you might find an entire army of angry limbs besieging your fort if you rely on sharp weaponry a bit too much.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeNounverber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeNounverber">Luke Nounverber</a>: Naming for everything works this way.<ul><li> Occasionally throws up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Names to Run Away from Really Fast</a> if something or someone with a sinister name turns out to be, well, sinister.

The end result is usually an unstable biomass vaguely resembling what it used to be, for Wrestlers in either Fortress or Adventure mode.</li><li> A way to try and make super soldiers (or any useful Fortress-bred dwarves at all), known simply as "Dwarven Daycare", is to lock a baby in a tiny room with a bunch of dogs. Before long the dogs will grow aggressive because of overcrowding, and the child will be forced to defend itself. A steady supply of dogs is ensured. This is repeated until the child matures into an adult at age 12. An upgraded approach includes precisely burning the child's subcutaneous fat off its body, making it fireproof.</li><li> There's also the <a class="urllink" href="http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/v0.34:Danger_room">Danger Room<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> method of training dwarves in Fortress mode. A room filled with spikes moving in-and-out of walls at dangerous speeds, combined with a bunch of soldier dwarves with little to no armor and shields until they learn how to dodge or block dependably. The mortality rate is usually high, though less so if you use wooden spikes. In that case, the only thing to die are babies carried by mothers, which, sadly, many players consider to be a "feature" and not a design flaw.</li><li> "Live training" involves capturing invaders in cage traps, stripping them naked, and carefully releasing them for your fully armed and armored dwarves to butcher. More dangerous creatures like trolls can be dropped into pits and used for target practice by marksdwarves. For bonus cool points, have observation platforms where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GladiatorGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GladiatorGames">civilians can watch the militia doing this live training from a comfortable remove</a>.</li><li> After the Civilization screen got improved, you can now expand your cruel ambitions beyond the site of your fort.

While in development, Toady realized that vampires would be unable to infiltrate the player's fortress without the UI giving them away. So, he modified the UI and a few game mechanics to accommodate stealthy vampires, including:<ul><li> Dwarves disappearing and anonymous crimes. In the old system, you are informed when a dwarf is attacked or killed and told who the culprit is. Now, you are only informed if there is a witness to notice the deed. Dwarves who haven't been seen recently are quietly added to a list of missing units, crimes will likewise be silently added to the justice screen if there are no witnesses. So dwarves can turn up dead and you won't know who killed them, but if you're attentive you'll know they vanished. Vampires can also frame other dwarves for their crimes.</li><li> Migrant skills. Vampires were given old, unused skills before other migrants were. So, the vampire was the only newcomer with a half-forgotten trade. All migrants can have old skills now.</li><li> Fake identities. Previously, you knew almost everything to know about a dwarf by reading his bio. Now they can assume false identities to hide their real age and potentially lengthy kill records. Their relationships can hint at their identity: a spouse not present in the fortress or armies of relatives suggest a vampire. This is were problems creep in: if the dwarf worships a god then that deity will be listed as a relationship. The deity's history can be viewed, providing a list of worshipers and curse victims, and listing a vampire's original identity. If you assign a nickname to a dwarf, <em>the list will display the nickname rather then the assumed and real names</em>. Thus, vampires can be spotted via the UI by nicknaming all newcomers, because giving Urist McCheesemaker the nickname "Doofus" results in the god's history reading "Cursed 'Doofus' McStonecrafter to prowl the night in search of blood".</li><li> Played straight with the advent of dwarfs being horrified at the deaths of other dwarfs, however. Now, it's possible to find "was horrified by the death of Urist McVampirebait" messages in dwarfs' thoughts; this is pretty much proof positive that the dwarf in question is the vampire responsible, especially if Urist McVampirebait's body had not been found and thus didn't even realise they were dead until seeing that thought.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverseGameClock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverseGameClock">In-Universe Game Clock</a>: The game keeps track of how long your dwarfs have been at the fortress, and things like weather, available crops, and arrival of traders are tied to the season.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvasionOfTheBabySnatchers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvasionOfTheBabySnatchers">Invasion of the Baby Snatchers</a>: Goblins.
