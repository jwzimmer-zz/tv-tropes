In this story, two factions on either "side" (as in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderVersusChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderVersusChaos">Order vs Disorder</a>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">team up</a> temporarily to defeat the other two and secure the power of a massive wrecked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Imperator-class Titan</a> that is lost somewhere on the planet.</p><p>The next expansion, <em>Dark Crusade</em>, departs from the mission-based campaigns of the original <em>Dawn of War</em> and <em>Winter Assault</em> and introduces the Tau and the Necrons as playable races. Its campaign is set on the planet Kronus, where the seven playable factions engage in a free-for-all smackdown across a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiskStyleMap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiskStyleMap">"Risk"-Style Map</a>. The planet nominally belongs to the Tau, but of course the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Imperium of Man</a> claims it's theirs by right, so each dispatches armed forces from the Fire Caste and the Imperial Guard to consolidate their authority; the Blood Ravens are back, sent by the Chief Librarian to carry out a purge of the world seemingly to protect the chapter's dirty secrets; an Ork <em>Waaagh!</em> led by Warboss Gorgutz Headhunter, who was also the Ork leader in <em>Winter Assault</em>, arrives on the planet to satisfy their bloodlust; the Chaos Space Marines arrive to claim the world for their dark gods; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUndead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUndead">Nec</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot">rons</a> buried in vast catacombs beneath the planet's surface stir from their tombs and rise to stake their own claim to the planet; the Eldar of Craftworld Ulthw&eacute; arrive to stop them under the leadership of Farseer Taldeer, another returning chararcter from <em>Winter Assault</em>. Although the Imperial Guard and Space Marines factions are usually on the same side, they fight each other anyway, since following their orders is mutually exclusive with leaving the planet to the other side peacefully.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>A third expansion pack, <em>Soulstorm</em>, upped the ante by featuring a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateShowdownOfUltimateDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateShowdownOfUltimateDestiny">nine-way free-for-all campaign</a> over the four worlds of the Kaurava system, in which even the three Imperial factions were at each others' throats (all located right next to each other), and introduced the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade">Sisters of Battle</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Dark Eldar</a> as playable armies.</p><p>The sequel, <em>Dawn of War II</em>, is a reboot of sorts. The player is a newly-promoted Force Commander, leading a few squads of Space Marines against an Ork invasion threatening the Blood Ravens' recruitment worlds, and therefore the future of the chapter itself. Once again, the Eldar are working behind the scenes to instigate the conflict, hoping to buy time against the incoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts">Tyranid hive fleet</a> to save a Craftworld. While still a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealTimeStrategy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealTimeStrategy">Real-Time Strategy</a> game, the game eliminates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConstructAdditionalPylons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConstructAdditionalPylons">base-building</a> altogether and greatly simplifies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouRequireMoreVespeneGas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouRequireMoreVespeneGas">resource-gathering</a>, while focusing more on squad-based tactics rather than huge pitched battles, and also incorporating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPG">RPG</a> elements in the form of unit experience, wargear, and skill selection. The game is built on the same engine used in Relic's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> RTS, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CompanyOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CompanyOfHeroes">Company of Heroes</a></em>, with plenty of graphical enhancements and gameplay tweaks, mirroring the history <em>Dawn of War</em> shares with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ImpossibleCreatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ImpossibleCreatures">Impossible Creatures</a></em> engine.</p><p>An expansion titled <em>Chaos Rising</em> adds Chaos Space Marines to the multiplayer and as antagonists in the campaign, along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">powerful wargear that can be used by your Space Marines</a>, though they may lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption">corruption</a>. A second expansion named <em>Retribution</em> expands on the single player campaign system by reintroducing campaigns for all the playable factions, and brings back the Imperial Guard as a playable faction.</p><p>Besides these official games, the <em>Dawn of War</em> series has spawned numerous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">mods</a>, from simple tweaks to damage and health values, to ambitious projects that add new units and factions (complete with voice acting and unit models), or even attempts to make the game more closely mirror the rules of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopGame">Tabletop Game</a> it is based on.</p><p>The franchise's future was in doubt in 2012 due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">bankruptcy of its publisher</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/THQ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/THQ">THQ</a>, sending its subsidiary studios either to auction or out of business. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-01-25-sega-and-relic-and-the-whereabouts-of-the-warhammer-40-000-ip">Relic was purchased<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sega" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sega">Sega</a> on January 22, 2013, and it was <a class="urllink" href="http://www.pcauthority.com.au/News/330680,confirmed-sega-now-owns-all-the-warhammer-licenses.aspx">confirmed later that month<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that with it came an exclusive license to produce games based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GamesWorkshop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GamesWorkshop">Games Workshop</a> IPs. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ZgyNoHtjw&amp;ab_channel=DawnofWar">Relic released a trailer on May 3rd, 2016<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> confirming <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWarIII">Dawn of War III</a></em> was in development and three races &mdash; Space Marines, Eldar and Orks &mdash; will be playable in it.

Their squads are expensive, especially the elite ones, but tend to be slightly above-average in every respect.</li><li> Doctrine: Generalist with a dash of Brute and Loyal. Overall the Space Marines' combat doctrine can be summed up as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a> <em>en masse</em>. They're designed for fighting and as such, their various upgrades tend to be a dozen individual upgrades for squads, sergeants, and Commanders that all add up over time. Basic Space Marine squads can be upgraded to be effective against any units, and most of their units feature at least one optional upgrade that lets them realign their weapons output as needed. Sergeants for basic Space Marine and Assault Marine squads also have the Rally! ability that lets them instantly restore their squad's moral and make them immune to morale damage for a time. Their final building gives them the option of sending units anywhere on the battlefield via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropPod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropPod">Drop Pod</a>, but can also train Space Marine squads and Dreadnoughts, letting them send reinforcements directly to the frontline.</li></ul></li><li> Chaos: (Renamed Chaos Space Marines in <em>II</em>)<ul><li> Numbers: Balanced overall, with a tug back and forth between Spammer and Elitist. Their units aren't as expensive as their loyalist counterparts but also aren't as adaptable. While their basic unit is the utter chaff Chaos Cultists squad, every other unit is much more cost-prohibitive.</li><li> Doctrine: Generalist, with a side-order of Guerrilla. They're less adaptable than their loyalist counterparts but still have units that can answer more than one role on the battlefield. As they tech up, their Chaos Cultists and Chaos Marines can become permanently infiltrated, making them adept at sneaky tactics.</li></ul></li><li> Orks:<ul><li> Numbers: Spammer. Ork units are cheap and have above-average size limits, but individual Orks who aren't part of an elite squad tend to be fragile and easily killed.</li><li> Doctrine: Brute, with elements of Industrial and Gimmick. Orks are reliant on the exploitation of the Orky Population mechanic, which determines their maximum number of boots on the ground and their progress on the Ork tech tree. Orky Pop is raised by building WAAAGH! Banners, with the more of them built allowing more Ork infantry, more powerful Ork squads, and better upgrades and research to improve existing forces. The number of Orks in a unit or large area also determines a squad's movement speed, attack damage, morale recovery, and health regeneration.

But when it does, it brings its entire army. And yes, that does mean that taking casualties while attacking one of several AIs on a team will result in the other AIs immediately counterattacking the player's base with their entire army. <em>Dark Crusade</em>'s campaign is so notorious for this due to its habit of pitting the player against two AI opponents when attacking high-value territories that battles can drag out for <em>hours</em> due to the player not being able to make any headway unless starting the match with a swift rush to knock one of the AIs out early on.</li><li> If the player attacks the AI and it moves to defend, any units that take even the slightest bit of damage will run away to the AI's nearest structure (which more often than not is a Listening Post, adding its firepower into the equation) in an attempt to pull the player into a chokepoint.</li><li> If the AI is on the offensive but takes so many casualties that its cumulative army cost drops too low relative to the player's, it will back off and retreat to rebuild instead of futilely pressing the attack.</li><li> If the AI has any units queued up for a deep strike, it will keep them on standby until it engages in battle, then drops them right next to the enemy (which is especially dangerous with Necron Flayed Ones which drain morale from nearby enemies and can break a much bigger infantry force's morale in seconds if allowed that close). It also knows how to use units that can jump or teleport and is scripted to immediately drop any such units right onto the nearest enemy unit on ranged stance to tie them up in melee and thus remove their firepower from the battle (and in the case of vehicles, restrict their movement so that they cannot run away). Note that jump units that are ranged specialists themselves such as Warp Spiders and Crisis Suits are specifically excluded from attempting this because they will not automatically engage in melee.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimbs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimbs">Artificial Limbs</a>: Lord General Castor of the Imperial Guard has an augmetic right arm, which he uses to hold and operate two-handed guns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiringOneHanded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiringOneHanded">in one hand</a> while holding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordAndGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordAndGun">an officer's power saber in the other</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Artificial Stupidity</a>:<ul><li> Units in just about every <em>Dawn of War</em> game ever have unbelievably bad pathfinding skills. Trying to move a tank from your base to the front-lines is enough to scatter your carefully positioned defensive infantry line like roaches when the tank barges through them on the most direct route. Alternatively, the tank gets stuck and refuses to move out because the defenders are set to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine">Hold the Line</a> mode, marking them as immovable to allied units. If you do manage to get past this issue, giving combined infantry and armor forces a shared move or attack command results in 1) them getting stuck in each other, again, 2) individual soldiers from stuck squads charging forward without attacking because they're waiting for their squad to regroup before doing anything, 3) units getting into combat with the enemy piecemeal instead of all at once because, well, most of them are stuck in each other somewhere way back, or 4) taking up positions spread out across several screens' worth of the battlefield, forcing you to collect and reposition them one by one to restore some semblance of order. It's so bad that attacking with armor or infantry only, while rarely ideal, still proves to be the most effective approach due to the massively improved control you have over your imbecile forces. Of course, not all factions have the luxury of being able to field infantry/tank units that can deal with anything equally well.</li><li> The AI of the first game is set to prioritize more expensive units for production if it has a choice, which frequently results in the AI making nothing but hero units and sending them off to die every couple of seconds if it's backed into its own base.</li><li> The "jump/teleport everyone who can jump/teleport to the nearest unit on ranged stance" behavior mentioned under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance">Artificial Brilliance</a> does not check for the target actually being a squad better at ranged combat than melee, only its current stance. So setting a squad of melee specialists like Khorne Berzerkers on ranged stance will result in the AI jumping right next to them and getting cut down for their trouble. It also does not check whether the AI's units are actually effective against the target, which results in Predators getting mobbed by Stormboyz that can barely even scratch tanks.</li><li> The Assassination victory condition results in defeat if your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroUnit">Hero Unit</a> dies, so the computer will always attach it to the first squad it builds. However, it never switches them, keeping them attached to their weakest unit for the rest of the game. For that matter, they always let said hero join attack heavily-defended bases instead of hiding them away.</li><li> Any unit told to attack a fallen unit will do so in melee, including those that have no business being in melee like Fire Warriors. Similarly, telling them to attack a squad that's been scattered will result in them moving forwards until they can attack the whole squad.</li><li> The Imperial Guard, Chaos, and Necron AIs are prone to getting their tanks stuck behind their own buildings. The Eldar do the same with their Avatar, though in this case it's not as stupid as keeping the Avatar alive gives better bonuses than combat.</li><li> Tau armies <em>always</em> send their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Ethereal</a> into melee, never give the Commander extra weapons, and never increase their Kroot squads' HP through cannibalism.</li><li> The computer abuses their <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllSeeingAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllSeeingAI">ability to see the whole map</a></em> by dropping Jump-capable and Teleport-capable units on top of your nearest ones. This is normally devastating if the attacked unit is alone and bad at melee but it becomes a minor annoyance if you have overwhelming superiority in numbers.<ul><li> The AI also seems to be scripted to jump or teleport to the lowest-health unit it can see as soon as it is in range. This can result in scenes like a Necron Lord completely ignoring a wall of Fire Warriors trying to gank the lone Earth Caste Builder behind them, teleporting to the Builder, hitting it once, <em>then</em> aggroing onto the Fire Warriors.</li></ul></li><li> Your artillery units will gleefully fire into swarms of your own infantry to hit a single enemy scout, scattering your infantry and destroying their morale.</li><li> Infantry in <em>II</em> automatically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeCover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeCover">Take Cover!</a> on their own to free up some micromanagement. Unfortunately, they may do so even as a ranged squad under attack by a melee squad which is pitiful at range, causes them to waste time running into cover when they should just be shooting continuously... and the cover they choose to get behind can be <em>closer</em> to the enemy melee squad, making it easier for the melee squad to tie up the rest of the individual's squad and force them all into melee combat (which, as a ranged squad, they will probably lose at).</li><li> A.I. Opponents in <em>II</em> will also do this aplenty in Multiplayer mode. Difficulty primarily dictates what units the enemy will build. Easy will have the enemy send in their most basic troops to be sacrificed on the guns of your own. Normal lets them use some of the more powerful infantry. Hard starts adding in vehicles (typically, a transport or two, and their top-level, limit 1 vehicle/monster.) Expert has them willing to use all units, and tend to be a bit more aggressive at pushes.<ul><li> Which leads us to the second issue. The A.I. appears to have three combat "strategies". Strategy 1, they trickle units towards your base, one at a time, and form a neat orderly line. Sometimes this is of some concern (Say, Ork Killa Kans, or a Battlewagon). Most of the time though, they'll be content sending an infantry unit, no matter how poorly suited they are for the task, to try and take tiny little nibbles out of your base's <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPs">H Ps</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Say, Ripper Swarms happily accepting the Emperor's fury at small annoying creatures, via two to three Twin-Linked Heavy Bolter Turrets, in less than 5 seconds</a>. Strategy 2, has them run about capturing Power and Resource nodes, then immediately retreating, with no defense left to watch over them. Strategy 3, and perhaps the most annoying especially in Annihilate victory conditions (and one commonly seen when they have allies), is to just sit at their base, and build units, sending only their Commander unit, and maybe a heavy unit or two out to do anything else. It's annoying because it means you'll take heavy losses unless you have a forward respawn unit with them and keeping everyone healed and repaired, but once you bleed the enemy out of a lot of expensive units, it becomes easy to start blasting apart anything that does get called in at their base. Plus they tend to group up so nicely together for Orbital Bombardments.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseReligion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseReligion">Artistic License &#150; Religion</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>.

Unlike the Space Wolves' or Blood Angels' ferocious charges, the Blood Ravens focus on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis">analyzing and targeting weak points in enemy lines</a>, applying pressure where needed to break apart far larger forces with minimal casualties. The best example of this comes from <em>Dawn of War II's</em> campaign, where a strike force consisting of 11 Marines, 3 Scouts, and 1 Dreadnought was able to hold off a sector-wide Tyranid invasion (with Ork infestations and Eldar interventions on top of that) by striking at key targets until the much larger relief force arrives.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">The Computer Is a Cheating Bastard</a>:<ul><li> On "Harder" and "Insane" Skirmish difficulties the computer doesn't really get any smarter, it just gets bonuses to its resource acquisition rates. On "Hard" campaign difficulty, the computer gets extra HP on its units, although both are reversed in favor of the player in "Easy" or "Standard" for Skirmish and "Easy" or "Normal" for the campaign. This was done because <a class="urllink" href="http://community.dawnofwar2.com/blogs/?p=654">Jonny Ebert, lead designer of ''Dawn of War II'', believes that allowing the computer to cheat is necessary to close the gap between them and the player(s)<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>...</li><li> The Imperial Guard scanner has an uncanny ability to always hit infiltrators dead on, despite the fact they're, y'know, invisible. Even if you don't have any infiltrators to unveil, the scanner will always land on some of your units or buildings no matter how low the chances are to do so with a Hail Mary shot.</li><li> Honor Guard units in <em>Dark Crusade</em> and <em>Soulstorm</em> can only be earned by conquering and holding territory, and getting all 12 units requires conquering everything that doesn't confer a strategic bonus instead. That's the rule for the player. AI generals don't need to conquer or hold anything at all. They simply gain one unit per turn even if they never make it out of their stronghold, including units like heavy tier 3 tanks that the player can never have in their Honor Guard. This can lead to extremely nasty surprises when an AI player sits tight and quiet for a while and then suddenly steamrolls your provinces with an unstoppable Honor Guard full of powerful elite units that charge your HQ before you've even had a chance to build some basic infantry.</li><li> The Tau are the only faction in <em>Dark Crusade</em> and <em>Soulstorm</em> without access to stationary defenses other than their listening posts, which prevents Tau players from applying the game-breaking fortification techniques that make province defense missions a joke. However, if the AI controls the Tau, it can build listening posts absolutely anywhere, not just on control points and relics, and it's depressingly common to attack a Tau base and find it walled in by about a dozen upgraded "listening posts".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyRedemption">Conspiracy Redemption</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The 'pure' ending of <em>Chaos Rising</em> flat-out states that this will be happening to the Blood Ravens.

From <em>II</em> onwards Howling Banshees have voices like this as well; in the first game their voices are high-pitched and slightly squeaky.

This seems like just a gimmick, but if you stack five Priests, and time their invincibility just right, you can prevent that unit from ever being damaged.

For a demonstration of this, try winning a firefight with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Khorne Berserkers</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking">Nobz</a>, or a melee with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Dark Reapers or Fire Warriors</a>.<ul><li> Faction-wise, Tau units can destroy nearly anything from afar, but don't last long in melee. While they do have auxiliaries decent at melee, they're not quite as good as the equivalent melee units of the other factions.<ul><li> The Imperial Guard is in the same boat, more or less. Guardsmen squads have good firepower, especially once they have been fully upgraded, as do Kasrkin, but the former are quite poor at melee, and the latter are only a little better. Furthermore, unlike other factions, the Guard has no vehicles that are any good at melee; whereas, say, the Eldar have the Wraithlord, and the Imperial Space Marines have the Dreadnought, the Guard Walker, the Sentinel, is only good at anti-vehicle ranged. The Guard, therefore, has only two units that are any good at melee: one single Ogryn squad, and the single command squad, especially if it has a lot of priests. Pretty much the only time you want to use the Guard in melee is against the Tau.</li></ul></li><li> The Eldar Infantry of <em>Dawn of War</em> are almost a pure embodiment of this trope.

They usually start with a set of weapons made for the same target (Anti-Infantry for the Chaos Predator, Anti-Tank for the Ravager) that can be upgraded to do the opposite (lascannons for anti-tank on the Predator, Splinter Cannons for anti-infantry on the Ravager). This allows the players to choose if all of the weapons are specialized against one target, or if they want to bring a balanced mix. The upside and downside of course is that there isn't enough of these units for you to bring an even mix that is also effective, but overspecializing leads to the usual problems.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrosshairAware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrosshairAware">Crosshair Aware</a>:<ul><li> Tau missile barrages leave a big honking crosshair on the ground.</li><li> Off-map support like artillery barrages or drop pods in the second game usually leave a marker on the ground before they trigger, as do most special boss attacks.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchingMoronHiddenBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchingMoronHiddenBadass">Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass</a>: Doesn't usually apply, considering that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfBadass">everyone in the 40K universe is inherently badass to a degree</a>.

You start out with only a hero and a single builder unit and no resources, with honor guard and defensive units added at great cost, so it's not unusual to spend a turn or two doing nothing to accumulate enough requisition to survive an attack, while enemy heroes start maps with full squads and immediately go for your HQ.</li><li> The <em>Chaos Rising</em> campaign is a weird case. Its first mission is fairly relaxed overall, as are more or less all others from the third onwards, but its second mission is absolutely brutal even on the lowest difficulty setting.

It also let you deploy however many turrets you felt you could get away with. Relic/Specialist units and turrets gained caps when <em>Dark Crusade</em> was released.</li><li> For the sake of simplifying the animation work in <em>Dawn of War I</em>, all characters are <strong>right-handed</strong> (they always use guns or melee with their right-hand). This is highly unusual as characters who wield a pistol and a melee weapon at the same time are implied to be left-handed (they're supposed to use the melee weapon with their strong, dominant arm instead of their weak, non-dominant arm).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">Earn Your Happy Ending</a>: Maintaining full purity in <em>Chaos Rising</em> is necessary to get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a>, and by the Emperor, this game will make you <em>earn</em> that ending.

Once you've figured these out, most of the campaign becomes trivial due to options this behavior opens up. The most obvious one is to simply make a beeline for the enemy HQ buildings the moment the mission starts, defeating the enemy before they can build up their forces. Another, even better approach is to trap the enemy in their base (most starting positions only have one or two narrow entrances), conquer the entire map, max out your tech tree, build turrets around the enemy base entrances, then destroy the HQ. Buildings remain on the map when you leave, and if the province is attacked later, you already own the whole map while the enemy either can't leave their base at all or suffers horrendous casualties in the attempt, slowing them down enough for you to move in with minimal fuss. Just be careful not to build too close to the enemy base - it has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathRadius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathRadius">"Instant Death" Radius</a> of sorts that will remove any of your buildings inside the perimeter.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatingTheEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatingTheEnemy">Eating the Enemy</a>: Squiggoths and Greater Knarlocs from avert this: while many of their melee animations show them chomping down on enemies, they don't actually eat them, just toss their corpses far off (in canon, of course, it's a different matter).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Egopolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Egopolis">Egopolis</a>:<ul><li> The Lands of Solitude are renamed Borealum in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">Space Marine</a> ending of <em>Soulstorm</em>.</li><li> In the Imperial Guard campaign of <em>Soulstorm</em>, the Roklaw Mountains are renamed Stubbs' Peak.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Elite Mooks</a>:<ul><li> Elite squads for each faction, such as Terminator Space Marines and Imperial Guard Kasrkin and Ogryns.

In the first two, Honour Guard squads and vehicles are unlocked by holding certain territories on the map and bought with Planetary Requisition. They have lower squad numbers than their regular counterparts, but have better stats and don't contribute to their respective population caps. In <em>Retribution</em>, each playable hero has a corresponding Honour Guard unit who can replace them in the field.

The best ones, however, are the ones big units perform on other big units, for example, a Dreadnought grabbing a Wraithlord's weapon, forcing it away, grabbing it by its neck and crushing it in its power claw - in other words, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTank">Walking Tank</a> strangling a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a>.</li><li> Or when above <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> gets its sword stuck in said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTank">Walking Tank</a> when it kills the pilot inside for good, forcibly removes his sword, sees that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTank">Walking Tank</a> is still standing, then gently tips it over.</li><li> The Force Commander's sync kill against the Bloodthirster in <em>Dawn of War</em> and its expansions deserves special mention. He performs a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColossusClimb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColossusClimb">Colossus Climb</a> on the thirty-foot daemon by grabbing it by the horns and swinging up, stands on its shoulders, pounds it into the ground with repeated whacks from his hammer, then vaults over its disintegrating corpse (which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncendiaryExponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncendiaryExponent">on fire</a>).</li><li> Perhaps one of the most epic sync kills from <em>Chaos Rising</em> onwards is the Avatar of Khaine vs the Great Unclean One. If the Avatar is sync killing the GUO, it will stab it in the chest; causing it to laugh and use its puke of doom on the Avatar, which responds by shoving its gigantic sword into the Great Unclean One's mouth and out the back of its head. If the GUO is sync killing the Avatar it will jab its meat cleaver sword into the Avatar's back, turn its sword upright and lift it into the air and use gravity to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice">impale the Avatar all the way through the sword</a><ul><li> In <em>Dawn of War</em> and its expansions, the humanoid Relic Units also had their fair share of epic sync kills. If a Bloodthirster sync kills an Avatar, the Bloodthirster gets smacked around by the Avatar, but bats the Avatar's head off with its axe in the end. If the Avatar is the sync killer, it gets knocked down, but before the Bloodthirster can capitalize on this, the Avatar impales it with his giant sword. If the Nightbringer sync kills the Avatar (never the other way around due to the Nightbringer's invulnerability) after (now this troper is just going off of memory) a brief fight the Nightbringer scythes the Avatar's head off. While technically not a Relic Unit, if the Daemon Prince defeats the Greater Knarloc (pretty hard to do considering the differences in DPS and HP) it will leap up into the air with its sword pointed downward and impale the Knarloc's head and pin it to the ground before pulling its sword out and walking away.</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Dawn of War II</em>, if a Chaos Aspiring Champion of Khorne or the Spare Marine Force Commander sync kills a Carnifex (really hard to do) he will perform a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColossusClimb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColossusClimb">Colossus Climb</a> and stand on the Carnifex's tusks, holding on to his melee weapon impaled in the side of the Carnifex's head, and blast it repeatedly in the face with his pistol before finishing it off with a blast to the mouth. This sync kill is featured in <em>Retribution</em> in the mission where you have to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">escape Typhon as Exterminatus is being performed on it</span>. When you get to a certain point the Deranged Chaos Champion (since this is his full title <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">he must be crazy even by Chaos' standards...eep</a>), will start roaring to the sky, enraged by the fact that people would be trying to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">escape from Kyras's gift of death</span> before doing this in the Typhon Arena.</li><li> While not a sync kill, this is undoubtably epic. In the last mission of <em>Retribution</em>; after you have hammered at <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Daemon Prince Kyras</a></span> for quite a while and brought him down to one last sliver of health, your commander (Bluddflagg for the Orks for example) will note that he's weakened and tell you to finish him off with your big damaging global power (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">Rok bombardment, which drops a bunch of Asteroids</a>, for the Orks to continue this example.) Bluddflagg will say "Look, 'es reelin boys. Now it's time ta zap 'im wiff da biggest rok we 'ave." and you'll get one free usage of Rok bombardment. Once you target <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kyras</span> with this, you'll get a cutscene where Roks will start raining on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kyras</span>, causing him to shudder until an absolutely massive rok falls on top of his head and completely destroys it. Once the dust clears you'll see the bloody stump where his head used to be and watch his corpse slump back into the lava pit. A similar thing happens with the other factions (with the Space Marines using orbital bombardment instead, for example.)

The Necron Lord can let the Nightbringer possess him for a short period of time, during which, he is invincible and floats around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterScythe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterScythe">chopping up enemies good</a>. It seems a shame that he's not actually all that good at killing things - he doesn't have the raw killing power that some other units have. However, upon inspection of his in-game stats, he does vastly more damage to heavily armored vehicles and monsters... which includes every top tier unique unit in the game. While he won't be laying waste to entire armies, his damage output is such that during his brief stint on the battlefield he is capable of killing any single unit in the game that doesn't run away from him.</li><li> In fluff, Necron Gauss Weapons (which are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisintegratorRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisintegratorRay">not</a> Gauss weapons at all) are capable of eating through any kind of armor, and can inflict damaging blows on even the sturdiest target. In the game, they're about as effective as regular guns against armor.</li><li> The Eldar Avatar of Khaine requires a sacrifice to be summoned in the form of an Exarch being chosen to host him. In-game, he's built at the portal like any other unit (although this sacrifice is depicted in Dark Crusade's stronghold and Retribution's Eldar campaign).</li><li> A zigzagging example: in fluff, teleport homers and drop pod beacons are very necessary to avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleFrag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleFrag">Tele Fragging</a>.

By the end of a campaign, you may have gone through several Chapters worth of them.</li><li> Angelos gets trapped in the Warp towards the end of DOW II, including being unable to communicate. However, he still gives briefings for side missions like killing large Tyranids.</li><li> The Tau's primary commander unit is an XV22 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Battlesuit</a>, intended to make them distinct from their more rank-and-file XV8 Battlesuits.

In game, they do lots of damage to vehicles and that's it.</li><li> The Thur'abis Catacombs are, well, underground.

When facing them, it's extremely likely they'll move like the other armies, sticking around Kaurava IV and fighting only the Chaos forces there.</li><li> During Retribution's campaign, your heroes are trapped on a Space Hulk and need to fight through hordes of Tyranids and orks to escape.

Fortunately, the reward for speed-running is just a minor amount of XP while you get the same <em>plus</em> all the XP and gear from the enemies you killed if you go for a five-star kill rating, so gameplay-wise it's mostly a no-brainer.

Attaching multiple Priests and rotating the Priests' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Fanaticism</a></em> gives them ludicrous staying power, even when surrounded, and you can even order <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove">Orbital Bombardment</a> on your very location and remain unscathed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverineClaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverineClaws">Wolverine Claws</a>: Imperial Guard Generals in <em>Winter Assault</em> to <em>Soulstorm</em>, and Space Marine Assault Terminators.<ul><li> They come as equippable items in <em>Chaos Rising</em>, with sets both for normal and Terminator armour.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">The Worf Effect</a>: <em>Dark Crusade</em> and <em>Soulstorm</em> open with movies of Necrons wiping out Space Marines and Battle Sisters ignoring Tau pulse fire respectively.<ul><li> Chaplain Varnus establishes his credentials by smiting a Bloodthirster single-handed.</li><li> There's non-cutscene case of this in the final Imperial Guard level in <em>Winter Assault</em>. When the Necrons show up, they will outright slaughter the Chaos and Ork bases, giving a pretty good idea of what will happen if you try and fight without the Titan's guns.</li><li> This also happens to certain characters in <em>Retribution</em> depending on which campaign you play, as a main character from one of the other races will appear as an appropriately weak tutorial boss.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkerUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkerUnit">Worker Unit</a>: They do exist, but are far less of a crutch (and consequently, a burden) than in other RTS games. They build your structures and Listening Posts, repair damage and facilitate the gathering of resources, but as of <em>Dark Crusade</em> they don't take up any population cap and have a cap on how many of them you can build. The standard cap is 4, but the Imperial Guard have a cap of 3 and the Necrons a cap of 5 due to their greater dependency on their workers. Some Worker Units get quirky abilities which can be very powerful given the chance.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfBadass">World of Badass</a>: It's <em>Warhammer 40K</em>, so this is kind of a given.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfCardboardSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfCardboardSpeech">"World of Cardboard" Speech</a>: In place of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech">Rousing Speech</a>, the Necron Stronghold opens with Thomas Macabee giving one of these instead.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfHam">World of Ham</a>: Nearly every unit that talks is as hamtastic as possible. <em>Dawn of War II</em> toned it down a bit, which some fans were disappointed by. Fortunately for them, the villains in <em>Chaos Rising</em> bring the ham. It's like a Saturday morning cartoon with blood and gore!<ul><li> Let's just say this is the hammiest RTS ever.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>: Crops up a few times in <em>Soulstorm</em>.<ul><li> The Blood Ravens take no retributive action on the surviving Guardsmen. The Imperial Guard return the favor to the Blood Ravens: the small number of survivors they return to Segmentum Command, while burying the dead ones, whom they themselves just killed, with full military honors.</li><li> Commander Or'es'Ka, the Tau commander, apparently views the Space Marines this way; after defeating them, he praises their valour in battle and admits his troops would probably have lost, if it weren't for the Greater Good.</li><li> Inverted by the Dark Eldar Tahril, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurroundedByIdiots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurroundedByIdiots">sees every enemy but Chaos and the Eldar as idiots</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldNotShootAGoodGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldNotShootAGoodGuy">Would Not Shoot a Good Guy</a>: One mission in <em>Chaos Rising</em> involves having to go up against another company of Blood Ravens to destroy a specific building in order to expose a mole, and those other Blood Ravens have orders to shoot-on-sight. The player is encouraged to avoid unnecessary bloodshed during this mission and play this trope straight. If the player <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averts this trope</a> and gets aggressive, it results in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">corruption points</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCallThatAWound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCallThatAWound">You Call That a Wound?</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> by way of General Sturn in <em>Winter Assault</em>, who says it when revived.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">You Have Failed Me</a>:<ul><li> Eliphas' fate when his stronghold is destroyed. Which doesn't stop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPower">Popularity Power</a> bringing him back in <em>Chaos Rising</em> (luckily this can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">hand waved</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">death being cheap</a> in the Warp). He lasts all the way up to <em>Retribution</em>.</li><li> In <em>Winter Assault</em>, a meeting between Gorgutz and Crull ends with Gorgutz casually tripping a Chaos Space Marine as he leaves, just to show he can. Crull orders his Sorcerer to "execute that pitiful excuse for a soldier for EMBARRASSING ME!"</li><li> A random cultist who's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearerOfBadNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearerOfBadNews">Bearer of Bad News</a>, as noted under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMessenger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMessenger">Shoot the Messenger</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGetKnockedDownYouGetBackUpAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGetKnockedDownYouGetBackUpAgain">You Get Knocked Down, You Get Back Up Again</a>: Units who get knocked down can't be targeted directly until they get up again.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouRequireMoreVespeneGas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouRequireMoreVespeneGas">You Require More Vespene Gas</a>: Although the exact dependence on the various resources varies between factions, there are two resource types that form the basis of the first two games' economies: Requisition and Power. Requisition is directly tied to the number of Control Points the player holds, as well as how developed the controlling structures are, and is generated quickly. Power is generated by building generators, and is generated slowly. Requisition is typically spent in far greater quantities than Power, although Power is required in ever-greater amounts as the player accesses the more advanced parts of the technology tree; as a result, there is rarely enough Power to go around for everything.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a>: Much like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">tabletop game</a> the Imperial Guard and Orks focus on sending waves of bodies but does it in different ways:<ul><li> The Imperial Guard focuses on having large squads of weak guardsmen 10 strong supplemented by commissars, sanctioned psykers, and priests for extra strength. They also have specialized vehicles like the Hellhound for building destroying and Leman Russ tanks as their main vehicle attack. A single squad will be quickly torn up... but three of them can tear apart other squads and a whole army is very hard to beat on a head-on fight.</li><li> The Orks' main unit is the Slugga Boyz, weak Orks with cheap pistols as their measly ranged weapons. However, you can build specialized Boyz that destroy vehicles or provide covering fire and with the Warboss, you can summon the WAAAAGH! for a boost in your massive (as in 100 Population max) army's attack power.</li></ul></li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder6');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>The Last Stand</em>&nbsp;</div><div id="folder6" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality">Acceptable Breaks from Reality</a>: Absolutely blatant. Players can play as Hive Tyrants, Chaos Sorcerers, Ork Mekboys alongside Space Marines, Imperial Guard Generals, and Eldar Farseers. Outside of your faction announcer commenting when one of your comrades goes down, none of the characters so much as acknowledge they're working with their mortal enemies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>: Several of the playable heroes have builds that emphasize extreme mobility or damage output at the cost of survivability.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByTheirOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByTheirOwnPetard">Hoist by Their Own Petard</a>: Wave 16 of the Bloodied Colosseum is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch">Mirror Match</a> against the players' own heroes; the clones have the same stats, weapons, and abilities; they can even revive one another if not taken down quickly. Depending on matchups, this can make it nearly unbeatable, as the AI use your own superpowered abilities to take out your best heroes before you can get a shot off, oe else keep picking each other back up faster than you can kill them. Woe betide you if you have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">Lord General armed with a sniper rifle.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a>: There are two arenas, each with fixed waves of enemies. These enemies start easy, but scale up VERY quickly; new players, with limited Wargear options, likely won't survive long without help from better equipped, more skilled players; however, even for veterans the higher waves can be punishingly-difficult.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a>: The Hive Tyrant and <em>especially</em> Space Marine can be built this way; tons of health, armor, and (in the Marine's case) health regen, at the complete sacrifice of speed or mobility. The recently added Necron Lord blows them both out of the water though. With the option to build insane armor, or health regen, and the ability to self revive a short while after being killed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">Stuff Blowing Up</a>: Multiple variants, but a speciality of the Ork Mekboy. One possible build combines a knife that can teleport the player or enemies when it hits, an armor that can teleport the player or enemies when the player is hit, and an accesory that causes anything teleport to explode. Combine with an accessory to make the Mekboy immune to knockdown and the end result is multiple random teleportations followed by explosions; none of which will harm the Mekboy.</li></ul></div><hr><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">COWARDS DIE IN SHAME</a></strong>
