It is a direct sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a></em>, taking place three years after its ending.</p><p><em>Radiant Dawn</em> is divided into four parts, each starring a different main character. The first arc features Micaiah, the leader of the Dawn Brigade, in her work to liberate the country of Daein from its abuse at the hands of its post-war Begnion occupation, an act which instigates the conflict to come. Following <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Arc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Arc">arcs</a> feature Elincia, now queen of Crimea, dealing with rebellious nobles, and Ike and his mercenaries aiding the Laguz kingdoms in a war against an apparently corrupt Begnion, with the final arc bringing all the characters together in order to avert the destruction of their world.</p><p>The gameplay of <em>Radiant Dawn</em> is largely identical to its predecessor, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a></em>, using the series' standard turn-based tactical combat.

He starts the chapter on a Balista and proceeds to Crit everything he shoots at. Then, a common scenario in the chapter is that the mage near the archer will get killed by a hawk. The archer will then kill the hawk and block the ledge so laguz cannot climb while simultaneously attacking them, making him VERY useful to avoid getting overrun from both sides. Best part of all, he usually lives. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_mo9hZa9bo">Witness his unbridled wrath.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSpilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSpilling">Bag of Spilling</a>: While most returning characters return at the same relative class or promoted from the last game, two characters you likely trained in <em>PoR</em> return to being first tier in this one for the sake of it being the beginning of the game &mdash; Ilyana and Jill. Thankfully, transfer bonuses can partially rectify this if they capped any stats or weapon ranks, but Thunder magic being nerfed in this game make it an uphill climb to third tier for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyMage">Ilyana</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBattleDidntCount" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBattleDidntCount">The Battle Didn't Count</a>:<ul><li> If you manage to defeat Ike in Chapter 3-13, he merely says that you've held out longer than he expected before being informed by one of his soldiers that his forces have breached your defenses at another location.

It's the singular bridge chapter in the game, which like in <em>Path of Radiance</em> means it's full of pitfalls that force you to navigate it a certain way. Unlike the one from that game, though, the combination of pitfalls and Shine barriers means infantry units actually <em>cannot cross the bridge at all</em>. The only ones exempt from this are flying units, which means a grand total of four possible units plus Tibarn and Leanne as guests.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note03io6');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note03io6" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note03io6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There's a way to get around this; namely, you can have flying units wait on spaces you know are boobytrapped, and since two units can't occupy the same space, the infantry units can pass by them safely without triggering the pitfall&mdash;though, this still does force the issue of at least one flying unit. Note that this will <em>NOT</em> work on a trapped tile that's already been tripped.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter">Crutch Character</a>: There are several examples in this game, especially in the Dawn Brigade chapters:<ul><li> Sothe is the traditional "Jagen" of this game; he joins the Dawn Brigade in Chapter 1-2 as an already promoted unit (being in the Rogue class) with base stats way beyond the rest of the Dawn Brigade and the enemies, with him being strong enough to solo large parts of maps by himself for most of Part 1 even on Hard/Maniac difficulty, especially if supplied with forged Knives for stronger weaponry and superior 1-2 range to what everyone else can have at this point. He additionally actually has some pretty good growth rates, so while he'll gain EXP slowly he can have productive level ups to help him dominate harder in later Part 1. Come Part 3 though his low HP and Defense growths will catch up to him, where he is no longer durable and will be easily 2HKO'd by the <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Tiger Laguz</a>, but he can still be productive offensively with his access to strong 1-2 range with the aformentioned forged Knives and a Beastkiller to reliably one-round Laguz. In Part 4 however he becomes unsalvagebly bad, as in Chapter 4-P he is still a weak second tier unit who can't promote until his storyline promotion occurs after the map is completed, and then he has the worst third tier class (a Whisper) with an abysmal Strength cap and the worst mastery skill, while still being restricted to Knives (which other than the SS ranked Baselard are very weak for this point in the game). With his class limitations he'll struggle to do more than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> in Part 4 while being unable to take more than two hits, and unlike other speedy classes with low Strength, like Trueblades and Assassins, his class doesn't get any sort of crit bonus to alleviate his damage-output issues.</li><li> Tauroneo joins the Dawn Brigade in Chapter 1-6, as a prepromoted General with ridiculously high base stats for that point in the game, and for the two 1-6 maps he is pretty much a god, with barely any enemies being able to barely damage him if they can hurt him at all, while he one-rounds everything unless (or maybe even if) he is equipped with a Bronze Lance. Then the player becomes unable to deploy him for a long time, with him finally joining the battlefield again in Chapter 3-12, where while decently strong, he is no longer the untouchable god he was, and when fighting the Laguz in the next chapter he is completely unimpressive, while not being able to tank much despite being a General (or Marshall if you used one of your Master Crowns on him to get some sort of third tier unit for the brutal Part 3 DB maps and had no other decent candidates). Then for Part 4 his bases can no longer carry him at all and he would have levelled little if at all unless you fed most of the kills in 3-12 and 3-13 to him, and then if you do invest into him his growth rates are only ok and as a Marshall he'll be stuck with awful movement and a low Speed cap that will prevent him from doubling in later Part 4, so he'll never be better than mediocre by endgame.</li><li> Tormod and Maurim join the Dawn Brigade in Chapter 1-7 as a prepromoted Sage and relatively high level Tiger Laguz respectively, where Tormod is fast enough to double and ORKO most enemies in the rest of Part 1 while having enough durability to usually take at least three hits, and Maurim's stats are so high when transformed he is essentially a god that can't be damaged by any physical attacks and will ORKO everything, if he doesn't just outright kill them in one hit. After Part 1 they leave and aren't seen again until all the way in Chapter 4-4 without having gotten any stronger since, where Tormod is now hopelessly so far behind and can't hope to survive a round of combat with any enemy, and Maurim is still strong enough to deal a hard hit and has pretty good durability but will now get doubled by everything while being vulnerable to crits, so he can't endure more than a couple rounds of combat. Then right after this Chapter it's the endgame for them, where they have no hope to compete unless the player dumps a ludicrous amount of bonus EXP and stat boosters into them, and on Hard/Maniac not even that might make them remotely salvageable.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Black Knight joins the Dawn Brigade in Chapter 1-9 and is deployable in Part 1's Endgame, where unsurprisingly as a unit meant to be an endgame boss and armed with the Alondite, absolutely nothing can even damage him and he'll absoutely destroy everything that challenges him. He then comes back midway into Chapter 3-6, where even the strongest Tiger Laguz can't deal more than a single point of damage to him, if they can damage him at all.

Then when the CRK are in your control again for Chapter 3-9 he'll be your strongest unit there, but after that he disappears all the way until literally the last chapter before the Part 4 endgame, where even if you used the CRK's Master Crown to promote him into a third tier unit he'll be quite weak for this point in the game, and even if invested into his relatively poor growths and his class' low stat caps will make him no better than emergency filler for the Endgame.</li><li> In Part 2 you also got Lucia, who is in your control on Chapter 2-2 as by far your best unit and way stronger than the enemies you fight there, and then she won't be back as a playable unit until Chapter 4-2, where she is barely hanging on and way worse than your trained units at that point. As a Swordmaster/Trueblade she does have potential to be good in Part 4 and its endgame, but with her base stats being rather low for a level 14 second tier unit (Mia for example, a fellow Swordsmaster who starts 7 levels lower, has comparable bases and even better base Speed), and her growths being rather low and poorly-distributed (including an outright bad 25% Strength growth and abysmal 15% Defense growth), she is significantly worse than all the other potential Trueblades you can have and will require a lot more effort to bring her up to speed.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax">Cutscene Power to the Max</a>: Kurthnaga forces a ceasefire by virtue of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonofMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonofMassDestruction">as large as a castle and blowing it up</a>. When he gets on the battlefield in the next chapter however, you find out he's only around Level 20 (halfway to his max), his accuracy is subpar, he's incredibly slow, and he doesn't even hit that hard; your trained up units at this point would be able to easily take multiple hits from a dragon whose breath is supposed to be strong enough to blow up a castle tower.

When the Laguz Alliance goes to war against the Begnion Empire, their only strategy is "run up to them and claw their faces off until we win the war because we're stronger." Ranulf is the only one who realizes that not only does Begnion outnumber them, but they have equipment, training, fortifications, and most importantly the strategic expertise necessary to stomp them into the ground. It's for this reason that he hires the Greil Mercenaries and especially the strategist Soren to even the odds, and it's still not enough because Skrimir, the dumbass in charge, disobeys Soren's plans and sends the whole war effort into the gutters.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat">Dump Stat</a>: Stats are not of equal value in Radiant Dawn, with some being of particularly far less value, and units whose base stats and growth distribution favor these stats tend to end up performing much worse on average.<ul><li> Obviously Magic for any physical unit, but even moreso with the fact that no magical weapons exist in Radiant Dawn and there is no reclassing to potentially utilize it by turning them into a magical class. So the only time Magic can come into play for a physical unit is using the Imbue skill (which restores a physical unit's HP by an amount equivalent to their Magic each turn, and there's only two Imbue scrolls obtainable in RD), and when attacking with Magic cards (which are pretty much a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell">Useless Useful Spell</a> when 99% of the time you'll deal more damage by attacking normally). For magical units Strength is pretty useless too, though there are a couple instances where a magical unit's Strength is so low that they get slowed down by their Tomes, which is particularly a problem for Sanaki.</li><li> Besides Magic for physical units and Strength for magical units, Luck is generally considered the least useful stat. What Luck does is for each point in Luck your unit gains a point in their avoidance, hitrate, and crit avoidance, as well as help activate certain skills more frequently. However this boost is pretty meager and makes a point in Luck much less useful than a point in other stats, and there's only two skills in the game that have an activation rate based on Luck (Shreik and Miracle, both of which are a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSkill">Useless Useful Skill</a>). Additionally unlike other stats, each class line's stat cap for Luck is set at a static cap for each tier in the class line, so as a result first and second tier units will have a Luck cap of 30 or higher and will not get more Luck on promotion. Why is this bad? It means units with high Luck as one of their strengths won't realistically be able to cap Luck in their first and second tier classes, and will take a while to cap it in their third tier class, so they then can't use BEXP as effectively to increase their weaker stats after their stronger stats have capped when they're stuck waiting so long for Luck to cap. Also for Laguz, Luck does not double when they transform, farther decreasing the impact of Luck for them. The only time low Luck is considered a problem is when it's so low that a unit faces a crit rate from enemies with no crit-boosting weapons and abilities (such as with Aran, which is one of the reasons he is considered a pretty poor unit), however this is an uncommon problem as it doesn't take much Luck to completely avoid this.</li><li> Resistance in theory should be useful, as each point of Resistance results in one less damage taken from Magic, but in practice is of far less value than other stats for the vast majority of the game, as the Mage and Priest class lines are really underpowered in Radiant Dawn, with them being the easiest enemies to kill with their paper durability and terrible Speed, and when Tomes are so weak relative to physical weapons that they can't even hit you that hard even if your Resistance is low. Plus Mages are uncommon relative to physical units and Priests are more often stuck healing, if they have access to a Tome at all. However this changes for the Part 4 Endgame, where there are actually threatening magical units, and the final two chapters have exclusively enemies that attack with magic, making it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless">Not Completely Useless</a> at this point of the game and a serious consideration for which units you take with you into the Tower.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyGameHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyGameHell">Early Game Hell</a>: The early levels of the game are surprisingly difficult compared to other games on the series. Each level gives only one or two new units, theres no option to buy new weapons for several levels straight, and you lack a healer for roughly four levels. It's easy to make a mistake and lose a unit, especially if you picked "Normal" in the Western version, unaware that you were actually playing Hard as a result of a translation error. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">It's justified</a> though, as your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagTagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagTagBunchOfMisfits">Rag Tag Bunch Of Misfits</a> is trying to squeeze by a huge occupying army, but from a gameplay perspective, it's quite a shock if you didn't play <em>Path of Radiance</em> first.

Fiona is also noted to be one of the worst units of the game. Astrid and Makalov both have speed, but not enough power behind their attacks nor durability to survive many, and Fiona simply has incredibly low base stats that make her a liability unless mass amounts of effort are put in to correct this.</li><li> Mages were nerfed considerably. The gap in power with physical weapons is wider, and there are now a lot of physical 1-2 range options, which are thus no longer exclusive to them. Worse still, Sages have very low speed caps in comparison to their previous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> stats.

Meteor, Blizzard, Bolting, Purge, and Fenrir won't deal very much damage at all even assuming the enemy doesn't have a good Resistance stat, and that fact only worsens given that mages, as stated above, usually aren't fast enough to double. All of this makes it feel far too useless to justify only getting five uses out of each tome.</li><li> The laguz units outside of the royals just plain suck. In the previous game, they couldn't fight back in their human forms but they at least had decent base stats to survive attacks. In this game, they can counterattack in human form, but that's the only buff they got. Now, their stats double upon transformation, meaning their stats are absolute garbage in human form to make sure they won't be too powerful in animal form. Even the overpowered royals will die like chumps if they're attacked untransformed. And since stat gains upon level up are doubled when they transform, their growth rates and experience gains are next to nothing to make sure they won't outpace beorc units as compensation. This means there isn't much reason to use any laguz units outside of the royals because they'll stay exactly as you got them all the way to end of the game, unless you pump Bonus EXP and force those stat growths.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralityBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralityBacklash">Neutrality Backlash</a>: Dragon King Dheginsea stubbornly tries to have the country of Goldoa remain neutral for 1,000 years <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to satisfy the terms of the covenant with the goddess Ashera</span>.

The heroes were overjoyed and thought this would be sign of improving relations between the two races, but when the child came out looking like an ordinary beorc and Lehran lost his powers following the child's birth, they panicked. Fearing that the laguz would take this as an attempt by the beorc to breed them out of existence, they covered up Lehran and Altina's marriage, the child's true parentage, and then declared unions between beorc and laguz to be a crime against Ashera. It was only later that the brand appeared on the child, along with the unusual powers typical of Branded. Since then, divisions between the two races only intensified, the Branded suffer from discrimination under false pretenses, and the Apostle Misaha, descendant of Lehran and Altina, was assassinated when she tried to reveal her true heritage to the world, sparking the Serenes Massacre, Lehran's fall into despair, and the war between the Laguz Alliance and the Begnion Empire.

It activates on half his Skill stat, so he always has a fixed 20% chance to absolutely kill anything multiple times over.

International versions made it so you can promote by just levelling up a level 20 second tier unit like you can to promote a first tier unit, so your potential third tier units are not limited by the amount of Crowns you have (though the two hidden Crowns were removed to counterbalance this change). This is especially appreciable if you're playing below Hard/Maniac difficulty, where you'll get plenty enough experience to easily promote more units than there are Crowns available.</li><li> To create forges in the original Japanese version, in addition to money to buy the forge you also need 50 "Forging Points" of the desired weapon type to create a forged weapon, of which you obtain by selling weapons (with the amount of points you get being based on the rank of the weapon you sold and going towards the type of weapon you sold).

The international releases buffed their starting level up to 4 and raised their base stats accordingly, raising all their base stats by 1 to 2 points. Edward, Leonardo, and Nolan additionally get a very powerful exclusive weapon in chapter 3-6 (the Caladbolg, Lughnasadh, and Tarvos respectively), significantly helping all three and making the notorious Part 3 Dawn Brigade chapters bit more manageable.</li><li> In the original Japanese version, the Wrath skill (which raised your critical hit chance by 50 points) required your unit to have 20% or less of their health to activate, and then still only had a chance to activate based on your unit's Skill, making it pretty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>.

Once the desert finds itself penetrated, he goes to Gallia and spills everything to Caineghis, who declares war on Begnion. Arguably a blessing in disguise, though, as without this information Lekain and his accomplices would've escaped justice.</li><li> Later on, it's implied ever-so-slightly that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kurthnaga and Ena violating Goldoa's neutrality laws</span> was the exact moment the Dark God was destined to be released, as only then was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">ALL of Tellius at war</a>.<ul><li> This is actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">inverted as the &#147;Dark God&#148; is not the one bringing about judgement</span>.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell">Useless Useful Spell</a>: There are plenty of skills and other abilities that are of very niche use at best in Radiant Dawn.<ul><li> Guard in theory should be very useful, as if you support a particularly frail unit with a very durable one, you could keep them on the front lines as the more durable unit takes any attacks aimed at the frailer unit. However it only has a chance to activate, a chance that still isn't even particularly great with an A rank support, and as such you can't ever actually rely on it to keep a frail unit on the frontlines safe, meaning the skill will end up going to waste as you can't ever leave those frail units open to attack anyway as banking their life on the chance of Guard randomly activating is sure to get them killed.</li><li> Similarly there's Miracle, which has a random chance equivalent to a unit's Luck to reduce any fatal hit to half damage instead (and if they had 1 HP left, then reduce the hit to no damage). Again in theory it sounds useful, especially in a game with permadeath, but proper strategy would entail avoiding putting a unit in a position where they could get killed at all, and Miracle will never have great odds of activating so it's not valuable as a "failsafe" either.</li><li> Discipline, a skill that doubles the rate of weapon EXP gain for Beorc units. It works as advertised, but problem is weapon ranks don't really matter in Radiant Dawn as the vast majority of units start with high enough weapon ranks to use what they need to, and there is no additional bonuses for getting higher weapon ranks, while weapon ranks will increase fast anyway. And Laguz can't use it, whose Strike rank actually matters and is a pain to increase. Its only real use is to get Micaiah to B rank Light tomes in time for 3-13 if you want to use Purge there, as otherwise she has a difficult time reaching it through typical usage, but Micaiah will probably be spending most of the time healing with Physic there anyway regardless of if she can use Purge.</li><li> Blossom, which when a unit has the skill equipped, whenever they level up they'll get a second chance at proccing a gain in each stat they failed to increase, at the expense of having their EXP gain cut in half. The problem with Blossom is your unit essentially getting half the level ups they would normally get is going to leave your units worse off than getting a couple more stat points with each level up will, and because of how levelling up with BEXP works you'll be able to reliably improve a unit's straggling stats anyway once they cap a couple stats, which you'll also want a unit levelling up as fast as they can to take advantage of sooner. The only possible practical use of Blossom is with high levelled Laguz units, as they're getting very little EXP with each kill anyway before Part 4 and often will only get a single point of EXP, especially on Hard/Maniac difficulty, so if you want to level them up you'll be relying on BEXP, where then you can BEXP them up to 99 EXP before a map and have them level up with Blossom upon any single instance of combat, which can especially help with how low Laguz's non-HP and non-Luck growths are.</li><li> Flourish, a skill that reduces your unit's attack power in half on command. In theory you can have a stronger unit use it to leave an enemy weakened for a weaker unit to kill, thus helping you train up a weaker unit, but if you really want to do this you can just have the stronger unit use a weaker weapon instead and save the skill capacity for something that will actually help out.</li><li> Similarly there's Mercy, an exclusive skill for Elincia that always leaves enemies with 1 HP when dealt a fatal blow and prevents her from killing them. This is even worse than Flourish, as it's always active instead of being activated on command, and when Elincia gets this skill in Part 4 she is quite underlevelled for this point in the game, so if you intend to use her she really needs the EXP and is not at all the sort of character you want leaving enemies alive for others. Then if you really don't want to use Elincia at all you can just have her staffbot and avoid fighting, while if you ever do need her to fight it's better to keep the option open for her to take out an immediate threat rather than be left with a unit that cannot kill enemies at all.</li><li> Nailah's exclusive Glare, a skill that can be activated on command instead of attacking, where she has a random chance equivalent to half her Skill to permanently stun an enemy. However this has a very low chance to actually work and pretty much every time Nailah can just outright kill the enemy instead, especially in Part 1 where absolutely nothing can survive a round with her. The only actual use for Glare is for "priest abuse", where Nailah can petrify a Priest and then any unit you want to train up can beat up on the petrified Priest for EXP, while the Priest's staff heals them up each turn and the +10 to their Defense from being petrified will help prevent you from killig the Priest prematurely. Such tedious grinding though will never be remotely necessary for beating the game.</li><li> Howl, Quickclaw, Shriek, and Maelstrom, all Laguz-exclusive skills that can activate when they're attacked at 2-range. Each of them have a random chance to activate that will never be particularly high and usually you'll want to avoid leaving Laguz in range of 2-range enemies whenever possible, and if these skills activate they won't have that useful of an effect anyway (Howl might occasionally be useful by leaving the enemy stunned for a turn, allowing you to attack them on Player Phase without retaliation, but then Quickclaw and Maelstrom just deal a bit of damage, and Shriek just reduces the enemy's Luck to 0 for a turn). Overall they're better than nothing and Laguz have such huge skill capacities that you're unlikely to actually fill up, so you might as well use these skills anyway, but they're no remote substitute for Laguz's lack of 2-range retaliation.</li><li> Herons actually have more Galdrars beyond Vigor upon reaching certain level requirements, but you'll probably never use any of the non-Vigor Galdrars in most playthroughs; there's Bliss and Sorrow at level 15, Valor at level 30, and Recovery at level 40. First Bliss, which raises a unit's biorhythm to best, and Sorrow, which lowers an enemy's biorhythm to worst, will pretty much never be more useful than giving one to four of your units another turn. Then Valor raises a Laguz's transformation meter to its max and Recovery will fully heal a unit alongside restoring any status condition, but you'll never reach the levels to get them without dumping a load of BEXP on one of your Herons, as Galdrar only gives 10 EXP per use and Herons can never fight without magic cards. Then even if you do get them you'll rarely if ever want to use them instead of Vigor, as for Valor by the time you could get it you're either just using Laguz Royals that don't care about transformation gauges or have plentiful items to get your Laguz transformed without the aid of Valor, and with Recovery if you ever need to heal more units in a turn than your healers can manage, you can just Vigor a healer alongside other units, thus getting the healing you need while still getting other units an extra turn.</li><li> The magic card items, which allow a physical unit to attack with magic. Problem is 99% of the time you'll be dealing much more damage by just attacking normally, and in instances where a unit is dealing very little damage physically, they still won't be dealing meaningful damage with a magic card since enemies have actual decent Resistance in Radiant Dawn. Their only real noteworthy use is that they can allow Ike to safely attack the Black Knight in Chapter 3-7 to fulfill that requirement to recruit Lehran at the end of the game, as enemies can't counter when you attack with a card and thus Ike can survive a battle with the Black Knight regardless of his stats. There's also the gimmick of magic cards being the only way for Herons to attack, but this is never remotely practical when your Heron can just Vigor your actual combat units to take out the enemy instead.</li><li> Unique to this game in the series, Staves are equipped when used, and when a Staff user is attacked they'll counterattack with the Staff. They additionally have ludicrous crit rates, including the SS-ranked Staves having 100 crit, essentially guaranteeing a critical hit. Some Staves even give some stat bonuses too. However since all Staves have 0 Might and pretty much every Staff user bar Elincia will have super low Strength, they'll tink for no damage the vast majority of the time regardless of if they crit and will be negligible damage otherwise, making this ability pretty pointless and even a detriment to promoted Staff-using units that are capable of using proper weapons.</li><li> Mastery skill's secondary effects is very rare to see because mastery skills can already kill the enemy with the skills additional damage. Don't expect Deadeye or Stun to show its effect to sleep and stun, respectively, in the field when the enemy is already dead from their boosted power.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Utopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Utopia">Utopia</a>: The nation of Hatari ruled by Queen Nailah, on the other side of the Desert of Death east of Daein.

There, racism is a thing of the past as the beorc and wolf laguz live together peacefully and even have Branded children on rare occasions, who are not persecuted for their mere existence.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall">Villain Ball</a>: Lots of them:<ul><li> Jarod suffers lots of them, mostly to stop the audience from developing too much sympathy or respect for him, to the point that this occasionally leads to rather bipolar behaviour (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen">he expresses his pride in his subordinates</a> and in the next moment he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">stabs them</a>). The most obvious example is him demolishing the capital of Daein (and killing lots of (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMillionIsAStatistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMillionIsAStatistic">unnamed and story-wise irrelevant</a>) innocent civilians in the process) for no explained reason, after Micaiah and the Black Knight let him escape, probably because said mission made him rather sympathetic, and he was required to be killed as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss">Disc-One Final Boss</a> in the next one.</li><li> Although Ludveck is more cunning than most <em>Fire Emblem</em> antagonists, he too lapses into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil">Stupid Evil</a> by the end of his arc. His last trump card, have his men threaten Lucia, should Elincia not consent to his demands, is very cleverly played. Not so smart is his order to have her really killed, after Elincia (after some thought) decides that as a Queen, she cannot meet said demands for personal reasons. Not only does he lose his only bargaining chip in the process, he gives Elincia and her followers additional reasons to hate him and have him killed.</li><li> The most blatant and hotly debated case however is the one of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">King Dheginsea</span>, whose reasons for opposing the protagonists make little to no sense in the eyes of most players. Suffice to say, he'd be <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

If you do this, instead of Oliver attacking your unit like an enemy will do any other time, Oliver will instead run up to him, talk to him, and then join your side on his own initiative. Also serves as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>, because who in their right mind would intentionally put such a fragile Heron in the attack range of any enemy, let alone a boss?</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaterSourceTampering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaterSourceTampering">Water Source Tampering</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">Defied</a>.

Rather than point out the questionable ethics involved, she explains that people would <em>see</em> it as a questionable act, and start to question their motives, maybe turn against them. More importantly, the base is a prison camp they are attempting to liberate for manpower, and this would hit the prisoners as well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a>: Who could have expected the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Black Knight</span>, of all people, to come to your aid at the most unexpected time?<div class="indent">"Be at ease, Maiden.
