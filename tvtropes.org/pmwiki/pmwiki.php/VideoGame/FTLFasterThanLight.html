The objective is to deliver important information to the remains of the Federation fleet in a distant sector. Unfortunately, as those familiar with Roguelikes will suspect, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">far, FAR from easy</a>: the galaxy is an extremely dangerous place for a lone vessel, filled with dangers such as pirates, deadly environmental hazards, rebel scouts, hostile alien races, and others. Not to mention that the vast rebel fleet is in hot pursuit...</p><p><em>FTL</em>'s gameplay involves the player's ship "jumping" between waypoints in a randomly generated galaxy, most of them containing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEvent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEvent">Random Event</a>. The main game interface is a cross-section view of your ship, showing the layout of rooms filled with crewmen and various ship systems (helm, engines, shields, weapons, etc). During combat, the player must juggle various aspects of the ship &#151; from crew assignments to power allocation and weapons targeting. Certain systems gain bonuses from being manned, but you may need those crew members to repair damaged systems, repel boarders, or simply evacuate dangerous areas. Meanwhile, all ship systems need power to function, but your ship's reactor may not be able to supply them all at once, leaving the player to decide which are most important at any given time. Along the way, you'll collect scrap, the game's currency, and use it to upgrade your ship's systems, get repairs, and purchase things like fuel and &#151; if you're lucky &#151; some fancier things like new weaponry or whole new systems such as cloaking devices and teleporters.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p><em>FTL</em> was officially released for purchase from the developers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam">Steam</a>, and GOG.com on September 14th, 2012, although early beta access was granted to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Kickstarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Kickstarter">Kickstarter</a> backers. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/64409699/ftl-faster-than-light">It is one of the first completed games spawned from a completed Kickstarter.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></p><p>In November 2013, the developers announced <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.ftlgame.com/?p=598">FTL: Advanced Edition<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, a free <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Pack</a> that adds new equipment, events, weapons, ships (for both the player and enemies), and various other goodies, as well as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IOSGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IOSGames">iPad</a> port.

Assuming that a ship's weapon systems are upgraded so that it can power several weapons simultaneously, carefully timing their shots such that they happen closely together in a tight salvo can knock out shields, overwhelm defense drones, and leave the enemy crew dealing with more damage control at once than it can comfortably handle. This is also a necessary tactic to employ beam weapons, which usually have little-to-no ability to penetrate shields. The Weapon Pre-igniter ship augment lets you launch one the moment a battle starts, and there's an achievement for using it to blow up an enemy ship with the first volley. Your enemies will rarely do this, since they normally fire each weapon the moment it is charged, even if waiting for the rest of their weapons to charge would be a lot more effective. However, cloaked enemy ships will sometimes charge all their weapons and hold their fire while cloaking, so that when they uncloak, they release a barrage of fire.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmostOutOfOxygen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmostOutOfOxygen">Almost Out of Oxygen</a>: It could happen to you, or to the enemies, if someone's oxygen generator gets busted.

The tradeoff is that shields will mitigate beam damage, up to and including outright blocking damage if the beam's power is less than or equal to the number of layers the shield has.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>: Averted &#151; you can find reasonable and friendly members of all races. Even some of the rebels aren't too happy with the situation and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">are just following orders</a>. Perhaps the closest you get are the telepathic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConMan">Con Man</a> Slugs, who were shunned in the Federation because of their incessant exploitative antics. Even then, individual Slugs may work for the Federation regardless and you do come across the occasional trustworthy one.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">Anti-Frustration Features</a>: As hard as the game is, it does have a few features that prevent it from getting really bad.<ul><li> Your teleport and FTL drive charge instantly when you're not in battle. This can help avoid situations like your crew burning to death or suffocating in an otherwise empty ship, as well as sparing you the wait to bring your crew back or charge your engines if you defeated the enemy quickly. The exception is levels with environmental hazards like asteroids or solar flares, but even in those, your FTL drive will charge at an increased rate after the battle.</li><li> When preparing to jump away with your crew still on board the enemy ship, the game will ask "Are you <em>sure</em> you want to jump away? Your crew is still on the enemy ship!"</li><li> Once a ship is considered defeated by surrender or crew death, any and all weapons you might have fired at them prior will automatically miss. This keeps you from accidentally killing your crew with a stray shot when you've already won. The same doesn't hold true in reverse, though.</li><li> If your teleporter gets knocked out while your entire crew is on board the enemy ship, and you defeat the enemy crew, your crew will take a shuttle back to your ship to prevent an unwinnable state.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiGrinding">Anti-Grinding</a>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvancingWallOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvancingWallOfDoom">Rebel Fleet</a> forces you to go to the further, more difficult sectors, even if there are unexplored places in the current sector. If you jump to a node that the Rebels have either reached or completely taken over, you'll be faced with a ship that's disproportionately powerful for the sector, and defeating it only yields one unit of fuel to jump to the next node. There are no other rewards of any kind, except in specific circumstances (if you have no fuel, for example, you'll usually get several for winning). The best you can do is maximize the time you spend in any one sector through careful jump selection. <em>Advanced Edition</em> further upped the ante by adding a shield-piercing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> that even goes through Zoltan shields, causing three damage and a hull breach, which regularly fires on your ship if the Rebels have secured that node.

This extends to specialized systems like hacking, teleportation, and mind control.</li><li> Enemy ships will deploy their cloaks as soon as they recharge. This allows the player to know precisely when they'll use the cloak and plan accordingly. The same applies to the hacking and mind control systems.</li><li> Enemy crew members follow a specific pattern when dealing with threats, which makes manipulating their behavior incredibly simple:<ul><li> On their ships, they will run to their medbay as soon as their health starts to get low, and will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">fight an unstoppable boarding party to the death if it's full</a>.</li><li> They will prioritize the protection/repair of shields and weapons, occasionally even forsaking defending other systems to repair them. The former system is the absolute highest priority, allowing you to draw them away from other systems by having your crew attack it or damaging it with weapons.</li><li> They won't cease attacking a blast door once they've begun attacking it, even if another door is opened in the same room.</li><li> They will immediately retreat from any airless room. While sensible, this makes it trivially easy to herd a boarding party into your medbay, where they are guaranteed to lose.

Other drones can defend against incoming fire (especially missiles), repair damaged systems, repair your ship's hull, repel boarders, or be sent over to board the enemy.

II Defense Drone fires faster than the Mk. I and can shoot down any kind of incoming projectile, including laser bursts and ion blasts, not just missiles and boarding drones like the Mk. I. However, like all drones, it's computer-controlled and has no threat priority system, meaning it will often prioritize a closer, weak laser over the more dangerous missile that will go right through your shielding. It also requires four bars of power to operate, compared to two for the more reliable Mk. I. It's good, just not as good in practice as it is on paper. <em>Advanced Edition</em> reduced the power consumption by one bar and made it slightly faster, but it still falls short of the Mk. 1.</li><li> Almost any weapon that costs four bars of reactor power to use, and even some that cost three. They are very easy to disable, since they're power hogs, and often have prohibitively long charge times.

A sleek, shiny vessel, it sacrifices the engine power, the Titanium Systems Casing augmentation, and the weak but efficient combo of a Mini Beam and Dual Lasers used by the Type A for a Glaive Beam and level 2 cloak. The Glaive Beam is rightfully considered to be the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity Plus One Beam</a>, as its damage per shot is the greatest in the game; its obscene damage output can often kill pretty much any ship in the first sector (as well as the second and third). However, it takes so outrageously long to charge that they're practically guaranteed to get at least one clear shot off before that happens, even if you time your cloak perfectly. If that shot hits your weapons room and you haven't upgraded it (and you likely haven&#146;t if you're saving your scrap to buy a shield system), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog">your Glaive Beam goes offline and you have to start charging it all over again</a>.

It does have one very important use, though; at level 2, the teleporter recharges fast enough to beam your crew into and back out of a completely depressurized room without killing them (they have to have 100 health, and will just barely survive with ~10 health if not otherwise damaged), making teleportation a viable strategy against drone ships as long as you don't accidentally send in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Zoltan</a>.</li><li> An upgraded medbay allows for many "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">blue choices</a>" to appear during numerous random events, enabling the player to obtain better outcomes regardless of whether the medbay is powered or not. Upgrading the medbay also allows the healing to outpace the health drain caused by oxygen deprivation.</li><li> The Burst Laser series. A gun that fires 2, 3, or 5 single-damage shots may not sound exciting compared to the bigger guns and missiles, but it doesn't need ammo and chews through shields better than anything short of a missile aimed at the shield generator or a fully warmed-up Chain Vulcan. The Burst II model is especially practical, using the same amount of power as Burst I to fire three lasers instead of two. With 4 Burst Laser II's, you can output <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">More Dakka</a> than the freaking <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Rebel Flagship</a></em> <strong>using its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Power Surge</a></strong> (though this veers into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> by requiring 8 bars of power and actually finding and equipping 4 Burst Laser Mark II's, leaving no room to use other weapons).</li><li> The best way to level up your crew is to find or create a battle where the enemy's weapons cannot penetrate your shields and leave the game running for by itself while you go do other things and your crew gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatGrinding">some no-risk training</a>.</li><li> The A-layout Kestrel's starting missile launcher, the Artemis<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4s2k4');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4s2k4" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4s2k4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">also equipped on the Rock Cruiser A and Slug Cruiser B</span>, will be a mainstay in your arsenal, even as you get lasers that chop through hulls and bombs of radiation. It only uses one bar of power but deals two damage per shot, and still has the shield-piercing capabilities of every other missile in the game. The same is true of the Leto missile on the Federation B; a weak, one-bar missile that, while only dealing one damage per shot, is every bit as capable of piercing shields as any other missile.</li><li> The Ion Bomb is this. It does nothing more than disable an enemy system, expending a missile to do so. However, as a consequence, it does its task with such reliability, bypassing shields and defense drones, and at such relatively low cost in terms of ship power (requiring only 1) that as long as you can feed it, it can serve even better than an Ion energy weapon. It helps that it's by far the strongest ion-damage weapon in the game, at a whopping 4 ion damage; that is <strong>20 seconds</strong> of system lockdown, matched only by a fully warmed-up Chain Ion (which requires 3 power). The Ion Bomb can't quite manage to accumulate ion damage on a system by itself (it has a charge-up time of 22 seconds, slightly longer than the time required for 4 ion damage to wear off), but the ability to immediately remove 4 bars of power from any system means that any system except drones, weapons, shields, and engines can be entirely shut off in one blast, regardless of strength, and those other four can be <em>severely</em> weakened.</li><li> Boarding Drones (or Lanius boarders) against AI-run Auto-Scouts, especially for ships that don't start with any real weapons, like the Mantis Cruiser Type B. They will slowly but surely kill every system on the ship, doing one point of damage every time they take the system down, until the ship itself blows up after losing its last hull point. This doesn't work on the scout's larger Auto-Assault cousins, though, which are compartmentalized and thus prevent boarding drones from being able to move around within them. To beat those, you need to have a level 2 teleporter so your crew can get in and out without dying, leaving the drone to deal the final blow.</li><li> Basic lasers are dull, firing only a single laser beam and doing a relatively pitiful one damage on a hit. However, the Kestrel's B-type layout, the Red Tail, comes with <em>four of them</em>, which, combined with their single power requirement and a decently trained weapons officer<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5pj70');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5pj70" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5pj70');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">and with four weapons with only 10 seconds' charging time firing per salvo, that training will happen quickly</span>, will chew through anything with two or less shields. It's only when enemies start getting three shields that you need to seriously consider upgrading (by that point, enemies will have engines powerful enough to reliably dodge at least one of your shots from almost every salvo).</li><li> The Scrap Recovery Arm boosts your scrap collection by 10%. Doesn't seem like much, but the scrap bonuses add up over time, and it's much more pronounced in later sectors when defeated ships dole out more scrap. If you somehow manage to pick up a second SRA, the boost stacks up. Having one also adds a blue option to a relatively common event, resulting in a nice pile of scrap if you happen to get it. Although benefits are less on harder difficulties, where you gain less scrap to begin with.</li><li> Hull Repair Drones don't do anything exciting and spend most of the time stashed away in storage. But they can save your life if your ship is starting to break apart from all the accumulated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> and there's no store in sight. They are especially useful for healing in between the three phases of the final boss fight. They also help you save scrap you'd pay for repairs, if you have more drone parts than you need.</li><li> The Drone Recovery Arm augmentation, which recovers unused drones upon jumping away from a beacon, can save you scrap needed for vital equipment or repairs. It also works well with the aforementioned Hull Repair Drone; as the Hull Repair drone repairs between 3-5 hull pieces before being expended, if you warp out before it has vanished, you will get that drone part back automatically, repairing your ship without any expenditure of resources.</li><li> The Backup Battery adds two or four extra power bars for 30 seconds. That's it. But there will be <em>so</em> many times you <em>need</em> that extra power.</li><li> On many ships you will usually end up with exactly one combination of weapons and systems which can pierce high level shields, so you will find yourself using the exact same strategy for every fight for a large stretch of the game.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossDissonance">Boss Dissonance</a>: Not that the game itself isn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">quite a challenge already</a>, but the Rebel Flagship as the final boss has the game throw literally everything it has at you.

Green sectors (Civilian, Engi, and Zoltan) tend to have more friendly and non-combat encounters and are a low-risk choice, while red sectors (Rock, Rebel, Mantis, Pirate-Controlled, and Abandoned) have more combat encounters and dangerous enemies, but can potentially provide you with more scrap thanks to the numerous battles. Purple sectors, fittingly ambiguous compared to the normal danger level spectrum, are reserved for nebula sectors &#151; Slug and Uncharted &#151; in which fleet pursuit is slowed and rebel ASBs cannot shoot you should you be overtaken, but where you often lose system functionality.</li><li> Each race or faction has a distinct color scheme for their ships. Their Type A playable cruisers all follow their faction's standard color scheme, while their Type B cruisers have unique liveries.

Additionally, they can even mind control your crew while your ship is cloaked.</li><li> One specific event begins by having you face off against an ordinary-looking enemy ship, like many other enemy encounter beacons.

If you fail to do so, you lose out on any scrap reward from the ship, and will have to accept a quest to pursue it instead, which leads you to a fight against an even stronger enemy ship.

The Engi Cruiser Type B starts with just one Engi, with drones picking up the slack for defense and repair until you can get more crew. Operating with only one crew member is extremely sub-optimal, though, as you don't get bonuses for manning systems, you can't repair systems or fight off boarders effectively, boarding enemy ships is out of the question, and if anything happens to your one crew member, you lose the game. AI-controlled enemy ships (including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Rebel Flagship after losing its crew</span>) don't need crew and hence can only be defeated through hull destruction. They can automatically repair their systems, all their rooms are depressurized, and they don't need a pilot to dodge or charge their FTL drive. Their one weakness is that they cannot repair hull breaches, which, due to the way repairing works, means they can never repair a system if there's a breach in the room.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialisation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialisation">Crippling Overspecialisation</a>: Many ships start out this way. Worse, those which start out with a critical system missing or "weak" need to pay a high premium to upgrade it to the normal starting level. To list them off:<ul><li> The Type B Stealth Ship can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> most enemies in the early sectors thanks to its Glaive Beam. That is, if you can keep the beam online for its 22.5-second charge time (enough time for many other weapons to fire at least twice) with no shields, low-level engines, and only a 10-second cloak offering any real protection.</li><li> On the other side of the spectrum, the Type B Mantis Cruiser has only two crew, two drone slots, and no starting weapons. However, it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">comes with powerful shields</a>, a four-person teleporter room, and is crewed by Mantises, who are the masters of hand-to-hand combat. They can make short work of most any ship by boarding it. If you wind up against a drone ship, however, you either have to wait for the boarding drone to slowly break and re-break all of the robot ship's modules, or just escape. Also, until you get a weapon or happen upon the Zoltan Shield Bypass augment, you are impotent against anything with a Zoltan shield.</li><li> The Rock Cruiser Type A has two missile weapons only. They are powerful and can take out a lot of ships in only 2 or 3 hits, but if you run out of missiles, you can't hurt the enemy at all. An enemy with a Zoltan Shield or Defence Drones will often cost as much cash in new missiles to blow up as you get in scrap for killing it. The Slug Cruiser Type B has this problem even worse; not only does it only have missile-based weaponry, but it also lacks a medbay at the start, so healing your crew after a boarding operation requires the use of ammo-consuming Healing Bursts which might miss entirely.</li><li> The Engi Cruiser Type A starts with an Ion Blast II and a Combat Drone. If you can't keep the enemy shields permanently stunned with the Ion, the Combat Drone, your only source of damage, will uselessly shoot at the enemy shields, since it can only shoot one one-damage laser at a time and shields recharge faster than it can fire. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7ff18');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note7ff18" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7ff18');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Ion Blast II does fire faster than ion damage wears off, so it can eventually shut off any number of shields... but it will take a <em>long</em> time to get through 3 or 4 layers, and if any shots miss, it will provide a window for some ion damage to wear off, and it will take even <em>longer</em> to replace the lost momentum.</span> Anti-Drones will also take out your combat drone, leaving you with just an Ion Blast II that can't do hull damage and can only occasionally disable the anti-drone. Because of this, it's imperative that you find a missile weapon or other support weapon or drone as soon as possible.</li><li> The Crystal B begins with only a 4-man teleport and 3 Crystal crewmen.</li><li> The Type C Stealth Cruiser takes this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> by sacrificing the cloaking system for a more power-efficient Zoltan overshield generator drone that can block beams and bombs; with this ship, emphasis is more on "Crippling" than "Specialized".</li><li> The Mantis Type C and Crystal Type B are perhaps even more specialized than the Mantis Type B. An extra crewman on both means you won't have to leave your ship empty (or can send an even bigger party). But they both lack the extra shields and the drone system (which was the only weapon against airless auto-scouts). Mantis C trades them for weapons that can't damage hull but make boarders even more effective, while Crystal B trades them for a cloaking system.</li><li> The Type B Zoltan Cruiser starts with powerful weapons, but no normal shield underneath its non-recharging Zoltan Shield. Prolonged fights will leave you defenseless, and asteroids or combat drones will tear through your shield (and hull) before you can hope to respond.</li><li> The Type C Zoltan Cruiser has a power-hungry arsenal but a near-useless reactor, instead relying on its Zoltan crew and a 30-second battery. Boarders, repairs, or fires that require you to move anyone from their post will force you to shut down systems, and if your drone doesn't kill the enemy in 30 seconds you'll have to shut off your engines, ion gun and oxygen to keep the drone and shield online.</li><li> The Type B Rock Cruiser has no airlocks (and can't gain any later) and it starts with no door control system. Your only defense against boarders or fires is for your rock crewmen to slowly walk over there and deal with it in person. If you're lucky an enemy shot will breach the hull in an unimportant room to give you an impromptu "airlock", but you'll still have to buy an expensive door system to use it.</li><li> Less severe than most of the above, but the Type A Slug Cruiser has no sensors. Your slugs can tell where enemies are and see into adjacent rooms, but you'll have to search your ship for fires and hull breaches manually.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure">Critical Existence Failure</a>: Applies to crew; at 0 hit points, they go from alive to "dying" to dead in about a second. Also, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">hull integrity</a> is measured separately from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubsystemDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubsystemDamage">Subsystem Damage</a>, it's quite possible for a fully-functional ship to explode thanks to a stray shot.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelMercy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelMercy">Cruel Mercy</a>: When you damage an enemy's hull enough, they'll usually offer to give you some scrap and other resources as long as you stop shooting at them. In most cases, they'll survive, but if you've damaged their oxygen system, they'll die if they can't repair it, meaning you've basically doomed them anyway. A similar thing can happen if you've destroyed their doors system and set a large amount of their ship on fire, usually resulting in them burning to death slowly but surely, or their ship spontaneously exploding after you've accepted their surrender. Of course, these things can happen to you just as easily.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter">Crutch Character</a>: Many ships' early loadouts can become this once enemies become too strong for them to deal damage. On a broader level, the Engi A is often one of the first ships players unlock, simply by reaching Sector 5 with any Kestrel ship. Its typical gameplay &mdash; set your Ion Blast to auto-fire, and allow your combat drone to do all the work of attacking &mdash; requires little active input from the player. This playstyle will backfire when using later ships that require much more micromanagement.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalPrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalPrison">Crystal Prison</a>: The Crystalmen get a variant of this as a special ability; their Lockdown power temporarily coats the room with crystals, which prevents exit or entry until the crystals are destroyed. Handy for trapping enemies in airless rooms or keeping them from responding to boarding parties.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutsceneIncompetence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutsceneIncompetence">Cutscene Incompetence</a>:<ul><li> One random event has a crazed Mantis rescued from an escape pod lash out and kill a random member of your crew instantly. Then you return to normal gameplay and fight him. Even the most physically frail race could survive at least a few seconds against that very same Mantis, which becomes apparent if his next target is of the same race as the one he just killed.</li><li> Thankfully works in your favor in one event where a ship of notoriously untrustworthy Slugs request your help repairing their oxygen system. You can choose to send over a Mantis crewman, if you have one, and he will gleefully <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintTheTownRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintTheTownRed">spread them on the walls</a> if it turns out to be a trap. Normally, two Slugs would be a fair match even for a combat-experienced Mantis; three or more would win easily.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax">Cutscene Power to the Max</a>:<ul><li> If you have a Clone Bay and lose a crewmember to certain events, they are instantly respawned, as opposed to taking however many seconds required to clone them normally. The system doesn't even have to be powered.</li><li> Some events allow your crew to teleport onboard an enemy ship as a blue option. You can do this for enemy ships with Zoltan Shields even when you don't have a bypass unit. You can also safely teleport crew to an automated ship and back with a level 1 teleporter, when in gameplay the cooldown time usually wouldn't be enough to save them from asphyxiation.</li><li> Blue Options at events can do this; one Rock crewmember can extinguish a burning space station or put down a riot on his own, a Scrap Recovery Arm can suddenly mine asteroids, the Anti-Bio Beam can one-shot an entire station full of giant spiders without harming anyone else...</li></ul></li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D-K&nbsp;</div><div id="folder1" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss">Damage-Sponge Boss</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The final phase of the boss fight gives the boss a Zoltan shield with slightly more than double the power of a normal one and the ability to restore it completely after a while.

Its weapons ignore one level of shields and don't use ammo, making it trivially easy to beat the early sectors. This is mitigated slightly by the weapon being the only non-missile weapon which can be intercepted by a Mk. I Defense Drone, but most enemy layouts will not have such a drone in the early sectors. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note959un');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note959un" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note959un');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Rock Cruiser B, the Shivan, has a unique Heavy Pierce laser that also bypasses one level of shields and cannot be intercepted by Mark I Defense Drones, but that ship has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">several... difficulties</a> (including a lack of airlocks, which cannot be addressed no matter how the ship is upgraded) that keep it out of <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

That said, the process for unlocking this craft is so convoluted and improbable that you might as well have won a minor lottery if you get it.</li><li> The Rock Cruiser Type B "Shivan" starts out with Fire Bombs, a unique Heavy Piercing Laser, and a strong Rock crew. The Heavy Pierce is incredibly effective early on, charging fairly quickly and ignoring one layer of shields, while taking no ammunition and not being vulnerable to Mk I Defense Drones. While it becomes less effective later on, it's strong enough to the point where you can collect the supporting crew and a teleporter to assemble your Rocks into a fire-augmented nigh-unstoppable boarding crew for the late game, or else acquire further weaponry to help combat more heavily defended foes. It does have 2 disadvantages: no airlock and no door control. This means that you can't hurt enemies by opening airlocks or hinder their movement around your ship, and have no way to contain fires or extinguish them unless you divert crews from their position to stop them. Door control can be purchased at a store for 60 scrap, but there is no way to solve the lack of airlocks; the closest things to a "solution" to that problem are creating a hull breach in an empty, out-of-the-way room or getting a Lanius crew member, and you still need door control to actually use the deoxygenated room as an impromptu airlock.</li><li> The Zoltan Cruiser Type B, "Noether", starts with two Ion Blasts and a Pike Beam, which, given an experienced weapons officer<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10m6mg');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note10m6mg" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10m6mg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which you can easily have by sector 3 or 4, given how fast the Ion Blasts can fire</span>, is actually <em>enough firepower to bring down the final boss</em>. The two ion weapons can quickly and efficiently disable enemy shields and keep them down, and you can even divert one to disabling enemy weapons once that's done. And once the shields are out of the way, the Pike Beam can do widespread and severe damage to the now-defenseless enemy, as it cannot be dodged and is the longest and most energy-efficient beam weapon in the game. More heavily shielded enemies take longer, but can eventually still be rendered defenseless and cut down. Throw in a laser, an extra ion weapon, and/or an attack drone, and you're pretty much set. The downside to the initial firepower, of course, is that your normal shields need to be upgraded before they can properly function, and you depend entirely on your Zoltan shield and evasion at the start, which can lead to hairy situations in fights against drone-heavy enemies or in asteroid fields, or, if you're <em>really</em> unlucky, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs">fighting drone-heavy enemies</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs">in</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs">an asteroid field</a>.</li><li> The Mantis Cruiser Type B starts with no weapons at all, but its two-layer shield, four-person teleporter, defense drones, and starting crew of two Mantises make it trivially easy to defeat almost any ship, earning plenty of scrap for weapons and other upgrades.</li><li> The Human type B ship, the Red-Tail, starts off with four Basic Lasers, single-shot lasers with a charge time of 10 seconds. While each one is weak on their own, four of them at the same time allows you to inflict more damage than a Burst Laser II, but with less recharge time. In fact, it's not even necessary to target the shields on single-shield enemies for the first two sectors since you can still do pretty reasonable damage with three lasers; sometimes you can even shut down an enemy's weapons before they can fire <em>at all</em>. Later on, swap them out for Burst Laser I's or II's to pile up the damage some more. Crewmembers manning weapons gaining experience each time <em>each weapon fires</em> &#151; meaning you often max out the gunner before Sector 3 or 4 &#151; is a bonus.</li><li> The Type B Lanius cruiser starts with a highly power-efficient flak launcher: 3 shots, even if slightly inaccurate, will easily chew through 1 layer of shields to damage enemy systems.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DissonantSerenity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DissonantSerenity">Dissonant Serenity</a>: Your Mantis crewman shows this on one blue event.<div class="indent"> Almost expecting this, your Mantis calmly responds to the trap.

No variant of the ship has shielding, relying on engine and cloaking modules to increase the soft counter of evasion against attack, instead of the hard counter of shielding. Taking one bad hit can cripple its ability to withstand punishment, and they are guaranteed to take a severe beating against anything equipped with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysAccurateAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysAccurateAttack">beam weapons</a> (which completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sell</a> evasion as a tradeoff for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sold</a> by shields, which the Stealth Cruisers do not have).</li><li> The Vortex, Engi Cruiser layout B, has trouble fighting enemies in <em>Sector One</em>.

First there are the "lasers", which fire one or more projectiles of energy that do hull and system damage, can be blocked by shields but weaken them, and like all projectiles, can be dodged. Then there are the "beams", which fire energy beams that cannot be dodged and do damage based on the number of rooms they hit, often requiring careful aiming of the beam path. Their damage is reduced by 1 for every layer of shields they have to pass through, however, and they don't have any weakening effect on the shields themselves. Then there are ion weapons, which fire blue projectiles of energy that can disable enemy systems on impact but do no hull damage. If they hit shields, it's as if they hit the ship's shielding system, and hence their disabling effect is applied to the shield generator. <em>Advanced Edition</em> adds an ion subset, stun, which has the same effect as ion weapons but also are guaranteed to cause anyone in the affected room to be stunned for a short period; the tradeoff is that the actual ion damage they deal is pitiful relative to their charge-up time.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note17yhsz');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note17yhsz" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note17yhsz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The "guaranteed" in the previous sentence is there because regular (read: competent at actually disabling systems) ion weapons were also given the ability to stun crew members in the room they hit; however, unlike stun weapons, regular ion weapons are not guaranteed to stun crew (and in fact are likely to fail to do so), and when regular ion weapons <em>do</em> stun crew members, the stun tends to be shorter than that caused by a stun weapon. Essentially, ion weapons are for disabling systems and stun weapons are for disabling crew; each can do the other's job, but is very inefficient at doing so.</span> The projectiles of stun weapons are yellow to differentiate them from normal blue ion shots.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">Epic Fail</a>: It is possible to die during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameTutorial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameTutorial">Video Game Tutorial</a>.

Envoy is maxed out in all skills, including weapons and combat, and you can then make Envoy your weapons officer and/or have him fight enemy boarders or be in boarding parties (though the latter may be a bad idea, considering that max combat skill doesn't modify his below-average health).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note19rc9z');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note19rc9z" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note19rc9z');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">You can be given the Zoltan Shield augment from this event chain instead of getting Envoy (with the reward being chosen randomly), but the Zoltan Shield has no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a> potential.</span></li><li> Using a teleporter in blue events ignores its cooldown time. For instance, you may find an opportunity to use a basic teleporter to get onto an unmanned scout ship and get sector information, then return safely. The cooldown time on a basic teleporter is longer than the amount of time it takes for a crewman (other than a Rockman, Crystal, or Lanius) to asphyxiate in an unpressurized room.</li><li> The events for killing off the enemy crew in a slaver ship aren't programmed to determine how the enemy crew was killed off. This can end up with the slaves getting scorched to death even though it was a simple boarding mission. Or somehow with them surviving on board a ship that was oxygen deprived with multiple breaches or was completely flooded with <em>fire</em>.</li><li> You, the player, require a pilot at the helm to FTL jump, and so do most enemy ships, but this doesn't apply to automated ships or the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Federation cruiser</span> you can send back home (and then it does apply to that Federation Cruiser when you actually play as it).

There are also lesser chaingun lasers, who act like Burst Lasers except they lose a second off their firing rate as they spool up, to a maximum of -3 seconds. Chain Ion Blasters fire ion blasts with the same mechanics, except they get increased ion damage instead of faster cooldown.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatheringSteam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatheringSteam">Gathering Steam</a>: "Chain" weapons, such as the Chain Laser, Chain Ion, and Chain Vulcan get progressively better each time they fire in an encounter. Depending on the weapon, getting better implies either shooting faster and faster or getting more powerful. In exchange, their first shot is nearly always weak and/or has a very long charge time. On the first shot, the Chain Laser is just a slower Burst Laser I, while after the third, it's a much faster one, going from a 16 second initial cooldown to a final cooldown of 7 seconds. By the fourth shot, the Chain Ion has gone from one ion damage to four, though its cooldown never changes from 14 seconds. The Chain Vulcan takes 11.1 seconds to charge a measely one shot, but after five shots, each shot has a cooldown of 1.1 seconds, so fast that it can overwhelm any amount of shields through raw rate of fire. If any chain weapon loses power, it loses all its steam and has to start over from square one.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GemstoneAssault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GemstoneAssault">Gemstone Assault</a>: Crystal weapons.

In one case, there is a struggling ship trying to move cargo which puts up the last of its shields when it sees you. You power up your weapons as a show of force, but you don't get the items for free &#151; you just open a store. Curiously, this event is marked "store" on the map, so your threatening gesture is automatic.<ul><li> One event has you hauling a stranded ship's goods to another jump beacon, for which the insufferably snide buyer offers you a paltry reward for your trouble. If your weapon systems are adequate, however, you get a blue option to power them up, which quickly makes the buyer rethink his position and gives you a <em>much</em> better reward. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControlDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControlDevice">Mind-Control Device</a> also works if you have it, and if you decide to take the drone parts and leave, there's a chance that the buyer will rethink his position.</li><li> Another case happens with the Mantis slave trader event, where he offers you a crew member in exchange for Scrap.

Easy, by comparison, often lets you build up a decent surplus, to the point where you can reliably max out several systems by sector 8.</li><li> The sector map generation can screw you over if you see what should be a link of sectors to jump to the exit, only to find one link is broken, forcing a backtrack to the start... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">most likely through several Rebel-Fleet-occupied nodes</a>. Unless you are incredibly well-armed, you will die, or at the very least have your end-game wrecked. There is an in-game option that will allow you to hover your mouse over each sector to see where it links, but it starts disabled by default, and you can still easily run into a dead-end if you don't bother to actually examine your planned route ahead of time.</li><li> Most ships can be unlocked simply by finding the relevant homeworld (Stealth, Mantis, Slug, Rock, Zoltan) or beating the game normally (Engi, Federation), though the Stealth and Zoltan ships are somewhat counter-intuitive. The secret ship, however, is much more complicated. First you have to find the Damaged Stasis Pod, an event which can only be found in specific sectors and even then doesn't always produce the pod (thankfully, it occurs at distress beacons, meaning that you can scout out which nodes may or may not have the pod, and you're guaranteed to get the pod if you have Rock Plating... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShmuckBait">unless you take the weapon the event offers instead</a>). Then you have to open the pod, which is also an event only possible in certain sectors &#151; and this event is a normal beacon, so good luck actually finding it, even with the map scouted. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note22r18a');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note22r18a" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note22r18a');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There are two sector types <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(specifically Engi-controlled sectors and the Engi Homeworlds)</span> that can contain both the pod acquisition event and the pod opening event. However, those are far from guaranteed to actually have both, and you obviously can't open the pod before you find it, so if you find the events in the wrong order, you're out of luck.</span> <em>Then</em> you have to find the Rock Homeworlds, which may not even appear, while also not allowing the crew member gained from opening the pod to be killed. <strong>Then</strong> you have to find an event in the Rock Homeworlds that will allow you to enter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretLevel">the hidden sector</a>, where you then have to reach to a quest beacon to finally unlock the ship. Each attempt can take from 30 minutes to an hour. Perhaps in recognition of the feat, it is easily the best ship in the game. Mercifully, a patch caused the Rock Homeworlds crystal wormhole beacon to be marked as a quest on the map whenever you have the pod crewman, taking some of the edge off.</li><li> <em>Advanced Edition</em> also added an alternate unlock method for most ships that only requires winning with the previous ship on the list, making it even easier. The secret ship can be unlocked "merely" by beating the game with all sixteen of the main A and B type ships.</li><li> One achievement for the Federation ship requires you to use your crew in four blue events by sector five. Even with your diverse crew, you just have to hope you run into events which allow you to do so. Another achievement for the Kestrel is "Have six different alien races on your crew." Nearly impossible with Kestrel A (starts with Human crew only) and a little easier with Type B (starts with three of the six races: Human, Mantis, and Zoltan). And an achievement for the crystal cruiser requires destroying 15 rock ships in one run. That will likely require running into 2 rock controlled sectors, and fighting a lot of battles in them. You are much more likely to beat the game with the ship than you are to get this achievement.</li><li> Yahtzee of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ZeroPunctuation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ZeroPunctuation">Zero Punctuation</a></em> eloquently summed up the <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

The first sector is often the hardest, as you have virtually no way of destroying rebel drones (the Basilisk can destroy Auto-Scouts with a Boarding Drone and patience, but the Carnelian lacks even that) and you're stuck leaving your ship entirely unmanned while you fight on the enemy ship. In addition, since the scrap yields for the first sector are naturally very low, you're not getting too much more than you do on a regular run. However, if you can make it through the first couple of sectors and pick up some non-combat crewmembers to run the ship (and some actual hull-damaging weapons to deal with Auto-Scouts, Auto-Assaults, and the Rebel Flagship), then you probably have a winning run on your hands.</li><li> The chain-laser series in <em>Advanced Edition</em> starts out with a long recharge time, but it decreases with each shot, to the point where they fire faster than most weapons in the game. However, the chain is broken if the weapon is depowered, so protecting your weapons system from damage is <em>absolutely vital</em> (even more so than usual). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood">The Chain Vulcan</a> takes this to the extreme; it's a four-power, single shot laser needs to be fired five times to reach its minimum reload time of <em>1.1 seconds</em>. That's faster than shields can recharge. This means that, even allowing for misses, the Vulcan alone will take out any ship in the game, including the Rebel Flagship. If you can get it &#151; and that's a big if &#151; you can spend all your scrap on shields, engines, and other systems to help you survive while the Vulcan chews through anything and everything in front of it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMainCharactersDoEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMainCharactersDoEverything">The Main Characters Do Everything</a>: Oh, you've just jumped across half the universe, surviving by the skin of your teeth to bring us this vital information about the Rebel fleet?

It is very possible to fire twice as many lasers as the enemy has shields and still completely fail to put a dent in the enemy ship's hull.</li><li> Heavy Lasers do more damage per shot and can more easily punch holes in the target's hull, but have a lower rate of fire, making them by themselves ineffective against shielded ships.</li><li> Beams <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysAccurateAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysAccurateAttack">never miss</a> and do enormous damage, but have longer charge times and their damage is reduced by 1 for every shield layer it must pass through, and they cannot damage shields at all. Only two beams, Halberd and Glaive, have sufficient raw damage output to penetrate a one-layer shield, and only the Glaive Beam can penetrate a two-layer shield, which means you need other weapons to supplement them.</li><li> Missiles ignore shields, but have limited ammunition and can be dodged or shot down by defense drones. The bigger ones also take a fair amount of time to charge.</li><li> Bombs ignore shields <em>and</em> defense drones, but share ammo with missiles and never inflict hull damage. Some can start fires that can potentially cause hull damage, but that's only one point. All bombs take longer than missiles to charge, too, and are just as likely to miss, wasting the ammo and the long charge time.</li><li> Ion weapons disable systems, but their effects are temporary and deal no actual damage. They can also miss, just like lasers, missiles, and bombs. On the plus side, they generally charge faster than most weapons, with one ion weapon, the Ion Blast II, having the fastest charge time of any weapon short of a fully-warmed-up Chain Vulcan[note]Four seconds, compared to the Chain Vulcan's 1.1 at full speed[/note].<ul><li> There are three ion weapons &#151; the aforementioned Ion Blast II, the Chain Ion (when fully or almost-fully warmed-up), and the Ion Charger (only if manned by a max-skill crew member) &#151; whose ion DPS exceeds the rate at which ion damage wears off, allowing them to singlehandedly lock down the enemy's shields indefinitely (or singlehandedly lock down another system if shields are already being held down by another weapon). However, if they miss, the locked-down system will have sufficient time to recover before the next shot.</li></ul></li><li> Offensive drones attack continuously, but are limited by your supply of drone parts and are computer-controlled, aiming at random rooms. Furthermore, the Mark I Combat Drone's rate of fire is insufficient to overcome enemy shields without support, while both varieties of Beam Drone and the Fire Drone are entirely incapable of bypassing shields. On top of that, offensive drones they can be shot away by accident by enemy weapons, or disabled and potentially destroyed on purpose by Anti-Combat Drones<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note25t0dq');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note25t0dq" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note25t0dq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Anti-Combat Drones fire ion shots rather than damaging shots, but drones directly afflicted with ion damage have a chance of self-destructing rather than reactivating when the ion damage wears off (ion damage to Drone Control or to a room containing a drone does not count)</span>. Mark I Defense Drones will ignore combat drones, but Mark II Defense Drones will attempt to shoot down the lasers fired by combat drones (they will not respond to beam drones).</li><li> Boarders allow you to wreak havoc inside an enemy ship, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">Anyone Can Die</a> &#151; often in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YetAnotherStupidDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YetAnotherStupidDeath">stupid ways</a>, such as them destroying the enemy ship while inside it, causing their deaths, the ship getting destroyed by your own weapons if you're not careful, or the enemy jumping out with your crew members still on board.<ul><li> Boarding drones are similar to boarders, able to attack the enemy's systems and crew. They require a drone part to launch, but their use is independent of boarding parties &#151; you don't have to put your crew in harm's way, or even have a teleporter &#151; and they have the durability of Rockmen, the power of Mantis (in the case of standard boarding drones) or the ability to do ion damage to systems and stun crew (in the case of Ion Intruders), and immunity to suffocation. They also create a hull breach on entry. However, they target rooms, including their entry room, completely at random, and take a few seconds to travel from their home ship to the enemy ship, during which they can be shot down by defense drones (both Mark I and Mark II) <em>and</em> stunned or potentially destroyed by anti-drones. Furthermore, boarding drones become inert and completely vulnerable to anti-personnel drones and the enemy crew if depowered (and as they require 3 power to operate, this can happen fairly easily), and even when powered, boarding drones are just as susceptible as actual boarders to being overwhelmed and destroyed by superior numbers of enemy crew before they can inflict substantial damage, meaning that boarding drones are most effective when supported by actual boarding parties.</li></ul></li><li> Hull weapons will do double damage when they hit a system-less room, allowing them to inflict severe hull damage in just a few shots. In exchange, they take slightly longer to charge, making them less viable for disabling ships. Furthermore, hitting a room without a system means that no system will be damaged by the shot, and some enemy ships have no system-less rooms at all, taking away a hull weapon's niche. The Hull Beam also has half the beam range of the otherwise equally powerful Pike Beam.</li><li> The Federation Cruiser's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Artillery Beam</a> is independent from its other weapons, cannot miss, and ignores anything short of Zoltan shields to deal massive damage, but can't be manually controlled and counts as one of the 8 ship systems, meaning fewer additional helpful systems like cloaking or hacking can be installed. It also starts with a 50-second charge time, which takes a lot of scrap and power to upgrade into a more reasonable 20 seconds.</li><li> The Crystal Cruiser and Rock Cruiser C have special Crystal weapons which mostly behave like lasers and have most of the same advantages and disadvantages. However, Crystal weapons can bypass one layer of shielding (for comparison, missiles and bombs can bypass five layers of shielding, which is the most any ship (even a computer-cheating-bastard ship) can possibly have). Since they otherwise behave like lasers, Crystal weapons don't use ammo; however, unlike lasers, crystal weapons fire physical objects that a Mk. I Defense Drone can shoot down.</li><li> The Repair Arm will restore your ship's hull whenever you collect scrap, but you'll earn less scrap when you're repaired.</li><li> Fire weapons do no damage by themselves, but the fires they start can cause damage in addition to forcing the enemy to put the fires out prior to effecting repairs. Fire also spreads, and can grow out of control if not managed quickly. However, only Fire Bombs and Fire Beams are guaranteed to start fires, and both take some time to charge, meaning the crew may be able to keep up with the fires if there's enough of them. An upgraded door system will also render fire virtually harmless, since it can't get past blast doors.</li><li> In the <em>Advanced Edition</em> expansion, the new Hacking system can shoot out a drone that attaches to the enemy hull and affects a single system. This locks the doors to that room to enemy crew, allows friendly crew to freely pass through the doors, makes it unable to be manned by a crew member, and allows a disruption ability that makes the normal effect of the room inverted or disabled, and said disruption is reusable. However, each usage costs a single drone part, the drone cannot be moved unless it is destroyed through ion damage or hacking, and each use of the system takes as long to cool down as cloaking does. Much like boarding drones, it's also vulnerable to defense drones and anti-drones, though it doesn't have a cooldown period between launches.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!</a>: When you reach the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Crystal Home Sector</span>.

Many events involve suspiciously generous offers, most of which turn out to be ruses to sabotage your ship. On the other hand, choosing the exact same option in said situation in a different playthrough CAN give different outcomes. For instance, a Slug trader talks to you about a special deal for his wares for a while only to be revealed as distracting you from his mates looting your ship. The next time you meet him, choosing to talk to him instead have him appreciate your trust in him and give you some extra bonus.

It has no weapons, level 2 shielding to start, a crew of two Mantises, and a four-person teleporter. Early combat tactics involve sending them both over to board enemy ships, leaving the shields to protect the ship since it has zero evasion in your absence. This is actually way more effective than it sounds, especially in the early levels.

If your pilot control or jump drive is knocked out, defeating the local enemy will quickly become the least of your worries; add to that a hit to your door controls, and you'll never get ahead of the flares.</li><li> The Pulsar environmental hazard introduced in Advanced Edition can result in your shields being dropped, letting the enemy have free reign to attack and destroy you (though it also often drops the enemy's shields, giving you free reign to attack them). The best advice for dealing with this hazard is to simply warp out as soon as possible unless you are certain you can take out their weapons.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign">Unwinnable by Design</a>: Unless you can manage to upgrade your ship to keep up with the increasing difficulty of the ships the game throws at you, it's quite possible to find yourself in a situation where you're incapable of killing your opponent. Boarding-based ships like the Mantis B are especially liable to find themselves in such a situation, as Zoltan shields and automated ships present a significant problem without ways of compensating for their defenses. The flagship basically enforces getting a strong offense up, as its myriad tricks make it far more formidable than normal enemies. The third phase in particular will <em>destroy</em> you with its boarding parties and mind control unless you took out most of the crew in phases one and two and/or can break through the Zoltan Shield and shut down the Mind Control system lightning-fast.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake">Unwinnable by Mistake</a>: The Backup DNA Bank augmentation prevents your crew from being lost if the Clone Bay is off or broken, allowing them to be brought back later once the Clone Bay is turned on or repaired.

However, the blue options it grants for events usually just mean you're going to skip a fight, which you usually don't want, considering the rewards from fighting and the fact that you have a limited number of encounters per sector.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VariableMix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VariableMix">Variable Mix</a>: With the exception of Sector 8's special music, each music track has two versions: calm and spacey most of the time, and incorporating more rhythm and percussion when you're squaring off against a hostile vessel. One version automatically fades into the other as the situation changes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash">Vendor Trash</a>:<ul><li> The most straightforward example of this is drone schematics, if you don't have and aren't planning on getting a drone system: they're useless except as store credit.</li><li> Many 3-power and 4-power weapons can be hard to add onto a weapons loadout, since they take up a significant fraction of the maximum of 8 power in the weapons system, requiring many weapons upgrades (let alone the cost of purchasing the weapon itself). Thus, if you receive something like a Burst Laser III (4 power, 19 second charge time, 5 damage at most) or a Breach Missile (3 power, 21 second charge time, 4 shield-piercing damage), it's often easier to just sell them to a store for a decent chunk of scrap rather than try to fit them into a loadout.</li><li> Most augments are at least slightly useful, but few provide a large effect compared to getting money for them at a store. The most noteworthy examples are Advanced FTL Navigation (allows you to jump to any previously-visited beacon... which will usually be completely empty, thus spending a fuel and wasting a tick forward of the advancing fleet), and Repair Arm (which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromMoney">takes a percentage of your money to heal you</a> every time you get money, when you'd rather keep the money to upgrade your ship so you get hit less).

Rescuing hapless space travelers from rebels, pirates, asteroids, giant alien spiders, and anything else that pops up can give you the warm fuzzies as well. Especially when you encounter another Federation vessel, usually heavily damaged and always in trouble.</li><li> Many encounters end with the enemy trying to bribe you, including the Lanius showing you pictures of their cargo holds. Actually, you can spend a few events trying to communicate with the Lanius. One possible surrender message has them use their limited knowledge of human culture to attempt to surrender by showing you a video feed of them waving around makeshift white flags <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a> style.</li><li> You may come across an event where you could take the less friendly option and get some benefit, but you can also be nice and possibly not get anything, but the game will compliment you when you're lucky. For instance, there's a random event where the Engi ship at a beacon immediately surrenders their supplies. One option is accepting the supplies. If you refuse and explain you're friendly, they might leave in relief (leaving you nothing), or they might give you the supplies anyway, saying you deserve them for your kindness. There's no additional benefit aside from you feeling better for it, since you get the same amount of stuff.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">Video Game Cruelty Potential</a>:<ul><li> You can accept bribes from pirates to leave them alone when you find them attacking another ship, agree to hand over one of your crew to slavers in order for the rest to go free, and cruise right on by desperate pleas for help without stopping. For more hands-on cruelty potential, you can deal with enemy boarding parties by opening up your airlocks and letting them suffocate. Some of the game's achievements actually <em>encourage</em> cruelty to your enemies &#151; such as one that requires you to drain an enemy ship of oxygen, while another requires you to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">Kill It with Fire</a> by having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">every single square of an enemy ship ablaze at the same time</a>.</li><li> There is also an event that encourages cruelty where you meet a pirate who is trying to extort resources from a planet-side colony and can "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWrongRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWrongRight">show him how it's done</a>" by igniting their villages with a fire beam or fire bombs, should you choose to, granting better rewards.</li><li> One of the achievements to unlock the Type B Mantis Cruiser requires you to defeat the last enemy crewmember on their ship with your last crewmember. The easiest way to do this is to kill all but one of their crew, beam back, suffocate your entire crew save one, then finish the job on their ship.</li><li> Depending on your weapons, it can be better to watch as the crew of an enemy ship slowly but surely dies while cowering in one of the few safe rooms left.

About the only ship immune to this tactic is Clone Bay-equipped ships, as your kidnapping rate most likely won't be able to overcome their cloning rate.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">We Have Reserves</a>: The entire point of the Clone Bay subsystem. Who cares if your men keep dying? There's more where they came from. Can your enemy say the same? If they can, then this isn't quite as viable.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWinBecauseYouDidnt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWinBecauseYouDidnt">We Win... Because You Didn't</a>: Done in the player's favor when fighting the Rebel Flagship. If you and the Flagship <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutualKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutualKill">blow up at the same time</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">it counts as a victory</a>. After all, the narrative objective of the game is "save the Federation", not "save the Federation and come out alive."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a>:<ul><li> A few events will call you out if you choose not to help out. At least one is particularly nasty about it; if you opt not to help a ship struggling through an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsteroidThicket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsteroidThicket">Asteroid Thicket</a>, sometimes they'll make it out alive without you and relay your location to the rebel fleet as revenge, speeding up the fleet for the next two jumps.</li><li> One of the sidequests has you escorting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunawayFiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunawayFiance">Runaway Fianc&eacute;</a> of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a>. If you choose to complete the arrangements when you arrive at the quest destination, you'll get a weapon as a reward, but not without said fiance screaming "May your children erode to dust!"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note299pze');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note299pze" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note299pze');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The alternative is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheMoneyIHaveRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheMoneyIHaveRules">refuse to hand her over, forgoing the weapon</a> and starting a fight, but the bride joins your crew as gratitude for helping her flee her forced marriage.</span></li><li> <em>Advanced Edition</em> adds an event where you can steal supplies from a rebel colony. Assuming they don't booby-trap it, they'll cite you as an example of why the rebels have support.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark">What You Are in the Dark</a>: The game doesn't have an explicit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">Karma Meter</a>, but many events will test your morality. Do you take the bribe of a pirate and let him go after some ship, or do you take him on? When a slaver offers gifts in exchange for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsWantMercy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsWantMercy">letting them live</a>, do you accept and let him live to continue his dirty work, or do you finish the job? Do you help when asked for it, even if it may cost you health, ammo, or crew? There's no one around who will judge you, only your conscience. Choose, skipper.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllElseFailsGoRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllElseFailsGoRight">When All Else Fails, Go Right</a>: You are always traveling from left to right &#151; even in the eighth sector when trying to catch the flagship, your ship begins on the left side of the map and the flagship generally on the right.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinsByDoingAbsolutelyNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinsByDoingAbsolutelyNothing">Wins by Doing Absolutely Nothing</a>: If you encounter a Rebel scout ship with no shields in an asteroid field, and provided your own ship has functioning shields, it's possible to do nothing and watch as the asteroids blow the scout into pieces. If you have enough shields and evasion, it's very possible to win this way without taking any damage.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WireDilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WireDilemma">Wire Dilemma</a>: You can run into one of these during a special event in which your ship has to dodge an active mine. Fail to dodge it or be unable to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a> and the mine will attach to your ship, forcing a crew member to go outside and try to defuse it. If the crew member panics at the sight of the mine's interior, you are then prompted to cut a red or blue wire. Cut the right one, and the mine is disarmed and you deconstruct it for scrap. Cut the wrong one, and the mine explodes, doing significant damage to your hull as well as ending the unlucky crew member tasked with disarming it. If you have a Clone Bay, the clone steps out, sheepish and apologetic.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithThisHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithThisHerring">With This Herring</a>: You have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAPieceOfJunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAPieceOfJunk">an old, clunky ship</a> with hand-me-down weapons and a small crew. Your mission is to save the struggling Federation. Good luck.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWorldHalfFull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWorldHalfFull">A World Half Full</a>: You can change the galaxy for the better... if you can somehow win the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle">Final Battle</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit">Wounded Gazelle Gambit</a>:<ul><li> One random event has a Rebel soldier teleport onto your ship, hoping to defect from them and join your crew. You can either reject his offer or let him join. However, if you let him join, he will either A) be a loyal crewmate, which is always a plus, or B) immediately betray you and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStab" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStab">Back Stab</a> one of your crewmates, killing him or her. And even if you reject him, he might attack you anyways.</li><li> Slug ships occasionally claim to be unarmed and seeking asylum, before weapons spring from their hull and they attack.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YetAnotherStupidDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YetAnotherStupidDeath">Yet Another Stupid Death</a>: So many ways.<ul><li> Many deaths are related to oxygen/fire issues, such as:<ul><li> Accidentally depressurizing half your ship by forgetting to close an airlock.</li><li> Repairing the oxygen room, but forgetting to put power back into it and not noticing until your crew start dying.</li><li> Being in a plasma storm (which cuts your reactor power in half), and deactivating the oxygen to activate just one more shield or weapon, then forgetting to turn it back on afterward.</li><li> Screwing up the anti-fire door shuffle, and watching your oxygen, door control, and/or medbay get burnt by the fire or hit by enemy weapons, resulting in crew that have a choice of dying from asphyxiation or fire.</li><li> Your door or oxygen system getting hit while your ship is on fire or with a hull breach or with external doors open.</li></ul></li><li> Throwing units in the medical bay during a battle, with low oxygen levels and/or to fight boarders, and forgetting to put power into it.</li><li> Certain events can inflict hull damage without a battle, which can result in a heavily damaged ship being destroyed.</li><li> Certain events can cause crew loss. They do not make exceptions if you have only one crew member left. If you start a game with the Engi B cruiser, which starts with a single crew member, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressStartToGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressStartToGameOver">it is possible to get a game over after only one jump</a>.</li><li> Boarding an enemy ship during heated combat can result in a number of stupid deaths for your crew as your attention is drawn to one area when you need it on another:<ul><li> Teleporting your crew onto an enemy ship, only to see it warp away.</li><li> The Federation Cruiser's Artillery Beam special weapon is not controllable by the player in any way except by powering it down. This can lead to situations when, after boarding a ship, it shoots the beam at a compartment your boarding party are in, which can kill your crew through friendly fire if they're already at low health.</li><li> Forgetting to turn off auto-fire and accidentally destroying the opposing ship with your crew on board.</li><li> Forgetting that having your boarding party destroy a system results in hull damage, with the hull already critical. A ship with 1 hull point left whose crew have retreated to the medbay will leave your boarding party to attack some other system, which, if they destroy it, will blow up the ship with themselves on it.</li><li> Watching your boarding team get taken out because the enemy has a cloak and your team got stuck in a combat situation they can't win, unable to get back to your ship since a cloak blocks teleporting.</li><li> In the same vein, teleporting onto a ship with upgraded doors and being killed by a lack of oxygen, or getting stuck in a medbay or against overwhelming numbers of enemy crew.</li><li> Teleporting crew onto an AI Drone ship with a Level 1 teleporter. Drone craft have no atmosphere, and your crew will die before the Level 1 teleport recharges. Level 2 is fine, but cuts it close. However, Rockmen can last a little longer with their 150% health, Crystals have improved suffocation resistance and 125% health, and Lanius are completely immune to suffocation.</li><li> Similar to the above, accidentally picking the wrong crew to teleport to an AI Drone ship, and sending a Zoltan instead of a crewmember from a more suitable race. Their lowered health prevents them from surviving long enough for a level 2 teleport to save them.</li></ul></li><li> Forgetting you turned your weapons onto auto-fire and wasting shots/charge time OR forgetting that you turned it off and missing damaging important systems.</li><li> Firing a weapon too soon, such as a beam or a laser, before another weapon, like a missile or a bomb, has time to actually connect and disable the shields.</li><li> Deciding to hold off healing a crew member, just to have him/her killed by a breaching weapon.</li><li> Forgetting to return units to stations, heal them, repair systems, etc. before jumping into combat.</li><li> Forgetting to buy repairs/fuel/missiles/drones before jumping.</li><li> Forgetting to check if that beacon leads to where you want to go and misjudging the rebel's advance just to get bogged in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack">Desperation Attack</a> against the fleet.</li><li> Giving supplies to a passing ship for the rewards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCaringPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCaringPotential">or the good feeling</a> and forgetting that: 1. you don't have the supplies and/or, 2. this type of event can give you a benefit that you don't need, like map data when you are on the second-to-last beacon or getting a augment you can't keep/already have.</li><li> Having Lanius crew mixed in with non-Lanius crew can cause problems, such as getting multiple crew into the same room (e.g. to stave off a boarding attack), but not noticing your Lanius crewmember draining away oxygen that the other 1-3 people in the same room need until you start hearing the "low crew health" beeps.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouRebelScum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouRebelScum">You Rebel Scum!</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Inverted</a>. At one point, the rebels call you, "federation scum".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWillNotEvadeMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWillNotEvadeMe">You Will Not Evade Me</a>: The Crystals' Lockdown ability prevents crew from entering or escaping a room, preventing enemy crew from running away to their Medbay to heal.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a>:<ul><li> Certain events can result in six boarders appearing on your ship. This often exceeds the amount of crew a player will have under their control for the majority of their attempts.</li><li> The player themselves can use this strategy with the use of the Clone Bay, which allows sending inexhaustible waves of boarders onto the enemy ship. Combine with a four-man Teleporter for maximum effect.</li><li> The Flagship is really bad about this. If its crew has survived to the third stage, they'll funnel over to your ship as fast as their teleporter can charge, and their crew size is equal to your maximum, plus the ones manning the weapons.</li></ul></li></ul></div><hr><div class="indent"><em>You find nothing of major importance reading through the page.
