Breaker</a>: The Great Wall Wonder in <em>Revolution 2</em> completely destroys them. The AI is programmed to, upon contact, constantly wage war with you, barring situations where you've managed to defeat them so thoroughly that they can only last a couple more turns if the situation continues. The Great Wall, however, forces all civilizations to be at peace with you, and to offer peace if they're at war. The way it breaks them is that rather than realize they can't fight you, they think they're in those few turns before they declare war again rather than trying anything else, and indeed, the diplomacy menu for other civs pops up a lot and has the civs you're at peace with offer peace and do nothing else on a regular basis like they would if they'd be allowed to declare war (though without trying to coerce your much stronger civ).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AintTooProudToBeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AintTooProudToBeg">Ain't Too Proud to Beg</a>: In <em>V</em>, leaders that are losing a war tend to offer peace agreements in exchange for every city but their capital, all their resources for 30 turns, all their income for 30 turns, their entire treasury, and their wives and daughters as your concubines (well, OK, not that last one). Oh, and guess how hard it'll be to take that lone capital once the 30 turns are over. They do it to other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a> too, so the number of powerful nations on any given continent can drop quite quickly.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllSeeingAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllSeeingAI">The All-Seeing A.I.</a>:<ul><li> Used completely straight in the earlier games.</li><li> Mostly averted in <em>IV</em>, except that the AI negotiators know precisely what the relative values of various goods are, leading to weirdness such as knowing the value of trading world maps when they shouldn't know what's on yours.</li><li> In <em>V</em>, AI players frequently "covet your lands," despite having never visited your land and not knowing where it is or what resources it has.</li><li> One may, early in the game, witness the AI placing cities in almost dead tundra areas of no value, at the cost of better areas, and proceed to defend these places heavily. This is not the settler-happy AI function at work and it has nothing to do with the land's value at this time. The AI is aware of locations of all resources no matter the age. Later ages will reveal these resources to players with proper research. And that less than ideal location (or even an ideal location, the richness of the location in early ages is not the point here) ends up full of Oil, Coal and Aluminum nodes. The AI doesn't have the ability to harvest them yet, but will still value the areas that have them. If non-warmonger leaders are treating you vehemently for no good reason, either for your territory or borders, then it's a good guess that you're sitting on future riches.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllianceMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllianceMeter">Alliance Meter</a>:<ul><li> Every game tracks your relationships with other civilizations using one, factoring in both opinions and existing treaties.</li><li> In <em>V</em>, each city state has one for each full-sized civ.

It becomes quite bizarre though when you meet a city-state during the Ancient Era and they tell you that they know the secrets of, say, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness">Panzer</a>. That said, they won't actually give you that kind of unit until you research the tech that would normally unlock it.</li><li> Even the Leader screens, which are <em>supposed</em> to give the player at least a certain realistic feel for a culture and a time period flub it up occasionally, such as England's Queen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ElizabethI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ElizabethI">Elizabeth I</a> quoting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill">Winston Churchill</a> and Austria's Empress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MariaTheresa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MariaTheresa">Maria Theresa</a> eating at <em>Neuschwanstein</em>.</li><li> While the leaders' themes in <em>V</em> are often songs that technically originate from the appropriate culture, they sometimes come from a very different period than the rest of the civ's aesthetic. For instance, Darius I's theme, "Mor&#7713;-e sa&#7717;ar," was written in early 20th century Iran &#150; roughly <em>two millennia</em> after the decline of his Achaemenid Empire that <em>Civ V</em> Persia is based upon.</li><li> The opening cutscene for <em>VI</em> tries to avert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTactics">Hollywood Tactics</a> by having a WW2 infantry charge of well-spread troops covering each other on the run... performed by bayonetless musket-toting Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth soldiers.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues">And the Adventure Continues</a>: A rare case where the <em>game over screen</em> suggests this in <em>V</em>.<div class="indent"><em>Your Civilization has fallen...but your people do not despair.

It gets rid of two major annoyances that have plagued players, especially those playing against the A.I., for most of the series.<ul><li> The first one is the grievance/favors system, which quantifies dickish behavior and helpful behavior. Before the A.I. would start wars and denounce you at the drop of a hat and there was nothing you could do in response aside from get labeled "warmonger" for attacking them. Now you get a type of currency that justifies striking out at an antagonistic Civ after you've put up with their abuses for a while. Favors similarly is a currency that rewards you for being nice to other civs so you don't run into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard">Ungrateful Bastard</a> behavior for helping, or at least get something solid to show for it.</li><li> The second is influence. One of the biggest jerk moves in more recent Civ games, mostly done by A.I. but players could do this too, is drop a city into an area largely controlled by a single Civ and nothing you could do would remove it short of warmongering penalties. With influence trying to drop a city into an uncontested area otherwise filled by a single, or possibly 2, Civ(s) will cause the city to become converted. This was most often done by A.I. trying snipe resources or possibly natural wonders, if a player took too long to establish a city there, from right under other Civ's noses.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiPoopSocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiPoopSocking">Anti Poop-Socking</a>: As of <em>IV</em>, not only does the game offer players the option to have the system time displayed on the UI, it actually has a <em>built-in alarm clock function.</em></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToForce">Appeal to Force</a>: Invoked by the leaders before the negotiations in the first two games: "Our words are backed with NUCLEAR WEAPONS!"

Originally, he was the only leader whose aggression used to be 1, on a scale of 1-10. In Gandhi's case, adopting Democracy, which normally decreases aggression by 2, would lead to him having -1 aggression, which created a variable underflow - often just as strategic weaponry came into play. So at roughly the same time nuclear power was researched, Gandhi's aggression was <em>255 out of 10</em>. The memetic impact was such that the developers have been purposefully making him a nuke monger for every major sequel afterward.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme">Ascended Meme</a>:<ul><li> "Nuclear Gandhi." In <em>Civ I</em>, nuclear powers would boast that "Our words are backed with NUCLEAR WEAPONS!", even Gandhi.

One was suspected by some to be Tamar, leader of the kingdom of Georgia. It ended up being Gorgo of Sparta, but the fervency and unexpectedness of the guess was so amusing it led to the nation becoming a popular guess for <em>any</em> upcoming civilization... until Tamar and Georgia were officially announced as part of the <em>Rise and Fall</em> expansion released two years later.</li><li> One Achievement in <em>VI</em> is for getting a culture victory, called "Buying Your Blue Jeans and Listening to Your Pop Music", a complaint by leaders in <em>IV</em> when players were strong in Culture. In <em>V,</em> AI leaders make the same complaint when the player becomes culturally influential over them.</li><li> "Seahenge" is an achievment in <em>Civ VI: Gathering Storm.</em> It's a reference to how in <em>V</em>, Stonehenge would often appear on the ocean if built in a coastal city.

This would be awesome but for the fact that it's at the very end of the tech tree for most players, meaning that either it'll be built after it's needed or the AI will get it first. However, there is a specific strategy that ignores all other endgame tech to get the Internet built early, making it actually useful.<ul><li> The Space Elevator in <em>IV</em> gives you a big boost to spaceship construction. The problem with it is that it's expensive and requires a tech not needed for the spaceship (not to mention you <em>have</em> to build it in a city near the equator!) that you're usually better off building another spaceship part in its place.</li><li> The Great Colossus wonder in <em>V</em> used to be this. It had a nice benefit that was lost once a certain, rather early, technology was discovered by any player. It was later patched to have a slightly different effect and not become obsolete.</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme">Giant Death Robot</a> in <em>V</em> comes so late that anyone aiming for a domination victory will probably get it before having an opportunity to build the GDR. It also requires valuable uranium, which could be used on the earlier and quicker-to-build nuclear options.</li><li> Due to their almost pedantic requirements, most of wonders in <em>VI</em> are like this. While they provide often valuable bonuses, it takes a <em>very</em> specific spot on the map to even build them. Also, it can easily reach the point where not having the wonder provides more than sacrificing everything just to get it in place.</li><li> Nearly all the wonders in Civ Rev get this treatment barring the East India Company, which is always good and very powerful. In a game that runs at such a fast pace (193 turns max, and most games can be decided in 60 or less by a decent player) nearly all of them are just too expensive to build in the relatively short amount of time you have to devote to frivolous endeavors, even the decent ones are only situational useful instead of strong enough to justify always trying for, and most eventually go obsolete to boot. Special mention goes to the Apollo Program: it instantly hands you all technologies that remain un-researched in the game....which would be great if it wasn't unlocked by the <em>penultimate</em> technology requiring most of the others in the first place, and that ALSO unlocks the Technological victory option by itself (an oversight perhaps, you DO NOT have to build Apollo to go to space, you only need the Space Flight tech which unlocks all the space ship parts at once), making the wonder largely pointless.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MahatmaGandhi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MahatmaGandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a></em> is incredibly nuke-happy. In the first game, this was down to a bug in the AI's coding, which made Gandhi almost certain to declare war if he adopted a peaceful form of government like Democracy; but in subsequent games it has been retained for the sheer comedy value. In <em>V</em>, despite being very reluctant to start wars unprovoked, Gandhi will rain nukes on you if you're a warmonger, as his AI has a hardcoded Nuke Production and Use of Nukes rating of 12; the maximum rating otherwise is <em>10</em>.<ul><li> In <em>VI</em>, he's back with a vengeance. Every leader have a constant agenda and a random "hidden" agenda, and each leader has a specific agenda that have a high likelihood to be their random agenda.

In <em>Civ V</em> vanilla, this involved building the Utopia Project once you've completed the correct Policy Tree. In "Brave New World", the mechanic was changed to building up enough Culture (your "defence") and Tourism (your "attack") for the holiday makers from the other civs to conclude that your culture is just better.

It also made cities quite a bit sturdier, with defensive buildings increasing the cities max health in addition to their combat rating.</li><li> In the same game, garrisoning a unit in a city is a double-edged sword. While it does add the unit's strength to the city, it also means that if the city has been bombarded down to zero HP, then it doesn't matter whether the next attacker is a Spearman or the defender is a <strike><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Tank</a></strike> Giant Death Robot; the latter is going to die when the city is captured.</li><li> In the same game, being the first to open an ideology gives you a bonus tenet. Also, reaching the modern era lets you unlock an ideology without finding coal or building factories. Conveniently, there is <em>one path</em> across the industrial era that only requires three technologies- scientific theory, electricity, radio. As a result, you can get 6 Modern Infantry with 40 combat strength when most people have crossbows as their strongest units... with only 22 strength.</li><li> A mechanic in <em>Civ Rev</em>: if your battle odds are 7:1 in favour on the attack, it's an Overrun, and the defending unit cries out in terror and flees with accompanying sound effect.

With enough Legion units, you can take down pikemen <em>armies</em>(a powerful defensive unit a tier above Legions) note that armies are 3x as strong as individual units that comprise them and pikemen (3) are already stronger than Legions (2) individually.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a>: <em>V's</em> Civilopedia <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">points out</a> some of the more complicated and absurd parts of history that it goes over for certain entries, and is by no means above poking more fun at them if it feels warranted.<ul><li> By way of example, its entry for Fascism reads:<div class="indent"> <em>This form of government was quite popular in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">certain states in Central Europe</a> during the last century but other states didn't much like it, and it was ultimately abandoned after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWar2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWar2">some unpleasantness</a>.</em></div></li><li> Some of the leader dialogue can get pretty snarky.

Invading other people's cities and annexing them (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn">Rape, Pillage, and Burn</a> or, in <em>V</em>, making puppet states out of them) fits the bill. It's fun to conquer every single city, but it requires a lot of micromanagement and strategy with your units. You're also going to have to deal with a lot of unhappiness due to overpopulation, angry citizens from occupied cities and city-states, and having diplomatic relations completely cut off and every civilization declare war on you for your war-mongering attitude. This is why "military based civilizations" (i.e. Mongols, Aztecs, Huns, and the Japanese) are considered to be high-risk/high-reward type of civilization.</li><li> The entire point of Wonders is they are expensive to produce, other people may beat you to building one (meaning you wasted all your effort) and time spent building one could have been better spent making lots of conventional forces. But if you finish it, you get something pretty awesome that changes how you play the game.</li><li> Getting a Cultural Victory via Tourism in <em>Brave New World</em> requires a lot of planning, both to get the right Great Works at the right time and getting the aforementioned Wonders, but do it right and you can get the rest of the world to concede the superiority of your culture without firing a shot.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">Disc-One Nuke</a>: Many units are superbly strong when you first get them, but are eventually outclassed as technology continues. In <em>III</em> for example, the Swordsman boasts 3 attack and 2 defense and is the pinnacle of Ancient Times military technology, but once you get to the Middle Ages, Knights can outspeed them, Longbowmen outdamage them, Pikemen can stand up to them, and Swordsmen can't upgrade into more powerful units. You can also of course rush to a technology with intent to get a leg up on opponents with a new unit they aren't prepared to deal with, but of course that won't last.<ul><li> Even more obvious for civs with strong Unique Units in <em>V</em>, who <em>will</em> eventually obsolete and be replaced by something better - and available for everyone. Some units will still keep an edge (Chu-ko-nus keep the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">two-shots upgrade once they become Gatling Guns</a>, while Longbowmen become Gatling Guns with +1 range), other will be brought down to normal (Keshiks or Camel Archers lose their ranged attack, Battering Rams or Siege Towers their huge bonuses against cities...). The most obvious case may be the Zulu Impi, who loses its double attack when upgraded <em>and</em> the access to the +1 movement promotion once you gain access to Riflemen.</li><li> Subverted by Polish Hussars, who boast rather nasty unique ability transferable through entire anti tank chain and can be upgraded from Landsknechts, purchasable unit enabled by social policy. Thus, even when Hussars get 'obsoleted' by Anti-tank gun and can no longer be trained directly, they still remain crucial step in creating devilish combo known as Winged Gunknechts, which turns rather underperforming Gunship into walking calamity that creates absolute mayhem behind enemy lines by pillaging everything in reach and disrupting movements of enemy troops.</li><li> The Horseman units in Civ Rev are ridiculously powerful for their era. Unlocked by a basic technology that would only take you 5 turns to research, each horseman costs twice as much as the basic warrior unit but has double the attack power. More importantly, they have twice as many movement points, meaning they can cross the map and bring this power to bear <em>very</em> quickly. Horse armies are completely effective even on the highest difficulty of Deity and define most multiplayer matchups, as players are never truly safe from the threat they pose until they get <em>pikemen</em>, a unit unlocked by a mid-game tech! Much of the civ tier ranking in Revolution relates to how quickly each can field horse armies or what special bonuses they have that enhance their application.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Disproportionate Retribution</a>: While spies getting caught does result in international incidents, declaring war over catching one might be going a bit far.

For example, in the <em>Civ IV</em> expansions, Great Generals can be attached to units, giving them access to special promotions and letting them upgrade for free when you develop a new unit type. The downside is that the game picks your best defender when the enemy attacks you, and if that's your Great General because of all the upgrades and promotions, and your combat odds aren't 100%, it's entirely possible to lose them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">Leeroy Jenkins</a> style.

If they have their own religion and you try to spread your religion in one of their cities, they get angry, slap you with a diplomatic penalty and tell you to send your missionaries somewhere else.

Merging two units of the same type together (and later, adding a third) creates a "Corps" or "Army" unit, respectively (naval units become "fleets" and "armadas") that is stronger than a unit of that base level. Shaka Zulu was reworked for his reappearance in <em>VI</em> to specialize in this. An Army can even pull a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBeatsLaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBeatsLaser">Rock Beats Laser</a> on a unit of a higher technological tier this way (again, fitting for the Zulus.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">Game-Breaking Bug</a>: The PC build of the original <em>Civilization</em> suffered from one of these at very high levels of advancement. Dubbed "popup pollution", once an indeterminate trigger condition was reached the player would be inundated by pollution squares appearing randomly in their territory. The pollution would appear even if the pollution levels of all cities were at zero. The effect would start as a minor annoyance and then grow, reaching upwards of 25 polluted squares <em>per turn</em>. This could initially be fought with roving bands of Settlers acting as cleanup teams, but by the end the pollution was forming so quickly it could trigger <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalWarming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalWarming">Global Warming</a> before the player's turn came up again. The only solution would be to launch one's spacecraft and end the game.<ul><li> Popup Pollution could even form in the arctic and antarctic regions. These areas were typically not built up in game due to their lack of food production. Without comprehensive rail infrastructure, settlers could not be quickly dispatched to clean up the mess which could then bring about Global Warming even sooner.</li><li> The insidious part of Popup Pollution was that it would tend to only affect those players trying to go for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScoringPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScoringPoints">High Score achievement</a> by increasing their population and tech levels as they ran out the clock towards the end of the game.

If a hill, forest or mountain is one hex between the target and the unit, no dice. An exception is that a unit on a hill can shoot over a forest or hill, but not over a forest on a hill. Units with the "indirect fire" promotion (which is free for modern ranged units) skip all of these effects and can shoot any target in range, as long as the player can see it.

It's even smart enough to change its mind about whether or not to declare war on you.

They're usually named after capitals or other well-known cities of nations not yet present (like Geneva and Zurich from Switzerland). You <em>could</em> straight-up conquer them if they've got territory you want, but it's often to your benefit to do favors for them and stay on their good side, since they'll give you extra faith, happiness, food, culture or military units, as well as access to their luxury and strategic resources, and will declare war against anyone you are at war with. Either way, they add a complicating factor that wasn't seen before. There's also a fun subversion to this; if they are at war with a proper civ and you donate enough units, they can conquer a city of that civ, and if the city is a former capital or has a wonder, they won't have the option to raze and will keep it instead.</li><li> There's also an achievement for beating the game with just one city. Typically, the only victory you can get this way is a cultural victory, but if you play your cards right, that one city will be all you need.</li><li> Most Italian cities and provinces were independent rivals that often warred with each other; it wasn't until relatively recently in history that Italy was one united nation.

It goes like this: A friendly AI civ declares war on an enemy. They invite you to join the war, and then once you're involved and have moved all your troops in, they'll quickly sign a peace treaty with the enemy, leaving you to keep fighting alone, weakening you both and making you look like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a>. Of course, if you don't agree to join in the war with your 'ally', it's a diplomatic penalty. And they'll hardly ever help you if you ask them for aid, except when you are so strong that you could probably win the war by yourself anyway. It's even possible for your former ally to turn sour on you, and think of you as a "warmongering menace to the world!" when the only war you ever declared was <em>the one they asked you to</em>.<ul><li> You can do this to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a> yourself if you have good relations with one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a>.

In the early game, you can get Archers, Spearmen, and even Swordsmen before researching them normally. It takes a turn for the absurd, however, when Ancient Ruins that have been sitting untouched since the beginning of the game can upgrade your Musketmen to Infantry, or your Tank to a Modern Armor. It's less likely to happen now since an official patch has made it impossible for a previously upgraded unit to receive this bonus... but that means it's still possible to build a Knight (strength 20) in the late Medieval Era, send it into a ruin, and get an early-Industrial Cavalry (strength <em>34</em>), which eats any contemporary unit for breakfast.

The catch being - you need to have a city with <em>both</em> iron <em>and</em> coal within its radius to build them. You can't even see where coal is located until researching Steam Engine, which is the final phase of mid-game. Chances of getting this wonder are thus purely to lucky city placement. And nothing hurts more than realising you placed a city one tile away from a spot that would allow to build Iron Works.</li><li> Military Academy allows to form Armies without having a Leader. If that wasn't enough, all Armies gain a +25% bonus to their Attack and Defense, making an already broken feature even more broken. However, to <em>build</em> Military Academy, you need to gain a Leader, form an army with it <em>and</em> win at least a single fight with it.

As soon as the Renaissance hits, England will be locking down maritime trade and invading all over the place with deadly Ships of the Line and Redcoats.</li><li> Venice tends to have a rough early game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandOfOneCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandOfOneCity">because it can only control one city</a>, meaning one wrong move can be fatal, especially if you're placed next to a warlike Civ. However, later on you'll be swimming in boatloads of cash and can simply buy whatever military units you need and bribe every other city-state to your cause, provided of course you don't instead simply use Merchants of Venice to make them your puppets.</li><li> Brazil in <em>V</em> doesn't fare well in the early game because its start bias is for jungle terrain, meaning you'll have a lot of hardly usable real-estate and you'll probably also start next to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">the Aztecs</a>. But in the Renaissance, Brazilwood Camps can be very diversely useful and your University bonuses can make you quite the scientific powerhouse.</li><li> The Zulus in <em>V</em> are both this <em>and</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter">Crutch Character</a>. They have nothing really going for them in the early-game nor the late-game, but in the Medieval period they get their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Impis</a> and their special promotions, allowing them to go on a path of bloody conquest until gunpowder is invented, the Impi become obsolete, and the Zulus are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal">Brought Down to Normal</a>.</li><li> Scout units in <em>Civ VI</em> are individual Magikarps. They start out weaker than the base combat unit of the game, but they have a unique promotion tree that starts with them becoming able to move through rough terrain and terminates with them getting a whopping 20-point combat bonus (that's an entire technological age!) and being able to retreat after attacking. The medieval, industrial and modern versions of the unit trade their melee attack for a ranged one which lets them pick off enemies from a distance without endangering themselves. There's a reason why the modern version of them are Spec Ops soldiers. The trick is keeping them alive long enough to get promoted that high.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness">Medium Awareness</a>:<ul><li> On rare occasions, when declaring war, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat">Alexander the Great</a> will look the player in the eye and ask, "You didn't really think I was going for a cultural victory, did you?"

In <em>V</em> and <em>VI</em>, the Great General/Admiral gives status buffs to units within a couple of tiles, and in <em>VI</em> their bonuses are limited to units of specific eras. In all games' cases, the Great General doesn't fight directly, and in <em>IV</em> and <em>V</em>, they'll be killed in action if directly attacked.

This was not included in <em>V</em>.</li><li> The diplomatic victory has changed quite a bit. In <em>IV</em>, it was about getting enough votes to become supreme leader (good luck doing this in a multiplayer game). In <em>V</em>, it's mostly financial. City states make requests from time to time, and if conquered by another civ, you can liberate them to guarantee a vote from them, but in practice, most influence with city states is simply bought with gold, <em>especially</em> if other players are competing for diplomatic victories.<ul><li> <em>Gods &amp; Kings</em> added a lot more to City States, who can now have several requests active at a time and can be further influenced by Espionage (and Religion, with the right perk). Furthermore, civs can no longer vote for themselves. The AI will vote for whichever Civ they like best, so you can actually improve your chances by being nice to them.</li><li> <em>Brave New World</em> again changed things around for diplomatic victory. Civs can once again vote for themselves with all of their delegates. You get delegates from city state allies, and by getting the Globalization tech and then assigning diplomats instead of spies (and some bonus delegates to be gained in other ways).

By contrast, earlier games have fortification buildings simply add to the health of the city. Certain units can bypass the walls to attack the city directly, and the replenishment of each has different qualifications: life regenerates automatically at a rate determined by population, whereas walls can only be repaired as a construction project which depends on the city's production rate and prevents the city building anything else, like new units.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin">Munchkin</a>:<ul><li> Some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a>, especially in <em>V</em>, play to win.

Playing on the Prince ("normal") difficulty, the AI only gets 60% of the unhappiness that the player does, and gets more happiness to start and an extra point of happiness for each luxury.

One compromise is to conquer rival cities and puppet them rather than annexing them, since you will get the science bonus from their population but not the hit to cultural progression.</li><li> The civics and similar mechanics in previous games generally had an advantage and a drawback.

Fast melee (mounted and armour) have more movement points and usually can move after attacking, but have penalties against cities. Anti-mounted (spearman tree) are weaker than basic melee against anything that isn't their prey. Ranged units are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannons</a> that, although able to attack without hurting themselves, will suffer against melee; the Gatling Gun and later units are equally strong in defence as in offence but can only attack adjacent targets. Siege units are strong against cities but, with few exceptions, need to use one movement point on setting up and have reduced sight range necessitating other units to spot for them.

Democracy will also prevent you from breaking or refusing peace treaties with other factions, meaning that you can only fight when they break the peace or by never engaging in diplomacy.</li><li> Spain in <em>V</em> seems to have this as an inevitability due to how their unique trait works: they get double the yield from Natural Wonders (including El Dorado) and you'll often see a tasty Natural Wonder within the limits of a City-State.

Even several old-hat Civs have received leaders who are far less well-known (but perhaps more suitable) than the old, familiar faces. Gone is Alexander the Great, with Greece instead being led by either Pericles of Athens or Gorgo of Sparta. And rather than Augustus or Julius Caesar, Rome is spearheaded by Emperor Trajan. Add to that wonders such as Great Zimbabwe, Huey Teocalli, Mahabodhi and the Potala Palace, and you've got a great opportunity to actually learn a bunch of <em>new</em> stuff about history from playing the game... or, more likely, getting curious enough to read the Civilopedia entries.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfRock">The Power of Rock</a>:<ul><li> Rock 'N Roll is a constructable Wonder of the World in <em>IV</em>.

Purchased using Faith, rock bands are sent overseas to tour, generating tourism for their home country and helping them win a cultural victory. Upon creating a rock band, you name it and give it one of several promotions that inform what type of music it plays, giving it various bonuses; for instance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlamRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlamRock">Glam Rock</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reggae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reggae">reggae</a>, and festival bands gain bonuses for playing at theater squares, water parks, and national parks respectively, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianRock">religious bands</a> can convert foreign cities, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndiePop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndiePop">indie rock</a> bands <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousSpirit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousSpirit">reduce loyalty in foreign cities</a> (great for when you want to flip a neighboring city with shaky loyalty).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerupLetdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerupLetdown">Power-Up Letdown</a>:<ul><li> Scouts are early units excellent for exploring, mainly since they ignore most terrain movement penalties.

Fans have coined this unit the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Portmanteau" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Portmanteau">scarcher</a>", and it keeps these scouting abilities after it is upgraded through the ages, so even as a machine gunner it enjoys the scouting bonuses, while normal scouts cannot upgrade at all and thus become thoroughly obsolete for combat.</li><li> Sometimes in <em>V</em>, if you're using a Warrior for some quick exploration and they stop on some Ancient Ruins, they can turn into spearmen. Great for everyone else! Not so great if you're playing as The Huns, which replaces spearmen with battering rams as their unique unit, leaving you with a siege unit that can't attack other units or properly protect itself. You best get that ram back to your city so you can put it to better use, lest the barbarians come and smash it to bits.</li><li> Some of the Unique Units lose their massive bonuses when they get upgraded.

Each game after the first altered the combat equations in various ways without actually removing the problem. Fundamentally, it's about units having attack and (in some versions) defense values that fail to take into account basic concepts like range. Therefore, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">Random Number God</a> will eventually allow the spearman to get lucky.<ul><li> With the right combination of bonuses, it doesn't even need to be a lucky roll. In <em>II</em>, a veteran phalanx (+50% strength) in a mountain-top (x3 defence) city with walls (x3 defence) would win more often than not against anything less than a tank.</li><li> Further, there are some "auto win" situations, as in <em>IV</em>, where ships and aircraft in base/port are automatically destroyed when a land unit occupies their square. Yes, this means you can take out a squadron of stealth fighters and a fleet of battleships with a club-wielding warrior (presumably they bash them into nothing while on the ground/port).<ul><li> <em>V</em> did this on water prior to the <em>Gods &amp; Kings</em> expansion. Any embarked land unit can be instantly killed by any ship moving on them.</li><li> Also made worse by inconsistent unit range scaling: riflemen, modern infantry and tanks are intended to be late-game counterparts of early game infantry and cavalry (swordsmen and cavalry, etc) so they are melee units with no ranged attack capability, while archers and crossbowmen (and the English Longbow deserves a special mention for having 3 range) have at least 2 range and can attack these modern units without fear of enemy retaliation. Even more strangely, in <em>V</em>, the late-game counterpart of archers, the machine gun, has only 1 range. You essentially lose 1 range in exchange for (much) more firepower when upgrading archers into machine guns. It's generally worth it, but could make you lose battles in some edge cases.</li><li> In <em>IV</em>, on the lower difficulties, you are guaranteed to win your first encounters with barbarians. If you haven't used up these "free wins", you can create a barbarian modern armour with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DebugMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DebugMode">World Builder</a> and your warrior will defeat it.</li></ul></li><li> In the first two games, aircraft were moveable units. Hence you had surreal things like a phalanx beating a bomber.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuthlessModernPirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuthlessModernPirates">Ruthless Modern Pirates</a>: In later games, particularly <em>V</em> and <em>VI</em>, this is what barbarians become once you hit the more modern tech ages. Their spiky tribal outposts become a more modern shantytown and they keep pace technologically with you, deploying more advanced units to harass your civilization. And since barbarian camps on the coast put out ships as well as land units, expect them to do actual piracy on your sea trade routes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandIsWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandIsWater">Sand Is Water</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSkyIsAnOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSkyIsAnOcean">The Sky Is an Ocean</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsAnOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsAnOcean">Space Is an Ocean</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LavaIsBoilingKoolAid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LavaIsBoilingKoolAid">Lava is Boiling Kool-Aid</a>: Many game mods substitute different types of terrain for oceans. For example, the Test of Time fantasy cloud world has sky, the Sci-fi orbital map has space, and a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune">Dune</a></em>-based mod uses sand for the "ocean" terrain, while using, respectively, clouds, orbital platforms, and rocky terrain as "land".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a>: Across all the games, it's disturbingly easy to abuse the save feature to get favorable battle outcomes or avoid negative randomly generated events. Some versions try to prevent this by saving the random number generator's seed along with the game, so you get the exact same outcomes after a reload unless you do things in a different order. This option can be turned off, however.<ul><li> The problem is, thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfLoading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfLoading">Loads and Loads of Loading</a>, said abuse can take a very long time.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayYourPrayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayYourPrayers">Say Your Prayers</a>: <em>Baba Yetu</em> from <em>Civ IV</em> is the Lord's Prayer in Swahili, but, like <em>Sabaton</em>'s <em>The Carolean's Prayer</em>, the singer isn't dying but paying gratitude to the Almighty.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">Schizo Tech</a>: A particularly skilled player can roll over his spear-equipped enemies with legions of tanks. (Well, all except That One Unit...) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees">Just like Japan did in real life.</a><ul><li> This is pretty much bound to happen in any game where one player runs away with the science race. What could be more satisfying than crushing enemy spearmen with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Giant Death Robots</a>?</li><li> This problem was noticeably worse before the concept of technological eras was further developed in <em>III</em>. In the first two games, one could climb disturbingly far up just one or two branches of the tech tree before finally having to go back and research, say, The Wheel.</li><li> In <em>II</em> and earlier, you didn't necessarily even have to go back and research it. You could trade for techs without having all the prerequisites for them, so if you had all the follow-on techs, and didn't need the specific units or abilities that a particular tech gave you (chariots, in the case of The Wheel in <em>II</em>), you could ignore it completely. Which could lead to hilarious exchanges with AI civs: "We notice that your puny civilization hasn't even discovered The Wheel. We'll gladly give it to you in exchange for the secret of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness">Automobile</a>."</li><li> While tech trading was taken out of <em>V</em>, it is possible to get units that would logically need a technology you don't have. For example, you can make Chariot Archers without Archery, Ironclads without Sailing, or Gatling Guns without Gunpowder.</li><li> Resources can work either way in <em>III</em>: India's elite unit, the War Elephant, can be built without access to ivory (represented as an elephant on the map). Samurai require both horses and iron despite not being mounted units. Saltpeter is needed to build Musketmen but not Riflemen (the notion being that industrial production supplants native saltpeter as a source); however, on the other hand, a civilization that has oil but not coal still cannot build railroads (diesel locomotives apparently aren't a thing in <em>III's</em> 'verse). Many of these were fixed in <em>IV</em> (War Elephants require ivory, Samurai replace Macemen instead of Knights and don't require horses, Saltpeter was removed entirely), but you still can't build railroads without Coal.</li><li> A 2020 update for <em>VI</em> includes an option to randomize the order of the tech tree within a given era, making it possible to develop a technology before its logical prerequisite (to pick a simple example, Advanced Flight before regular Flight, meaning you theoretically know how to make a jet engine, but not the hangar to build it in).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale">Sci-Fi Writers Have No Sense of Scale</a>: <em>IV</em> has a demographics section, and most of it is alright. However, the size in square miles is ridiculously low compared to what it should be. For instance, in an Earth map that ships with <em>Beyond the Sword</em>, you can own all of China, Mongolia, Korea, Siberia and Afghanistan, and it'll give you 441,000 square miles. In real life, that's only the size of Colombia. Population amounts shown in the demographics tend to be fairly low as well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScoringPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScoringPoints">Scoring Points</a>: Each civ in a game is scored based on how many wonders, techs, and tiles of land they have. This doesn't always signify who has the upper-hand, but it's an okay indication of a civ's development, and decides the winner if the game goes on for too long. In most games, researching Future Tech only provides bonus points; <em>IV</em> is the exception, as it added happiness and health with each Future Tech, which added up fast, but it went back to being points-only in <em>V</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney">Screw the Rules, I Have Money!</a>: If you're rich enough you can do most anything, including paying off faction leaders for technology, cities and resources, and rushing to complete city improvements in a single turn when normally they would take dozens.<ul><li> Alternately, <em>Screw The Rules, I Have Faith</em> in <em>VI</em>; you <em>have</em> to use Faith to buy certain units, but you can also use it to buy religious buildings.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondPlaceIsForLosers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondPlaceIsForLosers">Second Place Is for Losers</a>: In <em>V</em>, if your capital has been seized by storm and every other city you founded <em>razed to the ground</em>, you're treated to a picture of the crumbling remains of your once-proud empire, now crushed under the sands of time, and a message regarding your loss.

This could happen at the standard difficulty as well, but to a much smaller degree.</li><li> Diplomacy-wise in <em>V</em>, they can tell you to move your units away from their borders, giving you the option to declare war immediately, or promise to never declare. Picking the latter and then declaring war before the promise expires hurts relations with every other civ.</li><li> Trade deals are a pile of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadsIWinTailsYouLose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadsIWinTailsYouLose">Heads I Win, Tails You Lose</a> in favor of the computers, though it's not quite as bad in <em>V</em> with its expansions. If other civs dislike you, they will give you very grudging prices for anything you try to trade them; and if you're friends with them, they'll ask for a gift of gold or a spare resource. And if <em>they</em> have something <em>you</em> need!... Well! Hope you enjoy being rejected and accused of "making an arrogant demand" for the next 100 turns or so.<ul><li> As of <em>Gods and Kings</em> the AI will usually suggest renewing expired treaties like open borders. Which is nice, except they will sometimes tell you that they no longer like the original treaty and demand you add more on your end.</li></ul></li><li> For <em>Revolution</em>, you have things like AI spies being totally invisible (unless it's one they captured in the field from you), being able to remove settled Great People from cities and relocate them, the ability to defend a city with a 0 defense unit like a Spy/Great Person (to clarify, even though the 0 defense unit will always lose, you still have to have enough units to <em>attack it</em> else they keep the city; If it happens to <strong>you</strong>, the city and all 0 def units in will be captured when your last defender dies to an attacking unit), and being able to move naval or air units into your territory/block worked tiles without causing a war. There are also a host of abilities which are more akin to full-blown cheating, like unit teleportation around the map into any fog of war tile, but these were owned up to by the dev team as necessary to save on performance that proper logistical behavior would eat up on the weaker home video game consoles.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelEscalation">Sequel Escalation</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Inverted</a> with <em>V</em>, in its vanilla, pre-expansion form anyway: no religion, no units stacked on top of each other (except for one military and one non-military unit), a less-arcane Social Policies system to replace the Civics, and only one tile improvement allowed on a tile at a time (plus roads). The intent was to clear out a lot of the cruft that had built up in the series. Religion and more complex features were added back in by the expansions, but even then, they tended to be easier to grasp than they were in <em>IV</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel Hook</a>: After the release of another Sid Meier game, winning a round of <em>Civilization V</em> gives you a summary screen with three options: return to the main menu, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustOneMoreLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustOneMoreLevel">"Just...

But each building can get a bonus depending on whether the stuff in it is 1) from different nations and/or 2) from different time periods, and <em>each building has specific criteria</em>.

They can be deployed from a silo improvement, missile submarine, or bomber, and any tile within range is a valid target.

Any unit that ends its turn in Radiation takes 50 damage (and all units have 100 max health), more than they can heal in a single turn.

There are a lot of other dialogues that do count as this though; if someone bullies a city state you are protecting, you can either forgive them, which lowers your influence with the city state, or say "you will pay for this", which keeps the city state happy, does not count as a denouncement against the bully, and basically does nothing except peeve the bully for a little while. Other actions allow you to respond "you will pay for this in time" if you want, but it has little if any effect.<ul><li> <em>Gods &amp; Kings</em> makes denouncements even more meaningful, as they undo certain diplomatic actions like embassies and declarations of friendship.

On the other hand, if you declare war on them and predictably steamroll their civilization off the map, they <em>are</em> stupid enough to not throw themselves at your feet and beg for mercy, and will still snort and posture when you approach for a treaty. In <em>V</em> they also don't appear to take Defensive Pacts into account when judging strength, and so will eagerly throw themselves into war with a coalition that can wipe them off the map in order to fight one of the members who happens to be of lower power.

Most players, however, seem to regard this as a non-issue, regarding land and air units to represent larger groupings (what seems to be ten Riflemen is actually a whole division of rifles; what seems to be one Jet Fighter is actually a whole wing of jets). For naval units, early units like Galleys seem to be groupings, but it would actually make sense for later units to be individual ships (those things are big and expensive enough, and tend to be built in smaller numbers anyway).

An empire that manages to secure good territory early on can research faster and produce more units, making it easier for them to expand even further.

Environmentalism became <em>far</em> more powerful in the <em>Beyond the Sword</em> expansion.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VariablePlayerGoals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VariablePlayerGoals">Variable Player Goals</a>: Any civilization can achieve any of the win conditions, but some civs have particular traits that make achieving certain goals easier than others.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VastBureaucracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VastBureaucracy">Vast Bureaucracy</a>: Different games have found different ways to represent this:<ul><li> The first three games had a corruption mechanic which affected individual cities, affected by government type, empire size, and the particular city's distance from the capital. This is supposed to represent a sprawling empire's tendency to be plagued by expensive red tape, inefficiency, and graft.</li><li> <em>IV</em> replaces the corruption mechanic with city maintenance costs and Civics upkeep, largely representing the same thing. Unlike corruption (which drains a fixed proportion of a city's produced resources), the maintenance costs stay relatively static as the city grows - meaning that building a new city initially actually harms your economy, but once the city's developed the maintenance costs are negligible compared to the money the city produces. (By comparison, in the earlier games there was little reason not to grab land as quickly as possible as it would always at least produce <em>something</em>). There's also a Bureaucracy Civic, which provides a significant boost to your civ's capital (and no other city at all).</li><li> <em>V</em> just gave up and made everything global; the empire <em>itself</em> is the basic unit of measure, instead of individual cities:<ul><li> If you build a Colosseum, it adds +X smileys to your <em>empire's</em> Happiness total. This makes war a lot easier, since it eliminates the catch-22 of newly-conquered citizens who are too furious to build things that would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak">un-furiize</a> them. However, it does cause some Fridge Logic when you realize that angry citizens in newly-conquered, say, Shanghai are being pacified by the goings-on of a theater in New York. However, it was later changed so that basic happiness buildings can't provide more happiness than there are people in that city.</li><li> On the other hand, other mechanics, particularly Culture, slant the game towards empires with a small number of well-developed cities. The more towns you have, the more Culture points each new policy requires; this slows down anyone who's going for a Culture Victory or who just wants the bonuses policies provide. Plus, the AI will get hostile if you encroach on (what they perceive to be) their territory.</li><li> National Wonders: Every civilization gets to build one, but they require that each city under your control build one of a specific structure first (everyone needs a Library to build a National College in your capital, for example) so the more cities you have, the harder it becomes to build the National Wonder.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VelvetRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VelvetRevolution">Velvet Revolution</a>: Using the culture mechanic allows you to bloodlessly take over rival cities by simply overwhelming them. Earlier Civ games had this as you expanding your border to envelop rival cities. <em>Brave New World</em> for <em>V</em> allows this to happen when you put so much cultural pressure on a rival ideology that their citizens revolt ("We hate being Order! We're joining Autocracy instead!"). A balance patch also allows you to conquer enemy cities by force but leave their population completely untouched and receptive to their new owners when you take them, if your culture is dominant over theirs.<ul><li> In the <em>Rise and Fall</em> expansion for <em>VI</em>, the new Loyalty mechanic does a similar thing: your citizens aren't going to be happy if their city is on the other side of the continent a thousand miles away from your capital and are eventually going to revolt and join another Civ unless you can find ways to placate them and keep them loyal to you.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeteranUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeteranUnit">Veteran Unit</a>: Unit experience mechanics have been present in all iterations of the game to date. The first two simply had a binary distinction between "veteran" and "non-veteran"; later games have added increasingly more elaborate implementations.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCaringPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCaringPotential">Video Game Caring Potential</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentAdorationRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentAdorationRating">"We Love The King Day celebrated in &lt;city name&gt;."</a><ul><li> It's a part of gameplay for <em>V</em>; a City will request a certain resource, and if you can get hold of that resource, the local populace start getting busy.</li><li> If a Civilization is defeated by another player and you liberate one of their former cities, they'll be back in the game and you'll be given a large relationship bonus for resurrecting them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">Video Game Cruelty Potential</a>: Poison your neighbors' water supplies!

If you manage to subjugate or genocide every race but your own, the game declares you a winner.</li><li> Some civilizations (particularly in <em>V</em>) are specifically geared towards dog-kicking, like Montezuma, who gains culture by sacrificing captured enemies, or Genghis Khan, who is designed to hunt down and destroy City-States. Also, the "Autocracy" policy track is specifically modeled after conquering the world by force and all of its policies are named after unfortunate things associated with fascism.</li><li> Among the Luxury resources in <em>V</em> is Ivory, and its tile is depicted with, of course, elephants on it. Ivory remains very much a luxury resource that improves the happiness of your Empire even when you already have discovered the Ecology tech. Same thing, of course, with the Whale tiles. Or the Fur tiles, even if those ones show animals that are not considered as endangered - foxes. (This was not the case in <em>IV</em> where all these resources eventually became obsolete.) On the other hand, the game lets you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCaringPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCaringPotential">pass motions in the World Congress to ban those luxuries as immoral</a>.</li><li> The <em>Gathering Storm</em> expansion for <em>VI</em> adds climate change, which will slowly melt sea ice and flood low-lying regions as you pump more carbon into the atmosphere. The devs have stated you can either try to slow down the effects, or you can be a jerk and weaponise it by purposely raising sea levels and watch as all your enemies' coastal regions get flooded.</li><li> <em>VI</em> later added an Apocalypse Mode which adds the soothsayer, a unit that can cause natural disasters to happen. As <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk0QVqx-1Ss">SpiffingBrit demonstrated<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, because the AI does not take into account whether a natural disaster is actually natural or caused by you, it's perfectly possible to go around crippling rival Civs' cities by causing them to be buried under sandstorms, snowstorms, floodwater, or volcanic ash.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">Video Game Remake</a>:<ul><li> <em>I</em> is a remake, and also a loose adaptation, of the original board game. The board game had a fixed map, with predefined city locations and resources (and was an accounting nightmare as each city had to have resources collected and recorded manually). The computer adaption allowed for map generation, free city placement, and to have the computer do the bookkeeping for you.</li><li> Various scenarios from the games are updated versions of earlier scenarios&mdash;for instance, the "Mongol Conquests" DLC scenario from <em>V</em> is an improved version of the one in the <em>Warlords</em> expansion for <em>IV</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense">Violation of Common Sense</a>:<ul><li> Some of the Achievements for <em>V</em> require you to do deliberately counterintuitive things, like going for Cultural or Diplomatic Victory while using the Domination-focused Autocracy ideology.</li><li> If you've got a nuclear weapon and a bunch of enemies about to take one of your cities, launching said weapon is a perfectly viable way to clear out those enemies. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> citizens would probably object to the government <em>launching a nuclear weapon upon one of its own urban areas</em>, but in <em>Civ</em> all it does is shut down production for a few turns (which, considering the other option of losing it entirely, is definitely the much better option).</li><li> <em>VI</em> added Apocalypse Mode which adds the soothsayer, a unit that can cause natural disasters to happen. Normally a natural disaster will be met with grumbling from a player as all their improved tiles and districts get pillaged, but if you never built or improved anything this negative is basically not a thing, leaving only the positive of improved tile yield. So, the solution is ([[<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Sarcasm Mode</a> obviously) to cause flood upon flood or volcanic eruption after eruption to improve food output to ridiculous levels.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolenceIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolenceIsTheOnlyOption">Violence Is the Only Option</a>: When dealing with barbarians.<ul><li> At higher difficulties, anything other than a Domination Victory becomes practically impossible.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarElephants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarElephants">War Elephants</a>:<ul><li> In <em>II</em>, they become available when you discover Polytheism, for some reason. In <em>III</em>, they're India's special unit, replacing knights.</li><li> In <em>IV</em>, they become available when you discover Construction, but you also need access to Ivory.</li><li> Three separate versions show up as special units in <em>V</em>; the standard War Elephant replacing the Chariot Archer for India, Naresuan's Elephant replacing Siam's Knight, and African Forest Elephant replacing Carthage's Horseman.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarForFunAndProfit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarForFunAndProfit">War for Fun and Profit</a>:<ul><li> The Honor social policy tree in <em>V</em> after the 1.4.X patch. Adopting it provides a Culture bonus similar to what Montezuma's special ability gives (and stacks with it, doubling the Aztec's Culture output) and finishing it allows you to earn money for killing enemy units, making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarForFunAndProfit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarForFunAndProfit">War for Fun and Profit</a> a viable tactic for fighting-oriented Civs like Germany, Japan, the Aztecs and the like.</li><li> Something that the A.I. civilizations invoke in <em>V</em>. They will declare war against another civilization that they have military parity with, then rather than pour all their resources into beating down that civ, they will just fight it to a stalemate. After getting bored of this, it will then propose a peace treaty, with terms highly favorable to themselves and costly to the other civilization. In doing so, it gets to lose some of the military units it has been paying maintenance on, and gets some nice access to luxury and strategic resources, and a fair amount of money to boot. This can even happen without any enemy unit ever entering your borders.</li><li> The <em>Civ IV</em> AI actually factors this into its (rather complex) war planning. If an AI is under economic stress, undoubtedly due to their tendency to overproduce units, it will check for a valid land target (at least 8 border tiles abutting each other) among other things like power and disposition and possibly attack. The goal would be to launch either a limited war to pillage improvements for gold and get compensation for a peace treaty, or a total war to capture more profitable territory and acquire city capture bounty. Coveting thy neighbor's land indeed!</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWarJustBefore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWarJustBefore">The War Just Before</a>: In <em>Civilization V</em>, a common warmonger strategy in single-player games is to accept a peace treaty offered by an AI opponent, and then use the time of guaranteed peace to rebuild and upgrade their military. Once the peace treaty expires, injured units have healed, new units have been built, and the player is ready to roll out for another war.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillHavePerfectHealthInTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillHavePerfectHealthInTheFuture">We Will Have Perfect Health in the Future</a>:<ul><li> One of the wonders in <em>I</em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CureForCancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CureForCancer">Cure for Cancer</a>, a monument that bestows +1 happiness.</li><li> In <em>III</em> and <em>IV</em>, every Future Tech increases the civilization's health and happiness.

In <em>V - Brave New World</em>, each city under a player's control, including puppets, makes techs and policies cost a little more science/culture to unlock, resulting in a tough choice between keeping a small city without much potential, or burning it to the ground for a temporary but large happiness hit. Too much unhappiness, and rebel barbarians appear <em>and</em> your own forces become less effective. In addition, if happiness levels drop <em>far</em> below, one of your cities will coup and convert to a happier civ, which can disrupt the boundaries of your empires.

Depending on the game's tech progress, these might not go out of style for a long time. Unit-wise, Airships can only bomb ground and sea units for a bit of damage, which is helpful given how strong garrisoned units can be, though it's not much damage (only able to reduce them to 80% of their max HP), and have no counters (short of taking the city they are based in) before Flight (and if only <em>you</em> have that...).</li><li> A much more true-to-the-trope example is the "Empire of the Smoky Skies" scenario included with the <em>Gods &amp; Kings</em> expansion for <em>V</em>.

Because a converted city isn't actually a blow to an opponent (they still get all the yields of the city) it's trivially easy for them to just buy a missionary and convert it back. Instead of doing it one city at a time, the most effective way of shutting down a competing religion is to build up a force of missionaries then send them all to convert every city at once making it so it's physically impossible for your opponent to undo the damage since they don't have any cities left to buy missionaries that aren't your religion.</li></ul></div><hr><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">''Just... one... more... edit!'' *click*</a>
