It's possible to exercise control over dialogue trees to better control one's character. You play as either Alexios or Kassandra, brother and sister, who both descend from the bloodline of King Leonidas of the Agiad dynasty of Spartan kings. A series of incidents sends you far from home, becoming a mercenary (or <em>misthios</em> in Greek) known throughout the land as the "Eagle Bearer" because of their eagle "pet" of sorts, Ikaros. The Eagle Bearer makes a living in the midst of the ongoing war between Sparta and Athens. As their involvement grows, they come to be embroiled in a conflict with forces behind the war seeking to take control of all of Greece, and the plans said forces have for them and their family.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Free <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">DLC</a> includes the <em>Lost Tales of Greece</em>, a series of quest chains centered around several locales in the Greek world.

The second DLC, "The Fate of Atlantis," continues the game's storyline (specifically, the Atlantis arc), and has the Eagle Bearer exploring re-creations of realms where the Ancient Greek gods reside, including the afterlife.

On the plus side, the reward is a suit of armor which is apparently <em>very</em> snuggly.</li><li> A quest in Messara requires one shark fang. That doesn't sound so bad until it turns out that shark teeth are a rare item, sharks are far from an easy kill, and you can kill twenty sharks or more without getting one fang - in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> sharks not only have hundreds of teeth but regrow any teeth they lose all through life.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>: There isn't a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompletionMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompletionMeter">Completion Meter</a> like in previous titles but achievements are awarded for reaching major milestones. Notably you don't have to complete the majority of side-quests or conquer all the enemy-outposts to earn every achievement. Nonetheless, several objectives which the player can max out are as follows:<ul><li> Completing the main storyline (i.e. everything indicated in the Quests menu as part of your odyssey).</li><li> Reaching the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelCap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelCap">Level Cap</a> of 50 (99 as of update 1.14).</li><li> Become the Rank 1 Mercenary (with four tiers above that being added through updates).</li><li> Fully upgrading the <em>Adrestia</em>.</li><li> Defeating the five Arena challenges.</li><li> Defeating the Cult of Kosmos and fully upgrading the Spear of Leonidas, the latter of which goes hand-in-hand with the former because the necessary upgrade components are obtained from each defeated Cultist.</li><li> Defeating the four major bonus bosses (Cyclops, Sphinx, Minotaur and Medusa) and returning their artifacts to Atlantis.</li><li> Completing the questlines involving Hippokrates, Markos, Xenia, and the Daughters of Artemis.</li><li> Setting foot in every region in Greece and exploring all the underwater ruins.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySharpBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySharpBlade">Absurdly Sharp Blade</a>: The Atlantean Blade, a legendary dagger, provides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack">+30% armor penetration</a> as its unique perk, making it particularly powerful against heavily armored opponents. It also looks a lot like a modern, albeit somewhat oversized combat knife, which in combination with its name implies at least a partial Isu origin.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a>: Both times overlapping with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring">Offing the Offspring</a>:<ul><li> The game <em>starts</em> with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">'s father sacrificing his younger child (the PC's sibling) to the gods to fulfill an oracle's prophecy. When the PC intervenes, killing a Spartan elder in the process, they fall off along with the elder</span>. He does seem quite conflicted about it, but he still qualifies since he eventually goes through with it instead of doing the right thing.</li><li> In the Valley of Olympia, the Eagle Bearer can agree to help the patriarchs of two feuding families track down and kill whoever broke into their shared treasure vault. Turns out the culprits <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">were said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet">patriarchs' young adult children who are in love and wanted to elope and start a new life elsewhere</a>. The patriarchs' reaction? Fly in a rage and order the Eagle Bearer to kill the two lovebirds anyway, topped off with the particularly heartless argument that they have other children to continue their bloodlines. Worse, no matter how diplomatically the Eagle Bearer tries to resolves the situation, two people will be dead by the end of it &mdash; the lovers or the fathers, depending on player input</span>.</li><li> An optional side-quest the player can get has a Spartan woman sending the Eagle Bearer out to find and <em>kill</em> her son for deserting.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AceCustom">Ace Custom</a>: A number of the Legendary Armor sets are shinier, more powerful versions of more common armor sets. For instance: Assassin set -&gt; Athenian Hero set, Ares set -&gt; Spartan Hero set, Persian Warrior set -&gt; Immortal set, Mercenary set -&gt; Pirate set, etc.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionFilmQuietDramaScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionFilmQuietDramaScene">Action Film, Quiet Drama Scene</a>: A few are sprinkled in throughout the various campaigns, but the most notable has to come near the end when the Eagle Bearer finds Sokrates in the cemetery outside Athens <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and they quietly reflect on the lives lost in the shadow war against the Cult; Phoibe, Perikles, and Brasidas before joining the rest of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> for a small victory celebration</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>:<ul><li> Kassandra, as the playable female protagonist.</li><li> Several of the love interests like Daphnae (head of the Daughters of Artemis), Kyra (Rebel Leader), Odessa (Adventurer), Roxanna (Gladiator) &amp; Xenia (Pirate Leader).</li><li> Many of the Mercenaries, both custom-made and randomly generated, are women.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal">Added Alliterative Appeal</a>: Many mercenary contract titles on the notice board have this going on.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">A God Am I</a>: A sidequest deals with a guy who sincerely thinks he's a god, evidently thanks to finding an Isu artifact, which he believes is the key to Olympos itself. Brontes the Thunderer... "disabuses" him of this notion in a decidedly fatal way.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcoholInducedStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcoholInducedStupidity">Alcohol-Induced Stupidity</a>: Examining the incredibly rickety diving board over a shark-infested pit in the Pre-Trials of the Minotaur can have the Eagle Bearer ask if all the other contestants were drunk. Apparently, they were.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCrimesAreEqual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCrimesAreEqual">All Crimes Are Equal</a>: Almost. There's only a single punishment for the handful of crimes the Eagle Bearer can commit: death by mercenary. The only difference is how often you can commit them before the first merc goes on the hunt for you. Thieving is the most minor offence (20% bounty), followed by murder (33%), sinking a non-pirate ship (50%), assaulting a fort (200%) and finally, killing a nation leader in plain sight (500%, an instant full bar). However, one major exception exists: the Valley of Olympia in the Elis region. Any crime committed there is punished five times as harshly as elsewhere in Greece because of the Olympic Truce, so a single witnessed murder is worth almost two bounty levels.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllForNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllForNothing">All for Nothing</a>: One quest line in Boeotia has the Eagle Bearer assisting an archaeologist in recovering stelae from ruins to uncover some kind of message. When they do, the archaeologist is unable to see it, but the Eagle Bearer can (because of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnevenHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnevenHybrid">Uneven Hybrid</a> status). The guy is understandably upset at the thought of all his hard work being for nothing, while the Eagle Bearer can walk away with some nice Rare gear for their trouble.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue">All Myths Are True</a>: While this has applied to a certain extent throughout the franchise, in <em>Odyssey</em> the Eagle Bearer can encounter several Isu remnants that are direct inspirations for the myths of cyclopses, gorgons and more, which also lend direct credence to figures such as Theseus. Many of the other Isu elements feel "fresher" simply because the game's time period is so much closer to the Isu backstory than before, and many of the Greek populace's beliefs in the existence of gods is more justifiable as they <em>did</em> exist relatively recently.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALoadOfBull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALoadOfBull">A Load of Bull</a>: The mythological Minotaur is fought as a secret boss. Appropriately, it's fought in a labyrinth ruin fitted with Theseus' string, which the mythological hero used in order to find his way around. There's also the Kretan Bull, a legendary animal which can be found and fought on the same island.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmostDeadGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmostDeadGuy">Almost Dead Guy</a>: The game goes without the typical <em>Assassin's Creed</em> mechanism of the memory corridor, but this trope still manages to get in there.<ul><li> Elpenor, despite taking a severe pounding from an angry Eagle Bearer, still manages to gasp out a few words before croaking for good.</li><li> A guy on Naxos working for the Phoenix, who was ambushed by the forces of Paros. He manages to last long enough for the Eagle Bearer to get to him, tell him they've abducted his boss and then <em>immediately</em> keels over.</li><li> A guy on Lesbos, who went hunting a wolf with his friend only to get ambushed and dragged off by its pissed-off mate. The Eagle Bearer finds him, and he manages to explain the whole situation. If the Eagle Bearer goes to fight the wolf, which is just next to him, he'll die by the time they're done.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>: Of the three independent yet relentlessly aggressive factions in the world, only the Daughters of Artemis can be reasoned with at all, and that requires completing a lengthy quest chain that spans the entire level range up to 49.

Lambda actually corresponds to L, and it refers to the founder of the Spartans, Lakaedaemon, with the Spartans also being commonly called Lakaedaemonians. More subtly, the Assassin's symbol is also present on the upgraded forms of the Spear of Leonidas, as well as on the Mercenary Helmet, implying the Assassins' connection with the Isu as established in this game.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a>: It's safe to say that you'll come across at least one for every region or island you visit.<ul><li> Hyrkanos, a minor mercenary in Megaris who's been causing problems for the Spartan forces.

Ignoring that however, a mountain range is added in the north to prevent the player from leaving Greece, and the land of Thrace (now the country of Turkey) is pushed <em>very</em> eastward to make it look like the player shouldn't sail there at all (to put this in context, Chios and Lesbos in real life are right on the coast of Turkey, and much closer to Turkey than to Greece). The Macedonian area is shifted south, the island of Kriti moved north into the game map, and many of the smaller islands in the Aegean Sea are removed. The island of Thera is also depicted with palatial ruins on its caldera, both within the Animus and in the modern day segment which occurs there, when no such ruins have ever existed there.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory">Artistic License &#150; History</a>: Ancient Greece is far away enough, with very few written sources, that <em>Odyssey</em> takes more license than usual (for instance, the character of Aspasia, an actual historical figure, has nothing known about her other than being Perikles' mistress and being smart). The inaccuracies are justified in-universe by the DNA sample used for the Animus being too corrupted over time to produce a cohesive simulation, so Layla and Victoria supplemented the data with information from historical information of varying quality, primarily the works of Herodotos.<ul><li> The Battle of Thermopylai in the prologue is more or less a rehash of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred">300</a></em> without any of the 700 Thespians and 400 Thebans who also stood against Persia. According to Herodotus in the game, Leonidas sent the latter soldiers away when he saw they were afraid of the coming battle, as he only wanted soldiers with the appropriate amount of resolve. The actual Herodotus in his Histories reports that Leonidas commanded some of his allies to beat a retreat while choosing to hold off the Persians for strategic reasons, while the Thespians and Thebans volunteered to serve and fight alongside the Spartans. Likewise, the cut-scene before the battle shows the Spartans in their phalanx, albeit with much shorter spears than was typical, and held at the waist instead of at their shoulders so they could stab over their locked shields. When you can take control of Leonidas, they appear to have completely abandoned the phalanx formation that they were famous for <em>never</em> abandoning, ironic since this formation, coupled with the battle taking place in a narrow gorge, was indeed the primary reason 300 Spartans killed 10,000 Persians (and some historians speculate that without the treachery, the Spartans would have made a successful defence of the gorge).</li><li> Practically nothing survived from Ancient Sparta. The few ruins that survive tell little about the social life and all written records about the Spartans were written by non-Spartan Greek historians (mostly Athenians, notably Xenophon, but also Hellenic Greeks)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0q00v');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0q00v" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0q00v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Spartans did not begin to write about themselves before the Hellenic period. The only piece of Spartan writing known to us from before then is a partial poem from the 7th century BC</span>. Much of what is known of Sparta's culture comes from Plutarch, who wrote about it in the 1st century AD... almost 5 centuries after the Sparta seen in the game. The game's depiction of Lakonia as such is entirely based on current conjecture. Additionally, the battle sequences are entirely different from the Spartans' use of phalanxes and formation.</li><li> The art direction provides a more colorful portrayal of Greece than other works, but there are still white marble statues alongside many painted ones as well as a mix of history and mythology, though it might be justified given that even in the ancient times, many believed that the myths were real events or based on reality. For instance, stuff like Odysseus' Palace being a well known ruin on Ithaca is not recorded but it's likely that a location believed to have been such did exist then, since many cities would advertise or fabricate such connections if they had ruins nearby. The giant statues seen in the game are not only ahistorical, but also physically impossible; the tensile strength of stone is not enough to prevent such large constructs, like the statue of Zeus in the starting area of the game, from falling under their own weight.</li><li> The armor, weapon, and costume designs also take creative license, with some soldiers' panoplies being nothing more than a loincloth, helmet, and shoulder pads. Granted, this is largely done to emphasize the fantastical and mythological elements intertwined with the main historical narrative; in Ancient Greek mythology, wacky suits of armor and weapons were all over the place.</li><li> The game portrays the Pythia at Delphi as someone who can be freely consulted at any time; one only needs to stand in line. In reality she was only available on a single day per month, and only for nine months per year because Apollo wasn't at Delphi during the winter months. There were also many sacred rites involved, such as throwing cold water on a goat to see if it shivered &mdash; if it didn't, it was a sign Apollo wasn't available and people had to wait another month. Oracle readings weren't free &mdash; quite the contrary, in fact &mdash; and the Pythia herself was supposedly seated on a tripod during readings.</li><li> The Athenian ostracism seen in one mission takes dramatic liberties, and gets several details incorrect. For starters, the number of "ostraka" (broken pieces of shells used for voting) tallied for one person had to exceed 6,000 in order for the ostracism to take place; if no one received 6,000 or more votes, then no ostracism took place that year. The building in which the vote seems to take place doesn't even seem to contain fifty. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It would also be exceedingly hard to fake, since the votes were tallied via each citizen participant etching their vote on their ostraka, meaning that the fake ostraka had to be individually etched with the proper fake vote.</span></li><li> One mission involves the player taking the place of a pankratiast at the Olympic Games, and all the competitors are shown wearing loincloths. In reality, athletes at all of the Panhellenic Games competed entirely nude. If playing as Kassandra, this crosses over with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyCorrectHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyCorrectHistory">Politically Correct History</a>, as women were banned from the Olympic sanctuary entirely during the Games, under penalty of death. This is actually noted by one of the loading screen hints, and even mentions the Heraean Games (essentially the female version of the Olympics) but the actual game proper does not make any mention of this at all, even when playing as Kassandra. The pankration bouts also take place in a designated "ring" (a marked circle on the ground), but this was not the case for any of the actual ancient combat events besides wrestling (which took place in a shallow pit dug into the stadium track).</li><li> Historically, Sokrates served as a hoplite in the war, even saving Alkibiades during the Battle of Potidaea. Both went unmentioned in the game. Sokrates, as per Xenophon, was also a kind of pimp for young tricks but this isn't addressed since the game exclusively presents us Plato's version of Sokrates.</li><li> The open world has features such as ships with Spartan colors and constantly fluctuating back-and-forth skirmishes between Athenian and Spartan forces. In actual fact, the Spartans had no navy and only got one late in the Peloponnesian War courtesy of the Persians. The Athenians denied battle to the Spartans throughout the war and avoided battle whenever possible.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseMilitary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseMilitary">Artistic License &#150; Military</a>: Battlefields are simply chaotic melees of small groups or one-on-one fighting. No attempt is made at showing the famous phalanx formation or other infantry tactics of any kind.<ul><li> Downplayed with the Spartan navy: while modern historians believed that Sparta had a functional navy, portraying it as being on par with the Athenian fleet is an overcorrection.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Artificial Stupidity</a>: The game's AI has clearly been programmed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin">Can't Get Away with Nuthin'</a> in mind; helping a soldier defend themselves against an aggressive animal &mdash; indeed, defending <em>yourself</em> against an animal in their eyesight &mdash; will cause them to immediately become hostile to you. Just being in their line of sight after a fight that had nothing to do with you can evoke a violent response, as if the player is being held responsible for anything that happens in the game world. Sometimes even random civilians join in the fray, rabidly attacking the protagonist until killed because they were clipped by the enemy! On the positive side, it's extremely easy for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">NPCs</a> to end up fighting each other, as well, even ones ostensibly on the same side.<ul><li> This can have hilarious, if unfortunate results.

There's even a dedicated engraving that increases headshot damage by up to 25%. Specialized archer builds that focus on Hunter damage and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass">crit damage</a> are the most broken builds in the game, capable of killing any basic mook with one headshot, elite mooks with two, and bosses with one to two Devastating Shots to the head. Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a> builds can get a lot of mileage out of this mechanic by softening up tough targets from a distance.

Just as well when sniping isn't an option, walking up behind your target and just backstabbing them is equally painless, at least for you. Quick, quiet, easy.

One example of this is the quest Family Values on Lokris, in which you are tasked with retrieving a man's sword and shield to give to his parents for protection. You have no choice but to kill the bandit who stole his shield &mdash; the quest won't progress until you do, even if you knock her out &mdash; even though the man only told you to get his shield back, and it would be just as easy to take a shield from someone who's unconscious as someone who's dead. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The bandit turns out to be his biological mother, and being required to kill her means that there's no way to get a truly good ending to the quest.</span></li><li> The Heir of Memories questline, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when playing as Deimos, both in and out of universe.

However, unless you get close enough to touch the stuff, none of it has any effect on the Eagle Bearer aside from occasional complaints about the heat.

Unfortunately, legendaries lose their edge just as quickly as anything else as you level up. Even a difference of one or two levels is enough to make them fall behind epic and sometimes even rare gear, but upgrading legendaries is so hideously expensive that you'll have a hard time keeping up until well into the late game where resources become a lot more abundant. Chances are you'll be slumming it with a ragtag mix of non-uniques most of the time until you hit the level cap of 99.</li><li> Both the Warrior tree and the Assassin tree offer skills to buff your weapons with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlamingSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlamingSword">fire</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonedWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonedWeapon">poison</a>, respectively. While slashing about with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlamingSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlamingSword">Flaming Sword</a> sure looks badass as all hell, the poison skill is much more useful overall because in addition to dealing damage over time, it weakens the target's own attacks and their armor significantly. Most enemies aren't tough because of an absurd health pool but because they have massive armor ratings, which makes poisoned weapons dish out much more damage than if you set them on fire instead. The fact that burning enemies don't panic or suffer similar drawbacks aside from DOT doesn't help (no matter how much your enemies complain about it loudly) the Flaming Weapons skill much.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolHorse">Cool Horse</a>: Phobos, your faithful steed, starts out as your everyday horse but can be changed into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unicorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unicorn">Unicorn</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pegasus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pegasus">Pegasus</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellishHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellishHorse">Hellish Horse</a> with the appropriate, purely cosmetic skins.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopyAndPasteEnvironments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopyAndPasteEnvironments">Copy-and-Paste Environments</a>: While the environment itself is mostly unique, military camps only come in two or three vaguely different layouts. Even the treasure chests and war supply crates are always at the exact same position, with the exact same looks. There's about a hundred of these camps scattered all over Greece, so if you happen to be a completionist who doesn't leave any location uncleared, you're liable to start groaning very soon every time you discover that a new location is yet another army camp. Even military standardization can't explain this level of identity, especially not in an era where modular prefab equipment didn't exist yet. On a smaller scale, many of the bandit camps (that is, the smaller ones not marked on the map) are also similarly scattered.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption">The Corruption</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">A problem with the Staff of Hermes Trigemestus is that it corrupts anyone not sufficiently braced enough to hold it.

Spartan and Athenian troops do have some minor variations in their equipment, but nowhere near enough to require adapted tactics to fight them effectively - what works for one works usually just as well for the other, assuming you have a reliable method to deal with shield-bearing enemies. There's also nothing to be gained nor lost when a region switches sides (apart from rulers and military strongholds resetting), so the whole thing essentially boils down to a plot vehicle for providing the player with an endless supply of mooks to murderize in creative ways.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoversAlwaysLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoversAlwaysLie">Covers Always Lie</a>: The exact location depicted on the cover art is a composite of at least four different locations and thus doesn't exist in-game. For example, the Statue of Athena stands on its own in the background rather than accompanying the Parthenon in Athens, the statue of Poseidon is transposed from its spot on a small island in the middle of the ocean, and Mount Taygetos is visible in the distance, which is in Sparta.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingTheCompetition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingTheCompetition">Crippling the Competition</a>: A side-quest on Keos has a "witch" doing this in regards to a childhood friend.

They have almost no cooldown on this ability, so even one boar can stunlock the Eagle Bearer to death in a matter of seconds. Needless to say, it gets a whole lot worse when several boars are present, and they almost never come alone. There's a reason why of all the legendary animals, the Kalydonian Boar (the very first one that introduces the whole quest line) is so reviled, as after a certain amount of damage, it will call out several smaller boars to swarm you.</li><li> The Eagle Bearer can inflict this in kind on enemies that get knocked over by Charged Heavy Attacks, after the third upgrade shortens the wind-up time.

As slavery is a huge part of Greek culture and the backbone of the Athenian and Spartan economies, there's precious few places for the main character to oppose slavery. At best you can express that slaves deserve to be treated fairly, because treating slaves badly means they can't work, and should have the right to earn their freedom, because it's an incentive to work harder. You can also express that if there's a problem, it's the master and not the slaves' fault, because the master is responsible for the slaves.<ul><li> Two characters who are unambiguously heroic and allies of the Eagle Bearer, as Spartans, vehemently and vocally support Sparta's intensive slavery and the repression of the helotes. Brasidas will even charge the main character with suppressing a helot rebellion (admittedly it is being provoked by Cultists).</li></ul></li><li> While the rampant sexism of the time generally goes unmentioned, there is one quest in the Olympics where the Eagle Bearer has to save a woman from being executed for the crime of... trying to watch the Games while being a woman.

For example, completing the Minotaur quest before doing the Pre-Trials of the Minotaur one will result in the addition of the Eagle Bearer trying to claim they've killed a minotaur already, which no-one believes. Doing "The Elixir" after finishing the Medusa fight has the Eagle Bearer try to point out that finding a cure for Medusa-related petrification isn't necessary, but the questgiver insists.</li><li> Finishing the Battle of a Hundred Hands questline adds a momentary extra bit to "They Just Want Cruelty" where Maion, owner of the arena, will note he's heard of the Eagle Bearer from their efforts there.

Regular side quest at the level cap of 99, where additional mastery levels require XP in the millions, only give 45,000 to 75,000 XP, barely moving your experience bar at all. Even worse, cash rewards range between 3,000 and 5,000 drachmae at a point where selling an average piece of gear nets you about 20,000 drachmae, and the items you may get are also useless since you're bound to be decked out in legendary gear by then. At least you can sell/dismantle the latter for a decent amount of cash/resources.

She is treated throughout most of the game as a very minor character who only appears in a few small parts in the game at first. Once the protagonist exposes her, she explains that she became the Ghost of Kosmos specifically because she was the least conspicuous person above suspicion in Athens who could be the leader of the Cult without raising any alarms in the Peloponnessian War, and still control the war on both sides through her relationships with different political and military leaders throughout Greece. She however admits that Deimos rising through the Cult's ranks has eroded her control over the Cult, which is why she has chosen to lay low and let the Eagle Bearer eliminate the group, which had become irredeemable in her eyes</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBypass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBypass">Dungeon Bypass</a>:<ul><li> Most forts and similar large strongholds have hidden side entrances that can get you close to the important assets inside (nation treasure chests, commanders, prisoners, quest items, whatever) without having to sneak past dozens of guards first.</li><li> The Ghost Arrows of Artemis ability is an insanely useful weaponized example for any situation that involves killing something. Most high-value targets are difficult to get a bead on when they're hiding behind fortress walls or deep inside cave systems.

As you enter the forest, the colour becomes more and more desaturated and gray, and that's before you begin walking through the enormous, twisted, <em>stone</em> trees and winding paths through the mist. It's also eerily silent and devoid of any animal life. When you reach the temple itself, you find an enormous, alien-looking precursor structure with numerous "statues" of men and women fleeing from the entrance.

Only one quest ever actually points this out, one unlocked after you complete two questlines where you kill high-ranking soldiers for the commander in the opposing army.

But, if the required quest is done out of order, said partner will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostForever">Lost Forever</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She is Iola, the smuggler who asked the Eagle Bearer to kill the alpha bear on Delos. If she appears during the party, the Eagle Bearer can invite her to join the crew as a lieutenant.</span></li><li> Another one involving romance and Barnabas: If you romanced Roxanna, recruited her as an lieutenant for the <em>Adrestia</em>, didn't dismiss her later and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">advised Barnabas to go easy on his nephew Neleus, she'll be part of the crew rescuing Neleus from Cult guards. After the rescue, the Eagle Bearer can opt to have another round of sex with her, making her the only romance partner with this distinction</span>.</li><li> Before getting the Death Veil ability from <em>Legacy of the First Blade</em> (which makes assassinated enemies disappear after death), Assassin players will spend a large amount of their stealth time hiding the bodies of their kills. Placing them in bushes and throwing them over walls is <em>exceedingly</em> difficult... unless you happen to see the random tool tip explaining how to throw them (it's just like using your bow). The game otherwise never tells you how to do this.</li><li> EVERYTHING to do with the Delos Islands quest chain. To wit; Podarkes is like any other leader and can be gone after immediately. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Killing him in this way cuts off almost all of the related sidequests AND will pretty much lock you into the worst ending for the quest chain.</span> Likewise, many of the quests have unexpected outcomes or consequences that won't come back to haunt you until much later in the quest chain - and some can't be predicted at all! For instance, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who would have guessed that rescuing that random rebel extremist on the western island and letting him live would lead to him randomly murdering Thaletas during the celebration party...but ONLY if you opted to make a farewell speech?</span> To be fair, Sokrates himself comments on that last one, regarding how the smallest actions can have unpredictable outcomes.</li><li> Buying equipment from blacksmiths is both hideously expensive and unnecessary, so you can be forgiven for never realizing that their stock actually contains a few legendary items. One of these has a unique perk that turns most of the combat system on its head.</li><li> After defeating every opponent in the Pephka arena, you can fight them again at a higher level. This doesn't make logical sense (you killed them, after all), so it can come as a bit of a surprise to discover that the second round has a whole bunch of additional equipment attached as rewards, including some legendary armor pieces to complete the Arena Fighter set.</li><li> It's entirely possible to get a pair of maps pointing to the Flute of Pan and Lyre of Apollo <em>many</em> hours before getting the quest they go with, simply by shanking the man holding them in the midst of other business (like, say, looting the fort he's in). Problem is, the two items won't appear in the locations marked until you activate the quest.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery">Happiness in Slavery</a>:<ul><li> In the "Once a Slave" quest, a slave will request from the protagonist that they blame him for the theft the slave's master has recently suffered. When asked why, the slave explains that his master plans to free him soon, and that the slave would rather live as a slave where he has purpose, shelter and food, than free where such things are uncertain. Ironically, if the Eagle Bearer does as requested, the master banishes the slave in anger. If they refuse to lie for him, the protagonist can instead just bring the matter up to the master, who will talk to his slave and just decide to keep him in his service.</li><li> Agapios on Euboea. He tells you he is a slave at the end of the first quest you do for him. Answer that one needs to do what must be done to survive and he'll agree. He says he doesn't hate his late father for selling him into slavery as it provided him with food, shelter and a certain degree of protection from the corruption on the island. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">If he survives the quest chain, his master frees him and he has trouble accepting it, but is ultimately happy to be free &#151; and continues working for the wellbeing of the island regardless of his status</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealThyself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealThyself">Heal Thyself</a>: The Second Wind ability from the Warrior tree restores 25%, 33% or 50% of health, depending on its level, at the cost of one adrenaline segment. The third tier also removes any poison or fire effects on the Eagle Bearer on top of the healing. It's generally considered <em>the</em> must-have ability in the game and should be taken the moment it becomes available.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicLineage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicLineage">Heroic Lineage</a>: The player character is on their mother's side, a descendant of Leonidas and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">their father is Pythagoras, the mathematician/philosopher/cult leader who in the game became an immortal living in the ruins of Atlantis</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiredGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiredGuns">Hired Guns</a>:<ul><li> Alexios and Kassandra work as mercenaries, or rather as they are called, <em>misthios</em> throughout the game.

You can also kill those ranked above you to increase your own mercenary ranking.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalDomainCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalDomainCharacter">Historical Domain Character</a>: There are quite a few famous, and some obscure, figures from Ancient Greece featured in the game, such as Sokrates, Hippokrates, Herodotus, Alkibiades, Aspasia, Perikles, Sophokles, Euripides, Aristophanes, Phidias, Kleon, Brasidas, Pausanias, Archidamos. King Leonidas of Sparta is the (late) maternal grandfather of the protagonist and is playable in the prologue. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And Pythagoras is the father of the protagonist</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitboxDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitboxDissonance">Hitbox Dissonance</a>: Boars are absurdly difficult to hit with arrows while lynxes escape most melee attacks because their hitboxes seem to be <em>much</em> smaller than the actual model.

Selling high-level equipment nets several thousand drachmae apiece, so even one visit to the blacksmith after a bunch of battles is usually enough to fatten your purse by about 100,000 drachmae or more at a point in the game where there's nothing meaningful left to spend it on.

When an enemy uses poison or fire against you, a single hit is all it takes to poison the Eagle Bearer or set them on fire. Hostile DOT effects also deal significantly more damage to the Eagle Bearer than the other way around, to the point that player-inflicted burn damage is so insignificant it might as well be a purely cosmetic graphics effect.</li><li> An example that helps the player is being knocked off a boat in a naval battle. The Eagle Bearer can just climb back on board, but for any enemy, including elites and bosses, it's a one hit kill.</li><li> Another example that benefits the player is the arena fights (or at least the rematch version). The bosses and mooks are capped at level fifty, but no such restriction applies to the Eagle Bearer.</li><li> Melee damage resistance works against all animals but one: snakes. Even if your melee resistance is at 100+%, making you immune to anything that attacks in melee, snakes still take off ~40% of your health bar with each hit.

This is a lot harder than melee blocks to pull off consistently, so while it is possible to neutralize one or maybe two archers this way, it should be considered a last resort in case you overlooked an archer while clearing house before you launched an open assault.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">Permanently Missable Content</a>: By initiating a conquest battle early, or as a consequence of your earlier decisions, certain quests and rewards will be locked out.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualMolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualMolt">Perpetual Molt</a>: The Pegasos armor set has has a strong <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeatherMotif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeatherMotif">Feather Motif</a> going on, so the devs went all out and also gave it a unique graphics effect that leaves a trail of white feathers in the air behind the Eagle Bearer while on the move.

The game does emphasize and clarify that the Spartans were a brutal, casteist society of aristocrats who terrorized the helots. Even sympathetic Spartan characters (like Myrrine) are indifferent to the system, and Alexios/Kassandra can choose to aid the suppression of a slave revolt. Myrrine also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">chastizes Alexios/Kassandra for choosing to interrupt the agoge, the Spartan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> whereby a Spartan boy was about to die for failing the test</span>.</li><li> When you play as Kassandra, the game more or less ignores the strictly enforced gender roles of Ancient Greece, especially Athens; by modern standards these would be considered nothing less than misogynistic. A woman was seen as more or less property of her &#147;oikos&#148; (family unit), and wouldn&#146;t have been able to make any decisions for herself. Notably, there's also no difference between interacting with men in Athenian controlled regions vs. Spartan controlled regions, even though the two city-state cultures differed significantly in their treatment of women. Sparta came the closest to modern standards of gender equality, with women being able to own land, receive education and physical training, and run businesses. However, Spartan society placed the heaviest importance on women bearing strong offspring, and aren't known to have ever sent them into battle. Similarly, both Alexios and Kassandra would have been maligned in Athens as foreigners, and would've had their movement and social standing heavily restricted.</li><li> On a more subtle gender issue, the game's constant celebration of "warrior women" over more feminine women <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with Aspasia being made the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> despite being presented for much of the game as the most feminine and girly of the game's supporting characters</span> ignores the fact that in Ancient Greek, such women, whether in myth or in drama, would always be referred to with masculine pronouns in the Greek language. This was done, as Mary Beard pointed out, to especially highlight and segregate such women from what the male population understood as the norm. As such, the conventional "strong female characters" seen in this game would be falling in line with the Greek misogynistic norms.</li><li> The practice of pederasty, common among Greeks of the time, goes obviously unmentioned. It was especially prevalent in Sparta and enforced with older general and officers allowed to claim as catamites younger officers and this was seen as a manly rite of passage. Athens likewise celebrated this wholly, and Sokrates was even claimed by Xenophon to be a kind of pimp for young tricks.</li><li> The Greek practices regarding prostitution <em>are</em> included in the game, but the game glosses them over by using the ancient Greek terms and never defining them for the audience. It will often use the term "hetaera(e)" for various female character of high societal standing - in particular for Aspasia (who was one in real life), but the game never goes into detail explaining that the term means to avoid offending audiences (or raising that ESRB rating). <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10x80u');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note10x80u" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10x80u');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Hetaerae were concubines/prostitutes, generally dedicated to a single or small number of clients.

"Most" being the operative word. You wouldn't be the first to ride into a newly discovered village, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">only for two dozen "incoming arrow" indicators to light up everywhere around you</a> because you just waltzed into a large stronghold of the Daughters of Artemis.</li><li> Quest chains often have steep jumps in their level requirements between one quest and the next, but you won't know that unless you check your quest log every time you accept a new quest. While it can be tempting to keep the subplot rolling without interruption, it's quite likely to get you into conflict with seriously overleveled enemies that'll kill the Eagle Bearer in one to two hits. The mythical monster quest chains are particularly dangerous examples because there's no chance of escape once you're committed.</li><li> On meeting Hippokrate's assistant, he mentions that the Eagle Bearer not bring up his baldness (he's a little sensitive). They can do so anyway. And unlock a spare quest if they do so.</li><li> A mission on the Silver Islands has the player, on Sokrates's advice, free a man who makes it clear he despises any and all foreigners on the islands, which includes Athenians and Spartans. Let the obvious nutjob run free, and he repays the Eagle Bearer by showing up at a party when the Silver Islands plotline ends and killing someone.</li><li> A mission for Markos has him make the Eagle Bearer take a jug of wine over to a person he owes money to. By this point, the player should definitely know not to drink it... doing so earns them a nasty poisoning.</li><li> During one of the Lost Tales of Greece, the Eagle Bearer runs into a woman named Circe, who lives alone in a ruined temple, surrounded by pigs... and is quite clearly out of her tree. If the player decides not to attack her, she'll offer them a drink. You can probably see where this is heading. It's drugged.<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Falling for this bait is actually beneficial</a>, at least to the player. If you attack Circe immediately, you fight her surrounded by a dozen boars and lions that can wreck you in short order. Accepting the drink instead results in the Eagle Bearer waking up in a nearby cave from where they can sneak back to Circe to fight her on their own terms, like putting a Ghost Arrow in her head without alerting her animal companions.</li></ul></li><li> A horse-breeder in the quest "A Horse, Of Course" believes the word of a person who made off with her prize horse, and feeds it some fruit she's been told will turn it into a pegasus. Her justification? "It <em>has</em> to work after I paid so much money for it!" She then proceeds to immediately ride it off a cliff.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchrodingersGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchrodingersGun">Schr&ouml;dinger's Gun</a>: Both Alexios and Kassandra play key roles in the game's story, but which character is in which position depends entirely on whom the player chooses to play as.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney">Screw the Rules, I Have Money!</a>: You can commit any number of crimes without consequences, as long as you have the funds to pay off the bounty.

The quest parodies Oedipus's story.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeldomSeenSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeldomSeenSpecies">Seldom-Seen Species</a>: The Krokottas Hyena is a gigantic striped hyena instead of a much-more-commonly-seen spotted hyena.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</a>: As befitting the tradition of Greek tragedies, Nikolaos attempts to murder both of his children in order to keep them from destroying Sparta, but his actions end up setting up its downfall.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking">Sequence Breaking</a>: <em>Encouraged</em>. It's possible to complete quest objectives before accepting the quest from the quest giver, and doing so often results in completely different dialogue and resolutions.<ul><li> Many of the Cultists in the open world can be killed without unveiling their identity first. Often you won't even realize you're fighting a cultist until you see the golden loot sparkle and the "Confirm Cultist Kill" prompt appears over the corpse.</li><li> In particular, sneaking into his home to kill Podarkes the Cruel will cause the player to instantly get 4 "Quest Completed" notices (and all the attached XP rewards) as this automatically finishes all but one of Kyra's quests. It's important to note however that resolving the Delos Islands quest chain this way will <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">lock you into the worst ending for it, since you never resolved Kyra or Thaleta's issues, and it's highly likely they'll both end up dead.</span></li><li> The Elpenor questline in Phokis is meant to go with the Eagle Bearer meeting the Oracle, then hunting Elpenor, searching through the local fortress in the Valley of the Nymph before finding his hiding place... unless the player finds his hiding place while exploring the map, in which case they can kill him anyhow. Doing so changes the Eagle Bearer's chat with the Oracle in her house, noting that mysterious cloak and mask they decided to loot from his corpse.</li><li> One example that can work against the player, specifically their immersion, is the fact that you can finish the three main story lines in any order. However, the ending of the Atlantis arc wraps up the Eagle Bearer's story for good and is therefore generally considered the true ending for the game at large, so if you finish that arc somewhere in between the others, the whole narrative gets thrown into disarray.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> is highly susceptible because the various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate">level-locked assets</a> from the base game no longer matter all that much. It often results in the player coming across enemies and events completely out of the intended order. For instance, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Exekias the Legend, Sage of the Heroes of the Cult and</span> normally <em>the</em> top-ranked mercenary, becomes a bog-standard merc in the roster, to the point that he can be the second bounty hunter that goes after you (and probably ends up dead in short order).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetBonus">Set Bonus</a>: Equipping all five pieces of a legendary armor set activates its unique perk, which is often a powerful buff tailored to the play style the set is meant to enhance.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory">"Shaggy Dog" Story</a>:<ul><li> Potentially everything the player does on Kephallonia. You can help the locals with their problems, kill the local crime lord, improve the lot of the local temple, even give a couple the chance to move somewhere better... and have it all come to naught by allowing a horrific plague to devastate the island.</li><li> One of Alkibiades' quests involves taking a general home, then defending him from hired thugs. Due to the mission, it's pretty easy for the thugs to get him anyway. Should the Eagle Bearer save him, they'll tell Alkabiades, who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">was the one who hired the thugs in the first place, and it's heavily implied he just tries again and eliminates him for good</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockwaveStomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockwaveStomp">Shockwave Stomp</a>: The Ring of Chaos ability in the Warrior skill list.

The game focuses around a customizable mercenary, a load of equally grey moral choices, and features multiple endings based on those choices. That said, similar mechanics and storylines have been carried over from <em>Origins</em>, like using an actual eagle to scout locations, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Eagle Bearer</a> hunting a mysterious organization that ruined their family.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceCompression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceCompression">Space Compression</a>: The game map is the entire geographical area of Greece, but is much smaller to allow for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun">fun gameplay and bearable travel times</a>.

The same happens if you start a fire near them. This also occurs sometimes when you stealth-kill an enemy and the torch they were carrying falls into the bushes, landing you in all sorts of trouble.
