The sole exception is the Lanchester Armoured Car, which was implemented and made playable specifically for a "100 Years of the Tank" commemorative special event in September of 2016.</li><li> Some tanks have rather outlandish equipment available for use; for example, the KV-1 can mount the fictional 57mm "project 413" gun, which is virtually identical to the historical ZiS-4 available to other Russian tanks. This is especially apparent with tanks that mount guns <em>as long as the tank itself</em> in forward hull positions.</li><li> Because the game's matchmaker does not consider the tanks' nationalities as it forms teams, you can see German tanks fighting alongside American tanks against British and Chinese tanks, along with other unlikely combinations.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note31rvx');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note31rvx" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note31rvx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The game did offer a "historical" mode with allied vs axis battles but they failed to catch on due to balancing issues. Likewise the "confrontation" mode (each team was comprised of just one nation's tanks e.g. USA vs Germany) was also removed due to serious balance problems.</span></li><li> A number of the early German SPGs are actually uncasemated assault guns intended to provide support for advancing tanks against infantry and fortifications. They were never meant to be used for indirect fire: along with a number of tank destroyers, they belong to a class of armoured vehicles known as assault guns, which were designed to provide mobile fire support for infantry.</li><li> In actual combat, a shot that manages to punch a hole into a tank will almost certainly guarantee a knock-out, if not outright destruction. Most armoured fighting vehicles are not very spacious: chances are that something, or someone will get hit. Even without an explosive filler, any projectile that manages to penetrate will generate spalling, causing fragments of the armour to break off and turn into shrapnel.<ul><li> On the flipside, shooting a tank anywhere on its hitbox that is not a module will deal hitpoint damage and eventually destroy the tank. Even if every shot is placed on the tiny little commander's cupola on the top of the turret.</li></ul></li><li> The maximum sighting range for a tank is 445m, which can be extended to 564m if a friendly spots a target for you. In World War 2, most tank combat took place at ranges from 400m (for tanks with small caliber weapons) to 800m (for late-war machines), and some guns could effectively engage at 2 km ranges, although these super long-distance engagements were a very small fraction of the total.</li><li> Many of the guns had to be watered down to avoid one-sided battles. For example, the Tiger I with the 8.8cm L/56 can knock out an M4 Sherman at 2,000 yards/1,828.8m from the side and 800m from the front (and it indeed could accurately hit targets at that range, as could most guns as mechanical accuracy varied very little), whereas the M4 had to catch the Tiger I on the flank at around 700m. In-game, the accuracy of the Tiger I's 8.8cm L/56 and the Tiger II's 8.8cm L/71, and especially the Russian D-25T 122mm L/44 gun have been reduced tremendously over their real-life counterparts for gameplay's sake.</li><li> Though most tanks approximate their historical counterparts' specifications, other stats are often fudged. For instance, many tanks can fire their guns much faster than they would have been able to in real life: a fully-trained crew in a T-62A, for example, can fire 10 rounds a minute when in actuality, the practical rate of fire was recorded as being much lower. Soft stats such as weak spots, weight, and gun depression/elevation are also fudged: the T-28 for example, weighs nearly ten tons less than production models, and is closer to the prototypes (which were not as heavily equipped and were made out of much weaker steel).</li><li> Some tanks are sometimes inferior to their real life counterparts - the IS-7 is a notable example<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note41762');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note41762" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note41762');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">it had a higher top speed, among other things</span> - for the sake of balancing the game. Other times, they are far better: the KV-2 was quickly phased out of service as it became apparent that it was poorly suited for armoured warfare<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5jlou');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5jlou" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5jlou');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">its turret was so big and heavy it couldn't even turn it unless on level ground, among other issues</span>, yet is an absolute terror in-game. Much of this comes from other real-life factors such as engine reliability not coming into effect in-game, since RNG-based mechanical failures would be about as far from "fun" as possible.</li><li> The guns themselves have no collision model for when dealing with terrain and other vehicles, and as far are the game engine goes, shots are fired from the base of the gun mount. This means that tanks can freely swing their guns through trees, buildings, other tanks and such, and they are not worried about plowing into the ground when coming down steep slopes. A result of this is that tanks can literally be touch each other, and their gun models poking out the other side, but still fire on each other, something small tanks can take advantage of when dealing with much larger ones who can't depress their guns that low.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalAimingSkills">Accidental Aiming Skills</a>: Happens often, especially due to RNG. Among the most common reasons are -<ul><li> Tanks sitting behind friendlies who get spotted and deliberately or inadvertently use their stealthed allies as invisible cover.</li><li> Sometimes tanks (with poor accuracy) will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotRunWithAGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotRunWithAGun">shoot on the move</a> on the off chance a hit will land.</li><li> Inevitable with artillery, of which most have very poor accuracy. It's not uncommon to aim at one tank, fire, miss, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatIAimedAt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatIAimedAt">hit his friend nearby</a> (who might have not even been spotted).</li><li> There have been numerous videos of tanks missing their intended target, only to kill an unspotted tank on the other side of the map. The most absurd has to be <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6BDWJBwjh0">this one.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></li><li> A more recent patch added the ability for shells that ricochet to still strike another tank.

Autocannons of 40mm calibre and below that have automatic fire (more then one shot fired on a single click) have their shots disappear at 400 meters distance post 9.8, 350 meters pre 9.8. This is true of the 7.92mm MG of the Panzer IC all the way up to the big British 40mm Pom Poms. Shots fired by single shot guns will travel until they reach the edge of the map or hit something. This extends even past the 1000x1000 meter draw distance box, and if an enemy is outside your draw distance, spotted by a teammate, and you manage to hit him, the crew will actually call out the hit. Penetration drops with distance, however, so you might not be able to cause any damage even if you manage to hit.<ul><li> This also applies to low-caliber single shot weapons, as well. An example would be the French 25 mm Canon Raccourci mle. 1934. It has decent penetration for its tier, but is let down by the fact that it can't damage anything further than 400 meters away.</li></ul></li><li> Played straight on the Xbox 360 version, where any shell fired from anything but artillery will vanish after 700 meters.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless">Armor Is Useless</a>: Averted, even premium ammo shots from large guns can sometimes bounce off tanks with relatively thin armor.

However, some are invented wholesale by Wargaming. Despite this, the small in-game histories of these vehicles give the impression that they existed - the Waffentrager auf E-100's reads: "A proposal to mount a large-caliber antiaircraft gun on the chassis of the E-100 tank." While both the E-100 chassis and the autoloading gun were created, no proposal for an E-100 <em>Waffentrager</em> was ever made, because such a thing would be contrary to the design principles of both projects<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6u643');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6u643" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6u643');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The E-100 (and the Maus) was to be escorted itself by a bunch of smaller dedicated anti-aircraft tanks, not be an anti-aircraft unit itself</span>.<ul><li> Many of the vehicles in the game also can equip guns that they never did in real life, or at least weren't very effective with them. An example would be the British Cromwell, which can equip the potent 75 mm Vickers HV cannon.

The extra penetration makes them absolutely devastating, but the price (in both Gold and Credits) skyrockets the higher up the tech tree you go. They can still miss or bounce off armor as well.</li><li> Tier 9-10 vehicles tend to be unprofitable with without a premium account and a win rate of at least 55%. So it's either playing with a platoon to rely less on the mercy of the autobalancer - or grinding repair and ammo money with other tanks.<ul><li> Special mention goes to the T95 American tank destroyer, which boasts almost impenetrably thick frontal armor and a monstrous gun, it can hold down entire choke points alone. But it is <em>so</em> slow, that the game is often either won or lost before the T95 can even shoot anything. The mid-tier British heavies and especially the TDs can also suffer from this.</li><li> The Maus is rather uncompetitive because of how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep">Power Creep</a> nullified its heavy armor. When the game launched, it was the only Tier 10 alongside the IS-7. With its thick armor and the absence of equal-tiered counters besides the IS-7, it was almost invincible with many players easily soloing matches in the Maus. However, with the introduction of Tier X mediums, tank destroyers, and artillery, Maus's armor became less effective as these newer tanks have the firepower and penetration to penetrate its armor and deplete it HP. Furthermore, as higher-penetrating premium ammo becomes purchasable with in-game credits instead of real-world money, tanks as low as tier 8 can easily punch through its armor. Nowadays, the Maus is treated more as a novelty than a genuinely useful tank since its heavy, unsloped, spaceless armor only weighs it down while other Tier 10 vehicles have better advantages like sloped armor and the ability to use higher-penetrating HEAT rounds.</li></ul></li><li> No matter how cool it may be to drive with a historically accurate module configuration, they tend to not be the best choice, with a few exceptions.</li><li> One of the two German Tier V tank destroyers, the Pz.Sfl. IVc (better known as the Flakbus), was designed as an AA gun; as a result, it has <em>eighty-five degrees</em> of gun elevation, meaning it can effectively shoot straight up. However, anyone driving this thing will be hard-pressed to find a situation where this feature can actually be used to any significant effect, especially with its nonexistent armor and enormous profile.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassAdorable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassAdorable">Badass Adorable</a>:<ul><li> Popular fan consensus is that the hulking, deadly T29 heavy tank's 'ears' (the pair of coincidence rangefinders on the sides of its turret) make it one of the cutest tanks in the game.</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://tagn.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/amx40.jpg">AMX 40's shape<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> has earned it the nickname of <a class="urllink" href="http://slayerjesse.deviantart.com/art/Amx-40-The-Duck-452762378">Rubber Duck.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> The affection come from its exceptional armour that would be good for a heavy tank the next tier up.</li><li> The Panzer II Luchs with its stubby proportions and blistering mobility is occasionally likened to a puppy.

Rain is common, ranging from a light drizzle to an apocalyptic thunderstorm. It doesn't have a significant effect on gameplay, but it looks very cool.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleRoyaleGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleRoyaleGame">Battle Royale Game</a>: The Steel Hunter mode pits players against each other. The tanks can be upgraded during the match, and players can loot dead tanks. The area of play slowly shrinks, and players have to watch out for Danger Zones.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled">Better to Die than Be Killed</a>: Some players deliberately drown their tank, hit themselves with HE splash damage or drive off tall cliffs when the battle has been lost to deny the enemy an easy kill, which means less XP and credits for the winning team. As of 9.3, repeated suicides will be punished. In <strong>most</strong> cases, this is less about denying XP and credits to the enemy team and more about getting back to the garage faster once the battle is clearly lost, so that another battle can be loaded into faster. But regardless of the reason, it's considered to be a rather dickish thing to do.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerStick">Bigger Stick</a>:<ul><li> More often than not, players jump to conclusions about the battle results just from seeing the tank line-ups, and players rallied by a top-tier tank will usually give their all to support it.</li><li> Generally, the largest calibre or highest tier weapon available for your tank is the most preferable option, unless it's an HE-only howitzer or has exceptionally poor handling.<ul><li> Averted with high-penetration, low-damage guns like the Soviet 57mm ZiS-2 and variants, which are often smaller calibre than the biggest gun on any given chassis.</li><li> Averted with the S-35 CA's <em>stock</em> 17pdr, which has the highest rate of fire and second highest penetration of any gun that can be mounted on the chassis, making selection of one of the other guns more of a playstyle choice than them necessarily being "better".</li><li> In some cases, it can be averted as the bigger gun may have bad enough "soft stats" such as reload and accuracy that a smaller gun may be preferable, such as on the KV-85 and T-34-2.</li><li> Mid-tier British tanks often avert this due to the frequent inclusion of some variant of the 6pdr gun. While stats slightly vary, these guns are typically light with decent penetration and absolutely excellent rates of fire (often firing twice or thrice in a slugging match with other tanks). In the hands of a player with a good sense for hitting modules, these guns are often infuriatingly strong despite their ostensibly weaker power.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a>: Typically, even when there's a wide selection of guns to unlock, the gun with the most penetration (which is nearly always the "top"/last gun to unlock) is generally the best gun to pick in most situations.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines">Bottomless Magazines</a>: Averted, since you need to spend the Credits you earn in battle on refilling your magazine. You can also spend some Gold or lots of Credits for better shells like High Explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT) rounds for better armour penetration.<ul><li> It also causes serious problems for players who equip high-caliber weapons on smaller tanks. The most extreme cases are the SPGs: e.g. the Russian SU-5 can only hold 14 rounds for its biggest cannon.</li><li> Amusingly played straight in a few cases. It's physically impossible to fire off the KV-2's 152mm howitzer's full load of shells within the confines of a 15-minute match, since it reloads <em>very</em> slowly. Similarly, the M37 carries 126 rounds. Over the course of a 15-minute match, it can only fire, at most, 76 of them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">Bribing Your Way to Victory</a>: Gold and real money-based purchases are a mixed bag.<ul><li> Premium ammunition (which can also be purchased for an account draining sum of Credits post-0.8.1) are either AP rounds with higher penetration (APCR/HEAT) or HE rounds with a bigger bang. They can still bounce off armor if the shooter is unlucky, and a miss with these is still a miss.<ul><li> In general, most Artillery will not be able to inflict the full amount of damage their gun is potentially capable of; this is especially true with American and Soviet pieces which have the highest shell damage. With HE having such low penetration value, targets which can actually be penetrated are usually one shotted without getting to see the full potential damage, most tanks which aren't penetrated (especially heavies) take only a fraction of the potential damage because armor will reduce the damage from non-penetrating splash shots. Load HEAT rounds however, and you can suddenly knock off half the health of even high tier heavy tanks... but you have to land a shot directly on them.</li></ul></li><li> Tier 9 and 10 tanks tend to lose Credits in most battles, even victories and often even with exceptional performance on the winning team. Purchasing a Premium Account is one way to counter this, as it increases XP and Credits earned per match by 50%. Another method is premium tanks, tanks bought with real currency which produce far more Credits than normal tanks. The most profitable of these cost upwards of $50 (though they can, on occasion, be won in in-game events). However, Premium tanks generally do not outclass their regular counterparts and are, in most cases, less dangerous than a moderately/fully upgraded regular tank of the same tier. Some of the best are:<ul><li> The German Lowe is a Tier 8 heavy that has a potent gun for its tier, though it's balanced out by somewhat fragile armor. It's competitive at any level, and absolutely murderous against lower tier vehicles. New players use it as a way to skip the work required to get a regular high tier vehicle and even experienced players use it, since it is the absolute best Credit maker in the game. It proved so effective (and popular), its real world cost was increased.</li><li> The 0.7.2 patch saw the American Tier 9 T34 heavy converted into a Tier 8 premium tank. It has weak hull armor, but has very strong turret armor and a powerful 120mm main gun, and it gives the Lowe some serious competition as the game's premier Credit farmer.</li><li> The 0.6.7 patch saw the introduction of the Type 59, a one-off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoddyKnockoffProduct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoddyKnockoffProduct">Chinese knockoff</a> of the <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpider">T-54</a>. It is Tier 8 (one tier lower than the original) and its acceleration and firepower are inferior even to the T-44, but it retains most of the original's armour and can still be quite a potent threat in the right hands. Being easy to play, it ended up appearing in such amounts that it skewed game balance, so now it is no longer being sold except for rare special events.</li><li> The French Tier 8 FCM 50 t heavy tank improves upon the best qualities of late-tier French tanks while mitigating several of their weaknesses. The end result is a heavy tank that has excellent firepower, superior maneuverability to most <em>medium tanks</em>, and the best armour layout of any French tank in the game. On top of all that, it also has preferential matchmaking. Played correctly, this tank is easily one of the best Credit farmers in the game, which is evidenced by its high cost in real world money.</li><li> The Soviet Tier 7 SU-122-44 tank destroyer boasts extremely high DPM, has well-sloped armor that no gun under 175mm penetration will go through, excellent mobility and speed, and great ammo capacity. The only downside it has is a terrible view range for a Tier 7 tank destroyer. It is agreed upon among fans that the SU-122-44 <em>outmatches</em> almost every other tier 7 TD in the game despite its premium status for these reasons.</li><li> The British Tier 6 TOG II* heavy tank. It's one of the longest tanks in the game, does a whopping 14kph (for reference, the Tier 10 Maus does 20kph), has poor armor for its tier, and will get shredded to bits if fighting alone (especially if it meets tanks with high-caliber [as in upwards of 120mm] "Derp Guns"). It's often bought just for sheer comedy value. However, it has the HP pool of a Tier 8 and the gun of a Tier 7, has preferential matchmaking (It will ONLY see Tier 6 or 7 battles, not 8 like other tanks of its tier) and is so heavy it can't be moved if killed. A lone TOG has been described as a pinata that dispenses credits and experience when you hit it, but a platoon of 3 becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Lethal Joke Platoon.</a></li></ul></li><li> A tank crew can be instantly trained to 100% competence with Gold. A 100% crew greatly outstrips a 50% starter crew and has access to secondary skills.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameraAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameraAbuse">Camera Abuse</a>: The camera will rock and shake as the tank receives hits. Getting hit with HE rounds will also create a smoke cloud in your field of vision. This can affect gameplay, as all the bouncing around can throw off the player's aim. The 0.6.4 patch added an option to turn this off in sniper mode.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder">Cannon Fodder</a>: The lower tier tanks in the match often become this in the most brutal way; often their job is to go first and locate the enemy by being the first ones to get shot.

The same is true of the various Skirmishes that pit small teams of specific tiers or tank types against one another.</li><li> Some tanks can be reached from multiple precursor tanks. However, this can lead to vastly different "stock" options and crew skill for the new tank to the point of this trope. For example, the T29 Heavy Tank can be reached from either the M4A3E2 or the M6. However, coming from the medium line leaves you with the (at this point insufficient) 75mm as your only gun and a slightly less trained crew due to the extra penalty from retraining a medium crew to a heavy crew. Unless you first proceed to the tier 7 T20 and unlock it there, you would much rather want to come through the M6 in order to be able to mount the 90mm from the start.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping">Cherry Tapping</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">Death of a Thousand Cuts</a>:<ul><li> Light tanks (usually) have piddly guns, but if they can avoid getting shot and hit the right area several times (like the rear), they can take down much heavier tanks. It will take time, however.</li><li> Low tier tanks have access to autocannons, which can allow them to fire multiple rounds with one burst. Some can even fire multiple bursts before needing to reload. However, their penetration and damage tends to be rather lacking compared to single-shot guns of a similar caliber.<ul><li> The Germans have 2cm flak cannons on the Pz.Kpfw. I and Pz.Kpfw. II, and a 3cm aircraft cannon (the MK103) on the Pz.Kpfw. II Ausf. G.</li><li> The Soviets have an autocannon as well. It's a 37mm that packs a decent punch but doesn't quite have the penetration to suit the tanks its mounted on - the T-46, the T-50 and the A-20.</li></ul></li><li> Tanks armed with just machineguns are this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. Each individual round deals damage in the single digits, but they can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">spew out lots of them</a>.<ul><li> The American M2 Browning HMG that comes stock on the M2 Light and premium T7 Combat Car is powerful for a machinegun, but it's <em>not</em> made for taking out tanks.</li><li> The French Renault FT-17 (along with its Chinese counterpart, the NC-31) and D1 can equip the 13.2mm Hotchkiss mle. 1930. It's not much better in power, but it shoots <em>even faster</em>.</li><li> The British get in on the action as well with the slightly stronger but slower-firing 15mm BESA machine gun, available for the Medium Mk.I, Cruiser Mk. III and premium Light Mk. VIC.</li><li> The most extreme example to date is the German Pz.Kpfw. I Ausf. C with the Mauser 7.92mm Automatic, which will take around 50 to 100 hits to kill a same-tier opponent. Against a heavier tier, it takes hundreds of rounds... or it will just simply bounce every shot, giving the enemy an easy laugh before they blow you away. However, it is extremely effective against thinly-armored opponents, should the player properly use the Pz.Kpfw. I Ausf. C's speed and agility. A properly executed Pz.IC attack goes something like this: Zoom. Stop. <strong>BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP!!</strong> Boom. Scratch one enemy tank after just a few seconds.</li></ul></li><li> The Soviet 57 mm ZiS-4 and 413 guns deal rather low damage per shot, but can send shells out every 2 seconds, and can penetrate almost any tank from Tier 4 to Tier 7 from the sides and rear, if not frontally.</li><li> The StuG III's 7.5cm L/70, along with a highly-skilled crew, can fire once approximately every 3 seconds with full accuracy restored by the time the next shell loads. Its excellent penetration coupled with a high rate of fire means that its fairly meager AP damage rating quickly adds up even against higher-tier opponents. Your only problems will be running out of ammo mid-fight and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">enemy returning fire</a>.<ul><li> The E 25 takes this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. The same gun, except now it reloads in <em>two seconds</em>.</li></ul></li><li> The 7.5cm L/100 for the Panther and Panther II has great penetration, nearly unrivaled accuracy, and fires every 4 seconds. Of course, it deals small amounts of damage for its tier. It is possible for some tanks to withstand, on average, 20 hits or more.</li><li> The American 76mm guns in general also follow this &mdash; they have similar stats to the two German guns listed above (slightly weaker per shot than their counterparts at similar tiers, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">More Dakka</a> to make up for it).</li><li> The British 2-pdr and 6-pdr guns fall into this category, sending rounds out every 2 seconds, but with low damage. The 2-pdr Mark IX-B on the Matilda has the best penetration of all Tier 4 and Tier 5 guns, but at the price of piddling damage.</li><li> HE shells deal damage based on the enemy's armor thickness and will deal a small amount of damage to armor your gun can't penetrate with AP rounds. This allows weaker vehicles to finish off badly injured higher tier vehicles or to cripple them through module damage, especially with fast-firing guns.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarFu">Ramming</a> usually causes a small amount of damage. Oftentimes, a heavier tank will ram a lighter vehicle that is at low health, rather than wasting expensive ammunition. As this tends to reset track repairs, sometimes you can inflict a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">Death of a Thousand Cuts</a> by ramming, backing up, and ramming over and over until you slowly take down the other tank.</li><li> Occasionally, matches where <em>both</em> sides are incapable of damaging each other with AP rounds happen. With the advent of French tanks, it is possible to get into standoffs at around Tiers 2 to 5 where even HE rounds won't be doing any damage.</li><li> Japanese guns in general tend to have superior rate of fire, quicker aim times, and better recoil control then other nation's guns, but tend to lack penetration and damage-per-shot.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheeseEatingSurrenderMonkeys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheeseEatingSurrenderMonkeys">Cheese-Eating Surrender Monkeys</a>: French tanks get a lot of flak from the fandom because they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGameplayChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGameplayChange">behave differently from others</a>, their <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

Low HP, no armor to speak of, and a high speed means that more often than not, in the hands of an average player, it gets used as a proxy scout, which just results in it getting destroyed early in a match. In the hands of a decent player, however &mdash; who knows about its <em>excellent</em> camo value and view range, plus its fast-firing 76mm gun &mdash; it becomes a killing machine capable of carrying even up to <em>tier 7 matches</em>.

It's extremely difficult to do, but survival in some tanks depend on your ability to do this.</li><li> It should also go without saying that smaller light tanks, such as the French ELC AMX, can pull this off just with their speed, maneuverability, and small size. It's not uncommon to see an ELC driver zipping around in the opposing team's base, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATeamFiring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATeamFiring">annoying the heck out of everyone present</a> as they zig zag around, taking out the artillery, and lighting up everyone to be sniped from the tanks on your team.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotRunWithAGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotRunWithAGun">Do Not Run with a Gun</a>: No, seriously, don't. Very few weapons are able to fire accurately on the move, which is period-appropriate, and even then, it's more of a "slow crawl" than anything else. Most players will stop to shoot and having a gun which has a dispersion that drops down quickly when you stop can be a major advantage.<ul><li> Light tanks are an exception: stopping is death for them, so they usually close to knife-fighting range when fighting and circle-strafe.</li><li> The lowest cruise control setting offers your tank reasonable, but still reduced accuracy on the move. Even if you don't want to fire while moving at this speed, dispersion drops more quickly once you do stop, including reduced rocking forward and backwards after hitting the brakes.</li><li> The <em>Vertical Stabilizer</em> equipment increases accuracy on the move, but is expensive and is usually only available at high tiers. US tanks can get them as early as Tiers 5 to 7 (depending on which branch the player takes), but are still rather expensive.</li><li> The US tanks in general tend to be more accurate on the move, but it's still recommended to stop to shoot.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownToTheLastPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownToTheLastPlay">Down to the Last Play</a>: Two versions:<ul><li> The game has a set 15 minute time limit that, when reached, will <em>immediately</em> end the game, even if you were a split second away from killing the last tank on the enemy team. This is especially important in Assault map mode, where only one team has a cap circle and the timer is reduced to only 10 minutes; meaning the defending team need only wait out the clock to win.</li><li> When a base is captured, there is a small delay until the game ends. It is possible for the other team to finish capping as well for a draw. It is also possible to lose even if the base is successfully capped, if all of the team dies before the match actually ends.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat">Dump Stat</a>: On reaching 100% in their major qualification, crew members can train additional skills and perks (skills start to take effect immediately, perks only come into effect at 100%). Some are pretty useless outside specific circumstances, are more effective in certain tanks, are made redundant by equipment or just have too little effect to begin with. For shared skills, Firefighting is made redundant by fire extinguishers while Camouflage is more useful for scout and sniper tanks that rely on stealth (these skills are also averaged across the entire crew, so the whole crew must be trained to 100% to get the full benefit).<ul><li> For the commander, Mentor, Eagle Eye and Jack of All Trades. Mentor increases training for the rest of the crew and does nothing for the commander's performance. Eagle Eye will, after four seconds, if the enemy tank was spotted by your own crew, allow you to see which models are damaged if you're aiming at them. Jack of All Trades allows the commander to replace a knocked out crewman at 50% training, which is better than nothing, but a medkit is better still.</li><li> For the gunner, Armorer, Deadeye and Designated Target. Armorer improves accuracy on a damaged gun by 20%, a rare event which is solved by a repair kit. Deadeye offers an extra 3% chance of hitting something vital, pretty low for a perk. Designated Target keeps a tank spotted for an extra two seconds while firing at them, useful for light tanks and tank destroyers but not much else.</li><li> For the driver, Controlled Impact and Preventative Maintenance. Controlled Impact increases ramming effect by 15% while decreasing damage to your tank by 15%, but only if the other tank is stationary. Preventative Maintenance lowers the chance of fire by 25%, but it doesn't effect transmissions (where German tanks catch fire the most); a fire extinguisher is more useful and frees up the slot for better skills. Smooth Ride improves gun dispersion while moving, which is very useful for almost all tanks but doesn't effect stationary turning, so tank destroyers and self-propelled guns don't gain any benefit from it.</li><li> For the loader, Intuition and Adrenaline Rush. Intuition gives a 17% chance (or 34% if you have two loaders with this perk) of a shell being automatically loaded while switching between ammo types, too much of a gamble since you should only completely switch ammo (as opposed to selecting the next shell to load in sequence) in a safe location instead of betting on a 17% chance; it can also reportedly accidentally load the wrong type. Adrenaline Rush loads 9% faster with less than 10% health, very specific conditions for it to come into effect.</li><li> For the radio operator, Signal Boosting, Relaying and Call for Vengeance. Signal Boosting increases your tank's radio range by 20% while Relaying increases the range of allied tanks by 10%, useful, but somewhat redundant after very powerful radios become available. Call for Vengeance keeps tanks you've spotted visible to allies after you die, pretty useless since you have to die for it to have any effect and only works if the radio operator wasn't killed before destruction.</li><li> This also comes up in vehicles that call for two Gunners, two Radio Operators, or two Loaders. Since for Gunners and Radio Operators none of their skills/perks stack with themselves it's completely useless to give each of them the same one, effectively giving them six skills instead of eight. While Loaders do have a perk that stacks with itself (Intuition), the other two do not, so they also effectively only have six skills when there's two of them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingAlone">Dying Alone</a>: The most likely fate for SPGs if the team loses: they usually remain at base and survive until the very end, to be mocked by the dead players for being useless. However, it is possible, if unlikely, for them to turn around the situation, particularly if the enemy team is incredibly stupid and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookChivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookChivalry">comes at the surviving SPGs at a rate just slow enough that the SPGs have time to reload between enemy attacks, as opposed to swarming in all at once</a>.<ul><li> With the 9.14 physics patch, this is also a common fate for tanks who turn over and don't get help in righting back onto their tracks&mdash; especially now that the lightly-armored underside of the tank is wide open.

Some tanks have powerful alternatives:<ul><li> The Pz.Kpfw III can pack a short 7.5cm cannon with awful armor penetration and reload time, which seems rather undesirable, until you notice that its HE round has penetration that's almost as good as its AP<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note126m1v');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note126m1v" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note126m1v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Penetration for HE rounds is how much armor they ignore and since HE does damage based on armor thickness...</span>. This inverts the usual German "snipe and run" tactics, making the Pz.Kpfw III a powerful close combat vehicle.</li><li> The old KV (which could be the KV-1 or 2, depending on the turret used) took the cake, being a radically different tank with the turret upgrade. Also, <em>all</em> of its weapons (except the starting one) were useful to differing degrees. Even after the split, you'll still never know <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu">which KV you will encounter</a>.</li><li> The Tier 5 KV-1 can equip the 57mm, which deals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping">little damage per shot</a>, but has a great rate of fire, penetration and accuracy, an all-rounder 85mm cannon or a powerful 122mm howitzer.</li><li> The Tier 6 KV-2 (which also gets even more HP <em>and</em> an increase to reload speeds) gets the famed 152mm howitzer that gives it its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">Lethal Joke Character</a> status, and the relatively accurate, high penetration 107mm turns it into an exceptional tank destroyer. There's also the same 122mm howitzer as the KV-1, which still packs quite a punch and reloads much more quickly than the 152mm.</li><li> The Luchs has a Leopard-style turret that allows the use of more powerful guns instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">rapid fire autocannons</a>. The downside is that it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShedArmorgainSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShedArmorgainSpeed">heavy enough to hinder the tank's agility</a> somewhat. The same-tier Pz. 38 n.A. runs into the same issue.</li><li> The M4 Sherman has a 105mm howitzer upgrade that, at first glance, seems to be a poor tradeoff against the 76mm cannon that's also available. However, the 105, while slow loading, allows the Sherman to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">one-shot</a> most light and some medium tanks, and will still deal effective damage against heavies.</li><li> Before 0.8.0, installing the Schmalturm and the 7.5cm L/70 on the Pz.Kpfw IV pretty much turned it into a tank destroyer, though its mobility suffered.</li><li> The infamous Hetzer can mount either a 7.5cm L/48 cannon which has moderate penetration and damage values but reloads quickly <em>or</em> a 10.5cm howitzer with an extremely slow reload time and mediocre accuracy, which can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">one-shot</a> most light tanks and cause quite a bit of damage to even heavy tanks.</li><li> The SU-152 gets its name from the 152mm howitzer it uses for the stock gun, which is an effective gun with HE or HEAT ammunition. Also available is a 122mm cannon that, while lacking in penetration for a TD at this tier, fires a bit over 8 rounds a minute before adding on gun rammers, vents, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiA">Bi A</a>, or a combination of the three.</li><li> The German VK 36.01 (H) has what is probably the most varied and flexible selection of guns of any tank.

Not quite as bad post-0.7.3.</li><li> Premium tanks in general, and especially the Tier 8 ones. There are no qualifications necessary to use these premium tanks beyond a sufficient amount of paid-for Gold.<ul><li> Enhanced by the fact that many premium vehicles have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">greatly increased chance</a> to be top tier present in battle (thanks to favored matchmaking: a tank with favored matchmaking will only face matches with opponents of up to one tier higher, rather than two tiers like most tanks or three tier in the case of most light tanks of tier 4 or higher- this makes up for the fact that premium tanks generally have inferior stats to a fully-upgraded standard tank of the same tier). Therefore, these tanks will often be the top vehicle in a match, which are often far more powerful than those on the bottom. Good playing from the top will often ensure victory, while poor playing usually guarantees a loss, so a high level battle can end up in the hands of a player short on experience, but long on disposable income.</li></ul></li><li> Premium ammunition can mean the difference between victory and defeat against a thick-armored enemy... or against a thinly-armored one, if the player is absent-minded enough to forget the 30x more expensive ammunition is loaded before firing. Or if the player has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">cash to burn</a>. Embarrassment can be exacerbated by the fact that damage caused by premium ammo is usually less than cheaper AP or HE rounds.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>:<ul><li> SPGs. God help you if you get hit by an artillery shell, but god help <strong>them</strong> if you manage to get close and behind them.</li><li> Most Soviet Tank Destroyers are this, with the most extreme example being the Tier 8 ISU-152, which has almost no armour to speak of for its tier, but packs an absolutely devastating 152mm BL-10 gun, whose penetration and damage levels are only exceeded by Tier 10 TDs and high-tier artillery.</li><li> Before the gun was taken out in 0.7.5, the T-28 with an 85mm gun packed a substantial punch, but only had tissue paper for protection and was also an easy to hit target. There's a joke that T-28 tankers put up as many pictures of their loved ones, relatives, and friends as possible with drawing pins to use as additional armour.</li><li> The US light tanks and the following M7 Medium have some of the best weapons for their tiers, but very low health and armor.</li><li> With the release of the French tanks, their Tier 5 to 8 light tanks, Tier 9 and 10 medium tanks, and Tier 8 to 10 heavy tanks are this. Their Tier 6 and 7 light tanks were built around the Panther's 7.5cm L/70, while the Tier 8 one up-guns it to a 90mm gun. Some of their high tier heavies are capable of unleashing a whopping <em>1800</em> points of damage in about a dozen seconds, which could potentially kill anything but a Tier 10. On the other hand, their armor is ridiculously thin for high tier heavies.</li><li> The US Tank Destroyers play with this trope frequently. The Tier 3 T82 is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> incarnate, with nothing in the way of armor and a 105mm howitzer, which is typically a Tier 5 gun. The Tier 5 M10 Wolverine and Tier 6 M36 Slugger pretend to be Glass Cannons unless they're hull-down, at which point the sharply sloped 120mm thick gun mantlet takes over and they start bouncing nearly any round you can throw at them.</li><li> The British Alecto TD follows the same lines as the T82, with possibly even less armour despite being a tier higher. Only the guns-on-treads (UE57, UC 2pdr) have less.</li><li> Open-topped vehicles in general rarely have armor equal to their tier. Special mention, however, must go to those with fighting compartments open at the rear, like the Marder II and the SU-76. A single HE round into the open back will usually destroy them or at least wound most of their crew.</li><li> The 2nd German Tank Destroyer line features Waffentr&auml;ger type vehicles, essentially artillery re-purposed for destroying tanks. While they carry some terrifying armaments, the entire line is thinly armored, with the only armor in the entire line (the WTE100's hull) betrayed by the gigantic turret.</li><li> Semi-literally with the American T110 series. In real life, the armor developed for the T110 <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=AD0524050">contained layers of silica<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, which is... glass. Surprisingly, it turns out that the glass layer is actually quite effective against HEAT ammunition.</li><li> The Chinese Tier 10 113 heavy tank has a gun with a fast reload time and high alpha damage and does great damage per minute. It also has good mobility and a high top speed. However, it has very weak armor for a Tier 10 heavy.</li><li> The premium SU-100Y may claim the TD prize for this, as its outstanding 130mm naval cannon is offset by the vehicle being approximately the size of a house, with armour that can be easily penetrated by just about anything it could face.</li><li> Many Japanese medium tanks are this. They have excellent rapid fire guns and excel as DPS-Snipers but have rather thin armor.</li><li> The Tier X British tank destroyer FV4005 Stage II, added in patch 9.5, uses the same gun as the FV215b (183), but with better mobility, handling characteristics and a fully-rotating turret. The main drawback is that the turret armor is so thin that it can be penetrated by <em>tier 1 guns</em>.</li><li> The Swedish tech tree is almost completely dominated by this trope. Vast majority of its vehicles can best be described as thin skinned artillery guns slapped onto race-cars. Big guns and high speed is their forte with armor almost slapped on as an afterthought.<ul><li> Special mention goes to Strv 103B, a Tier X Swedish tank destroyer. Has an incredible DPM and the highest penetration available, but only 40 millimeters of frontal armor (read: none), a high silouette and a lacking sight range. Give this machine a spotter, and it's a terror to behold. A direct hit from an SPG is almost always fatal, though.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp">Goomba Stomp</a>: It's possible to jump down from a great height and crush an enemy tank. It's just a matter of having the hitpoints to spare and being heavier than the target.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualGrinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualGrinder">Gradual Grinder</a>: With very few exceptions, the clash of giant steel machines lives on this trope.

IIIA, ZiS-4 57mm and M1A2 76mm, though pretty hard-hitting at some tiers, soon become this.

Also tied in with guns are the fact that certain turrets will improve the soft stats of some or all of the guns on the tank.

However, it weighs around 30 tons and its best engine only produces 190 h.p., so you're lucky if it can go over 20km/h half the time.</li></ul></li><li> The listed tank stats dependent on crew skill, like rate of fire, were for 133% crew skill, not 100% crew skill. This was changed in the 0.7.2 patch.</li><li> Light tanks suffer from this trope quite a bit, as it so often happens where better modules (especially a new turret) weigh more, leaving you to wonder why your pimped-out Luchs drives like a slug when you expect it to dash like a greyhound.</li><li> Average Damage only tells you how much damage the selected gun can inflict with an Average Damage Roll. It doesn't tell you what the minimum and maximum damage output is. Once you equip the gun, the damage (and penetration) ranges will be listed in the garage.</li><li> For many tanks, the given armour thickness for each side is very close to being an outright lie. The cupola (the little dimple sticking out on top of the turret) is almost always less heavily armoured than the turret; in some cases, a non-apparent section of the tank (such as the lower hull) will be more weakly armoured than it appears. Inversely, some areas are actually <em>more</em> heavily armoured than they appear: gun mantlets are generally better protected than the turret facing they are mounted on, while some tanks boast "spaced armour" that can actually deflect shots and pre-detonate HE rounds before they hit the tank proper.<ul><li> Many tanks will be listed with large values for their armor... that only apply to a small section of the hull, sometimes to the point that it might as well be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">Blatant Lies</a>. One of the worst offenders is the T28 tank destroyer, with a listed 254 armor.

Because the only thing better than 152mm of high-explosive goodness is 152mm of high-explosive goodness from something that can do 70 kph.</li></ul></li><li> The T57 is the first US SPG. Typically, SPGs are slow, poorly-armored and ineffective at close range. However, the T57's speed, armor and weaponry are on par with Tier 3 TDs and better than <em>any</em> tank in its tier, being a nasty surprise for anyone who expected an easy kill.</li><li> The T18 is the first US TD. It has 51mm of frontal armor, equivalent to or better than many tanks two or three tiers higher, and access to a Tier 4 howitzer, making it the terror of recruit matches.</li><li> Then there's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Acrofatic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Acrofatic">T-28</a>, which is about as big as the Motherland, meaning it's rubbish at hiding, though it's surprisingly fast for its size. Initially, it's armed with a pretty pathetic short barreled 76mm close support cannon. With wafer thin armor, it's not going to last too long against its more well-armored contemporaries, <strong>but</strong>, once it gets a proper engine and the long barreled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">57mm ZiS-4</a>, it quickly becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> quite capable of punching out higher tier tanks.</li><li> The M3 Lee, combining the downsides of medium tanks and TDs and the good sides of neither, is widely mocked, ridiculed and hated by American medium tank drivers because of its massive profile, lack of a rotating turret and tendency to get killed by almost anything. However, it has very strong front armor for its tier and upgrades to a very fast-firing high-penetration gun that is capable of shredding even Tier 6 tanks that aren't paying attention.</li><li> The AMX 40, also (un)affectionately known as "<img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry. It should be moved to the TRIVIA tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">The Duck</a>", a Tier 4 French light tank with acceleration slower than most <em>heavy</em> tanks, a rather piddly gun... and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">armor equivalent to the KV-1 with completely retarded amounts of sloped armor</a>. Place it in a Tier 3-4 match and watch as every shot that goes towards your general direction bounce off.</li><li> The ELC AMX, which has virtually no armor, terrible aiming time, matchmaking that will always pit it against higher tier opponents, and a turret that can't turn more than a few degrees left and right. However, it is among the smallest tanks in the game, with a profile so low that some tanks are incapable of depressing their guns low enough to actually hit it at point blank range. It is also very fast, with a maximum speed limit is 65 km/h and an incredible power-to-weight ratio of 37 hp/t when fully upgraded. In contrast to preceding French tanks, it also has a great selection of guns: though slow to load, its top 90mm gun is easily one of the most powerful weapons available to any light tank. In the right hands, it can be a devilish nuisance if you stop trying to play it like a tank and start playing it more like a "Go-Kart with a Gun" (as it's been affectionately called).</li><li> The British TOG II* premium heavy tank. It tends to get mocked by everyone on <em>both</em> teams in a match and has been dubbed "Train", "Boat" or "Whale". It's painfully slow, comically large (longer than the Maus) and its armour is totally inadequate for its tier. However, its 80 ton bulk makes trying to ram it suicidal, 1400 hitpoints&mdash;double the Churchill III's health&mdash;allows it to absorb ridiculous amounts of damage, and it mounts the deadly OQF 17 Pounder Mk.VII, with very good accuracy, excellent <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoF">Ro F</a> and very good penetration. Late game, it can go on enormous rampages, considering most tanks it will encounter will be injured by the time it reaches them.<ul><li> Given its immense weight and length, a TOG turned sideways on a bridge or other chokepoint can completely seal off avenues of attack to the enemy by becoming an almost-immobile piece of scenery, a tactic dubbed "TOG-blocking".</li><li> A well-coordinated platoon of three TOG II*s is a Lethal Joke Team. Between them, the three could have more hit points than the rest of their team combined, allowing them to shrug off attacks while throwing out enough firepower to practically vapourize anything they meet as they move towards the enemy flag at a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousWalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousWalk">casual stroll</a>.</li></ul></li><li> The American T40 Tank destroyer is a slower, slightly more durable T82 with a massive gaping hole on top that just screams "KILL ME!" It's also a Tank Destroyer with a gun 2 tiers above its own, naturally faster firing due to being open topped, and happens to have an abnormally large view range and traverse. Combined with its standard TD Camo and competent players, this generally results in an invisible spotter killing your scouts before they can see anything.</li><li> The humble Cruiser II, a Tier III British light tank. Not too many people play it, as most prefer the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Cruiser IV's</a> tree. It's slow, its armor isn't very strong, its starting gun is average and it doesn't have a ton of HP. However, it can equip the 3.7 inch Howitzer, a cannon firing tooth-loosening HE rounds that can annihilate almost any other tank of its Tier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">in a single shot</a>, and even a few up to tier 5! Get one or two kills in a match this way and people will begin to approach you a bit more cautiously or avoid you altogether. Faster tanks might attempt to close the distance and attack, but this usually winds up lethal to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">all parties</a> involved. To give an idea of how powerful this gun is at this level, you find it on the Cruiser II's <strong>Tier VI</strong> cousins, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Cromwell</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Churchill VII</a>.</li><li> The BDR G1 B is not commonly seen on the battlefield, and it's not hard to understand why. Compared to the popular KV-1 and KV-1S tanks, it has much less armour (though still sufficient to bounce some guns, if angled correctly), feels very sluggish compared to the T1 and KV-1S tanks, and also has the least hitpoints of any tier V heavy tank. To top it all off, it also looks incredibly silly, being commonly derided as a "Steel Potato" due to its huge, ungainly shape, which makes it easy to spot. What saves it from being a mediocre tank is its top gun, the 90mm DCA 30, which has high penetration for tier V, deals exceptional damage, and has fairly good accuracy to boot. It will easily destroy any other tier V tank in no more than three shots, and is powerful enough to threaten tier VII tanks as well.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a>: Mostly limited to unlocking the higher tier tanks, where the XP and credit gain doesn't quite scale to their costs. This also applies to all tiers, as you need to earn experience to upgrade what tanks you do have.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelScaling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelScaling">Level Scaling</a>: For the most part, you only get matched with tanks around the tier of the tank you're using. The current system has tier 5 and up tanks able to see tanks two tiers higher or lower than them. Tiers 1 and 2 only see see tanks one tier higher or lower, while tier 3 and 4 tanks can face tanks two tiers higher but only one tier lower. For example, a tier 5 tank can only ever face enemies as low as tier 3 or as high as tier 7. Of course, there are some exceptions:<ul><li> Some premium tanks have what is called "Limited" or "Premium" matchmaking, so they won't see tanks two tiers higher than them. This is due to premium tanks generally being slightly worse than their non-premium colleagues in some way.</li><li> A few premium tanks, such as the B2 tier 4 heavy and the Valentine II tier 4 light tank, take this even further and can never see tanks higher than their own tier. This is due to them having absolutely terrible penetration.</li><li> The few tier 4 heavies in the game all have rather weak guns, lack the speed to flank and don't have any respectable armor above their own tier. Because of that, they have matchmaking similar to premium tanks and never fight anything higher than tier 5.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a>:<ul><li> The American T25 AT and German JagdPanther Tank Destroyers are this at the cost of lacking turrets, being maneuverable and quick, decently armored, and having powerful guns.</li><li> Don't forget about the American T49 tier 8 light tank which can go 70 km/h and can equip itself with what is essentially the KV-2's derp gun. It also counts as a glass cannon, since it has no armor to speak of.</li><li> The high-end medium tanks such as the T-54, the E-50 and the M46 Patton, are fast, relatively well-armoured and pack a massive punch.</li><li> The KV-13 medium tank combines the heavy armor of the KV series and the speed of the T-34 series.</li><li> The American M3 Stuart light tank is often a player's first introduction to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a>; it's one of the fastest and most durable tanks in its tier, and is actually tougher to kill than its larger but same-tier cousin, the M2 Medium. It also packs a respectable punch, though not quite as much as a fully-upgraded M2 Medium.</li><li> The German E-75 heavy tank is surprisingly agile for its size, packs insane amounts of armor on the front and has a Tier 10 gun that hits quite hard and is rather accurate.</li><li> The French FCM 50t premium heavy tank has a top speed of 51 km/h, a 1000 h.p. engine that allows it to accelerate quickly and extremely good steering. It is armed with the potent 90mm DCA 45 and has a halfway decent armour layout, unlike most other late-tier French tanks.</li><li> The Japanese O-I Experimental at Tier 5 is slower and less maneuverable than many of the examples here but still qualifies with a top speed of 40 kilometers an hour, an excellent gun and armor only slightly inferior to a KV-1. This is especially evident in comparison with the higher tier Japanese heavies, which fall squarely into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> category.</li><li> The Skoda T-40, the first Czech Premium Tank to be introduced into the game, looks to be something of one at Tier 6.</li><li> The A-44, a Tier VII USSR medium tank, is this in spades. It has great frontal armor, a blistering 59 kph speed, and a heavy tank gun that not only has better damage than any other Tier VII medium tank, but better damage than most Tier VII <em>heavy</em> tanks.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">The Load</a>: People who queue for a match then go AFK simply to get XP and Credits for being in the match.

Most tanks a of equal or lower tier tanks often switch to HE ammunition and chip away since most of their AP rounds will do anything but deflect off the armor. If only its turret is exposed, its 200mm thick sloped armor makes it almost completely invulnerable to anything but a direct artillery hit. That said, its frontal hull and turret armor can be penetrated with premium rounds, which cost a lot of in-game credits and real world money.</li><li> The E-75, a Tier 9 German heavy tank, is a nasty surprise for anyone going up against one frontally. Normally, the machine gun mount, the driver's viewport and the lower glacis plate are easily penetrated by most guns. The E-75 lacks all of those weakspots and sports a flat, featureless front. The various viewports and the commander's cupola are hard to hit, the armor is very thick and well-sloped, and even the lower glacis plate and the upgraded turret's frontal armor rivals the US heavy tanks at 252mm-thick armor. A properly-angled E-75 can reliably bounce shots even from Tier 10 guns.</li><li> The Indien-Panzer, the tier 8 medium on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> German medium line, boasts 90mm all-around hull armor, with just enough sloping to make it trollbounce incarnate against shots that are poorly aimed or baited into a heavily-angled side.</li><li> The Tier 4 French "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName">light</a>" tank, the AMX 40, has well-sloped 70-80mm thick armor, which is thicker than its equivalent tier <em>heavy tank</em>. Now factor in that most early guns in the game can only penetrate around 50-60mm thick armor. Some people have already started to refer to the AMX 40 as the Tier 4 Maus.<ul><li> A little explanation to understand just how well-armored it is: this tank easily gets the "Steel Wall" award for absorbing <em>thrice its total health</em> in damage and <em>surviving</em>. It often happens without any actual damage to its hitpoints.</li></ul></li><li> The infamous Tier 9 T95 American tank destroyer has <em>305mm</em> of armor, more than even the Maus.

Although classified as medium tank with a physical turret, only the hull-mounted gun could be used, giving it the play style of a tank destroyer. However, due to its arrangement, the M3 is ineffective as either a tank destroyer or a medium tank. The positioning of its gun means that the tank must turn its entire body, making it too cumbersome for aggressive flanking attacks suited for mediums. Since it has a highly visible turret that can be shot at, the M3 has a poor camouflage value that prevents it from successfully ambushing foes like a tank destroyer.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaGame">Meta Game</a>: World of Tanks is interesting in that the variety of servers (and lack of mobility between servers - you can't transfer accounts) means that drastically different gameplay styles have evolved on each.<ul><li> The RU Russian servers are by far the most populated - Players prefer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">very aggressive tactics</a> along with high caliber 'derp' howitzers.</li><li> The EU Western European servers are defined by mostly a lack of communication, due to the varying languages (with German and Polish being the most common) - Players prefer lots of heavy tanks and some tank destroyers, since they are generally the least team dependent.</li><li> The NA North American servers (basically America and Canada) are very lightly populated and thus features a more average player base - NA generally has more light tanks, mediums, and artillery per capita than the other servers, combat is generally very campy.</li><li> The Asian <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16dln4');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note16dln4" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16dln4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Previously known as the SEA server; serves the South East Asian region, as well as Australia and New Zealand</span> server doesn't really have its own meta - It is decently populated most of the time and primarily features locals who either don't understand much of the game or transferred back from other servers (a couple of one-time events after the server was established) for the reduced ping, and international players who make a separate account for relatively easy battles.

In addition to the Type T-34 mentioned above and IS-2 mentioned below, there's a Chi-Ha at tier 3 (with the exact same name as the Japanese Chi-Ha) and M5A1 Stuart at tier 4 (with only the A1 keeping it seperate from the American M5 Stuart).</li><li> The KV family: The KV-1, KV-2, KV-3, KV-4 and KV-5 are known as the slowest tanks in the game (the price for heavy armour) that even SPGs can outrun.

For all weapons, the displayed damage and penetration values are averages, with each shot deviating by up to 25%. A string of low damage rolls, especially with a large gun, can greatly reduce a tank's effectiveness. Or the game could decide against that this shot is going to get a minimum penetration roll and thus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">bounce</a> even if a previous shot on the same spot penetrated. This is before getting into the randomized chance to damage internal modules, which includes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> of a destroyed ammorack or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PercentDamageAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PercentDamageAttack">Percent Damage Attack</a> of a fire tacking even more damage on (or just having the module/crewman absorb the entire round for no damage to the tank).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks">Ramming Always Works</a>: Sometimes a last-resort tactic for tank drivers when the need to kill an enemy tank is imminent, especially while reloading. A slight bump causes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> on both the rammer and the rammee; a hard-enough crash can deal substantial amount of damage, and upon the introduction of updated motion physics in patch 9.14, can even roll over an enemy tank. Who comes out on the worse end of a ram is based on the armour and the weight of both the rammer and the target. But since speed also matters and the heaviest tanks tend to be very slow, super-heavy tank drivers often like to get on top of steep hills in order to set up a ram kill against light tanks. Which is less about practical combat tactics and more about the sheer joy of running over smaller tanks. The Controlled Impact perk for drivers actually increases the damage to the other tank by 15% and decreases damage to your tank by 15%, but only if the other tank is stationary. Spall liners also reduce the amount of damage taken in a ram, with there being 4 versions available: Light (tanks less than 30 tons, 20% damage reduction), Medium (30-50 tons, 25% reduction), Heavy (50-70 tons, 30% reduction) and Superheavy (70+ tons, 50% reduction).<ul><li> The "Kamikaze" medal is given to the player who plays this trope straight to kill an enemy tank that is a tier higher than the one they're using.</li><li> For a few tanks that have a pretty good combination of mobility, frontal armor and heavy weight, ramming is considered a core part of their playstyle rather than just something fun when the situation presents itself. Such dedicated rammers are widely considered the only tanks where spall liners are considered worthwhile (since with only 3 equipment slots per tank there's usually better choices). The Panther/E-50 line of German medium tanks is particularly known for this, since they're heavier and have better front hull armor than most same-tier mediums and yet still have the speed of a medium tank, especially the Tier X E-50 M. And the Tier V premium medium tank Pz.Kpfw. V/IV is known as the <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry.

The shot bounces if the Penetration Roll is too low and unlucky players tend to get Low Damage Rolls most of the time. There is also a Critical Damage Roll depending on where the vehicle gets shot.<ul><li> The best indication of a player being mocked by the RNG is when they point-blank a shell into an enemy tank and it only causes Critical Damage. (Example: A 90mm AP shell from a BDR G1 B only injures the commander of an AMX 40 with the Stock Turret which only has 70mm Front Armor.)</li><li> The 152mm "Trollcannons" seems to be the personal favorite of the RNG, particularly the BL-10 variant on the ISU-152. When a gun with 286mm of penetration bounces off the front of a vehicle with less than a third of that armor, or misses at very close range despite having been perfectly aimed at the target, you know that the RNG is screwing with you big time.

Despite lacking in he penetration department, its ML-20 howitzer deals considerable amount of damage wih its HE shells capable of dishing out 910 points on average.

If the rammer rams a vehicle too heavy, though, the lighter vehicle will be worse off from the collision. There is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmeticAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmeticAward">Title of Honor</a> for destroying a tank that's higher tier than yours by ramming it. Appropriately, it's called "Kamikaze".<ul><li> The E-50 weighs in at around 60 tons but can still reach a top speed of 60kph, making it an amazing rammer. Players have reported knocking 20-35% health off the T-54 just by ramming it once at top speed.<ul><li> Similarly, the KV-5 weighs in at 100 tons and can reach 40kph.

Rarely does a tank survive this kind of attack. The tier-10 AMX 50 B is especially good at this, since it now has an impressive 170mm of frontal armor to slam into other tanks.</li><li> The Controlled Impact skill for drivers was made with this trope in mind: when you ram somebody while using this skill, you do more damage, and take less in return. It's very popular with drivers of the aforementioned E-50 and AMX 50 B.</li><li> The Aufkl&auml;rungspanzer Panther is as almost fast as the best light tanks, but is still as heavy and well-armored as a regular Panther. Usually one ram and a shot from its 105mm cannon is enough to finish of any light tank in the game, save for another Aufkl&auml;rungspanzer Panther or a Chinese WZ-132.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Tank Rush</a>: In random matches, teams will have a few coordinated platoons of three tanks each <em>at best</em>.

While this reduces the number of guns shooting at the team, they could easily be left to friendly tanks instead of wasting an artillery shell that takes a very long time to reload.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Took a Level in Badass</a>: French tanks until Tier 4 are cumbersome behemoths with poor fire power, and as such many players see them as little more then (slightly) mobile cover and SPG bait. That said, at Tier 5, they go 180 degrees and become fast, lightly armored and armed with deadly cannons, a much more favorable combination, especially with guns in that tier being what they are.<ul><li> Unfortunately, the sudden gameplay shift between slow and heavy and fast with overwhelming firepower can frequently result in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInDumbass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInDumbass">the direct opposite</a> for the unprepared player, or for players who actually like being slow and ridiculously well armored.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse">Too Awesome to Use</a>: Premium ammunition, which is either bought with real money or an inflated amount of credits, can give a lot of tanks a leg up when they would otherwise not be competitive (for example a light tank which could hardly even dent a heavy tank with standard ammunition can become a credible threat with premium ammunition). However, the cost of firing it makes it quickly impractical to use as a replacement for standard ammunition. A good strategy is to only keep a few premium rounds in the tank and only switch to it from standard ammunition when a hard, high-value target presents itself.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a>:<ul><li> A worrying amount of players seem to have no idea how the ramming mechanic works (in essence, armor + weight will always beat momentum) or assume that a higher tier/health tank can always ram-kill a lower one and so one sees such stupidity as KV-85 (weight: ~43 tons) drivers thinking that their tank will survive ramming a TOG II* (weight: nearly <em>85 tons</em>).</li><li> Another large amount of the population similarly fails to understand vision mechanics, of which are most are rather apparent when they start <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

Evergreens with leaves going to the ground will provide concealment when standing up too.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TutorialFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TutorialFailure">Tutorial Failure</a>: World of Tanks is notorious for having one of the worst tutorials in today's gaming world. About the only thing it tells you is explaining very basic game controls such as how to move your tank or using sniper view, and some basic tactics. It ranks about as high as Minecraft Beta for not telling its new players how to play the game.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyBearAsses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyBearAsses">20 Bear Asses</a>: Wargaming issues a monthly challenge in which players can get a free tank with garage slot upon completion. Unfortunately, the required tasks are so unreasonably tall that casual gamers will never, ever come close to reaching even the 25% mark within the specified time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndergroundMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndergroundMonkey">Underground Monkey</a>: A lot of tanks in-game are similar to each other, often justified by their real-life counterparts. Some modifications of certain tanks are also considered different tanks in-game for balance purposes or to make up for the low diversity of the nation's tanks.<ul><li> The Soviet medium tank branch from the A-20 through to the T-43 are basically the same chassis with different armor and turrets; the KV-1, KV-2, KV-1S and T-150 heavy tanks are the same.</li><li> The German PzKpfw III Ausf. A and PzKpfw III (Ausf. E or M, depending on the chosen equipment) are the same tank with different equipment. Similarly, there's the PzKpfw IV divided into Ausf. A, D and H models, plus the PzKpfw IV Hydraulic gift tank and the PzKpfw IV Schmalturm premium tank, as well as the Panther, Panther II, PzKpfw V-IV, Aufkl&auml;rungspanzer Panther and Panther-M10. Also, the main difference between the E-50 and E-50 Ausf.M is that the M has more hitpoints and a rear-mounted transmission.</li><li> The American T1 Heavy and M6 Heavy are the same tank model with different turrets and camouflage.</li><li> All American medium tanks from Tier 7 onwards, the T29, T32 and T34 heavy tanks, the T30 tank destroyer and the T21 light tank are basically prototypes or modifications of the M26 Pershing.</li><li> 6 modifications<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note28svyv');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note28svyv" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note28svyv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The basic M4, the M4A3E8 "Easy Eight", the M4A3E2 "Jumbo", the M4A2E4 gift tank, and the British Sherman III and Sherman Firefly</span> of the M4 Sherman are also split into separate tanks.</li><li> There's also the T28 and the T95 tank destroyers, both being based of the real life T28/95 GMT, with the only difference being the 2nd line of tracks being removed.</li><li> The SU-152 and ISU-152 are the inverse of the above examples, having near-identical upper hulls placed on different lower hulls (the KV-1 and IS-1/2, respectively).</li><li> The French AMX 50/100, AMX 50/120 and AMX 50B are pretty much the same tank, just with different equipment (the 100 and 120 in the designations refer to the caliber of guns they are designed to mount). The same goes with the AMX 13/75 and the AMX 13/90.</li><li> The German Pz.Kpfw 38H 735 (f) is essentially a French Hotchkiss H35 with a German gun and radio.</li><li> The Japanese Type 5 heavy tank is practically identical to the Type 4 heavy a tier lower - the only difference being very slightly thicker armor.</li><li> Chinese tanks are, for the most part, slightly modified copies of other nations' tanks. Examples include M5A1 Stuart (American), Renault NC-31 (French), Vickers Mk. E Type B (British) and of course Soviet copies like the IS-2. Also, the WZ-132 is the WZ-131 with enhanced firepower and armor protection.</li><li> The British Centurion Mk. 7/1 is an upgraded version of the Centurion Mk. 1, and the Centurion Action X is the Centurion Mk. 7/1 with an experimental turret. The Churchill VII is the Churchill I with better armor and some minor equipment improvements.</li><li> The Matilda Black Prince is a Cromwell turret mated to a Matilda chassis.</li><li> The new Czechoslovakian tanks include the LT vz. 35 and the LT vz. 38, both of which served in the Wehrmacht as the Pz. 35(t) and the Pz. 38(t). A couple modifications are unique to each, but they're basically the same.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGameplayChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGameplayChange">Unexpected Gameplay Change</a>: A few vehicles don't play like everything else in their line.<ul><li> The M3 Lee medium tank does not have a rotating turret <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note29d4jq');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note29d4jq" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note29d4jq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">While the turret is modeled on the tank, it's not going to be made functional until multi-gun support is implemented.</span>, making it play more like a tank destroyer than the medium tank it's classified as. This is a major factor in it being considered <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">That One Tank</a> by a lot of players going down the American medium and heavy lines.</li><li> Conversely, there's a whole TD line for the Americans whose whole gimmick is that they're tank destroyers with a turret. Even if you stick purely to the T110E3 line, you'll eventually have to play through the turreted M10 Wolverine and M36 Jackson</li><li> Light "scout" tank lines only go up to tier 8 before switching onto a medium line, although one could say that this is a minor change at the most. The American scout lines take the cake: They go from scouts into autoloading mediums (although this isn't much of a change if the player comes from the T71) into the T57 Heavy, which is designed as more of a brawler.</li><li> The American M4A3E2 Sherman "Jumbo" is one if you're playing it to get through the American medium tank line, being a relatively slow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a> compared to the other American mediums, which are all generally well rounded, though not especially armored.</li><li> The Russian SU-26 SPG, British Birch Gun and French BatChat 155 are the only artillery pieces with a fully-rotating turret, allowing them to fire in any direction without having to stop and reorient. The latter also has a revolver auto-loader, granting it a much higher rate of fire than most other SPGs.</li><li> Tier 1-4 French tanks tend to focus heavily on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">armor at the expense of speed and firepower</a>. Once you start to get around Tier 5 or 6, French designs start putting <em>much</em> more emphasis on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">speed</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">firepower</a> and tend to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShedArmorGainSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShedArmorGainSpeed">very weak armor</a>.</li><li> The British TD line repeatedly plays to this trope until Tier 5; the UC 2pdr is fast but somewhat unmaneuverable and lightly armoured, while the Valentine TD is slow and unmaneuverable, but slightly better armoured. Then you hit the speedy and maneuverable Alecto &mdash; and then you get to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">AT2</a>. And then it happens once again at the very end: All the way up to tier 9 you have guns that focus on DPM over raw alpha damage (to the point where the Tortoise has the best DPM in the game)... and then you get the FV215b (183) mounting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">183mm cannon</a> that can one-shot most of the tanks in the game (including some tier 10 mediums) with its HESH round, which deals an average of 1750 damage per shot.</li><li> Patch 9.5 introduces the Archer TD which was intentionally designed to pop off 1-2 shots and then run away before the enemy can retaliate which means all that practice on learning how to drive the Alecto and Crusader SP won't go to waste anymore. If you choose to pursue the FV4005 from the other line, it's a transition from medium tanks to tank destroyers.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateNames">Unfortunate Names</a>: A few:<ul><li> "Assmann" is an available surname choice for German Crewmen.</li><li> Heh, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HehHehYouSaidX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HehHehYouSaidX">Dicker Max</a></em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note30xs6i');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note30xs6i" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note30xs6i');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Funny for English-speaking players, as the name itself means "Fat Max" in German</span>.</li><li> Having a ST-I in your nether regions is pretty much exactly as unpleasant as it sounds.</li><li> The O-Ho heavy tank - that's exactly what people do when they hear the name!</li><li> "Dickerson" is an available surname choice for American Crewmen. As is "Balls".</li><li> Wargaming has unknowingly offended players of Spainish-Mexican ancestry by being historically accurate with the Sp&auml;hpanzer 1C. Germany used Roman Numerals in their tank abbreviations, which leads the tank's abbreviation to be rendered as SP I C in-game.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong">Unskilled, but Strong</a>:<ul><li> Soviet tanks have good hard stats (armament, armour, and speed), but lack accuracy, reload speed and radio range.</li><li> HE-only cannons can qualify. They can deal outrageous amounts of raw damage and easily cripple tanks. However, they have low penetration, which is a problem... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxingLessonsForSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxingLessonsForSuperman">unless the player has learned the enemies' weakspots</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VariableMix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VariableMix">Variable Mix</a>: The background music will change depending on the action unfolding. Often borderline on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicalSpoiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicalSpoiler">Musical Spoiler</a> when the enemy is unseen for some reason, but the combat music starts playing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisibleInvisibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisibleInvisibility">Visible Invisibility</a>: Spotted enemies will always have a red mark over their vehicle and show a red outline if you've got a direct shot at them, even through opaque obstacles.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun">Visual Pun</a>: One of the ads for the game features Winston Churchill and Oliver Cromwell riding their respectively named tanks.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">Weak, but Skilled</a>:<ul><li> Many light tanks and low tier mediums (such as the Leopard or the M7) aren't considered a big deal, often dying in the first few seconds of combat. But even one experienced scout past the frontline can raise hell long enough to prevent the enemy from assembling defenses in time.</li><li> In general, German cannons deal less damage per capita than their American and Russian counterparts, but penetrate better and are accurate from much, much farther out. They also tend to have superior radios earlier, allowing them to know what's going on across the whole battlefield.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWinBecauseYouDidnt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWinBecauseYouDidnt">We Win... Because You Didn't</a>: Possible in the Assault game mode, should at least 1 defender still be alive and the attacking team hasn't completed the capture yet once time runs out. In other modes, running out of time counts as a draw instead.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAPieceOfJunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAPieceOfJunk">What a Piece of Junk</a>:<ul><li> Soviet heavy tanks are covered in welding seams, peeling paint, dirt and rust. Do not be fooled.</li><li> The Chinese tree takes it further - their tanks are absurd-looking, bodged-together mashups of second-hand parts from every other country, but that's small comfort when you're staring down the barrels of their viciously powerful guns.</li><li> The Japanese "Godzilla" heavy tanks have flat armor plates held together with hundreds of rivets, but their armor is some of the thickest in the game and their guns are devastating.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes">Why Did It Have To Be Gun Depression/Elevation?</a>: Expect to confront the limits of your vehicle's ability to raise or lower its gun a <em>lot</em>, particularly on the more hilly maps like El Halluf, or pretty much any time you want to come up over a ridge and can't fire at anyone before they get free shot at your vulnerable lower front glacis. This is especially bad with the taller heavy tanks who can't depress their guns low enough to shoot smaller tanks that are firing at point-blank range.<ul><li> The French tank destroyer line added in 0.7.4 features an even more frustrating example - the tier III TD, the Renault UE 57, has one of the worst gun depressions of all tank destroyers in the game at 2 degrees. The only other vehicles in the game with worse gun depression are artillery, many of which can't even point their guns down at all, having 0 degrees. It's usually less of an issue for them though, considering they usually will be firing at far away targets anyways.</li><li> German and Russian tanks in general have poor gun depression, usually having about 6 degrees, give or take 1, in either direction.</li><li> While American and British tanks almost universally have excellent gun depression of around 8 to 10 degrees (usually closer to the latter on medium and light tanks), even they will encounter slopes too steep to fire over from a hull-down position.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAllLookFamiliar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAllLookFamiliar">You All Look Familiar</a>: When recruiting a new crew member, it's possible for him to get an avatar that is already being used by another existing crew member.</li></ul></div><hr>
