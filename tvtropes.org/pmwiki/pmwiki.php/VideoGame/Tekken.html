Punches and kicks are uniquely mapped to the four face buttons, with each one corresponding to a limb. If you press a button that uses the right arms, then the character will almost certainly strike with that arm, for example. Characters also have massive movelists &mdash; for example, main character Kazuya has over 60 moves by <em>Tekken 7</em>, and that's not even getting into characters like Yoshimitsu or Hwoarang, who have stances with their <em>own</em> dedicated movelists. This complexity has earned it many fans around the globe, and the series has a reputation for being one of the most challenging, technical yet highly rewarding fighting games a person can play.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p><em>Tekken</em> has been extremely successful in arcades (and later in console ports), with characters' fighting styles influenced by real-life martial arts. The series contains seven games so far as well as a dream tag match game series called <em>Tekken Tag Tournament</em>. It has also spawned 3 separate movies; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TekkenTheMotionPicture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TekkenTheMotionPicture">one traditionally animated</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tekken">one live-action</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TekkenBloodVengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TekkenBloodVengeance">a CG movie</a>.

The series has often been derided by the father of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadOrAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadOrAlive">Dead or Alive</a></em> series, Tomonobu Itagaki; however, other fighting game developers (such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a></em> co-creator Ed Boon) enjoy the series.</p><p>Lately, the series has been going from strength to strength; <em>Tekken Tag Tournament 2</em> was confirmed in late 2010 to much fanfare and approval, and is one of the most expansive and exciting entries of the series so far. Nintendo fans are finally seeing some <em>Tekken</em> love for the first time since <em>Tekken Advance</em> also, with <em>Tekken 3D: Prime Edition</em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo3DS">Nintendo 3DS</a>. Lastly, but certainly not least, the series is finally going head-to-head with its old rival, in the form of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterXTekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterXTekken">Street Fighter X Tekken</a></em> and <em>Tekken X Street Fighter</em>, 2 separate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover">Crossover</a> games developed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom">Capcom</a> and Namco respectively. An updated version of <em>Tekken Tag Tournament 2</em>, <em>Tekken Tag Tournament 2 Unlimited</em>, was released as a patch to arcade units in March 2012, and a home console version of <em>Tag 2</em> with the changes introduced by it was released in September for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Wii U. This is notably the first time a <em>Tekken</em> title has ever been available on a Nintendo home console. In June 2013, Namco released <em>Tekken Revolution</em>, a free-to-play installment based on the <em>Tag 2</em> engine exclusively for the PlayStation 3 via the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationNetwork">PlayStation Store</a> featuring new gameplay mechanics such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointBuildSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointBuildSystem">customizable character stats</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit">Critical Arts</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvulnerableAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvulnerableAttack">Special Arts</a>.

The movie saw a limited theatrical release, but saw most of its distribution via DVD and Blu-ray releases in 2011, as well as being bundled with <em>Tekken Hybrid</em> (a Blu-ray which also includes <em>Tekken Tag Tournament HD</em> and a demo of <em>Tekken Tag Tournament 2</em>) and <em>Tekken 3D: Prime Edition</em>.</p><p>The series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">many, many</a> characters can all be found <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/Tekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/Tekken">here.</a></p><p></p><hr><h2><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">Get Ready For The Series' Trope Examples</a>:</h2><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # to E&nbsp;</div><div id="folder1" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating">0% Approval Rating</a>: In <em>Tekken Tag 2</em>, characters can enter Rage Mode faster or slower depending on how much they like their teammate.

However (<em>Tekken 6: Bloodline Rebellion</em> notwithstanding), a player who does understand their subtleties will have learned the best characters in the game.</li><li> 10-hit combos deal loads of damage but requires precise timing.

It also consumes a large chunk of round time, allowing you to win a round just by time out should you prefer.</li><li> There is a special category of attacks in the game many Tekken players refer to as "Just Frame" moves that require highly precise inputs performed within a significantly narrow time frame. With a few exceptions, these moves tend to be either unlisted on a character's movelist, or they are listed but without any indication of there being a Just Frame version. More often than not, being considered an expert in using a particular character who has Just Frame moves involves mastering said commands and being able to reliably use them when necessary during fights. The most famous example is the Mishima characters' EWGF (Electric Wind God Fist), an offensively faster (as well as slightly more damaging) and defensively safer variant of the Wind God Fist attack. In fact, part of the reason the Mishimas are so notoriously this trope is the fact that many of their best combos involve using the EWGF <em>multiple times</em> in juggles.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan">Dirty Old Man</a>: Put Wang against any female (with the exception of Xiaoyu), and see for yourself.

Not for nothing does it get a Teen rating for partial nudity and sexual themes. The outfits are more revealing, the breasts are larger and bouncier than ever, and special mention should be given towards all the sexy clothing pieces found in Customization with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingSwimsuitScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingSwimsuitScene">bikinis</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexySantaDress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexySantaDress">sexy Santa dresses</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meido" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meido">maid uniforms</a> galore.<ul><li> Special mention should also be given to the character select panel options, namely Panel 4. The Panel 4 images, usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic">Stripperiffic</a> in nature, could rival what is found in <em>Dead or Alive</em>. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fightersgeneration.com/games/tekkentag2-p4.html">See them here.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (The illustrations in question are by Shunya Yamashita.)</li><li> This isn't to say that the male characters are left out. Most male characters who don't already have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingShirtlessScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingShirtlessScene">shirtless costume</a> can be customized to have one. In addition, almost every male swim suit is as sexy as the ladies' - the overwhelming majority of younger guys (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilverFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilverFox">and even some of the older ones</a>) wear nothing more than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fundoshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fundoshi">fundoshi</a> or speedos.</li><li> In the interest of fairness it needs to be pointed out that this doesn't apply to each female character in equal measure. Xiaoyu and Jun still have moderately-sized breasts and a number of the default female costumes are actually quite conservative &mdash; the only way to get them to show the levels of flesh mentioned above is to customize them. There is also Leo (officially female) who has no jiggle physics, no Fanservice type clothes (except a bikini) and no flirty animations. And Angel has maid and Santa outfits, but no bikini; which makes sense since it's kind of hard to work around her wings, which cannot be modified or removed in customization.</li><li> In TTT2 the only females without jiggle physics are: Angel, Leo, Lili, and Christie. However, they all gain jiggle physics with alternate costumes except Leo.</li></ul></li><li> In Tekken 7, several female characters have alternate costume options that alter their figures. The already buxom Eliza, for example, has her chest nearly double in size.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticFightingStyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticFightingStyle">Fantastic Fighting Style</a>: A few examples throughout the series, most prolific being Mishima Fighting Karate. It's the chosen style of Jinpachi, Heihachi, Kazuya, Jin (initially) and, by extension, Devil and Devil Jin. Barring a little lightning, some flashy moves and a few of Jinpachi's more ridiculous powers, the style is mostly rooted in real Karate styles, though these differ by character, leading one to wonder if Mishima style has any original forms or is simply a system of crosstraining.<ul><li> Heihachi mostly uses Goju-ryu, a traditional Okinawan style with low stances and a balance of hard and soft moves.</li><li> Kazuya is primarily rooted in Shotokan, which emphasizes hip rotation, range and counter attacks. His style may be the least reminiscent of real Karate, as his moveset has changed very little since the earlier games while other characters have been updated with realistic Motion Capture movesets. Devil uses this style as well.</li><li> Jin uses Shito-ryu in earlier games, a fast and high style, but also has some throws from his mother and some special attacks from his dad and grandpa. He ditched Mishima style after Tekken 3 in favor of "traditional Karate", which is probably Kyokushin judging by his moveset, kata and subtle hints in his backstory<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6wckz');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6wckz" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6wckz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He trained at a dojo in Brisbane, a city which at the time of Tekken 4 had a famous Kyokushin school with a renowned master</span>.

The series tried to avert this in <em>Tekken 4</em>, which featured several stages in uneven ground. It was poorly received and the game went back to square one. On the other hand, <em>Tekken 6</em> introduced a different definition of "uneven" (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreeFloorFighting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreeFloorFighting">Free Floor Fighting</a> below).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderization</a>:<ul><li> The conflict between the Williams sisters received this. In <em>Tekken 1</em> and <em>2</em>, it was mostly just Nina playing mean pranks on Anna (stealing one of her shoes in Ninas T1 ending, taking nude Polaroids of her getting out of the shower in Anna's T2 ending). By the time Tekken Tag and Tekken 4 rolled around, it had shifted to the two of them attempting to outright murder each other.</li><li> Paul went from a dedicated warrior who wanted to be the strongest fighter in the world to a bumbling self absorbed jackass who's only fighting for fame and money, generally losing to joke characters.</li><li> With each sequential entree in the series, Kazuya loses more and more cartoonishly evil. In <em>Tekken 2</em>, he dabbled in organized crime, assassinations and illegal research, but by the time of <em>Tekken 6</em>, he has made several bids to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a>, attempted to murder his own son, and numerous other horrible acts.</li><li> Ling Xiaoyu is a case that <em>gained</em> more depth after her initial appearance, and then lost it to a <em>different</em> form of Flanderization. In <em>3</em>, her only character trait was the desire to build an amusement park. Then her ending in <em>Tag</em> gave a <em>slight</em> hint of her interest in Jin Kazama, followed by <em>4</em> confirming that they know each other and are good friends. From <em>5</em> onwards, Jin has been the centerpiece of <em>every</em> motivation Ling has.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep">Flash Step</a>: Several characters have highly mobile bursts of speed that make them briefly disappear and reappear, such as Lars, Raven, and Eliza, just to name a few.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerlyFriendlyFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerlyFriendlyFamily">Formerly Friendly Family</a>: <em>Where to begin!?</em><ul><li> Heihachi Mishima used to be deeply in love with his wife, Kazumi. However, when she reveals that the only reason she married him was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to assassinate him before his ambitions for world conquest ruined the world, he is forced to kill her in self-defense</span>. In turn, this made Heihachi bitter towards not only her, but their son (because he had the same supernatural curse in his blood that she did). Likewise, when a young Kazuya learned that Heihachi had killed his beloved mother, Kazuya attacked him. Then, both as a test to see if the boy would succumb to his curse and out of spite, he tossed Kazuya off a cliff. Sure enough, the Devil took hold and from that moment on, both father and son were mortal enemies.</li><li> Kazuya was also very fond of his paternal grandfather, Jinpachi, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DotingGrandparent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DotingGrandparent">who partially trained and doted on him</a> as a youth before Heihachi betrayed him. By the time Kazuya had grown up, Jinpachi had been consumed by a wicked demonic power and Kazuya himself had embraced his devil persona. Thus, in Kazuya's Tekken 5 ending, he briefly holds his injured grandfather in his arms and the two recollect their happier years together...before Kazuya's eyes burn red and he flashes a Slasher Grin before finishing Jinpachi off.</li><li> History repeated with Kazuya's son, Jin Kazama. While not exactly "loving" of his grandfather, Jin was told by his mother Jun to seek Heihachi if something ever happened to her (which it did). Heihachi raised and trained Jin, and even enrolled him in his school, but it was all part of Heihachi's plan to lure out Jun's killer: a creature called Ogre. When Jin gets to Ogre first and slays him, Heihachi decides that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">he has outlived his usefulness and orders his men to gun him down</a>.

Lei was initially a subversion, until his Chinese accent suddenly became American in <em>Tekken 6</em> (it <em>is</em>, however, a Hong Kong English accent, so this might be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">Double Subversion</a>).</li><li> Also the main characters in <em>6</em>'s Story Mode. Lars is Swedish and Alisa is a robot made by a Russian. They for some reason decide that the optimal language to speak would be perfect Japanese. However, Alisa is arguable, considering she is a robot and <em>can</em> be programmed to speak Japanese (theoretically, she could have any language loaded into her memory banks), as well as the fact that her current "master" &mdash; the person whose commands she's programmed to obey &mdash; is Japanese. Except for the fact Lars is half-Japanese and has been working for a Japanese company, it would make sense that he would be bilingual. <em>Why</em> he prefers Japanese is anyone's guess. (Although it's actually not too strange since Lars himself is well aware how big a deal his father is and that he'll probably have to deal with issues revolving around his father's family sooner or later. In the end, the final decision to make him speak Japanese is probably that it's easier that way while still remaining feasible.)</li><li> Similarly, Xiaoyu gets a pass for not speaking Chinese seeing as she primarily lives in Japan.</li><li> Most of the characters in <em>Tekken Tag Tournament 2</em> speak their native languages like Hwoarang speaking Korean (which has been done ever since <em>Tekken 5</em>), Steve with a British accent and Leo with German. The Japanese characters (with Lars included) speak Japanese as always. The Williams sisters don't speak Irish English, though someone suggested in a forum somewhere that it was probably due to their time in cryosleep experiments. The Williams sisters' cases are understandable in that they're international assassins; revealing their origins by speaking in their native accents would serve to give away their backgrounds.</li><li> <em>7</em> adds the Italian character Claudio, Shaheen who speaks Arabic, and another Brazilian, Katarina. Lucky Chloe's nationality isn't specified, and is made confusing by her speaking Japanese, along with some accented English. The trope is played straight, however, by Filipina fighter Josie Rizal, who speaks clear, unaccented English with absolutely no hint of Tagalog or any other Filipino dialect - that said, English is one of the two national languages spoken in the Philippines, and most Filipinos do get to speak it fluently with no accent, so Josie's portrayal is still somewhat accurate.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsTheSameAnymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsTheSameAnymore">Nothing Is the Same Anymore</a>:<ul><li> <em>Tekken 3</em> must have felt like this for fans when it was first released in 1997, despite wounding up to be the franchise's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingSeriesMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingSeriesMoment">Establishing Series Moment</a>. The story jumped <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">19 years</a></em> from <em>Tekken 2</em> and as a consequence nearly every established characters like Kazuya were discarded and presumably killed off (well, according to the then official story, anyway; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">they had long debunked it</a>), while those who returned were aged up. Instead, the game focused on a new generation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerAndHipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerAndHipper">Younger and Hipper</a> fighters, some of whom doubled as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">Legacy Character</a> for the older characters. If this kind of change is done today, people would no doubt be pissed off. <em>A lot</em> (we're looking at you, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulcaliburV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulcaliburV">Soulcalibur V</a></em>).</li><li> For a lot of players, <em>Tekken 4</em> felt like a step back from <em>Tekken Tag Tournament</em> which had made a number of innovations and included a much larger roster. Gameplay-wise, it went for a grittier feel. It removed the characters' primary throws, added walls to the levels (which had previously been open ended), and introduced a story mode that was not hugely different to Arcade mode. The game only really had two new, non-clone characters, in the form of Steve Fox (who, being a boxer, only has punches) and Craig Marduk (who in story, killed the first Armor King, which led to old school fans instantly disliking him). Although Eddy returned to the game, it was as a second costume for a Moveset Clone, Christie, which many fans felt was demoting an innovative character. Only two pre-Tekken 3 characters not in that game returned in 4, these being Kazuya and Lee. Thankfully, Tekken 5 returned to the series' roots by re-introducing a number of the older characters and improving the gameplay of 4.</li><li> <em>Tekken 7</em> is a lesser case. It is the first game in 18 years to do a major shake-up of the character lineup, mostly to avoid it from expanding too much, and did a much-awaited costume makeover on the entire cast, who had mostly stayed the same since 2004's <em>Tekken 5</em> (these were admitted by Harada). Unlike <em>3</em>, there is no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> and the absent characters very much still have the chance to return sometime in the future.</li><li> Speaking of <em>7</em>, the plot is affected by this, as well, especially in regard to the Mishima family curse and the Devil Gene, with the introduction of Kazumi Mishima, the earliest known person to possess the Devil Gene. Namely, it implies that the Devil Gene is not endemic to the Mishimas, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily">their personal issues</a> are a different can of worms altogether. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And as has been promised since the beginning, the game turns out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADeathInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADeathInTheLimelight">A Death in the Limelight</a> episode for Heihachi, one of the series' most iconic characters.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotJustATournament" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotJustATournament">Not Just a Tournament</a>: In <em>Tekken 2</em>, Kazuya announces the King of the Iron Fist Tournament 2 to get rid of Heihachi and his other enemies.

In <em>Tekken 4</em>, Heihachi needs to get the Devil Gene to become immortal so he announces the King of the Iron Fist Tournament 4 to lure Kazuya and Jin out to obtain the Devil Gene. In <em>Tekken 5</em>, Jinpachi is seeking a worthy opponent who can defeat him and stop the evil in him from destroying the world. And in <em>Tekken 6</em>, Jin initiates the tournament so that he and Kazuya can face off against one another, awakening Azazel and making the latter vulnerable. In <em>Tekken 7</em>, Heihachi assumes control of the Mishima Zaibatsu while Jin is missing and initiates the tournament to draw out Kazuya for one more confrontation.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome">Offscreen Moment of Awesome</a>: Jun fighting off Devil <em>while pregnant with Jin</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ojou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ojou">Ojou</a>: Lili.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldConvict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldConvict">The Old Convict</a>: Eddy Gordo's backstory from <em>Tekken 3</em> is that he was framed by the Mishimas, and while in prison, was trained in Capoeira by the oldest convict interned there. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a> Christie Monteiro is the old man's granddaughter.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">Older Than They Look</a>:<ul><li> Nina and Anna are in their 40's from <em>Tekken 3</em> onward, but still look as though they're in their 20's due to their time in cryogenic sleep.

Everyone appears as they do in their most recent game. This results in Heihachi looking appropriately like what a 70 years old grandpa should be, but not Baek, Bruce, Ganryu, Jun, Kazuya, Kunimitsu, and Michelle looking like what middle aged adults should be. This is particularly striking in the case of Jun and Kazuya, who look less like parents and more like older siblings to their son, Jin.

Jin is most likely named after Jinpachi, as the kanji used (&#20161;) is the same. Kazuya, too, inherited the "kazu" (&#19968;) part from his mother, Kazumi. Ironically, the names that are most commonly confused with one another, Jun and Jin, have unrelated kanji (&#28310; vs &#20161;).

Back in <em>4</em>, if the opponent was backed against a wall while Lee assumed this stance, he was capable of beating the opponent to death with a flurry of jabs.

Unknown in the first <em>Tekken Tag Tournament</em> is shorter than Jun in height, and if you look at her CGI ending, you will realize that she bears little resemblance to Jun (Unknown has noticeably sharper, more Caucasian features, not to mention green eyes, rather than Jun's brown).</span></li><li> The Devil Gene's true origin has changed a lot in between games. The first time, it is explained to be a spontaneous mutation within Kazuya (more on this in the next bullet). The second time, Jinpachi is told to be case zero, thus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRuntAtTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRuntAtTheEnd">skipping Heihachi and Lars</a> in the process. The third time, Azazel is said to be the source, meaning that he and Jinpachi must be connected somehow. The fourth (and probably final) time, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it is revealed that Jinpachi is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a> (his case is because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">Demonic Possession</a>); Kazumi is actually the true case zero, which explains why Heihachi and Lars do not inherit it.</span></li><li> Prior to the concept of the Devil Gene (which appeared for the first time in <em>4</em>), in the very two first games, Kazuya's Devil powers were in fact the doing of Devil, who at the time was a supernatural entity independent from Kazuya (as opposed to being simply a mutated Kaz, as seen in the more recent installments). When kid Kaz was dropped into the "Precipice of Fate" by Heihachi that day, he made a literal Faustian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a>, in order to both survive his fall and to gain power enabling him to exact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge">Revenge</a> on his father. Devil gave the power to Kaz, presumably as a mutation granting him inhuman powers, by the looks of it anyway, though it was never made wholly clear if this form was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">a mutation Devil gave to Kazuya for him to use</a>, or simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">Devil temporally taking over Kazuya's body</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">and using it as a medium to manifest himself physically</a>, but whatever the case, Kaz didn't have complete control over his Devil form/power until <em>4</em> when he fully "assimilated" Devil into himself upon reuniting with a captured Jin in the Hon-Maru temple. Why is Devil's existence as his own character independent from Kaz important you ask? Well, for one, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAngelBadAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAngelBadAngel">Angel's role in the story was to be a force opposing Devil</a> and trying to "save Kazuya's soul" (in <em>Tekken 2</em>, anyway). As soon as Devil ceased to exist as a standalone character, so did Angel, since her sole purpose was to be Devil's enemy, and with him gone, there was no reason for her to continue existing in the story.</li><li> And the reason explaining why Heihachi dropped Kazuya off a cliff in the first place? Up to <em>5</em> (as seen in Xiaoyu's ending in the fifth game, and in other media such as the OVA) it was because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinist">Hei wanted Kaz to be strong</a> enough to inherit his own position as ruler of the Mishima Zaibatsu (which is basically a global financial empire at this point, so whoever rules it gets to be one of the most important, influential men in the world). But <em>7</em> establishes that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hei actually wanted to <em>kill</em> Kazuya before he became a demonic being like his mother. Kazuya's survival was NOT part of the plan</span>.</li><li> And again, Heihachi adopts Lee Chaolan as another son of his own, in order to give a rival adoptive brother to Kazuya and hope said rivalry would groom the latter into a stronger person. Or that's how it was before <em>7</em> anyway...</li><li> And why does Heihachi conceive Lars with an unknown Swedish woman? In <em>6</em>, it was because Hei wanted to make sure he didn't have the Devil Gene in his body (if Lars developed a Devil form like Kaz had before him, it would point Hei as the source of the gene). But in <em>7</em> it's revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Devil Gene's source was Kazumi Hachijo, Heihachi's late wife, and that not only he knew this well, he also killed his own wife in self-defense after she attacked him in her Devil form, and later he tried to kill Kazuya as well before the boy developed a Devil form too</span>. So, if Hei knew this information all along, why did he get into an affair to conceive Lars, anyway?</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a>: <em>Tekken 7</em> has a reveal 23 years in the making: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Devil Gene is not endemic to the Mishima family.

The remaining content not included in that update is included in the arcade update entitled <em>Fated Retribution - Round 2</em> which will bring parity to the console's second season pass in terms of content. This includes a new feature introduced in the second season called "Wall Bounce" where certain moves will slam an opponent into a wall and then repel them back towards the attacker.
