Luring hostiles with stones is a bit trickier than whistling at them, but unlike the Lure Call it won't alert the entire hostile force if you use it more than once.

Some models like Striders, Grazers and Broadheads consume plant matter and process it into raw Blaze in their bodies, which is then further refined into the fuel that keeps all the other machines and installations throughout the world running. Other machines like Tramplers, Lancehorns, Behemoths and even Frostclaws/Fireclaws are basically ore refineries on legs that eat dirt, leach metals and minerals out of it and thus produce the raw materials required to build more machines. Scrappers and Glinthawks cannibalize other fallen machines for recycling purposes as well; if you destroy one in the process of harvesting, you may find amongst its wreckage a compacted cube of recycled metal stock it had formed, or a lootable container box full of salvaged machine parts.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation">Eldritch Location</a>: A scanned glyph found in one of the Carja towns describes the differing, outlandish locations that aren't even featured in the game called "The Forbidden West". The one who penned the entry seemed to be a healer, who recalls his wards' tales about the "Western lands" and their travels &#151;- which incidentally seem to be the cause of their injuries, illnesses, and ultimately, dying or maddened states. The healer continues his recall of the ruined cities his wards mention, as well as even wilder, stranger, and more dangerous machines and the strange tribes of people that roam the land far to the West of the Nora, Carja, Oseram, and Banuk lands. (Though keep in mind, these people are frightened by a description of what's obviously the ocean, and the Carja writers especially have a habit of sensationalising.) Near the end of the entry, the healer recalls how his wards came back with next to nothing, except for small souvenirs from these Western lands, including that of a seashell. Geographically, if the game's map covers Colorado and Utah up to Yosemite, then "The Forbidden West" is presumably the West Coast; California to maybe Oregon.<ul><li> The insides of cauldrons at least <em>look</em> the part, what with the dark, unpleasant atmosphere and constant hum of ancient machinery.

It's also pretty effective against the earlier enemies of the game should you be having trouble with the bow.

Regular Nora by law are not allowed to speak to or even acknowledge that outcasts exist, and are generally encouraged to persecute them.</li><li> The Banuk and Carja aren't friends, also largely due to the Red Raids. One of The Frozen Wilds DLC sidequests highlights this: trying to maintain the relatively peaceful recent relationship, Banuk put one of their own believed to have killed a Carja through a harsh punishment, being left naked and unarmed on a glacier covered in hostile machines, with the view that he'll probably die but if he lives and gets back he's forgiven. The Carja hearing about this are dismayed and want a proper trial for him &mdash; that is, having his mouth filled with salt and being staked out in harsh sun for three days, and if he <em>only</em> loses his sight or sanity that is a sign of the Sun's mercy.</li><li> Also between the Carja and Oseram.

It is near-useless against small or human targets at even point blank range (where spear-hits would do the job better). However, when firing at medium-to-larger machines means every shot hits, and those shots are augmented by damage modifications and/or the Freeze effect, it behaves more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">a primitive auto-shotgun</a>.

Armor plating, weapons and support components can be removed, internal tanks blown up, motive systems rendered inoperable. Heavily damaged machines start spitting sparks from joints and unprotected parts as if they're bleeding, and some even adopt the behavior of a wounded animal. Sawtooths for instance start limping and holding one front paw close to their chest when near death. This mechanism becomes particularly important on Ultra Hard difficulty due to enemy health bars being disabled, leaving visual signs of damage the only way to judge a hostile machine's condition.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleYetAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimpleYetAwesome">Simple, yet Awesome</a>: The Tearblaster has only one firing mode and can't be upgraded at all, but a single hit is all it takes to tear off most machines' armor plating and external components.

Both the old and the current world were/are far from ideal, and the game can get incredibly dark at times, but there's always a ray of light that refuses to be snuffed out. In the distant past, the whole of humanity <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">could've just lain down and surrendered in the face of the Faro Plague, but the Zero Dawn Project gave them hope and inspired them to fight back, against the extinction of all life</span>. Sure, there was no shortage of sceptics, but the ones with the means to make it happen believed in it and gave everything they could to ensure life would continue no matter the odds or the sacrifices they had to make. In the current age, for every asshole Aloy meets there're ten good people trying to make the world a better place. If she decides to help them, it works out marvelously most of the time, and in the end she unites almost her entire world against a common foe with basically just the force of her personality (her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWomanArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWomanArmy">One-Woman Army</a> status certainly doesn't hurt, of course), thus laying the groundwork to usher in a new era of peace and progress.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfRobotIntelligence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfRobotIntelligence">Sliding Scale of Robot Intelligence</a>:<ul><li> The Old Ones had advanced to the point of standardizing and legislating it, under the name of the "Turing scale", though there's not much information on what the points on the scale actually are, just that it involves <a class="urllink" href="http://horizonzerodawn.wikia.com/wiki/MIE_Assessment">several subtests<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. They encountered an interesting problem with developing artificial intelligence: the closer to human the intelligence is, the harder it is to predict, because it starts encountering all those messy human emotions on its way up the scale. Like fear. ELEUTHIA Cradle servitors are at Turing 0.4, noted as being enough for "low-grade empathy and limited improvisation without undermining adherence to codified behavior sets". Turing 0.6 is the legal limit but even scores in the 0.5 range are high enough that continued monitoring is 'strongly advised', and the known record was Turing 1.38. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When Elisabet launched GAIA, she was at 0.6 and spun up from there, somewhere past the record.</span></li><li> In The Frozen Wilds <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">CYAN's creators knew that despite this element of unpredictability she'd have to be more complex than was legal to perform her function, and so in mandatory testing some scores were falsified so she appeared to be Turing 0.54, with an earlier test putting her at Turing 0.61 ruled as a false positive</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlobsVsSnobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlobsVsSnobs">Slobs vs. Snobs</a>: Lorund, an Oseram tribesman, and Smiling Rainin, a Carja tribesman, are constantly bickering partners in a scrap business.

Apparently Ted had told his people that he didn't want the machines to have any backdoors into their systems, so this guy not only obliged by ensuring their code was <em>more secure than the most secure military networks in the world</em>, but no one caught it before the line was launched. What Ted most likely meant was "no backdoors that our <em>competitors</em> could exploit", but not leaving any option for FAS itself to get into the machines systems meant that they were pretty much guaranteed to lose control at some point, which they did.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocketedEquipment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocketedEquipment">Socketed Equipment</a>: Usually, outfits will have sockets available for protective weaves to be inserted into for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing">extra protection against a chosen damage type</a>. This, plus the fact that some modifications have multiple bonuses that overlap with the armor itself, means its possible to become immune (or near-immune, on higher difficulties) to a specific element or type of attack. Note that most machines will have a multiple types of attack, such that even if you're immune to a Bellowback's jets of flame, a flaming boulder from a Fireclaw will still hurt a lot. Some types, like melee and missile damage, can be maxed out at only 80%, so some damage is still inevitable.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundCodedForYourConvenience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundCodedForYourConvenience">Sound-Coded for Your Convenience</a>: Most of the different types of machine have distinct-sounding footsteps, allowing the experienced player to tell if (for example) a Watcher, a Sawtooth or a Tallneck is nearby without even checking the Focus. The distinctive purring hum of the stalker, and the whine of their proximity mines, are particularly useful, as their cloaks make them hard to spot visually.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks">Spanner in the Works</a>: Multiple.<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ted Faro deleted APOLLO, the program meant to give the new generation of humanity all the knowledge of the Old Ones. While he claims this was to preserve their innocence, at least part of it was to hide his own culpability for what happened. Sylens blames him for every crime that has happened since, such as the massacres at the Sun Ring. In a (slightly) more immediate way, the childcare robots raising the new generation had no idea what to do without APOLLO, and just kept the children inside the Cradle facilities until they ran out of food. The first generation were therefore unleashed onto a wild world with nothing more than kindergarten education</span>.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nineteen years ago, an outside signal caused HADES to activate unnecessarily, which would have resulted in the extinction of all life on Earth as he un-terraformed the planet.

They're the most powerful single-shot weapon in the game, but you can only carry a few shots for them (base 3, upgraded ultimately to 12) and they fire really slowly. The best thing about them is that they don't alert enemies to you until they start exploding, so you can stick several of them onto a target and switch to a different weapon to finish off the now heavily-injured foe. Also, they're really effective against Helis, who normally tries to block projectiles with his bracers.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopWorshippingMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopWorshippingMe">Stop Worshipping Me</a>: With the reveal that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Nora's supposed "goddess" GAIA created Aloy to save humanity from HADES</span>, the Nora Tribe are quick to bow to Aloy as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">All-Mother's Anointed One</a>".

Most machines have external weapons or support components that can be shot off to various effects in addition to dealing high damage. Removing a weapon makes the machine unable to use it anymore while sometimes Aloy can pick it up to turn it on its former owner. Destroying power cells, fuel canisters or cooling systems triggers huge elemental explosions and often puts the machine in an elemental state like shocked, burning or frozen. A few components like processor units or heat sinks simply inflict massive damage upon their destruction. The effectiveness of this tactic varies from machine to machine, and high-grade models often protect their vulnerable components with armor plating that must be removed before the part itself can be damaged, but there's no doubt that targeting subsystems is always the most efficient way to take down a robotic enemy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredRobotMeterMaids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredRobotMeterMaids">Super-Powered Robot Meter Maids</a>: Most machine types are ridiculously heavily armed for the function they were originally built for.

Yet almost all of them carry weapons of varying sophistication that often have little obvious use as terraforming tools, and it's always been like this even before the Derangement, which merely made the machines act more aggressively but didn't change their designs.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciousVideogameGenerosity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciousVideogameGenerosity">Suspicious Videogame Generosity</a>:<ul><li> When you're exploring a linear level like a Cauldron and come across a congregation of medicinal plants and/or supply crates near the door to the next area, stock up on everything you can, proceed stealthily and prepare for a fight.</li><li> During the quest "Queen's Gambit", the campsite where you meet Three-Toe Huadiv has a number of supply crates around it, filled with quite a bit of consumables.

Repairing a mount is rarely necessary because most players will unlock the "Call Mount" skill sooner or later, so even if you lose your mount you can immediately call a new one.

Their relentless hunting of what's keeping them alive - GAIA's terraforming machines - is the sole reason Hephaestus began designing and unleashing Combat-class machines, culminating in the truly scary monsters like Thunderjaws or Fireclaws, all in an effort to protect GAIA's work from those blissfully ignorant fleshlings. If mankind would simply stop hunting machines for parts and giggles, things would calm down real fast, but seeing how deep machine hunting is rooted in most tribes' traditions, the odds of that happening are slim to none.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameFlamethrowersSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameFlamethrowersSuck">Video-Game Flamethrowers Suck</a>: One of the new weapons introduced in the expansion, the Forgefire. It's got pathetic range and it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">burns</a> through its ammo entirely too quickly. On top of that, the ammo takes a lot of crafting materials to build. The enemies that have vulnerability to fire are typically too large and powerful to engage at the range of the weapon, and you'll run out of ammo at very inopportune times anyway. You're <em>much</em> better off just using standard fire arrows or fire bombs. Once upgraded to the Improved Forgefire things become a bit better since it now has a secondary attack that shoots a long-range fireball that inflicts heavy damage on the target, but the secondary attack still has low ammo and a long charge-up before it shoots.</li></ul><p></p></div><hr>
