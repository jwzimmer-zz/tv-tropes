These personified warships are based on real-life vessels which are explained in detail within the game; the physical characteristics, appearances and personalities of each of the girls correlate in some way to the real-life vessel (for example, ships with a larger displacement tonnage are often depicted with larger breasts, with the notable exception of a few aircraft carriers...and oddly enough a few cruiser-and-below ships who get depicted with large breasts). The player takes on the role of an admiral (&#25552;&#30563;, <em>teitoku</em>), who can be either male or female, and organises their fleets in battle in order to win. Combat is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdleGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdleGame">largely automated</a>, and manual actions by the player include micromanagement such as building, repairing, and equipping shipgirls.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Not surprisingly the series has spawned a <a class="urllink" href="http://i.imgur.com/H8pATqq.jpg">large number of official print spinoffs<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>, serialized in different magazines (<em>Comic Clear</em>, <em>Comptiq</em>, <em>Dragon Magazine</em>, <em>Famitsu</em>, <em>Monthly Comic Alive</em> among a few).</p><p>An arcade spinoff by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SEGA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SEGA">SEGA</a>'s AM2 division underwent location tests in early 2015 and is slated for an upcoming release.

The 4koma follows Fubuki as a new recruit in the Fleet Academy. There she learns the basics about being a newly-minted ship girl, though most of the time she just gets exposed to the eccentricities of all the other girls attending the academy with her, <em>especially</em> the seniors.</li></ul></li><li> <em><strong>KanColle Play: Kankan Biyori</strong></em><ul><li> The series running in Famitsu, again with Fubuki as its lead. The comic serves as an introduction to some of the gameplay aspects of the game itself... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsBetterWithPenguins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsBetterWithPenguins">with a penguin</a> standing in for the player Admiral.</li></ul></li><li> <em><strong>Someday As The Seas Turn Calm</strong></em><ul><li> Slice-of-life vignettes focusing on a different ship girl per chapter, each concluding with the featured ship girl's modern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KaijuDefenseForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KaijuDefenseForce">Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force</a> or Japan Coast Guard counterpart.</li></ul></li><li> <em><strong>Torpedo Squadron Chronicles</strong></em><ul><li> A series focusing on the adventures of the <em>Akatsuki</em>-class destroyers of Destroyer Division 6, as well as their minders Tenryu and Tatsuta.</li></ul></li><li> <em><strong>KanColle: Nanodesu!</strong></em><ul><li> Another series about Inazuma and her sisters, with focus on Inazuma's conviction to save lives, even if it's that of their enemies. Notable in how it's not set in a specific Japanese naval district, and is instead centered around a town suspiciously similar to Venice...</li></ul></li><li> <em><strong>Shimakaze, Girl of the Whirlwind</strong></em><ul><li> Initially marketed as an ecchi comedy, it focuses on Ensign Akai as he's reassigned to the Maizuru Naval District as an assistant to the serving vice-admiral there. There he encounters his new charges, in particular the titular Shimakaze, who's a problem child of a surprising degree.</li></ul></li><li> <em><strong>Tomarigi no Chinjufu</strong></em><ul><li> A yuri-flavored episodic series, centering on heavy cruisers Kumano and Suzuya. Notable in how it lampshades how the admiral <em>never</em> seems to be around, and instead leaves the day-to-day running of the base to the fleet girls themselves.</li></ul></li><li> <em><strong>Tonight, Another Salute!</strong></em><ul><li> Serialized in <em>Comptiq</em>, this series spotlights Commandante Teste, Gambier Bay and Tashkent as they open a restaurant, following in the footsteps of the mystery-shrouded burger place that came before them.</li></ul></li></ol></div><p>On top of those, there are several official manga anthologies.</p><p>There are also a few official <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovels">Light Novels</a> written for the franchise.</p><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Light Novels&nbsp;</div><div id="folder1" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ol><li> <em><strong>Kagerou, Setting Sail!</strong></em><ul><li> A somewhat serious entry in the franchise, this story follows Kagerou, a trainee at Kure, as she is transferred to the more front-line naval district of Yokosuka.

And before fleets were automatically made to retreat once a flagship is dropped to red or critical status to reduce subcheesing effectivity, flagships couldn't sink under <em>any</em> circumstances. (This still applies to the flagship of the escort fleet when you sortie under Combined Fleet rules, since the automatic retreat only applies to the flagship of the main fleet.)</li><li> Fall 2015 E-2 requires you to bring a light fleet (1 light cruiser, 5 destroyers only). Furthermore, clearing its transport gauge requires you to dedicate space to non-combat equipment, reducing your damage capabilities. Fortunately, you don't need to sink the powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss">Light Cruiser Princess</a> to clear the map.</li><li> Fall 2015 Event also introduces the Submarine Princess. Fortunately, the map she made her first appearance is a Combined Fleet map, which doesn't cause all damage done to submarines to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> during the night battle, meaning it's still possible to sink her even if the day phase doesn't pan out. This is averted in the subsequent appearances in event maps however, much to the frustration of the players who wanted the 16 inch Mk.7 gun during Winter 2015 Event.</li><li> Winter 2016 Event introduces long-distance air raid nodes to replace the Aerial Combat nodes. While it kept the enemy fleet out of range of your carrier's fleet, the enemy fleet only have one bombing phase instead of two for both sides, thereby averting the attrition from an all-out air battle that leads to significant loss of aircraft at both sides (especially if either side have powerful air defenses). These nodes also costs fewer fuel and ammo consumption as well.</li><li> Event drops at Abyssal Combined Fleet nodes tend to be available from A-rank instead of S-rank for Abyssal single fleet nodes, considering that scoring an S-rank against the Abyssal Combined Fleet is much harder with the doubled number of enemy units in the Abyssal Unit on top of the high-armored bosses that serves as the Abyssal fleet flagship.</li><li> The map will display accordingly if you reach an air raid or submarine node, allowing you to choose the appropriate formation.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">Anyone Can Die</a>: Prospective admirals beware, once a ship girl is sunk (when their HP is reduced to zero), they (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLongAndThanksForAllTheGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLongAndThanksForAllTheGear">and whatever's equipped on them</a>) are not coming back, unless you happen to have a special item equipped on her beforehand (damage controls, or damecons; they can only be bought using real-world money!) to make an emergency repair on-location. Even then, it's a one-time deal, and if the same kanmusu gets critical damage again (such as if you advance to a new node after that battle), that's it for her (unless you have <em>another</em> damecon on her, of course, but most people only equip one on a ship at most).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcherArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcherArchetype">Archer Archetype</a>: Some of the Standard Aircraft Carriers (like Akagi), as well as 4 of the Light Carriers, are portrayed as samurai archers.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmchairMilitary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmchairMilitary">Armchair Military</a>: It may seem unusual that "Armchair Admiral" gets mostly played straight, but it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">with justification</a>, since conventional battleships are useless against the humanoid-looking forces of the Abyssal Fleet, so all the humans' battleships look like people (and are all-female because all ships are female, naturally) carrying various military equipment instead to match their tactical capabilities. In other words, there's literally no room for the Admirals during battles, so they have to stay at the base and give orders via radio.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless">Armor Is Useless</a>: The stronger enemy types and bosses are so powerful that they can one-shot even the player's toughest battleships.

Examples are Kongou and Hiei (although many disliked Kongou's "monkey ears" art), Shiratsuyu and Murasame, Kinugasa, Naka and Jintsuu... But a standout example is Hiyou, whose Kai looked like <em>it was drawn by another artist altogether</em>. That was just how much the artist improved.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseShips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseShips">Artistic License &#150; Ships</a>:<ul><li> No, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_T">T-crossing<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> does <em>not</em> work that way. When you T-cross the enemy fleet, you don't take extra damage in return, and when you get T-crossed, you don't take reduced damage either. This is possibly one of many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality">Acceptable Breaks from Reality</a> for the sake of game balance, seeing as the game got most other facts right.</li><li> Before the update on 28 July 2014, fast battleships were unable to equip AP ammo, despite the fact that the <em>Kongou</em>-class did carry them historically.</li><li> Mizuho was introduced during the Summer 2015 event with a listed speed of Fast, when her historical speed was 22 knots (in comparison, <em>Yamato</em>-class, the fastest "Slow" ships, had a speed of 27 knots, and Kaga, the slowest "Fast" ship, had a speed of 28 knots). This was fixed when the event ended. The Chitose-class as AVs had a similar speed, but unlike Mizuho's, theirs weren't fixed.</li><li> The classification of the <em>Yamato</em>-class as slow may also count, seeing as how the real-life <em>Yamato</em>-class was faster than the smaller <em>Fusou</em>, <em>Ise</em>, and <em>Nagato</em>-classes. Also, the <em>Yamato</em>-class had the same top speed as the American <em>South Dakota</em>-class, which were classified as fast battleships. Then again, the class in real life wasn't designed as a "fast battleship" in mind.</li><li> Despite Warspite being historically a fast battleship, here she's a normal (slow) battleship. At least it makes sense since even the slowest Japanese battleship class (<em>Fuso</em>-class) is faster than her. Then comes Gangut, a dreadnought-era battleship who is erroneously categorized as "fast battleship" while having an actual speed listing of "slow".</li><li> While we're on the subject of the abstraction of speeds as "Fast", and "Slow", in the Arcade version, the ship's actual speed does matters. In an all-fast fleet that includes Kaga and/or either of the Chitose sisters and/or Shimakaze, for example, if the order for flank speed is given, this can result in Kaga and the Chitose sisters being left behind, as they are the slowest "Fast" ships, while Shimakaze effectively outruns the rest of the fleet.</li><li> In actual naval battles, aircraft carriers are capable staying out of enemy surface ship's shelling range due to the enormous range of their aircraft. In KanColle the surface ships are able to close into the shelling range of aircraft carriers on both sides (apart from the initial airstrikes). This is definitely out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun">Rule of Fun</a>, as it would be impossible to S-rank any nodes with enemy carriers if your own fleet doesn't have any. The later-introduced pure carrier-on-carrier nodes reflect naval aviation battles more accurately, as only the carriers' air wings engage (twice) and the surface combatants don't get to fire at all, effectively relegating the surface ships to air defense role.</li><li> All cruisers are capable of performing torpedo attacks, including five ships (Ooyodo, Pola, Zara, Houston Mod. 1, and Helena) whose historical counterparts were not armed with torpedoes. The real ships' lack of torpedo armament is reflected in these girls having zero for their torpedo stats. However, not only can they accept torpedo launchers and be capable of launching torpedoes after that, their base torpedo stat can be raised above zero via modernization.</li><li> As the devs once mentioned "The Washington Naval Treaty doesn't apply here". As such, light cruisers can be up-gunned with 203mm main batteries, which are typically heavy cruiser guns. Similarly, all battleships can be up-gunned all the way to 46cm, the largest battleship main gun caliber ever constructed. This has become downplayed when accuracy penalty is imposed on battleships with overweight guns, with Kongou-class being hit the hardest by the penalty.</li><li> Several of the less well-known foreign ships (such as <em>Richelieu</em> and <em>Zara</em>-class) have inaccurate stats, due to their specification details and service history (such as Zara's armor and Richelieu's anti-air refit at New York) not being fully disclosed by Japanese Wikipedia.</li><li> In IJN proper ship classification, all aircraft carriers are considered as fleet standard regardless of their plane capacity, but lighter carriers are put in their own classification in-game. Additionally, the <em>Shouhou</em>-class light carriers was officially designed as <em>Zuihou</em>-class in real life<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7eayk');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note7eayk" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7eayk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">While Shouhou (formerly the seaplane tender Tsurugizaki) is the older ship of the two, Takasaki was converted into aircraft carrier first, effectively making Zuihou the lead ship by commission date</span>.</li><li> All carriers can equip all planes. Historically, certain planes like the Ryuusei and Reppuu were too large for any ship but Taihou and the unimplemented Shinano to use.</li><li> Just like her counterpart in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarshipGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarshipGirls">Warship Girls</a></em>, USS <em>Samuel B. Roberts</em> is mis-classed as a destroyer instead of a destroyer escort, and because of this, she is able to not only equip the USN 533mm quint torpedo launcher introduced with the November ranking rewards, she also gets a stat bonus from the launcher on top of the equipment's base stats.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedGlitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedGlitch">Ascended Glitch</a>: At the start of Spring 2017, the devs had mistakenly make Yamashiro <em>Kai 2</em> a drop at E1's boss node. But then in <em>KanColle Arcade</em>, you can actually acquire <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/4TTIqarbvLw?t=859">a limited edition of Ise Kai card, complete with brand new artwork.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>:<ul><li> Aircraft carriers and battleships in general for players with limited resources, especially new players. They're much more powerful and tougher than anything lighter and they add options such as recon, air superiority and a second shelling phase that can make a big difference in combat. However, their expensive maintenance costs can <em>really</em> put a dent on an admiral's resources, and incur significant repair times whenever they're damaged. Superbattleships Yamato and Musashi take this to extremes, as they use as much as <strong>three times the resources</strong> to refuel and re-arm, and take twice as long to repair even when compared to Nagato, who is herself <em>already</em> a massive resource sink. To a lesser extent, Iowa took twice as much resources as <em>Kongou</em>-class battleships to refuel and re-arm.</li><li> The Tokyo Express expeditions (37 and 38) have a very high resource-to-time ratio, but require you to send out high-leveled destroyers (A Lv50-65 as flagship, plus some more to hit the fleet total level requirements) carrying many (4-8) drum cans, so this puts them out of reach of starter admirals. Becomes Awesome <em>and</em> Practical for more experienced ones that have so many appropriately leveled destroyers that they can randomly toss some into a fleet and still hit the requirement.</li><li> Combined Fleet sorties certainly sound cool in theory, considering that you can sortie 12 ship girls at once for more shelling and firepower. However, sortieing that many ship girls at once is bound to cost a much larger amount of resources, as well as taking away one of the fleets that could've been sent out to expeditions for extra resources (in fact, if you send both support fleets, which is virtually a must for the harder event maps, that would leave you with no expeditions to gain resources from). And that's before mentioning that pretty much every map that requires the Combined Fleet tend to have powerful enemies, and your fleet's accuracy are significantly nerfed.</li><li> 46cm Triple Cannons. The biggest ever gun in real life, this gun boasts the highest firepower out of all other guns. However, not only are they much harder to upgrade compared to other main guns<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8kec4');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note8kec4" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8kec4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Upgrading this gun requires a spare 46cm gun to be used as a modernization material, which can only be obtained as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareRandomDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareRandomDrop">rare result of crafting</a> after pouring around 300 ammo, or from similarly rare outcome of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneySink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneySink">LSC</a> as <em>Yamato</em>-class's stock equipment</span>, stacking them on battleships not designed for them (read: anyone but <em>Yamato</em>-class) causes an accuracy penalty which admittedly isn't that obvious in single-fleet sorties, but very significant in Combined Fleet where accuracy is nerfed further; it will be very difficult for your battleships to hit much of anything at all. For some reason, the 51cm Prototype Twin Cannon doesn't suffer the same accuracy penalty, although only <em>Nagato</em>-class Kai and <em>Yamato</em>-class can equip it, and it requires even more spare 46cm guns to improve as well.</li><li> The first two jet aircraft introduced. They get to attack in an earlier jet assault phase as well, but that just means they get exposed to enemy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAir">Anti-Air</a> twice, making them easier to get shot down. And the damage they do isn't even that much; they deal normal damage in the jet assault phase but reduced damage in the aerial phase. On top of that, they consume steel on a per unit, per battle basis (due to historically having lower service life). As a result, general consensus among the players is that they're not worth using. Hopefully it's just because they're fighter-bombers.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>: The effect of Damage Control (Damecon for short) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutoRevive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutoRevive">prevents your girls from sinking for real.</a> Of course equipping this item causes the ship to not performing as well as it takes up one equipment slot.

To top it off, the standard route for the map boss itself has a disturbingly significant chance of running off-course into a dead end, making the map itself much more frustrating to clear than it already is. While is possible to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm23141876">S-ranking the boss node<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, it is rarely done except for quests that requires S-rank clears in said map.<ul><li> As if the Phase 1 5-5 map wasn't hard enough already, Phase 2 managed to makes it <em>even harder</em>. Sure, the Re-class presence was greatly diminished to the point that the southern route becomes somewhat more viable (if you are willing to wade through <em>two</em> night battle nodes). However, the northern route now has a Tsu-class escort (infamous for killing off shipgirl's bombers) on top of a slightly higher air power <em>and retains</em> the ever-notorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate">Elite Re-class</a>. To top it off, the boss node now can have a formation where Southern War Princess is the flagship.

Examples include the 2014 Summer E-6, Autumn E-4 and 2015 Winter E-4 all have 12 stars. The first of the three was formerly thought to be an absolute nightmare, as documented in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">Fake Difficulty</a> entry due to the nature of the event, but subsequent events took this trope to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">much greater heights than even that</a>.</li><li> 2015 Winter E-5 (A-class) is one of the hardest maps ever conceived at its time. Many Admirals expressed outright disbelief upon seeing two Battleship Princesses (same as Summer 2014 E-6 final boss) now as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DegradedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DegradedBoss">mere escorts</a> to the even more powerful Battleship Water Demon.</li><li> 2015 Spring E-6, indicated with 14 stars. Before the pre-boss, you are guaranteed to encounter at least one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DegradedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DegradedBoss">Abyssal Princess</a> as sub-boss, with the paths with a night battle being the <em>easier</em> paths. The pre-boss node has a guaranteed Aircraft Carrier Princess. Furthermore, the boss, the aforementioned Battleship Water Demon, gains an Aircraft Carrier Princess as an escort for its final form on Medium and Hard difficulty. Surprisingly, it wasn't that hard to clear (in fact 2015 Spring was considered one of the easiest events in the history of the game), but resource drain for combined fleet was <strong>massive</strong>, especially if you intend to farm <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareRandomDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareRandomDrop">Roma</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareRandomDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareRandomDrop">U-511</a>.</li><li> 2015 Summer E-7 ups the ante with its difficulty rated at <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">15</a></strong> stars (appropriately titled "Operation FS"). Unlike the previous final event maps that pit you against an uber-powerful enemy battleship fleet, you're fighting to subdue a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate">heavily guarded</a> destroyer that has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavilyArmoredMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavilyArmoredMook">nigh-impenetrable armor</a>, requiring several relentless assaults on the installations throughout the map to weaken her armour for about a day. Sounds simple in theory once it was figured out, but the map itself has random routing and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate">the pre-boss nodes are very powerful</a> even at the lowest difficulty, making it very difficult just to get to the boss and damage it. In fact, it's not improbable for you to complete this task after many attempts.........only to find out you don't have enough resources left for an assault on the boss herself, and won't be able to get enough until after the daily reset, by which time her armor goes back to its original value. Post-event statistics show that of the about 70% of players who took part in the event, only 45% of them actually managed to beat the map at all!</li><li> 2016 Winter E-3 has 14 stars again. As with the previous event's final map (and possibly subsequent event's final maps thereafter), it is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel">Marathon Level</a> where you need to clear both the Transport Bar and the HP Bar. During the HP Bar phase, it's possible to get Battleship Princess (or two!) leading the mook nodes, and this is the <strong>easier</strong> route as the Carrier Task Force's route have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate">Aircraft Carrier Princess</a> and <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

At Hard difficulty it tops out even the Winter 2015 Event's final boss composition, as you not only have two Battleship Princesses as full-time escorts, but also one Aircraft Carrier Princess <em>before even the last dance</em>. Odds are good that at least two, maybe even all four, will survive into the night battle.</li><li> The <em>entirety</em> of 2016 Spring Event counts as this to certain extent, with the final map at E-7 setting a new record for the hardest boss composition ever seen. Once again having 15 stars, the final boss on Easy has <em>four</em> boss units - Central Princess, Airfield Princess, Aircraft Carrier Princess and Ancient Destroyer Demon. The ante is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">upped even further</a> in Hard Mode with an <em>all-boss composition</em> with Central Princess, Aircraft Carrier Princess, two Battleship Princesses <em>and two</em> Ancient Destroyer Demons.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">Bunny-Ears Lawyer</a>: Most ship-girls could be infected with sudden bouts of crazy, lazy, or stupid or permanent quirk(s) yet can deliver the job done if under competent and lucky admirals.

Other main traits are being eye-catching/fanservice (and sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RummageSaleReject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RummageSaleReject">garish</a>) and later on, the designs working in traits of the actual ships (like the bows being the Akizuki class' stomach protection), with Iowa combining the two. The only one with a significantly different shoe design is Akitsushima and they are rudder <em>wedges</em> rather than the usual stilettos. He also has a thing about sentient turrets, demonstrated with the Rensouhous and the Long 10cm-chan. Coincidentally, all but four of his ship girls feature exceptional stats. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note27nddk');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note27nddk" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note27nddk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Yamato-class <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">need little introduction</a>.

Shimakaze has above-average stats on par with destroyers who have second remodels; Yukikaze has ridiculously high luck apart from having similar maximum stats as the former; Amatsukaze has excellent durability and evasion; and the Akizuki-class have tremendous Anti-Air. Iowa is only second to Yamato-class in firepower and armor, while having superlative LOS and AA...as a <em>Fast Battleship</em>. Finally, Saratoga has peerless durability and AA amongst Fleet Carriers along with a decent offense and plane count. As for the Type AM twins, they feature decent durability and a third gear slot, meaning that they can compensate for their average combat stats. Only Tokitsukaze features generic Kagerou-class stats while Akitsushima compensates for her poor stats with her unique gear (A sentient Flying Boat).</span> He's also the one that starts the meme "the second ships (in a class) have sexy bodies", and this shows in Teruzuki, Mutsu, Musashi and Saratoga. His art while consistent has improved in a few spots, including curve range, making fans look forward to Second Remodel work for his Japanese BBs. With Musashi's second remodel, it hints at him seeking to fix a period of KC art he considers an <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry. It should be moved to the TRIVIA tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a>.</li><li> Ayaki (Tenryuu, Murakumo, Nenohi...): Every ship girl drawn by this artist wear some form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiGravityClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiGravityClothing">Floating Headgear</a>. Additionally, all but one of them wear bladed anklets in their unremodelled form. They also tend to take on rather dynamic poses and rather eye catching outfits. His Kai Ni out tends to drastically chance the girls' outfits; Murakumo being the most noticeable with Tatsuta in second.</li><li> Akira (Mizuho, French ships, Kamoi, Gambier Bay): While mainly an Abyssal artist (having done many of the bosses), he has done a few shipgirls with some eyecatching bits (like the hair of the French ships or Kamoi's Ainu outfit), though he's infamous for how lazy he is (his seasonal art for Mizuho only changes what she's holding for one example). His drawn lines are lighter than most, which is a sure way to tell he did that shipgirl.</li><li> Shibafu (Fubuki-class, Kitakami, Mogami, Ise-class, Akagi, Intrepid and several others...): Perhaps THE founding artist of the game. Unfortunately, the shipgirls drawn by him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces">only feature the same few faces or so</a> as well as relatively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a> designs. He compensates this with consistent art as well as the tendency for some of his shipgirls to be obsessed with being fitted planes, even discounting his Aircraft Carriers. In spite of his limited style, some of his characters are quite popular and a few being effective yet gotten early; it's charming in its simplicity (in a <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

He tends to favor smaller and more slender figure for her girls, with the exception of the 5 standard carriers he draws (and Ooi). Though he has been plagued with some foul ups of recent cgs (Mikuma summer '16 and Intrepid come to mind), escalating his critics.</li><li> Zeco (Samuel B. Roberts): Although Sammy B is his sole shipgirl here, she carries over a trait found on all the girls that he drew for <em>Battleship Girl</em>, most notably her legwear.</li><li> Kuuro Kuro (Nagara-class, Ryuujou, Hiyou, Akitsu Maru etc.): His shipgirls are usually Shinto-themed. His Nagara-class feature <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzagPaperTassel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzagPaperTassel">Shide</a></em> and all but two of his Aircraft Carriers are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Onmyodo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Onmyodo">Onmyouji</a>. Only his IJA and Submarine shipgirls are removed from this theme. Akitsu Maru Kai ends up being a <em>Buddhist</em>-styled Onmyouji and both Maruyu and I-26 are as removed from the theme as it is possible. A notable feature shared his non-Onmyouji shipgirls is their ship bow anklets (the Onmyouji shipgirls wear platforms instead, even Akitsu Maru Kai has them appended to her sneakers). He's a very firm believer in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuxomIsBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuxomIsBetter">Buxom Is Better</a> with most of his designs being noted for curves (more so after his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Art Evolution</a>, which produced a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanservicePack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanservicePack">Fanservice Pack</a> effect on his older designs like Isuzu). This tendency does have a couple of exceptions: Ryuujou (the flattest carrier of any type, to the point of <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a>), Nagara, and Maruyu (a really small submarine).</li><li> Bob: His shipgirls are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColourCodedForYourConvenience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColourCodedForYourConvenience">Colour-Coded for Your Convenience</a> as he usually draws whole classes. The Tone-class (2 girls) are Green, the Sendai-class (3 girls) are Orange and the Myoukou-class (4 girls) are Purple. Shouhou is his only shipgirl who is "alone". Zuihou, part of the same class, is drawn by another artist (Konishi). He sometimes gives his girls really reactive "damaged art".</li><li> Konishi (Kongou class, Shoukaku, Suzuya, British shipgirls and etc): A generally consistent artist, he's mainly known for dynamic poses and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconicOutfit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconicOutfit">Iconic Outfit</a> of the Kongou class. In many ways he's conservative as his shipgirls wear traditional outfits or school uniforms and his designs never get particularly curvy (such as Kuuro Kuro or Shibafu) with Nelson being the furthest he goes. His destroyers tend to be more teenage in age and figure, and those that aren't end up so with their second remodels. As of late, he's started to run into issues with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces">highly similar faces</a>. It may be a result of how many shipgirls he's made getting second remodels, being one of the more prolific artists in the game.</li><li> Kujou Ichiso: While his shipgirl output consists primarly of the Shiratsuyu-class, they are primarly known for getting ear-like flaps to their hair upon their second remodels (See Shigure, Murasame, Yuudachi and Kawakaze)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note28v86w');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note28v86w" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note28v86w');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">they also appear on Taigei/Ryuuhou</span>, 3 of them also have their eyes changing color. Both Yuudachi Kai 2 and Harusame Kai have similar hairclips. Furthermore, practically all of them share <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces">the same basic face</a> at three-quarters with prominent cheeks. More recent designs and second remodels are noted for being more eye-catching to borderline excessive extents (Some parts of Murasame's second remodel are more show than function).</li><li> Yadokari: Best known for doing various destroyers, chiefly the 4 DesDiv6 ships as well as the Soviet/Russian shipgirls. Another simple yet endearing artist who runs into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces">limited facial ranges</a>, causing most of his girls (i.e those not on the DesDiv6) to be forgotten. Until he did Gangut's art, he only did child-aged destroyers. His damaged art tends to be really conservative (a tasteful choice considering the "age" of most of his girls, barring Gangut of course).</li><li> Syobonne: The main sub artist, fond of schoolswimuits and rather vivid hair colors. Though most remember I-19 and - a bit less so - I-8 for both their stats, being rather curvy for their frames (the artist's curviest characters), and in I-19's case how suggestive her torpedo handling is.</li><li> Fujikawa (Yuugumo-class and various others): Another prolific artist who also made the art for the equipment fairies and Error Girl. Her art tend to be consistent, and can even blend in to arts of other artists as in Yamagumo, Asagumo &amp; Kinugasa (except for Akigumo, though there's a good reason for this). Also makes a lot of seasonal arts, particularly for the two NPC shipgirls Ooyodo &amp; Akashi.</li><li> Parsley (Katori, Kashima, Kamikaze-class, Hamakaze, Colorado etc): An artist that becomes more prolific with time. He generally favors teen or older designs, with a decent amount of curves usually, though with the Kamikaze class, he has them a bit younger, but even many of those have a bit of noticeable curves. He has no real outfit tendency beyond something original if he could help it. Lesser known are Maya and Choukai being some of his first designs (their Kai Nis show how far he's come)</li><li> Ugume (Kiso, Kuma, etc): A long running artist that tends to prefer normal school uniforms, and asymmetrical rigging. Since his early days he's radically improved, creating a mild <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanservicePack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanservicePack">Fanservice Pack</a> effect as well as improved Rigging. His escort ships (<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DEs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DEs">D Es</a>), however, are rather modest in both clothes and rigging design.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure">Critical Existence Failure</a>: Averted, performance wise. The kanmusu can still perform well as long they have not taken moderate damage (50% or less, but more than 25% of their overall HP, shown as orange, performance reduced to 70%) or major damage (25% or less of their overall HP, performance reduced to 40%). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> taken, on the other hand...</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit">Critical Hit</a>: It does an extra 50% of the usual damage a normal hit would do, before taking armor into account.

However, for some reason, normal hits dealing 40+ damage are also called "critical hits" in the game, and critical hits dealing less than 15 damage do not register as such.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrosshairAware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrosshairAware">Crosshair Aware</a>: In the Arcade version, enemy attacks are shown by crosshairs appearing on the water, frequently close to your fleet. If your ships are inside the crosshair, the enemy will start locking on, giving you time to move them out of the crosshair; by the time it's fully locked on, if (some of) your ships are still inside them, the enemy will attack. The boss enemies in particular tend to have good tracking capability with their crosshairs, or send out a huge number of them at your fleet.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossOver">Crossover</a>: The <em>Arpeggio</em> event was one with fellow anthropomorphized moe ship franchise <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ArpeggioOfBlueSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ArpeggioOfBlueSteel">Arpeggio of Blue Steel</a></em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageIncreasingDebuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageIncreasingDebuff">Damage-Increasing Debuff</a>: Introduced in Summer 2015 and has been a mainstay ever since, missing only one event (Winter 2016).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory">Damn You, Muscle Memory!</a>:<ul><li> Within the game itself. At the screen choosing whether to enter night battle or refuse, the left button is the defensive option of refusing, while the right button is the aggressive option. At the screen choosing whether to advance in the sortie map, however, the left button is the aggressive option, while the right button is the defensive one. This can and has led to confused or tired admirals mistakenly sending heavily-damaged girls to continue on sorties, with tragic results, or extreme amounts of rage when an admiral accidentally retreats a healthy fleet nearing the boss node at the end of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel">Marathon Level</a>.</li><li> Many expeditions require a light cruiser, four destroyers and one wildcard, not necessarily in that order. However, there are some that deviate, which can cause a careless or inattentive admiral to fail - for example, expedition 35 requires a <em>heavy</em> cruiser, while expedition 37 requires <em>five</em> destroyers with no wildcards allowed.</li><li> The Fall 2017 Event introduces the lookout formation... which happens to be located at the bottom right at roughly where the Line Abreast formation were once located (it have seen been relocated to mid-bottom). The Line Abreast is the prime formation for anti-submarine warfare, which the Lookout formation was ill-suited for. Cue the players who accidentally clicked the formation ended up with their fleet dealing lackluster damage to submarines.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a>: The two light novels &mdash; <strong>Kagerou, Setting Sail!</strong> and <strong>Bonds of the Wings of Cranes</strong> &mdash; are much more serious than some of serialized manga and, indeed, fan-made doujinshi.

They're expected to battle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook">elite battleships and heavy cruisers</a>. The fact that many destroyers (like Akatsuki, Inazuma, Ikazuchi, and Hibiki) are portrayed as middle-schoolers or younger just strengthens the impression, especially since the Abyssal Fleet ships they're going to battle look like adult women or saurian monsters.

The reason once again came from the fact that Yamato had a real history of being treated as one - when she was secretly built by the Imperial Japanese Navy, they had the mindset of "Aircraft Carriers are the best, Battleships are just a bonus/an alternative". That, and her status as a flagship along with her high consumption, causes Yamato to spend most of her time at the bridge until 1944 (Battle of Leyte Gulf), leading her to be nicknamed "Hotel Yamato". Historically, the term is also taken from <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamato_Hotel">a real Yamato Hotel which was located at Manchuria (presently Dalian, China)<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.<ul><li> Interestingly, although it was considered a luxury to ever spend a night in the ship's bridge, the purpose of Yamato stayed true to the core.

N-No, you're wrong!"</div><ul><li> The whole Yamato being treated as a hotel is played with in the official 4-koma manga, like how she was equipped to <em>manufacture ice cream</em> and was fully air-conditioned (both of which were true of the real battleship; back then, air conditioning was still getting phased in to the general public, but was considered a <em>luxury</em>). The little destroyer girls loved hugging her as a result.</li><li> Interestingly, Iowa thought the "hotel" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive">was a flattering nickname</a> to Yamato.

In addition, operation MI requires you to deploy the Combined Fleet, which is essentially <em>two</em> fleets at once in a single sortie, one consisting of mostly aircraft carriers and another one with mostly light ships. To further complicate matters, the final map E-6 locked out ships used in any of the previous event maps. As a result of all this, in order to just have a chance to complete the entire event you essentially needed <strong>four full fleets</strong> of adequately powerful ships (<em>Six</em> if you wanted Support Fleets in both midway and boss stage of E-6). On top of all that, prior to the start of the event the only thing the dev team revealed about the whole system was that ships used in one operation couldn't be used in another, and withheld the information about Midway's Combined Fleet system or the extra operation stage which forbade any AL/MI ships. Considering that each map had several variants of suitable team compositions, the amount of shipgirls involved in the event for an elite player may well surpassed <em>40</em>.<ul><li> Elaborating on this three-front war: Operation AL's first map was fairly easy regardless of the difficulty level. However, E-2, the last map of AL, which the devs even described as 'beginner-friendly' prior to the event, is generally regarded as one of the hardest map of the entire event, especially if your HQ Level was above 60. One of the main difficulties of AL was that the branching rules pretty much forced you to use light/medium ships only. While it was possible to use heavy fleets, you then had to face either more battle nodes or the stronger enemies. Or both. And that's before mentioning that you couldn't use those ships in later event maps. Operation MI, while a whole lot easier than AL thanks to being able to use all the heavy ships at your disposal and bring 12 ships instead of the regular six, turned into a nightmare for your resources because of the very same reasons. One fleet full of heavy ships can already be quite costly, but two fleets deployed at the same time meant an even higher resource consumption. Bauxite supplies usually suffered the most, since almost all enemy fleets contained lots of aircraft carriers with very strong planes. Those that didn't were either submarine nodes or night battle nodes, which didn't make things easier. Also, ships like Akitsu Maru, who were previously deemed useless except for their equipment, actually made things easier. The last map (E-6) however, was a nightmare. First of all, you cannot send the Combined Fleet to the aforementioned map, leaving only your regular fleet of six ships that has yet to be sortied to any of the previous event maps. The first battle node pitted flagship-type carriers and battleship (among other things) against you, and it got progressively worse from there. The "safest" route was over a submarine node and pre-boss node that contained <em>the final boss of the previous map as a regular enemy but still at full strength</em>. To secure this route you had to use two light aircraft carriers, who due to their weak armour got wrecked easily. The alternative was reaching the boss via night battle nodes, where even mere destroyers could wreck your battleships easily. Speaking of the boss node, in order to even reach it your fleet was required to have a very high LOS rating. If you failed to meet that requirement you were sent to a dead end. And even if you managed to reach it, you found out that the final boss was none other than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Battleship Princess</a>, the most hated enemy in the entire game due to her ridiculously high stats and ability to critically damage even your best ships in one shot. Beating this map required you to deal damage to her that amounted to a total of <em>ten times her health bar</em> (thankfully chip damage was allowed). And if the boss gauge had been depleted enough that you needed only one more kill to break it? If your HQ Level was below 100 it was random, but above 100 it was guaranteed that the game pitted <strong><em>two</em></strong> Battleship Princesses against you.</li><li> To further complicate matters, the event outright punished you for trying to figure out branching rules. When faced with a new map, the general course of action is to use different ship types and combinations and see where your fleet gets sent. However, due to the ship locking mechanic, this meant that, for example, you could send ships to Operation AL, only to realize that they were practically useless in it and were actually needed for Operation MI, but now you couldn't use them in MI because you'd already sent them to AL. Keeping two operations in mind when organizing fleets was already bad enough, but with E-6 thrown into the mix it was a punch in the face for those who didn't have a large number of ships at their disposal. As a result of this multiple-front war many players have started training two ships of the same name, which would have been insane in the past when Special Events had only one front, since two ships of the same name can't be in the same fleet.</li></ul></li><li> Much of Autumn 2013 E4's difficulty stemmed from the fact that many, many players at the time still thought that ships could "sink in orange" i.e. with more than 25% HP left but not more than 50%. That's not to say that it would have been easy otherwise, due to the other factors that contributed to its difficulty, but the clear rate would still have been a lot higher than 5%.</li><li> Event maps in general can be like this. Have a certain ship? You usually get favourable routing. Don't have her? Too bad, you'll have to travel through a much tougher route. Summer 2015 had rare aversions of this; it was possible to get equally favourable routing on E5 without needing Akitsushima, and on E6 having certain ships actually made things harder. Then it came back <em>hard</em> the next event; E3 was nigh impossible on hard if you lacked Akitsu Maru.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeLongevity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeLongevity">Fake Longevity</a>:<ul><li> Many maps require you to drain a HP bar that is several times the length of the HP of the boss <em>per se</em>, meaning you need to run the map multiple times.</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquipmentUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquipmentUpgrade">Improvement Arsenal</a> may count for this, as the required material for the equipment modernization are only given through certain weekly or monthly quests.

Depending on your equipment improvement planning, your frugality on the material and RNG favour to actually succeed at the modernisation (or paying more materials to guarantee the modernisation), you might find yourself taking weeks or even months to improve a handful of guns.</li><li> Certain shipgirls require blueprints for their remodeling, which can only be obtained by trading 4 Medals per blueprint, which in turn can only be obtained by either clearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel">Extra Operation maps</a> or certain seasonal event maps. The former gives only one medal per map and may be cleared only once per month, whereas the latter are only available during seasonal holidays and not all the seasonal event maps have them. As of October 2015, the number of ship remodels that require a blueprint is 16 for 64 medals. Collecting medals from Extra Operations alone would take you at least <strong>a full year</strong> to gather that many blueprints at the earliest.</li><li> As if the blueprints weren't enough after 6 maps has been made to award one medal each on monthly basis, some shipgirls requires additional items such as prototype flight decks, new gun mount models or aerial armaments or Action Reports, sometimes on top of blueprints, or worse, requires <em>several</em> of them at once on top of thousands of resources. That being said, shipgirls that does require any of these things tend to be a game changer in their own right, especially since certain shipgirls such as Musashi and Akagi gains a fifth slot in their second remodel.</li><li> Starting from Fall 2015 Event, certain event maps have multiple phases and bosses, with earlier phases requiring the player to either deplete the TP bar or defeat one or more pre-bosses (starting from Spring 2017 Event) before the player could defeat the map boss. These multi-phase maps typically have their own bosses and their own route and branching rules. Furthermore, even unlocking the route to later pre-bosses may also require players to beat or S-rank certain nodes on the map that require specific rules to reach, such that one cannot reach all these nodes in a single run. All put together, players end up needing to do multiple naval operations to clear a single map.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck">Failed a Spot Check</a>: The players, and <strong>how</strong>.

When the event ended, the mechanics were changed such that the sortie automatically ended if the flagship went to 25% or less HP (although a later patch months later allowed her to continue if she had a damecon equipped, using it up in the process), and new maps having map gauges became the norm rather than the exception.</li><li> Refreshing right after reaching a resource node used to allow the player to gather resources easily without risking damage to their fleet. Some time in early 2014, this was secretly changed so that the resources collected during the sortie would only count if you ended the sortie normally. A hard cap of 300,000 for resources was also introduced.</li><li> When the combined fleet mechanic was first introduced in summer 2014, E5 nodes A and B became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeninsulaOfPowerLeveling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeninsulaOfPowerLeveling">Peninsula of Power Leveling</a> for DDs and CLs due to each ship receiving 300 base EXP from either submarine node, which consumed only fuel and no ammo. Ever since the next event, every new map has had variable EXP for every enemy pattern in every enemy node, thus nerfing the EXP obtainable.</li><li> One of the most popular strategies to clear Winter 2015 E5 was to put submarines as the escort fleet flagship of a combined fleet, allowing her to tank damage without sinking, since the flagship of the escort fleet was immune to sinking, and you didn't have to retreat if her HP fell below 25%. Come spring 2015, submarines were no longer allowed to be the flagship of the main or escort fleet of a combined fleet. The same happened the event before with two Yamato-class battleships in the escort fleet being a popular setup for E3 and E4, resulting in <em>all</em> slow battleships no longer being allowed in the escort fleet. That said, there was no need to ban submarines from the main fleet flagship or other slow battleships from the escort fleet...</li><li> In the first event with Land-Based Air Support (Spring 2016), the combat radius of LBAS was calculated based on the maximum range of the longest-ranged plane, meaning that you could have one long-ranged plane and tack a bunch of stronger but shorter-ranged planes on to the squadron. Subsequently, LBAS combat radius was changed so it went with the shortest range of the squadron's planes. Then again, considering how many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">Game Breaking Bugs</a> the event had, it was just as likely that the devs just didn't bother to fix it until the next event, which ended up being the first ever event with no new mechanics introduced (apart from the airbases being actual locations indicated in the map).</li><li> During the Summer 2016 Event, the boss node was very far away and well beyond the range of most land-based squadrons, therefore encouraging the players to use them for pre-boss nodes... with the Harbour Summer Princess node as the most obvious target for it. The reasons are quite telling as the concentrated attack from three airbases to a single node are very devastating. Future implementations of LBAS limited them to two airbases that can be sortied even for the final map, and it wasn't until Spring 2017 that the players are permitted to sortie three airbases to the final map.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome">Offscreen Moment of Awesome</a>: In the 4koma, some of the naval battles got skipped off.

Just to note some examples (be it in fan depictions or official):<ul><li> Fusou and Yamashiro towards Ise and Hyuuga.

Do note that the whole rivalry is actually one sided as Haruna does not actually think much of it.</li><li> Kaga towards Shoukaku and Zuikaku. Kaga belonged to the First Carrier Division, while Shoukaku and Zuikaku belonged to the Fifth Carrier Division.

The end result usually is that either the attacks miss or someone is getting taken out of commission.

The only exception to this is her interaction with Akagi, be it in doujins or even in the official 4-koma manga. However she is not that stoic as she does offer her ears for you if you need to talk to her about something, be it for official or personal matters.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMovePortraitAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMovePortraitAttack">Super Move Portrait Attack</a>: An interesting example. Called a "Cut-In" by players, this night battle (and later also applicable in day battles under certain circumstances) attack which procs with a chance based on several factors (the most well-known being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckStat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckStat">Luck Stat</a>), and does damage based on the type(s) of weapons equipped, zooms in on the <em>equipment</em> used in said attack, instead showing the sprite of the character using them at the same size as with other attacks.<ul><li> Big 7 battleships (Nagato, Mutsu, Nelson and Colorado) takes this further as they are capable of shelling multiple enemies at once with special cut-in attack when certain conditions are met.

If you encounter a map that lets you bring all battleships and carriers to the boss, Combined Fleet, or support expeditions, you're going to need them.</li><li> In the updates leading up to an Event, if the new quests included give rare equipment as rewards, the Event may or may not require you to use it. Initially it almost certainly did (the Type 4 Sonar before Fall 2015, or the upgraded Daihatsus before Spring 2016, come to mind), but it got averted for some of the later events.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet">Taking the Bullet</a>: Used as a gameplay mechanic - depending on the formation, ships may occasionally do this to protect their side's flagship.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryOnlineContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryOnlineContent">Temporary Online Content</a>: Each First Class Medal can only be obtained during its event.

Shiranui, Haruna, Kinu) talk like that, especially most of the newer ones. However, some of said girls make an exception in one or two of their lines (such as Haruna who uses watashi once, if you repair her from heavy damage).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaman">This Looks Like a Job for Aquaman</a>: Certain quests and branching rules require you to use some ships that, due to not being particularly powerful, would normally be ignored by most players.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomboyAndGirlyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomboyAndGirlyGirl">Tomboy and Girly Girl</a>: Mogami and Mikuma.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaButton">Trauma Button</a>: Inevitable for some of the ship girls that are famous for events of their real life counterpart (usually sinking). As an average ship girl only has around 30 lines of dialogue to work with (which can get repetitive <em>very</em> quickly, especially for the battle-related ones), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">flanderization</a> is inevitable either way. Some averted it by either not having a major focus on such events, or having additional lines boosting the number to ~60. As shown in the 4koma (which is usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>) like Akagi's issue with everything even close to being related to the Battle of Midway, or the abject fear many Destroyers show for Submarines.

After which it either becomes one of three possible forms (pre-final form, final form, and a third form) or it stays as the final form (for event maps until Winter 2015) or reverts to the initial form (for event maps from Spring 2015 onward).</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder6');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tropes U-Z&nbsp;</div><div id="folder6" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckilyLucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckilyLucky">Unluckily Lucky</a>: For all of their high luck, Shigure and Yukikaze engaged in a lot of battles where they survived while their comrades sank, and they get to witness it every single time. At least for Shigure it's implied that the experience broke her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstableEquilibrium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstableEquilibrium">Unstable Equilibrium</a>: Several of the strongest in-game equipment (such as Prototype 51cm Twin Gun Mount and Ginga) such as are rewarded exclusively as event rewards, ensuring that they could continue clearing events at higher difficulties as long as they keep playing the game and keep their resources stable, while players who can't get them will have difficulty clearing hard mode and thus continue to miss out. Ranking also counts as this despite the varying quality of the awarded equipment (ranging from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> to <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

So you had destroyers who were fairly flat-chested (due to being portrayed as kids), and super-battleships that were on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuxomIsBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuxomIsBetter">the other side of the spectrum</a>. However as time went on, the historical displacement of ships became less and less of a factor to their buxomness, to the point one had an <em>incredibly</em> flat Taihou (an armoured aircraft carrier), and yet also an extremely stacked Hamakaze (who as a destroyer is far lighter than Taihou). Discussed in the 4koma in the chapter introducing the <em>Agano</em>-class, where Agano brought up their "firm bodies" and "amazing displacement". Fubuki and her fellow Destroyers then talk about how (for light cruisers) Yuubari has closely similar displacement to Tenryuu, yet the latter has comparatively bigger breasts. Then they look at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ACupAngst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ACupAngst">Ryuujou</a> and then they conclude that the correlation doesn't really matter.</li><li> Fuel Tanks: Originating from one of Heavy Cruiser Atago's lines, where she complains about how her fuel tanks make her shoulders stiff... Except she doesn't have any visible fuel tanks, though what she <em>does</em> instead have is a bountiful bosom. Has become a catch-all word to describe the bustiness of Takao and Atago.</li><li> (Ship) Bulge: Another term for girls with supple bosoms. Occasionally, though, it refers to breast paddings.</li><li> Night Battle: What happens when Admirals and their favorite ship girls have sex in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doujinshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doujinshi">doujinshi</a>. With the implementation of the marriage system, well, what would you <em>expect</em> a married couple to do anyway? Sendai being Sendai brings it up... in her married secretary line of all places.</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Sendai:</strong> Admiral, what's up? You're all red... O~ho, you wanna have a night battle with me?</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign">Unwinnable by Design</a>: Ship locking when it was first introduced in summer 2014. Sent too many ships to AL/MI, or just didn't have enough ships to spare for the last map? Chances are you won't be able to clear the last map. Last maps have been much more lenient since then, however; only Summer 2015 posed any problem <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

The map consists of a completely linear set of nodes filled with the toughest versions of normal enemies, capped off by a boss node consisting of Battleship Water Demon with Aircraft Carrier Water Demon and two Battleship Princesses as escorts.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeteranUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeteranUnit">Veteran Unit</a>: A mechanic introduced as part of the Summer 2015 Event update. Your fighter squadron will gain ranks from repeated sorties which grants a significant amount of stat bonuses, though said rankings will reset if the whole squadron got shot down. The presence of max-ranked planes changes the aircraft carrier loadout significantly by reducing the amount of fighters needed to secure air superiority so the larger slots can be allocated to bombers instead, granting the double benefit of increased airstrike power and greater buffer from enemy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAir">Anti-Air</a> fire.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingArmory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingArmory">Walking Armory</a>: Floating, but still, the heavier ships (most notably Yamato-class) are shown lugging numerous heavy weapons on their person around in battle.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkOnWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkOnWater">Walk on Water</a>: For obvious reasons, this is a common ability of the ship girls. When it came to this, the official 4-koma compared it to ice skating.<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme">Ascended Meme</a>: Originally, it was unsure <em>how</em> the ship girls even moved while on water. On <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/NicoNicoDouga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/NicoNicoDouga">Nico Nico Douga</a>, where Miku Miku Dance models became prevalent after the popularity of the game, videos popped up which showed the girls skating on water <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">as a possible way of emulating the propeller</a> on an actual ship. So it is unsurprising that the 4-koma and then the anime (the latter of which spawned a meme) decided to go along with the idea as well.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a>: The KanColle girls were introduced to these, care of the visitors from Arpeggio during the December 2013 event. Take note: all Fog ships barring Iona had these, and they could hit the <em>entire</em> squad.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WearingAFlagOnYourHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WearingAFlagOnYourHead">Wearing a Flag on Your Head</a>: The Italian shipgirls' colour schemes are modelled after Italy's flag. Iowa's stockings are colored after the American flag.

In later ones, they'll only wear their rigging when they're in battle, and not for free times.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidgetSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidgetSeries">Widget Series</a>: Natch. Despite being around for more than a year and a half by the time the anime started airing, more than a few people were still weirded out by the concept of fleet girls.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanOfAThousandVoices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanOfAThousandVoices">Woman of a Thousand Voices</a>: Applied to incredible effect. Most of the game's voice actresses have more than five different roles (often voicing all the ships of a given class) and as such get the chance to showcase their versatility. Who would guess that Nagato, Shimakaze, and Jintsuu are voiced by the same person?<ul><li> Taken to its logical conclusion in the <a class="urllink" href="https://soundcloud.com/masapusan/one-nao-show">Drama CD<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for the limited edition volume of the Side: Kongou manga, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaoTouyama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaoTouyama">Nao Touyama</a> performs a 20 minute skit alone with 8 of her characters.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfActionGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfActionGirls">World of Action Girls</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobablyFemaleCast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobablyFemaleCast">All of the characters are female</a>, and they can all kick the enemy's asses in one way or another.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YamatoNadeshiko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YamatoNadeshiko">Yamato Nadeshiko</a>: Houshou and Haruna. The former for her gentle tone of voice, and her lines evoking the feel of a traditionally-trained housewife, the latter for her politeness and general "good girl" air she projects. Surprisingly <em>not</em> Yamato herself (despite being a "Hotel"), who can be better described as a normal girl suddenly thrust into a major responsibility.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair">You Gotta Have Blue Hair</a>: While most of the girls have reasonable hair colors, a good amount (including entire classes) thrive on the technicolor hue of their hair.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouRequireMoreVespeneGas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouRequireMoreVespeneGas">You Require More Vespene Gas</a>: While the game generates the resources on its own, it is common for Admirals to get into low reserves and the game complaining you do not have enough of them.<ul><li> One specific <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a> even has its roots in this problem: Akagi can be acquired fairly early in the game with only a few quests, but the problem is that, as an aircraft carrier, she uses up bauxite, sometimes hundreds in one sortie, and repair buckets. Having neither usually results in having a two+ hour repair time and/or not being able to perform more sorties. Hence the reason images like <a class="urllink" href="http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=41731720">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> are really popular, because of the level of maintenence required to handle it.</li></ul><div class="indent"><em>...It feels like some numerical counter somewhere is dropping like a rock!</em></div><ul><li> If regular sorties, equipment crafting and/or ship constructions didn't do your resources in, then there is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneySink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneySink">Large Ship Construction</a>, which is unlocked by collecting all the <em>Sendai</em>-class light cruisers (which also unlocks the 3rd fleet for an additional fleet for expeditions).
