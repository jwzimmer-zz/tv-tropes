Because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILoveNuclearPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILoveNuclearPower">radiation,</a> some trees mutated into fallow trees, and their sap contains amazing medical properties that is every doctor's Christmas wish come true. Thus a research team led by Jack Richards and his daughter Brenda arrived on the island to study the trees and, if possible, reproduce them. But one day, the labs burned down in suspicious circumstances, and Lucas Santiano, a senior member of the research team, proposed to split the research team in two, arguing that two heads are better than one. Despite Brenda's objections, Jack agreed, and with his new found autonomy and authority he hired his own (literal) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy">Redshirt Army</a>, and took over most of the island to monopolize the sap-supplying business.

Eventually, the stand-alone missions tie together into thwarting the DFK, a high-tech organization whose plans involve using satellites for orbital superiority.

Hired by dethroned king Enrico Chivaldori, you and your band of mercenaries &mdash; from both A.I.M. and newcomer M.E.R.C. (More Economic Recruitment Center), which was founded by (surviving) ex-members of the former &mdash; are to liberate Arulco and to kill Enrico's ex-wife Deidranna Reitman, who usurped the throne a decade ago and ruled since then with iron fist of tyranny. Surprisingly well thought out and complex as computer games go in its approach to physical injury, fatigue, the effectiveness of firearms and the use of explosives and noted for its excellent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnBasedCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnBasedCombat">Turn-Based Combat</a>. Notably it's got a <em>lot</em> of mileage out of the <em>v1.13</em> mod (a reference to the last official patch being v1.12 and, probably by coincidence, the last official versions of both original JA and Deadly Games), which <em>drastically</em> changed the game and even introduced a multiplayer mode that wasn't in the unmodified JA2! Some of the trope examples are due to, modified, subverted, or averted by this mod.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The sequel's stand-alone expansion, <em>Jagged Alliance 2: Unfinished Business</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3o0j8');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3o0j8" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3o0j8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Sir-Tech Canada's penultimate release, also published by TalonSoft</span> takes place in Tracona. Ricci Mining and Exploration was the company that ran the mines in Arulco for Deidranna, and with her fall they lost them. Wanting to take them back, they set up a military base in the nearby military dictatorship of Tracona, gave Arulco an ultimatum to return the mines to [RMaE]'s ownership and launched missiles at the Prison in Arulco as a warning. King Enrico Chivaldori, knowing that Aruclo has not recovered enough to effectively deal with this crisis, hires you to resolve it. This game is very short, and the main draw of this game is the map editor, which was later added (along with other new features in this game, except the new mercs, unless you count the v1.13 mod) to JA2 in later patches.</p><p><em>Jagged Alliance 3</em> has had a troubled past, being announced, shown off at E3 '07, then dropped by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SirTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SirTech">Sir-Tech</a> (who closed down in 2003).

Training them to stand up for themselves, and having those militia soldiers successfully defeat attempts to retake their city will result in a much more vocal group of citizens.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryGunPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryGunPower">Arbitrary Gun Power</a>: Played straight in the first game with the weaker guns, but mostly averted in JA 2, especially 1.13, a shot from any old pistol with glaser ammo on an unarmored opponent is almost always lethal, and nearly all of the 5.56 and 7.62 weapons do the same amount of damage.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryHeadcountLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryHeadcountLimit">Arbitrary Headcount Limit</a>: You can hire up to 8 mercenaries in the first two games, 8 native guards per sector, and there can only be 8 enemies in the sector, which can be exploited in the final battle in JA1 (enemy limit is removed in <em>Deadly Games</em>). Vanilla JA2 allows you to hire up to 18 mercenaries, including the locals, which can be modified to 32 in <em>v1.13</em> and raising the number of militia and soldiers in each sector to up to forty each. As you can imagine, the gunfights get <em>pretty nuts</em>. And as of this edit, there is a modification in very early development that removes the limit, or rather raises it very high, and lets you hire all the mercs (theoretically up to 256 mercs) and face against up to 512 enemies with the help of maximum 512 militia.<ul><li> Downplayed in <em>Back In Action</em> and <em>Crossfire</em>. The 2010s real-time remakes work with squads, which maximum size is six men; nothing technically prevents to enter a map with several squads, although controlling several squads in the same time requires a lot of painful micromanagement. The trope is averted about the total number of squads, because if you have enough money, you can hire all the available mercenaries (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutuallyExclusivePartyMembers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutuallyExclusivePartyMembers">although some of them will refuse to join because they absolutely hate some of those who are already there</a>).</li><li> <em>Rage!</em> only allows a choice of two mercs (from a list of six) for the majority of the game, with a third becoming available upon contacting AIM HQ and a fourth if you manage to rescue Fidel. This is handwaved by the job initially paying enough for three people, including Fidel, and for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La R&eacute;sistance</a> putting forward enough money to pay for an extra merc.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmedBlag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmedBlag">Armed Blag</a>: In <em>Deadly Games</em> some criminals did this.

It is also smart enough to accurately mimic bad decisions, like poorly-trained and overwhelmed soldiers running back and forth in a mindless panic, or large numbers of troops laying down suppression fire at your smaller numbers of mercenaries in an effort to take advantage of how many guns they have. 1.13 expands their intelligence greatly, resulting in an AI that aggressively flanks and sneaks around, trying to hit you from directions you're not expecting. If you don't pair up your mercs and cover all angles, they <em>will</em> surround you. If your troops are in good cover, the AI will pelt them with grenades to force them out of cover. If you have rooftop snipers set up, they'll try to sneak around and climb onto the roof behind your snipers. Enemy snipers will lie down in cover and use spotters to locate your people and blast them from across the map. Soldiers from neighboring sectors will even come to reinforce their compatriots if you start up a major gunfight.<ul><li> Militia AI, while not that brilliant (see below) is still surprisingly clever. For example, if a merc is wounded, militia troops will move closer to the merc in question to cover him/her while you move a medic in to patch them up.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Artificial Stupidity</a>: Civilians <em>will</em> wander into mustard gas areas. Better than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCom">X-COM</a></em> though, as when they are caught between the crossfire, they are still smart enough to get down or get to nearby cover and let you hit the baddies behind them.<ul><li> Rookie Militia are deliberately programmed this way, often charging at enemy positions and getting gunned down, and suffering civilians' affections of wandering into mustard gas areas (though they stay on the border, if the cloud expands, they're good as dead). Once they're trained up to regular (or elite) militia, though, they become MUCH smarter. (Even better than Deidranna's elite forces.)</li><li> On a side note, the AI (enemies or militias) have a lot of trouble fighting non-human enemies (bloodcats and crepitus). Which you can use to your advantage if, for example, you're under attack by a large enemy force and a pack of bloodcats moves into the area. Pull back, consolidate your defensive position, and wait for the cats to run around killing all the hostiles, then mop up the surviving cats.</li><li> Militia have a problem with making sure they have a clear line of fire. A militiaman with LMG will gleefully open fire on full auto at an enemy soldier, regardless of intervening cattle, civilians, other militia, or very startled mercenaries.</li><li> AI who are very close to enemies will often forego shooting and instead run in close to beat them down with their bare hands or stab them with knives. This is perfectly fine when fighting human enemies, and even acceptable when used against Crepitus or bloodcats. <em>Not quite</em> so understandable when that militiaman is trying to punch a <em>tank</em> to death.</li><li> In both <em>Jagged Alliance</em> and <em>Jagged Alliance 2</em>, enemies will sometimes try to reach an alarm trigger to set off a major trap or to blow up a building. If you get to that point first, you can pick off the enemies one-by-one with the other enemies behaving defensively.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmsDealer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmsDealer">Arms Dealer</a>: Several.<ul><li> Micky O'Brien from Deadly Games is an international version of an Gangland Gun Runner and is depicted as an stereotypical slimy merchant that gives creeps even to such badasses like Gus Tarballs. He functions as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Auction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Auction">Auction</a>, and if you pay too much, your mercs will comment on your poor trading skills. He reappears in JA2, but running different contraband.</li><li> Bobby Ray from JA2 is a shady Online Gun Shop Owner. Many of the guns he sells could not possibly be legal unless he sells primarily to governments. He even sells <em>mustard gas</em>, although the item description says it is to be used strictly for pest control. This gets even more ludicrous in <em>v1.13</em> due to the vastly expanded arsenal. It's lampshaded further with experimental weapons - "We found a shipment of G11s in a warehouse somewhere. Please don't ask."</li><li> Tony in San Mona, operates behind an adult video store. His partner running the front requires a favor before you can access Tony's wares (namely, getting rid of an annoying customer).</li><li> Raul in Unfinished Business sets up shop inside a warehouse.

Three out of four are varying degrees of useless (although they can be trained up, if you can be bothered &mdash; and if you use their skills they have quite some potential, at least you don't have to pay them); the fourth, the rebel leader, however is something of a hardcore badass. More importantly, the Evil Dictator in JA2 is a skilled markswoman with heavy armour and an <em>automatic rocket rifle</em>. Subverted with pretty much everyone else - while they are marginally better shots than grunts, the vast majority of high-ranking enemies can often be taken out with just a few well-placed bullets, sometimes before they even get a chance to shoot back.<ul><li> Interestingly, normally Deidranna does not carry weapons or armor. If you are sneaky enough to cut her off her hidden stash with rifle and bodyarmor, you will meet her in a throne room. There will be with some soldiers, but Deidranna herself will be unarmed and without any armor.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>:<ul><li> The Ultra Shield Vest in the first Jagged Alliance provided a powerful armour boost, and could be worn with normal armour to make the merc incredibly resistant to damage. Unfortunately, it has no pockets, and vests are the only way for your mercs to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InventoryManagementPuzzle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InventoryManagementPuzzle">carry more than two items</a> (With their weapon being one, and ammo likely being the other). Deadly Games improved them by giving them three pockets.</li><li> In JA2, the Rocket Rifles look impressive. However. they are electronically locked except to registered user, the rifles can only hold five shots and can't have any accuracy-boosting accessories mounted on them. While powerful, most players prefer a rifle's mag size and accuracy to deliver consistent headshots by this point in the game. If you are playing 1.13, then they are pretty much useless since either an anti-material sniper rifle or an assault rifle with drum mag and various other attachments will pretty much outclass them.</li><li> Shotguns lose their punch about a third of the game in, when enemies begin to carry better body armor. They are given a particular niche in 1.13 though, thanks to the suppression mechanic - since every pellet suppresses as much as a single bullet, it can be used to scare the AP out of elite soldiers with spectra armor.<ul><li> Shotguns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">also have a secondary use as a stun-stick</a>: taking a full blow from buckshot, even if it doesn't penetrate armor, is a great way to get the wind knocked out of you (reducing your stamina). Two full blows will put down just about anyone, full armor or not. Slug ammunition is also great at popping heads: though the range on most shotguns is inferior to an assault rifle, a slug shot delivered to an unarmored head <em>will</em> kill anyone (and severely injure anyone not wearing a spectra helmet).</li><li> 1.13 makes shotguns viable again by giving them a range of specialized, shotgun-specific ammunition, as well as a variety of more useful variants (such as a one-handed, four-shot big-pistol-sized version, which, when loaded with lockbreaker ammunition, basically does away with lock-picking and/or finding keys as long as you don't mind being loud).</li></ul></li><li> The silenced .50 VSK/VKS Vychlop. Good: <em>it's .50 and silenced.</em> Bad: It's only got a range of about 500 meters, far less than the other anti-materiel sniper rifles. You can just use cold-loaded .308 rounds.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>: Several of the mercenaries you can hire tend to enjoy killing a little too much, fire on full automatic even when you tell them not to, or get very cranky if you try and give them orders before they've finished killing someone. Some of them will even kill other squad members between missions.<ul><li> Postie (weapon of choice: letter opener) and "Unusually Ruthless" Reuben (hedge trimmer) from the first two games being poster children for the trope. Fidel "I busy!" Dahan even has it listed in his bio that he was constantly gunning after another A.I.M. member<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5o8b5');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5o8b5" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5o8b5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Specifically, Hurl. If you have Hurl in your team at the same time as Fidel, the former will "mysteriously" disappear after two days</span>.</li><li> Made even worse in v1.13, 'psycho' mercs with auto weapons will sometime spend all remaining action points or ammo to fire in full auto, whichever comes first. Can be (somewhat) avoided by spending more action points to aim a single shot, as they have no qualms killing with head shots, and can be partially subverted by not giving them automatics, which will instead result in them losing a bit of morale out of frustration.</li><li> Several of the terrorists that Carmen sends you to hunt are complete psychos. Most notably is "MOM," the "Matron of Mayhem," who is wanted for mustard-gassing a Christmas parade and will open up on your team with a LMG if you try to take a shot at her, and promises to kill your friends and family once she's done with you.</li><li> Bill "Razor" Lamont pretty much the poster child for this. But don't tell him that. In his own words, he's not "psychotic," he simply "has a passion for his job."</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStab" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStab">Back Stab</a>: If you sneak up behind an opponent without being seen or heard, you can insta-kill the target with a throwing knife/star in the back. Dmitri is one of the more useful "indigenous" recruits for this reason having decent aim to boot. Shank can be this... once he stops sucking in general.<ul><li> Stealth and Night Ops are one of the most useful combination of traits for your customized alter ego, especially while using said throwing knives. In 1.13 with the new trait-system it is even possible to combine those two traits with another useful one like throwing, unarmed or melee weapons.</li><li> If you're particularly stealthy/lucky, you can even pull off a more traditional backstab on an enemy by creeping up behind them and cutting their throat with a knife, machete, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">sword</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BallisticDiscount" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BallisticDiscount">Ballistic Discount</a>: Shopkeepers drop their inventory when killed, but this is a bad idea in general, especially if you've trained a town militia. There's also a couple of characters who demand bribe money who can then be gunned down to get your cash back.<ul><li> Raul in Unfinished Business can be killed to obtain his inventory from a crate next to him. However, if you don't kill him instantly, or are too slow on the draw to get a shot off before he notices you trying to kill him, he'll detonate a bomb that kills him and destroys ALL of his inventory.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy">Badass Army</a>: Veteran militias can become this, easily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle">curbstomping</a> Deidranna's <em>elite troops</em> with no help whatsoever, even when outnumbered.

The rest of the countryside shows a chaotic mixture of accents and ethnic backgrounds, with American, Latin American, German, and vaguely Eastern European names and accents handed out seemingly at random. It does, however, have the dependence on a single export (in this case silver rather than bananas), corrupt upper-class and oppressive dictatorship down pat, though.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BashBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BashBrothers">Bash Brothers</a>: Several characters mesh together very well. One example would be Henning von Branitz and Rudolf Steiger, a former East German officer and GSG-9 operative respectively. Despite having been on opposite sides of the Berlin Wall, they get along really well and often compliment one another in combat. Igor and Ivan Dolvich, along with Grunty, also form a hell of a team, as do Grizzly and Bull. As the game progresses, certain characters who work together often will develop a rapport and become these, signified when they start complimenting each other in combat (i.e. Ice will get along well with Grizzly, saying he's "got style, dude!"). This is also the <em>only</em> way you'll get a merc to join your team if there's someone s/he hates on your team already: hire their buddy, and they'll agree to join, and stay on as long as their buddy stays and they're kept away from the merc they hate.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCouple">Battle Couple</a>: Several examples throught the series. Being in the same unit improves their morale.

Caution: Don't let Hitman near Raven.</li><li> Originally Buzz and Lynx were this in Deadly Games (among other "couples" like Margaret and Mouse).. not so much in the following games.</li><li> Biff and Flo, although they're less a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCouple">Battle Couple</a> and more a 'Whimper Pathetically And Run Away At The First Sign Of Trouble' couple (their low wages and good teaching skills make them extremely good militia trainers when working as a team, however). Digging a bit into the dossiers hints that the entire reason why Flo has a job at M.E.R.C. is because of nepotism thanks to being with Biff.</li><li> Wolf and Fox are another example. Wolf says he got in better shape (Explaining his improved physical stats between 1 and 2) because of Fox.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearerOfBadNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearerOfBadNews">Bearer of Bad News</a>: If Ivan dies, his nephew Igor will mourn while wondering how he will tell this to his Aunt.<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Elliot.</a> Poor, poor Elliot....</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled">Better to Die than Be Killed</a>: Lucas blows himself up as soon as he sees you.

In fact, arming more experienced mercs with aforementioned guns is often overkill, since anything in range will die. <em>Especially</em> applies if one didn't turn on auto-leveling in 1.13, where your EOD-armored teams with prototype weaponry will be mowing down grunts that look like they came fresh off the Soviet bloc from the 70s. Also applies to Spectra/EOD armor, the latter of which protects from <em>everything</em> and can withstand a shelling from mortar rounds (they're not called <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_Ordnance_Disposal">EOD<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for nothing). Encouraged, since you're only allowed a finite number of mercs (and the latest 1.13 limits mercs to 24).<ul><li> Can also be utilized by Deidrannan forces, if you're not a cheating bastard. You'll probably have low-grade AK-47s or just the weapons the mercs arrived with (often just pistols and sub-machine guns - only Gus has the best starting weapon, both in vanilla and 1.13), and the enemies will have FN FALs, M16s with laser sights and maybe grenade launchers, M4A1s...</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct">Bland-Name Product</a>: Lameboy, Fumblepak, and Neveready in JA 2.

It's a simple, low-powered, medium-ranged weapon with 5.56mm ammunition, but it's also very lightweight and accurate and uses one of the most common ammo types in the game, and as a result it is an ideal choice for your low-strength or dedicated support troops carrying tools and medkits, as well as a main weapon for troops with special equipment like mortars, rockets, or close-combat weaponry.</li><li> 5.56mm ammunition in general is one of these. Compared with other ammunition calibers, its damage and penetration are unremarkable. However, its high accuracy and the fact that virtually every enemy squad will have a few troops carrying rifles shooting it means that it will be very available and highly reliable. Even if your shots don't easily penetrate enemy armor, each hit will exhaust them until they either pass out, you get a lucky hit, or their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">wounds add up and they either bleed out or run away</a>.</li><li> One of the simplest and most boring tactics in wilderness battles in <em>JA2</em> is to lay your troops down prone, have one of them set off an explosive, and ambush the enemy as they come to investigate. The enemy will start trickling in to check on the noise, and your prone mercs will be able to spot and shoot them due to being less visible and having stable weapons. When the majority of the enemy arrive, you'll still have an advantage, as they will be standing and thus much more visible and easy to kill.</li><li> Tear gas grenades can be this way early on, and even later can be surprisingly effective, since only elites will often spawn with gas masks. It won't kill enemies like mustard gas, but it will blind them and cause them to panic and maybe even fall unconscious, letting you loot their corpses or finish them off at leisure. Since it won't inflict damage, it is also safe to use around civilians. It is also really effective when used on houses that enemies are holed up in.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessMagazines">Bottomless Magazines</a>: Played straight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">for the enemies</a> in the first game where reloading itself costs no AP.

If your character is not wearing a gas mask, and walks into a Mustard Gas cloud (or, more commonly, a Mustard Gas grenade is lobbed at him), the character will likely suffer a lot of damage and pass out. At this point, the character cannot be moved (he's passed out) and his inventory cannot be accessed, so he cannot be told to wear his gas mask if he has one at all. Each turn, the gas will drain a large amount of health and breath points from the character, making sure that he cannot escape. To make matters worse, it is even impossible to move the body out of the cloud by having another mercenary drag or lift it, so the afflicted mercenary just lies there in the cloud, completely helpless, until death.

Tex, Meltdown, Fox, and Danny are some of the better mercs for this role. Otherwise you'll be spraying bullets everywhere, and you can't use burst or autofire while dual-wielding. Dual pistols, machine pistols, and revolvers really come into their own in close-quarters combat, especially when outfitted with laser and reflex sights and scopes. Even if individual shots don't do much damage, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">the sheer volume of fire adds up</a>, and every hit wounds the target and reduces their breath, effectively paralyzing the enemy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunPorn">Gun Porn</a>: Old guns, new guns, rare guns, common guns. Shotguns both pump and semi-auto (and even a few break-action), rifles in bolt-action, lever-action, semi-automatic, and full-auto flavors, pistols of every possible variety, machine pistols, submachine guns, machine guns, rocket launchers, mortars...you name it, this game has it, including literally every single AK variant made to date (over four pages of them) and several guns that are so extraordinarily rare as to be unobtainable in real life. You're likely to use less than a quarter of them over the course of any given playthrough. It gets worse with 1.13 mods. You can find (on average) five different variants for a given gun - in fact, the first three pages of the assault rifle section of Bobby Ray's contains nothing but AK variants.<ul><li> Then you have the attachments. High magnification scopes, tactical lasers, fore grips, grenade launchers, longer barrels... gets even further in later 1.13 mods as the number of attachment slots increase and you actually get to see where the attachments are being placed. There are even more attachments, including folding stocks, reflex sights, even longer barrels, caliber changing barrels (5.7mm barrels for AR-15 variants, 5.56mm NATO / 7.62mm NATO / 6.8mm SPC barrels for SCAR rifles), EBR kits for M14/M21 rifles, C-Mag adapters, and Sci-Fi mode only 3 round burst trigger groups. It's quite common for the player to spend some time scavenging attachments, trying to put the optimal attachments on a given gun, and admire all the numeric enhancements and forget about fighting.

It was revamped in 1.13 though, with the addition of AET bullets which are only available in pistol calibers, as well as holsters for easy storage that everyone should have one as backup. Dual silenced pistols on the hands of an ambidextrous merc can be deadly in stealthy night ops. Handguns also prove to be a good secondary weapon for soldiers who use slower or heavier weapons but end up in close quarters. Thanks to their low AP cost in both readying and firing, they are effective at room clearing or shooting someone who runs up to your merc in close and triggers an interrupt. This is, in fact, the single biggest reason why dual-wielding troops are so deadly in close: in the time it takes a rifle or shotgun-wielder to fire a couple of shots, a dual-wielding trooper can fire off six to ten rounds, and every hit will knock some breath out of the target.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLevelsEasyBosses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLevelsEasyBosses">Hard Levels, Easy Bosses</a>: Since the main focus on the game is fighting squads and platoons, and there's a hard limit on stats (For humans, at least), a single target is hardly a challenge without backup.

Thus, every boss in JA2 could be considered one.<ul><li> The Warden of Tixa Prison is less combat effective than any of her mooks, and less dangerous, unless she gets the jump on you somehow and sprays a full burst of rounds into one of your people.</li><li> The legendary mercenary Mike gives you a 'head start' before beginning his attack. Though where you fight him changes, he's still likely to be one of the last few enemies, and a fairly easy target for your entire team to attack. The only thing is that several AIM members are unwilling to kill him, easily circumvented by the few that don't are either superior to him (namely, Ivan and Gus), hate him already (Fox once dated the creep), or are out of sight and lobbing mortars. Others simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy">don't care</a> and some of the rookies aren't as intimidated, having never actually seen him in action before.</li><li> The Crepitus queen in sci-fi mode is the closest thing to a real boss in the game. But she is immobile, meaning any merc of a decent level (to avoid interrupts) can walk into her room, throw a grenade (gas is surprisingly effective) and walk out a few times.</li><li> Kingpin, the 'Godfather' of San Mona also qualifies if you wish to fight him (to steal his money, because he is scum, or just for fun). He is better than the warden, but still, he goes down as easily as any of his thugs or the queen's red shirts.

How much a pocket could carry was limited to the same item, So you could carry five boxes of shotgun shells in one pocket, but not three .45 clips and two boxes of .357 bullets in the same pocket. Also a gun would take up one single pocket, no matter if it was a .38 revolver or an M-16 rifle. This wasn't so bad in the first game, where you could come back to the same area tomorrow to pick up dropped items (As long as you held the sector) but became very important in Deadly Games, where every mission was one day, and equipment left behind was gone forever.</li><li> In Jagged Alliance 2, each merc can only carry so much equipment, both in terms of how much <em>stuff</em> they can have and how much weight they can manage based on their strength. 1.13 adds even more complexity to it, as instead of simply giving you a set number of slots of set sizes, you can actually get vests, leg panels, and backpacks of various kinds with an array of pouches to carry a variety of items. There's even heavy backpacks with a huge inventory capacity but which slow down the merc wearing them in combat, which can be dropped to speed them up. You may end up having to (literally) weigh the difference between, for example, a Tactical Tailor Assault Vest (with lots of the ever useful assault rifle pouches), a Russian 106 vest (which gives a large number of different-sized pouches) or a German Flecktarn vest (which offers a good balance of different types). Then there's trying to figure out which rifles accept which scope, which laser sight, and if it'll take a foregrip or grippod. It adds an impressive (or annoying, depending on the player) level of micromanagement and logistics to the game.</li><li> 1.13 also adds backpacks, which are very useful for carrying additional gear, but severely drain stamina and restrict movement. Fortunately, there's an equally useful "drop backpack" option available for when it's time to spring into action.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InVinoVeritas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InVinoVeritas">In Vino Veritas</a> : One of the first missions the player gets in <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JA2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JA2">JA 2</a> is to organise food shipments to the besieged rebel base. The only person who is capable of doing so is Father Walker, a priest sympathetic to the rebel cause, but he initially refuses to help out of fear. However, he is also a well-known drinker and once you give him some alcohol, he drunkingly agrees to supply the rebels with the much-needed food.<ul><li> You can avoid this by bringing Ira with you, or just having a high enough town loyalty in Drassen: if he spawns on the middle sector of the map, he'll refuse to help, but if he spawns on the bottom sector (which means you've likely cleared the other two sectors of bad guys beforehand), he'll be happy to help as clearing all three sectors will raise loyalty enough to get him to help out.

Emptying a magazine at a single target a third of the map away is singularly wasteful if only the first two rounds hit.</li><li> As of July 2012 Beta, ammo belts can be used to externally feed the machine guns and modified assault rifles, either from the large ammo packs on the gunner itself or another merc holding the belt, providing more lead without the need to reload.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultinationalTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultinationalTeam">Multinational Team</a>: Subverted, some mercs will refuse to work with each other because of this.<ul><li> The rivalry between English sniper Scope and Irish arms-dealer Micky; Frenchman Gaston and French-Canadian La Malice; Americana-boy Gasket and anyone from Russia (Ivan, Igor, Iggy); crooked Southern prison-guard Bubba and until-recently tortured-prisoner (and black man) Dynamo; etc.</li><li> Another example is Steroid (Polish) who strongly dislikes Ivan and Igor (both Russian).

It helps that he's got good marksmanship and the ambidextrous perk.</li><li> In the first set of games, until you picked up assault rifles, your choices were slower pump-action shotguns, crappy revolvers, inaccurate SMGs, decent semi-auto pistols, and <em>relatively <strong>good</strong></em> revolvers like the .357 and Ruger Redhawk.

Put a laser sight, reflex sight, and scope on a big, powerful model like an Anaconda or Redhawk, load them with AP or AET ammo, and two revolvers become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGoodNameForARockBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGoodNameForARockBand">medium-range murder machines</a>.</li><li> Also in 1.13, revolvers get a unique property added that reflects a real-life advantage - they always unjam in one attempt. This is because all you need to do to unjam a revolver is rotate to the next chamber (provided the jam was due to a dud round, rather than the bullet firing but getting physically stuck in the barrel), which many revolvers will do just by pulling the trigger again.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RogueAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RogueAgent">Rogue Agent</a>: One spook tried to sell secret blueprints in <em>Deadly Games</em>.

It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> since they can open almost any door and safe (and not to mention they are free).<ul><li> Although Electronics did let you bypass the penalties for disarming electronic traps and locks (which there were plenty of... later on, after you can just blow holes with your <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LAWs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LAWs">LA Ws</a>).</li><li> In <em>1.13</em>'s new trait system the old bonuses of the Electronics trait are a part of the more general Technician trait, making them a nice bonus in addition to more useful bonuses the Technician trait provides, unlike the old, very situational Electronic trait.</li><li> Leadership is a subversion. At first glance, looks relatively useless. Sure, it's good at helping you chat up the locals, but otherwise, it doesn't seem that powerful. But get a few mercs with high leadership together commanding some squads, and morale will shoot up like crazy, and high morale greatly boosts your mercs' performance. Especially noticeable late-game, where mercs who once had pitiful leadership but good wisdom will likely have shot up into the fifty-to-sixty point range (<em>minimum</em>; high-wisdom mercs like MD can be in the nineties) if they've been training militia and teaching other mercs, and your entire force is walking around with maxed morale and slaughtering enemy forces thanks to the hidden stat buffs associated with said maximum morale.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VehicularCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VehicularCombat">Vehicular Combat</a>: A mod for the <em>1.13</em> mod restored the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> code that allows the vehicles to be used in the tactical combat itself instead of just being a semi-abstract transportation on the strategic layer. Now you can use Hamous' Ice-Cream Truck as a mobile bunker to drive-by the enemies. As an optional pay off for this you can allow the enemy tanks to be mobile.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCaringPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideogameCaringPotential">Videogame Caring Potential</a>: Many of the mercs have quite well-developed and likable personalities (aided by reasonably good voice acting), and it's pretty easy to get attached to them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">Video Game Cruelty Potential</a>: Read <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvulnerableCivilians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvulnerableCivilians">Invulnerable Civilians</a> above and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">There Is No Kill Like Overkill</a> below.<ul><li> It's also satisfying to keep shooting someone's legs until they fall over, groan helplessly, and bleed to death painfully.</li><li> Invoked with Doreen, the asshole running a child sweatshop in the first town you take. The mercs enjoy going to town on her.</li><li> It is entirely viable for you to stand back and let militia and Dedriana's soldiers fight it out in 1.13, then loot the subsequent corpses of all their dropped gear. Especially veterans, who will have gear comparable to Deidrianna's elites. You can even...<em>hurry</em> it along with a few well-placed mustard gas shells.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPunishment">Video Game Cruelty Punishment</a>: Killing civilians causes a loss of loyalty in a given area.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a>: The Queen is already pretty much nuts at the start of the game, but she gradually loses it completely as your merc band and your rebel allies steadily seize territory from her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">The Virus</a>: At a certain point one of the fallow trees will get a infection that renders its sap not fit for extraction and will continue to spread across the island. You can either find a cure or just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer">blow the infected tree up.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaterSourceTampering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaterSourceTampering">Water Source Tampering</a>: Lucas' men try to poison the water source early in the game.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherOfWar">Weather of War</a>:<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleInTheRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleInTheRain">Battle in the Rain</a>: Fighting in the storm (1.13), which greatly reduces your vision, forcing you to fight your enemies almost toe-to-toe. If you're lucky, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningReveal">lightning bolt will reveal</a> enemies and can make an interrupt - for <em>both</em> sides. The upside is that rain greatly reduces the enemy's vision as well, making stealth significantly easier.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeatWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeatWave">Heat Wave</a>: Sometimes, the day in Metavira will be hotter than usual, tiring the mercs faster.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellIsThatAccent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellIsThatAccent">What the Hell Is That Accent?</a>: Steroid. Polish accent missed by a long shot, accidentally ricocheting off Austria, getting stuck on the toilet and finally falling hard on its head.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithThisHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithThisHerring">With This Herring</a>: Played with. The mercenaries you pick have limited starting weapons, generally consisting of sidearms and some gear associated with their specialization. Usually, the more expensive the merc, the better the starting gear. However, said gear is generally much better than whatever the initial enemies of cops and random soldiers use, but you'll either be purchasing weapons or fixing up stolen gear later on in the game.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardNeedsFoodBadly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardNeedsFoodBadly">Wizard Needs Food Badly</a>: A new food system as of July 2012 Beta. Starvation and dehydration can result in stat penalties and slow death.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongSideAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongSideAllAlong">Wrong Side All Along</a>: Gus and Ziggy (the guy who saved Gus from being killed by the child soldier) got roped into working for Santiano by their ex-friend sgt. Adam Granger. They realized what's up four days later, and tried to kill Granger as payback. He survived, and because of that Gus and Ziggy have bad relations with A.I.M., forcing Gus to work as a middle man in the merc business. We are tasked to kill Granger later in the game.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">There Is No Kill Like Overkill</a>: It is possible to deal more than 100 (maximum <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a>) damage to someone. Nothing can stop you from unloading an entire magazine at a single 'critical' enemy just 2 yards away, or perhaps use a rocket launcher just to finish off a single 'critical' enemy, or plant a C4 next to a 'dying' enemy.... the list goes on.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouALLLookFamiliar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouALLLookFamiliar">You ALL Look Familiar</a>: Since there's not a lot of features on the mercs in the field (besides different shirt and hair colours), it's easy to confuse, say, Gus and Hitman, or Scope and Raven. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Mocked</a> with the bartenders, who notes that each of them (they're quintets) act, look, and dress the same. Except for Manny. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Poor Manny.</a><ul><li> Apply camouflage, and everyone looks the same except for gender and build. Color of camouflage too, in the case of 1.13.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode">Your Head Asplode</a>: Try shooting someone (preferably unarmored) at close range in the head with a high powered rifle; burst/full auto just to make sure. This usually happens to enemies with poor health, and with any weapon, but for obvious reasons, happens much more often when someone uses a high caliber bullet (or bullets).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a>: Harder levels have more grunts sent to try and recapture towns.<ul><li> On Normal or higher in v1.13, the enemy will often send upwards of a hundred soldiers to recapture Drassen once you take it. Since this is often the first town the player captures, they'll usually have nothing more than a lightly-armed, tired, and wounded team of six or less people with which to hold off the onslaught. This option, thankfully, can be turned off in the config file - but, if survived on any difficulty <em>not</em> insane, will take a large chunk out of the Queen's available soldiers and will guarantee no attacks for at least a week.</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><hr>
