It expanded the available characters to five (Barbarian, Amazon, Necromancer, Sorceress, and Paladin) and introduced many new features, including: a skill tree which gave players the ability to tailor their character(s) toward certain power schemes; the ability to add jewels and runes to weapons and armor to increase their abilities; the ability to craft items; new levels of weapon and armor rarity and quality; and many others. The game also greatly expanded the <em>Diablo</em> world. The action takes place in four Acts, set in the forests and fields around an abandoned monastery and temporary rogue encampment, the desert city of Lut Gholein, the jungle realm of Kurast, and in the depths of Hell itself.</p><p><em>Diablo II</em>'s plot revolves around the efforts of the Dark Wanderer (the corrupted hero of the first game) to reunite with the other Prime Evils and your character's journey to defeat the Prime Evils once and for all. The overall plot is loosely narrated by an elderly man named Marius, who follows the Dark Wanderer on his travels and sees the horrors he unleashes as Diablo increasingly gains control over him.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>An expansion pack, <em>Lord of Destruction</em>, added a fifth act set on the snowy Mount Arreat, two new character classes (the Druid and Assassin), and allowed the game to play at an 800x600 resolution.</p><p>The next sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII">Diablo III</a></em>, was released <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelGap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelGap">in 2012</a>.</p><p></p><hr><h2>This game provides examples of the following:</h2><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A - E&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyHighLevelCap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyHighLevelCap">Absurdly High Level Cap</a>: The pace of experience slows down to a crawl by the mid-80s. A handful of people do reach 99, but it takes an insanely long time. Most characters will have attained optimal skills long before this. This is because shortly after it was released, <em>Diablo II</em> ended up with hundreds of Level 99 Hardcore Barbarians on Battle.net, much to the chagrin of the game designers who were certain reaching level 99 in Hardcore (where dying even once permanently ended your game) was impossible. Several nerfs to the signature Barbarian skill (Whirlwind) were applied, only for other game-breaking abilities to be uncovered in other character classes. Finally, they simply applied a patch that set all experience gains for level 80 or higher characters to be 1/10th normal, all past level 90 to be 1/100th normal, and past level 95 to be 1/1000th normal (most non-boss enemies, even on Hell difficulty, give only one experience point per kill at that level). By mathematically guaranteeing that players would need to kill 10 enemies per second, 24 hours a day, for nearly a year to go from level 98 to level 99, they finally succeeded in killing off interest in attaining the maximum level.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySpaciousSewer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySpaciousSewer">Absurdly Spacious Sewer</a>:<ul><li> The sewers under Lut Gholein, although there are passageways that are tiny and cramped and will only allow one character to move forward at a time.</li><li> The sewers under Kurast are larger still.</li><li> Justified in both.

Instances of a particular rare magic item, the Stone of Jordan, became the unofficial currency, then later high level runes became the standard.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy">Adaptational Villainy</a>: Hephastos in the original Greek mythology was just the god of the forge and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGod">Jerkass God</a> at worst.

The game gives the option of displaying in perspective (parallel lines converge at the horizon) or isometric (parallel lines remain parallel). In the Arcane Sanctuary, the perspective option is disabled, due to it being impossible to draw.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllNaturalGemPolish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllNaturalGemPolish">All-Natural Gem Polish</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocketedEquipment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocketedEquipment">Socketed items</a> can be fitted with gems of many grades, the lowest being Chipped and the highest being Perfect.

To get your items back, you need to go back to where you were killed and recover your own corpse. This is often unfeasible, especially on higher difficulties, because the enemies that killed you are still hanging around your corpse and now you have no weapons to defeat them or armor to survive them. Thankfully, you can restart your game and your corpse will appear in town with all the items intact and only the gold gone. This was a consequence of not having this option in the first <em>Diablo</em> in multiplayer mode.

Supplementary material for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII">Diablo III</a></em> confirms that at least some of the heroes of the second game have also been killed not outside battle, notably <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Sorceress, who mentors the DIII Wizard until being murdered by the Assassin</span>.

A character's ability to wear a piece of armor (aside from level and any specific class restrictions on an item) more often than not depends on how many stat points are in STR. The result is that the 'pure' mage classes (necromancers and sorceresses) can't wear the heaviest armor because the player has likely put most of their stat points into INT. In other words, they can't wear the armor because they're squishy, and they're squishy because they train their minds more than their bodies.<ul><li> This actually wound up being subverted more often than not. Due to players wanting to spend the minimum amount of stat points in anything other than Vitality, the run speed penalty on medium and heavy armor, and the comparatively small difference in defense between the light and heavy armors, end game it was not uncommon to see members of any class all running around in archon plates and carrying monarch shields.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Artificial Stupidity</a>: While the enemy AI is okay, the ally AI is definitely not.

This created the Hammerdin, making a Blessed Hammer/Concentration combo a viable character build (with the right equipment, of course).

It's explained that light and dark are not necessarily good and evil, and while the balance tipping to evil would mean torment, the absence of evil would lead to stagnation. One additional point to consider that the Balance is sometimes portrayed (though not described as) not as being between good and evil, but making sure that neither the angels or the demons of the series gain too much of a foothold in the world, as both are jerks.

But in Lord of Destruction, Tyrael says that while the hero was fighting in hell, i.e. <em>before</em> Diablo was defeated, Baal had been rallying his army and launching his assault on Mount Arreat, and had already taken over all but one of the barbarian strongholds; and Baal had already recovered his Soulstone by the time he had taken over Sescheron in the opening cinematic in Lord of Destruction.

The first game allows you to choose one of three characters to play, a male Warrior, a female Rogue, and a male Sorcerer. After defeating Diablo, this character embeds his soulstone into his or her forehead in an attempt to contain Diablo forever. It doesn't work, and the hero is possessed by Diablo, becoming <em>Diablo II</em>'s villain. Although never explicitly stated, it is pretty clear that the Warrior is canonically the one who did so, as the character is male (unlike the rogue) and white (so not the sorcerer). If you look very carefully you can find hints about what happened to the Rogue and Sorcerer, but they clearly didn't do as well as their meat shield buddy, if "possessed by Satan" can be considering doing well.

The effectiveness of just about everything is reduced to a quarter, your resistances plummet to a base of -100, and almost every single monster is not only resistant, but entirely <em>immune</em> to a particular element (often when the monster had zero resistance to anything in either of the previous difficulties) while gaining additional resistances to one or nearly all attributes. The immunities are a particular problem, as it's very possible for your character's skills to be focused on only one form of damage if you didn't know about the problem beforehand.</li><li> It deserves special mention that some monsters possess immunity to physical damage. I.E, melee attacks don't work. Speaking of bosses, there are three randomly generated per normal level in hell difficulty as opposed to one in normal plus their flock of minions is deadlier too.</li><li> Less dramatic is Act IV of the game, when you invade Hell, featuring a jump in monster difficulty - suddenly homing, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">mana</a> draining missiles, etc. Then of course there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Diablo himself</a>.</li><li> The battle with the Ancients is far harder than the the battle with Baal, the final boss.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiminishingReturnsForBalance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiminishingReturnsForBalance">Diminishing Returns for Balance</a>: <em>Diablo II</em> uses this for many skill bonuses, such as Dodge giving you an 18% chance to dodge with the first point, but quickly tapering down to less than 1% bonus per point by level 20. This type of balance wound up turning many skills into "one point wonders." Just put a single point in the skill, and the "+x all skills" bonuses on your equipment end up giving you just as much of a bonus as actually maxing the skill would have in the first place.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisadvantageousDisintegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisadvantageousDisintegration">Disadvantageous Disintegration</a>: Freezing your enemies and then shattering them is nice unless you are a necromancer, who needs intact corpses to fuel some of his spells.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss">Disc-One Final Boss</a>: <em>Diablo II</em> was divided in four acts, with one final boss per act. In act 2 you're expected to kill Baal before he can escape his prison, but run into a giant bug called Duriel instead. Diablo is the final boss of act 4, but the expansion comes and Baal turns out to be the true final boss of the game instead.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">Disc-One Nuke</a>:<ul><li> The game allows you to trade between your characters online. One neat trick is to make <em>Khalim's Will</em>, which is usable by characters of any level (because it's a quest item) and provides obscene amounts of damage for most if not all characters below level 25 (when you acquire it, you're generally around level 21-24).</li><li> Enchant Skill, while normally a relatively useless sorceress skill that adds fire damage to a target's weapon, with incredible amounts of + skills, can get fire damage added up to somewhere between 3000 and 9000. It's still somewhat useless by the time you can get it there barring a very specific build. However, joining a normal game and giving that much damage to a character in normal mode essentially means anyone can go through the whole of normal one or two-shotting every monster with a regular short bow. To put it in perspective, Diablo only has about 14,000 HP on Normal (though fire resistance does factor in) and Baal, the boss of the expansion roughly twice that. The most a regular enemy has is about 3000. Makes early level grinding in Hardcore a breeze.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscountCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscountCard">Discount Card</a>: In Act 2, after killing Radament in the sewers beneath Lut Gholein, Atma the tavernkeeper tells the player she's asked the other vendors in town to give you reduced prices on goods.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisposableSexWorker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisposableSexWorker">Disposable Sex Worker</a>: The poor, poor harem girls in Act II.

Plainly, it summons a <em>frickin hurricane that you then walk around in.</em> Not only are you completely unharmed by it, neither are your allies. Enemies are not sucked in; instead, anything that comes into contact takes significant damage and dies. The lore says the druid is unharmed because he is in the eye of the cyclone. Also interesting are the actual Tornado and especially Twister spells: the latter produces <em>three</em> tornadoes that are so tiny as to miss targets two druid lengths in front of you, and getting hit only stuns you for a fraction of a second. The former correctly deals damage around it, where 'around it' is defined as the size of a large monster, and because it deals damage over time it cannot even interrupt monsters. This spell set goes nicely with the waist height volcano, but it is no surprise the sequel features Energy Twister, a tornado of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwirlyEnergyThingy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwirlyEnergyThingy">whirling magic!</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTouchItYouIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTouchItYouIdiot">Don't Touch It, You Idiot!</a>: Marius finds himself venturing into the tomb of Tal Rasha alongside the Dark Wanderer, eventually finding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInADuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInADuel">shackled mage</a> in the flesh.

"After so many have died, who are you to think you can accomplish what our warriors could not?" And, "Ending the siege [will] not earn immediate respect, outsider. Respect only comes with sacrifice &mdash; something I'm sure you know nothing of". The worst from Nihlathak? "What are you still doing here? I thought you were going off to die.

Archers generally cause a lot of grief because of their ranged capabilities, but this monster pack multiplies the damage of an already damage-enhanced monster through the use of minions. The Cold Enchanted property further acts as some sort of a force multiplier by allowing all in the pack to deal additional cold damage AND slow their target's movements. This combination makes for an encounter that makes Blood Raven seem like a cakewalk. To make matters worse, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">upon death</a>, she flips you the finger like all Cold Enchanted monsters do, by casting a frost nova that's VERY damaging to characters who haven't been investing significantly in their vitality attribute.

A common multiplayer strategy was to use the portals of a party member instead of yours, as the portal would only disappear after its creator took it; teammates could use it back and forth as many times as needed.

Baal pauses for a moment as though he's genuinely thinking of turning his Army of Doom back down the mountain to find some other place to pillage... then promptly vaporises the elder's innards. He issues this trope along with the words "It appears your terms are not acceptable", cackles and lays waste to the entire town.

Other parts of Hell include great, dark, ashen plains. This is in contrast to the first <em>Diablo</em> which envisioned Hell as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodyBowelsOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodyBowelsOfHell">a land of bones, blood and mutilated corpses</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireIceLightning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireIceLightning">Fire, Ice, Lightning</a>: A few variants of this, but played completely straight by the Sorceress.

He is eventually given the task to enter Hell itself to destroy Baal's soulstone, ie. to actually do something, but understandably chickens out. What's interesting is that if Marius is seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonPeripheralNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonPeripheralNarrator">First-Person Peripheral Narrator</a>, then the main character is Diablo, not the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a>.

This can help in defeating fallen shamans but is generally regarded as a waste of skill points (well, waste of skill <em>point</em>), arguably, though the ability to get basically any monster that does anything complicated or dangerous to stop doing it and instead walk right up to you and get its ass kicked is handy sometimes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlamethrowerBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlamethrowerBackfire">Flamethrower Backfire</a>: Bosses with the Fire Enchanted modifier will explode violently upon death.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlamingSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlamingSword">Flaming Sword</a>:<ul><li> The Archangel Tyrael used a sword that burned with holy flames, before Baal wrestled it away.</li><li> The sorceress can enchant weapons with fire.

But with the right gear and Minmaxing, they <em>can</em> dish out 100k+ damage per hit turning them somewhat into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannons</a> dealing more damage than just about anything else in the game.

The Paladin's Charge attack is close, allowing a means to dance from place to place at (nearly) untrackable speed, even leaving the trail of afterimages.

To make things worse, all three of the player characters from the first game didn't make it out of things in one piece &mdash; the Rogue was corrupted by Andariel and became Blood Raven, the Mage was driven insane by Diablo himself and became the Summoner, and the Warrior? As a result of sticking that soulstone into his own head at the end of the first game, he's become Diablo's new host.

Literally the only number it can't get wrong is your level, and inaccurate stats can appear <em>as early as level 3</em>.

For most of the game's lifespan, the only way to be strong enough for higher difficulties was to save skill points until you had unlocked high-level skills, as low-level skills were too weak even with heavy investment, and allocate stat points based on what you would need for Hell mode.

Deploy this trope against any melee opponent who looks too scary.<ul><li> You could specialize in this strategy by using items and charms with FRW (faster run/walk) and self-guided missiles (the Amazon's Guided Arrow or the Necromancer's Bone Spirit.)</li><li> A Poison Bone Necromancer added a new level to this strategy by using Bone Wall, which created obstacles in your opponents' path and/or trapped them if they couldn't teleport (rather than speeding up themselves, they slowed down their opponent.)</li><li> In the .08 version of the expansion pack, this strategy was considered a game killer because of the skill Pierce. The guided arrow would pierce through the opponent, turn around, hit the opponent again, and again, and again. The Amazon could also release several Guided Arrows while the first one was still active, and thus 5-10 arrows would be automatically piercing through the opponent. People were killing game bosses offscreen in under a minute. Guided Arrow Amazons were routinely outlawed in player duels, and naked Amazons with only a weapon could defeat much stronger players.</li><li> The Sorcerer's Blizzard, Firewall and Meteor spells were cast behind the sorcerer on enemies, then the sorcerer would run around in a circle around the spell's splash damage area so that the monsters would take the damage. With .09, the Druid and Assassin characters could also do this with their upgraded skills. The Sorceress' Blaze spell also worked very well for this at low levels, creating a line of fire wherever you walked. You didn't even have to turn around to hit them.</li><li> The Amazon's Lightning Fury would be used in a strategy called "herding." A large number of enemies were grouped together, and the Amazon would run in a circle casting Lightning Fury, avoiding damage. Sometimes, another player would help the Amazon by herding the monsters for them (usually they had skills or items to make them move faster.) As this strategy was first invented on the Cow Level, the helper became known as a "sheepdog."</li><li> The 1.10 patch brought in runewords, including Enigma which allows any class to use the Teleport skill, allowing for this tactic to be used far more effectively than running would among other things. Anyone can do this except the Amazon, as her slow casting speed means she'd be faster on foot.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomingProjectile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomingProjectile">Homing Projectile</a>: Amazons can fire homing arrows.

Inverted in the case of Mephisto, who has deadly ranged attacks, but will only use wimpy melee attacks at close quarters.<ul><li> Actually, standing up to Diablo is the best way to beat him with a weak character. His lightning hose has a gap right next to him so he'll literally shoot it past you, he won't cast bone prison when you're next to him, his cold melee and firestorm attacks can be dodged since they have big backswings and don't follow you, and his flaming circle attack always hits you anyway. Duriel's radius of death is about the same size as his room, so it doesn't really count. Duriel is also easier to survive if either a player or a minion is next to him since that prevented him from using his charge attack, which stunned its target. And Mephisto's best fought from across the chasm with a weak character - he doesn't exclusively melee when you're next to him, and his melee is a bit too much for a weak character anyway.</li><li> Melee characters are widely regarded as not viable unless you have the best items in the game. For instance, there are a handful of bugged monsters that are virtually impossible to kill in melee before they annihilate you from extreme range. And one monster type used to cast a curse on you that caused you to pretty much kill yourself when you hit anything in melee. It could cast this while you were in the middle of a whirlwind or zeal hit sequence resulting in an unavoidable instant death.<ul><li> The somewhat popular <em>Lord of Destruction</em> mod "Eastern Sun" <em>nerfed</em> the monster version of the spell in question (Iron Maiden, a Necromancer Curse), thus making it possible to actually complete Act IV with a melee character.</li></ul></li><li> The "Median XL" mod has a literal instant death radius in the form of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">"witch"</a> monster: a motionless ghost that announces its presence with an eerie song.

The catch of this skill is that it gets stronger the stronger you get yourself as it inflicts 75% weapon damage to enemies. This becomes even more impressive when you realize that it also causes the traits of your weapons like elemental damage as well as the traits you add to it by other means like armor or skills. So if your weapon possesses Mana Steal you have a ranged attack that refills your mana as long as it hits, if your weapon possesses Knockback it will push enemies away from you and if your weapon possesses the ability to randomly cast spells it will cast that spell with a similar ratio where it hits and it costs almost no mana at all. The downsides of it are that you can't move while you use it (you can't move while you cast most spells anyway), it only hits single enemies as long as it doesn't cast other spells and enemies are still able to avoid or block it (though as evasions and blocks are often tied to an animation they might be hit by the next blade as soon as they recover from defending).

Maybe 0.1% of people actually play the game like you're intended to.<ul><li> Even ignoring online play, this is pretty much a necessity. Try going through the game without level grinding, you probably won't access even a single rank of the highest level skill. Now try and go through the game on Nightmare with that character.</li><li> If you play on your own (single player), you will not even get enough experience to keep up with the monsters, forcing you to stop and grind. If you play only in full (eight player) online games, you very quickly outlevel the monsters and stop gaining more levels unless you skip ahead. In numerical terms, you gain <em>over five times</em> as much experience in a full game.<ul><li> Of course, console commands can trick the game into thinking one's playing a game with any number of players between 1 and 8 while actually going solo. Might make the enemies tougher, but as was mentioned above you'll outlevel them quickly enough.</li></ul></li><li> In single and multiplay, the better gear becomes more important to keeping up than character stats. Because everything <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops">Randomly Drops</a>, level grinding is just a byproduct of farming.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelLockedLoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelLockedLoot">Level-Locked Loot</a>: Items do have level restrictions, and some items have strength requirements.

This changed when the Council voted to spare humans on seeing their possible nobility. Imperius is the only one on the Council to continue to call for humanity's destruction and attempts to prevent any angelic attempts at aiding humanity. Given his status as commander of heaven's armies and the angels' believe in order it greatly impedes the other angels from acting.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningCanDoAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningCanDoAnything">Lightning Can Do Anything</a>: You might as well rename the "Lightning" skill tree as the "everything that isn't fire and ice" skill tree.

For passive skills like Paladin auras, this makes sense, but for normal attacks and spells it's very limiting. The game also lets one assign skills to quick keys, but these only ready skills, actually activating them requires a press of the slot's button.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedUseMagicalDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedUseMagicalDevice">Limited-Use Magical Device</a>: In <em>Diablo II</em> each class has a unique repertoire of skills, and only the universal utility spells of Identify and Town Portal are available as single-use, no-requirement scrolls.

In early levels your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">physical, combat class</a> will sweep the floor with any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> standing in their way.

Casters are <em>easier</em> since they depend less on items (most Fighters basically require quite good items to succeed, while some casters can get by with any old thing), and the Sorceress has free access to Teleport which makes a huge difference, but for the toughest bosses, a Fighter is always better. A "Smiter" can beat Uber Tristram with relatively mediocre items; for a Sorceress, it's almost impossible without preposterously rare items.</li><li> Averted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusPlayer">PvP</a>: every single class has several builds to duel with at each PvP level cap. There are melee builds dubbed "caster killers" for how effectively they can trash Necromancers, casting Druids and Sorceresses. This is in part due to a piece of armor which gives any class the ability to teleport, a skill normally reserved for the Sorceress. Even low-level duels are well-matched between caster and melee. But only with Enigma.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note21iyi');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note21iyi" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note21iyi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A basically-impossible-to-legitimately-obtain armor that can give anyone the Sorceress's Teleport skill.</span></li><li> Before the expansion, caster classes shot ahead of fighters early on and then hit a hard cap at about level 50 after their main offensive spell was maxed, at which point fighter classes only got started. The sheer amount of elemental resistances compared to physical resistances was not helping, notably the fact that pretty much the entire final Act in Hell difficulty was 75% fire resistant. The only viable endgame caster builds involved merciless exploitation of percentage based damage (Static Field, Corpse Explosion, Iron Maiden) or bugs (Blessed Hammer) while flat damage spells were only used to finish off enemies reduced to a sliver by Static Field or to kill a handful of enemies at the start of a run so you could get some revived minions up.</li><li> The expansion aimed to fix this by introducing large numbers of +skill level items, previously a very rare modifier that tended to come mostly on bad items. The game tilted in favour of casters, at first because it was easy enough to promote area of effect abilities, then because later patches made the game much harder to the point where melee builds without godly items stood no chance. Meanwhile new items solved the early game struggles of caster classes and provided ways around elemental immunities, enabling them to dominate pretty much the entire game from start to finish.</li><li> The necromancer before the expansion had spells with awful scaling effects. His poison spells did not gain damage per second when you spent skill points into them, only duration, meaning you could kill anything... over the course of 30 seconds. In an action RPG. The worst of the worst were poison skeletal mages which ended up doing literally 1 damage per second for 3 minutes.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiterallyShatteredLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiterallyShatteredLives">Literally Shattered Lives</a>: While shattering is not so much "freeze then crush with blunt instrument" as "freeze then kill normally", it is one of the more effective way of dealing with things that are liable to be resurrected or used somehow by something nearby.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingShadow">Living Shadow</a>: The Assassin can summon a shadowy clone to fight on her side.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALoadOfBull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALoadOfBull">A Load of Bull</a>:<ul><li> Hell Bovines from the Secret Cow Level.</li><li> In <em>Lord of Destruction</em>, there are some enormous minotaur-like demons in Act V, called [Descriptor] Lords.

There are even four different ways to do so: resurrect monsters with "burn" damage which bypasses resistances and attacks hit points directly; find the item that summons instakill reanimates on your side when you kill enemies; find the item that summons a certain boss whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecapitatedArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecapitatedArmy">death animation is coded to autokill nearby monsters</a> on your side and let it "expire"; or use a bugged passive in combination with Open Wounds to cause the monster to take physical damage despite being immune to it.</li></ul></li><li> <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

This was nerfed in the 1.10 patch.</li><li> An allegedly popular set of challenges are the 1@17, 2@20, 3@30 Diablo kills &mdash; basically, killing the final boss on a difficulty setting at the earliest possible level. To use the Hell entrance in Normal difficulty requires a character level of 17, to access Nightmare difficulty requires a level of 20, and Hell difficulty is accessible at 30. Each challenge is to be attempted solo, though you are not required to attempt or complete any of the earlier challenges to attempt the coveted 3@30.</li><li> There's also the literal lowest-level-possible challenge, which can be attempted only using outdated patches.

Necromancers can do this to nearly any dead enemy with Raise Skeleton (Mage) or Corpse Explosion, as well.<ul><li> Some monsters also break into gibs upon a normal sword-bashing death. It's funny to cast the resurrection spell with a necromancer on them and watch the death animation play backwards. Gibs fly into the air and connect with each other, forming a fully functional undead monster.</li><li> Interestingly, if one kills a swarm of locusts and attempts to raise a skeleton from the "corpse", the same bloody explosion will occur and produce a <em>perfect human skeleton complete with weapon</em>. Also, if you kill an enemy skeleton, you can cast the raise-skeleton spell on it, but first it too must explode in a shower of blood and gory effluence.</li><li> Aah, Corpse Explosion. Blow up a tiny Leaper or Fetish and get a blood fountain as glorious as if you'd blown up an entire Blood Maggot. A dry, fleshless Skeleton Warrior? Gibs aplenty. That one little animation, illogical as it may be, provides so much catharsis.</li><li> Many of the Druid's powers explode corpses too... carrion vines and solar creepers, for example, but also summoned Dire Wolves who always appreciate a quick snack and are apparently very messy eaters.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>: <em>Diablo II</em> continues the trend:<ul><li> Act I: To rescue Cain, find the scroll needed to access the Cairne Stones to open a portal to Tristram.

Find a <em>Horadric Scroll</em> in the sewers, then find the <em>Horadric Cube</em>, then find the two pieces of an ancient staff that must then be put together to form a full staff (<em>The Horadric Staff</em>). <em>Horazon's Journal</em> you need to read in the arcane sanctuary also applies as one even though it's not an item your character can grab.</li><li> Act III: Similar to Act II, to open the door to Mephisto's lair, find the 4 pieces of an ancient flail throughout the Act that must then be put together to form a full flail (<em>Khalim's Will</em>). Act ends with you receiving <em>Mephisto's Soulstone</em>. The optional quests also sends you out to find the <em>Golden Bird, Gidbinn Blade, Lam Essen's Tome</em> MacGuffins.</li><li> Act IV: Destroy <em>Mephisto's MacGuffin</em> at the nearby Hellforge, but to do it, you need the nearby <em>Hellforge Hammer</em>. The cutscene after finishing Act 4 also shows the player destroying <em>Diablo's MacGuffin</em>.</li><li> Act V: The <em>Relic of the Ancients</em> isn't a MacGuffin you can obtain, but it's plot relevant for Baal to reach the World Stone.

An exception to this is the unique staff "Ribcracker", which is a fairly popular weapon for shapeshifter druids who don't have access to the high end expensive runewords.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a>: The Assassin's gadgets such as the lightning trap, flame trap and blade barrier would fall under this.

So huge, in fact, that they can be entered from both Lower Kurast and the Kurast Bazaar, which aren't exactly small confined areas.

His summons are limited to 1, 3, or 5 damaging minions, while the Necromancer can have somewhere around 40 skeletons total. His melee skills are up to the task, but since his were-forms have limited durations, he has to worry about turning back into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">human</a> mid-battle.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfUnlocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfUnlocking">Master of Unlocking</a>: The Assassin can unlock chests without a key.

It's still one of the best ways to get good equipment in single player.<ul><li> Early on, it's a good idea to buy gear regularly. Every now and then, you can get some useful but expensive gear from the right merchant.

The SOJ was a powerful ring that was duped to such ridiculous levels that it served as the <em>de facto</em> currency in the game, and the Diablo Clone was Blizzard's way of getting rid of excess SoJs.</li><li> Gambling allows one a relatively decent odds of getting a desired item, assuming one has sufficient money (it "only" takes a few thousand tries, if you're not unlucky).

Or a <em>cloud of flies</em>. Or a ghost, or a bug. At least the imps might have <em>bones</em>.

The lore says that unlike zombies with their rotten flesh, mummies conserve their muscles and tissues intact which makes them physically stronger than other types of undead. Mummies can be produced in infinite numbers from sarcophagi and "die" in a burst of poisonous gases (from the chemicals used to preserve their ancient bodies escaping, of course), and greater mummies, the remains of Horadric mages who, to honor them, had animal parts grafted onto their bodies in death.

Humbart is a spirit bound to a skull. Nothing else, just a skull. He can see, hear, and talk, but that is about it. Zayl makes it a point to keep Humbart hidden when he's around anyone else, lest they think he's evil.</li><li> <em>The Sin War</em> trilogy briefly explains the origins of the Necromancers. There are 3 worlds in the Diablo multiverse, they are basically Heaven, Hell, and Sanctuary (Earth). Heaven is at war with Hell, and both sides think they could win by "recruiting" the mortals of Sanctuary. Necromancers want Sanctuary to stay neutral/not involved. They would like to kick ALL Angels and Demons out of Sanctuary, but, lacking the ability to do so, they wind up fighting against whichever side is winning.

Tyrael charges because he's an angel, and because of the pact, cannot directly intervene on behalf of humanity.

While this does make the game harder in some ways, the level difference (between monster and player) and the loot are a big factor in difficulty, so this mode is only a bit harder early on, when the difficulty is very low anyway due to the very slow difficulty build up through the game.

The very first mission is the Den of Evil, which has you clearing out a cave of zombies because they <em>might</em> attack the Rogue Encampment. Emphasis on might because the cave is full of low-level zombies, fallen that can be one-shotted with ease and the weaksauce wannabe-giants that get killed with one hit once you reach level three, and then you meet up with a single rogue laying waste to twenty or so of them on top of evil amazon-chick reincarnated-and-then-re-killed-by-the-sentry corpses in the Cold Plains in the very next mission.

Notably, the twinked Blizzard Sorceress and the Charging Paladin. It is also technically possible, with perfectly set-up gear and skills, to kill the final boss on the hardest difficulty over the course of several minutes with a single stab from a Necromancer's Poison Dagger skill.</li><li> Due to a bug in how damage is dealt when Fire-Enchanted monsters explode upon death, they can easily OHK an unprepared player. The mini-boss Nihlathak is infamous for both his potential to drop desirable items and his potential to kill even <em>prepared</em> players in an instant by using the corpses of his dead minions as area-of-effect bombs.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPolykill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPolykill">One-Hit Polykill</a>: The Amazon has a Bow skill called Pierce, which causes arrows to pass through multiple enemies. When combined with Strafe, which splits an arrow to hit multiple targets... carnage ensues.<ul><li> In older versions, this produced amusing results when used with the "guided arrow" skill - the arrow would hit the target, fly out the other side, and immediately turn around to have another go (and possibly repeat up to 5 times).</li><li> Some projectile weapons also have the Piercing Attack trait, rated 1 to 100% chance to pierce a target. The Buriza-Do Kyanon unique crossbow was the preferred weapon of many Amazons, called "Burizons", who specialized in Strafe and (when it worked) Guided Arrow.<ul><li> As well as this works with bows, it works much better when the Amazon uses a Javelin. Her Lightning Fury skill makes a number of lightning bolts fly out towards the enemies and at high levels you get a very high number of bolts. Combine it with piercing and the javelin will go on to hit another target... and release the entire volley of lightning bolts again. And again. And again. The more enemies you have together the faster all of them will drop dead, making this perhaps the ultimate example.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a>: Every playable character in the <em>Diablo</em> games can, and will, kill hundreds (if not thousands) of demons and other creatures over the course of the adventure. Not only do you plow through Hell and kill Diablo, you also kill his brothers Mephisto, Baal, and legions upon legions of their evil minions, all by yourself. It's a virtual one man demonic genocide.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneStatToRuleThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneStatToRuleThemAll">One Stat to Rule Them All</a>: In most cases, non-Vitality point assignment is only recommended for meeting equipment requirements. What happened to avoiding getting hit, and so being able to add to strength and agility? Well, all right, so far it's only Amazons who get to enjoy Slow Missiles... Nearly <em>every</em> single character build follows this stat format:<ul><li> Strength: as little as possible to meet equipment requirements</li><li> Dexterity: as above, or exactly enough for maximum block.</li><li> Vitality: PUT EVERYTHING YOU HAVE HERE!</li><li> Energy: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumpStat">never put anything into this.</a> (Even when playing a sorceress!)</li><li> Strength is outdone by skill- and equipment-based damage boosts. The attack rating (accuracy) from Dexterity can easily be found elsewhere or is simply irrelevant. The same can be said for the mana gained from Energy. Thus, with enemies having high damage, Vitality is the only thing really worth investing in, unless you're an Energy Shield sorceress (Energy Shield redirects up to 95% of damage they take to their mana instead of their hitpoints).</li><li> The 1.13c patch added in the ability to "respec" and reset attribute and skill points once per difficulty level to encourage non-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing">Min-Maxing</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">One Steve Limit</a>: A bizarre aversion: in Act III both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HubCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HubCity">Hub City</a> and the ruins you later explore are named simply "Kurast", which can be really confusing the first time through, as one quest requires you to go to the Kurast sewers, which most players would assume are under the main city like in the previous act.

One skill has such a slow animation that a monster can walk away before it lands. There's also a multi-strike skill that, as soon as <em>any</em> hit misses in the sequence or is interrupted (including by any of the Amazon's passive damage avoidance skills), all subsequent hits will miss while the animation plays out and you are beaten to death.</li><li> Both skills that use a certain attack animation, which looks like a continuous blast of flame or ice, can only hit one target. Furthermore, these skills do less than 1/3rd the damage they should. This is because the missile used disappears once it hits a target, rather than continuing to exist to deal damage in spite of the ongoing animation giving the illusion it's working.</li><li> There is the Gloam enemy that has two attacks: a powerful touch-based attack and a ranged lightning blast. The damage from the first attack is inexplicably added to the damage from the second attack making it one of the most infamous monsters in the game.</li><li> Due to faulty coding a Viper enemy, on Hell difficulty, fires poison blasts from its mouth that leave behind invisible hitboxes that do massive <em>physical</em> as well as poison damage and hit up to 12.5 times <em>per second</em>. This can and will kill any character not specifically built to fully negate the damage within seconds if they meet the conditions to trigger the bug. The conditions? Walking, or having an ally stand near you. They're also notorious for murdering your NPC ally without a moment's notice. Veteran players will usually just Save &amp; Quit rather than deal with them.</li><li> If a boss monster gets a certain kind of randomly generated Mana Drain power, it drains 512x as much mana as intended. This makes it go from an annoying perk to an instantly debilitating one that can result in (nearly) instant death for sorceresses who used the Energy Shield skill (which allows the player to lose mana instead of health when attacked). This is due to a combination of two bugs. The first is because the engine subdivides each point of damage into 256 bits of damage for better rounding accuracy. The Mana Drain code applies this multiplication twice, so all Mana Drain uniques deal 256 times as much damage as they should. The second results from Hell difficulty applying a -100% penalty to all resistances. This includes the resistance to mana damage, despite there being nothing that could raise that resistance. Thus, all attacks that drain mana drain twice as much in Hell.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a>: Three of these, aptly named the Prime Evils.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalHeaven">Physical Heaven</a>: <em>Diablo II</em> has you sent to Hell to kill Diablo.

Runes (items you can place into other items to make them better) are particularly glaring, with some high-level runes having such tiny chances to drop (1 in millions, and even that requires finding enemies even capable of dropping the runes in the first place) that most hard-core players have never seen a legitimate one (ones created by hacks, of course, are another matter entirely). In fact, one person apparently estimated that one has a better chance of getting hit by a falling plane that was struck by lightning than one does of finding the rarest rune. Nobody knows if that estimation is true, but you get the idea.<ul><li> The rune example is fairly straightforward, but it can get much more complex: A base sword, for example, might have an inherent range of say 5 +/- damage and 10 +/- quality. So, just getting a "max" sword would take at least 15 rolls of that sword, of which, the top swords are also rare. Then, the top prefix is "Cruel," which varies between 200-300% added damage. The top suffix is "of Eviscration" which also varies by 20 points. It is estimated that maybe 1 sword has ever existed that was truly "perfect." You would need 10's of thousands of rolls to get a perfect roll, but you would probably need somewhere around 100 million of that sword to get 10k with that roll to even have a chance at the perfect stats. And then, there's the "Ethereal" version, which is 1/3 as common as the regular version. Only 1 300% Cruel, Ethereal, Elite class, 2 Socket sword has ever been found.</li><li> <em>Diablo II</em> includes many items that, when equipped, increase the odds of an item drop, notably socketing an item with perfect topaz gems. Some players traded for as much of this equipment as they could cram onto themselves, and went hunting; the Barbarian had an edge over any other character in this respect, because the optimum item-finding equipment package requires dual-wielding a pair of enchanted broadswords, which only the barbarian can do, and the barbarian had a skill that basically amounted to "trigger the random drop again".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaysFromHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaysFromHeaven">Rays from Heaven</a>: When you clear the Den Of Evil, the place gets illuminated with rays of light apparently breaking through the stone roof of the place as a heavenly-sounding choir can be heard above the music.

In <em>Diablo</em>'s Multiplayer, the NPCs keep the same speech, talking to you like if you were the sole one present. This is a complicated example due to the difference between what's seen in-game and what happened according to canon. <br><br>In the games' canon, all of the heroes were indeed present. The Rogue, Sorcerer and Warrior from the first game show up as Blood Raven, the Summoner, and the Wanderer (possessed by Diablo himself because he is made the one who canonically "defeated" him) in the second. This goes with the completely different onscreen and backstory versions of the setting of the first game; Tristram is supposed to be the capital of the realm, whereas in-game it's a minuscule village, and several adventurers are supposed to be coming to explore the nearby dungeon, when in the game the only possible signs of anyone such other than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> are some remains inside. <br><br>To complicate things even more, though it's probably a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">Retcon</a> or continuity error, while the Wanderer was the one who defeated Diablo, his background in the second game contradicts that of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> in the first (who used to live in Tristram, whereas the Wanderer was not known to anyone there), which would imply... well, nothing that makes coherent sense, but it makes the relationship to this trope even more complicated. <br><br>Further, each of the three "characters" described in the manual is actually a type of adventurer (a character class in game terms); it's not that there was just one Warrior, Rogue and Sorcerer, the backstory made it clear there were at least potentially several of each coming to Tristram, and indeed the Rogues in the next game speak of others of their number besides Blood Raven having been there. So basically, the game does the trope almost on two levels, but the canon averts it. <br><br><em>Diablo III</em> largely avoids anything hard and fast about the heroes of <em>Diablo II</em>, and lampshades the fact that Tristram is so small and run-down for a capital with one of Leoric's journals commenting on that and wondering why Lazarus directed him to make such a place his capital. However, it further confuses the issue of the Wanderer, by making him Aidan, Leoric's eldest son, whereas in earlier lore, Leoric only had the one son &mdash; paving over the continuity error with regards to the Wanderer in Tristram by making him someone no-one would actually admit to recognizing after seeing how he'd deteriorated, but also making him a character who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy">previously didn't exist in any capacity.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretLevel">Secret Level</a>: The secret Cow Level, which was made after various rumours about one in the first game.</li><li> <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

The expansion provided the new druid class with an <em>Ice</em> thrower which was useful for no other reason than the very long chill length, providing some much-needed crowd control until players figured out that there's a passive area effect chill spell in the druid's arsenal and most enemies you want to chill are immune to it anyway.
