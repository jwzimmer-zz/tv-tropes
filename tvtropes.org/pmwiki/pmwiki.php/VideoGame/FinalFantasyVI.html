When the flames of war faded, humanity was almost extinct and magic was believed to be lost. Over the next millennium humanity rebuilt and rediscovered technologies and innovations like gunpowder, steam power, and ironworking.

To this day, it still holds the record among the main series <em>Final Fantasy</em> games for most playable characters, and provides nearly all of them with character arcs and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidequest">sidequests</a>. Most fall into broad categories that were introduced in earlier games, ranging from the simple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameStealing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameStealing">Thief</a> (Locke) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk">Monk</a> (Sabin) to the more-exotic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DanceBattler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DanceBattler">Dancer</a> (Mog), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">Blue Mage</a> (Strago), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DittoFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DittoFighter">Mime</a> (Gogo).

Only two characters can learn magic by leveling up normally; one is part-Esper and the other a Magitek Knight. The others must equip Magicite, which is the crystallized <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">remains of an Esper</a>. Magicite comes with a handful of spells that you learn though experience, though naturally some take longer than others. Equipping it also alters your stats when you level-up, which makes things a bit more strategic. Lastly, Magicite doubles as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic">Summon Magic</a> and has a variety of effects in battle, be they offensive or defensive.</p><p>It has been ported twice under the original title: the first came as one-half of <em>Final Fantasy Anthology</em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationRerelease">Compilation Re-release</a> on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a>. It added a number of CGI cutscenes, replaced all censored sprites with their uncensored originals, made some minor script changes to improve accuracy, included bonuses like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterCompendium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterCompendium">bestiary</a> and an art gallery, added a run ability which doesn't require the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SprintShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SprintShoes">Sprint Shoes</a>, fixed some well-known bugs and glitches, and changed the battle transitions for the world map and dungeons.

The GBA port also uncensored certain elements...while confusingly censoring others that had been <em>un</em>censored in previous versions. On a technical note, the GBA port fixed numerous bugs (while introducing some brand-new ones) and featured a brighter color palette and remixed music&mdash;the last of which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">remains a source of contention</a>.</p><p>Square Enix re-released the SNES version on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VirtualConsole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VirtualConsole">Virtual Console</a> in Japan, Europe and North America, the PlayStation port on the PlayStation Store, and released an enhanced version of the game for mobile devices which was later released on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam">Steam</a>.

While the mobile release undid some of the last bits of visual censorship (and was rated T for Teen), it still censored the Celes pummeling scene.</li><li> One of the dumbest (and admittedly kind of hilarious) examples comes from the opening to the World of Ruin. In the original script, Cid tells Celes that there used to be other people on this deserted island but that, in their despair, they flung themselves off the cliffs to the north and, should Cid die at the end of this sequence, Celes attempts suicide in this very same way. In the original translation, however, when Celes approaches the cliff, she apparently instead remembers Cid saying that when the other people on the island "were feeling down they'd take a leap of faith from the cliffs up north... perked 'em right up!" Not only is this line never spoken prior to this scene (everyone else died from boredom according to Cid), there are zero edits made to the suicide jump itself. Celes flings herself over the edge of the cliff with tears in her eyes to the accompaniment of sad music. It has no context with that clumsily-inserted line.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">Bragging Rights Reward</a>: In the GBA version, by the time you get all the <em>really</em> powerful weapons in the Dragons' Den, your characters are so strong they don't need them anymore.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFellowship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFellowship">Breaking the Fellowship</a>: By the breaking of the airship they are currently on.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">Breaking the Fourth Wall</a>: During the opera sequence the Impresario tells the player what they must do, while Locke ends up doing this to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">in-universe opera</a> to save it.

On the one hand, this is so, with certain scenes where the party leader makes these animations, every character has a sprite to use for them. However, even temporary playable characters, like General Leo, Banon, and Locke's merchant disguise, have the same animations, so if you hack or glitch them into the party, they still work. Even Esper Terra and the Imp, which are normally impossible to have as party leaders, have a full range of animations they never use, just in case. However, the developers didn't have <em>full</em> foresight. Temporary playable characters lack Chocobo-riding sprites, so riding one with them as party leader makes them glitch up.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4gv7y');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4gv7y" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4gv7y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">They furthermore overlooked a Chocobo Stable on the world map south of Figaro Castle, so a determined player can head there in Banon's scenario, rent a Chocobo, and behold his lack of a riding sprite with no glitches or hacks required. Whoops.</span></li><li> You know how party members not in the party loiter around the airship deck? If you somehow hack or glitch Umaro or Gogo into your party in the World of Balance, they still have places assigned to them in the Blackjack for them to appear when they're not in the party. The same goes for Shadow who normally isn't ever seen on the airship in the World of Balance.</li><li> Many scenes dynamically choose who will speak at any given point based on who's in your party, prioritizing more plot-central characters. A lot of these lines are "generic" and can be spoken by anyone; however, if you bring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByWolves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByWolves">Gau</a> as your only party member to certain scenes (such as meeting Ramuh), the generic dialog will be replaced by his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HulkSpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HulkSpeak">Hulk Speak</a>.</li><li> When you order food aboard the Phantom Train, the scene plays differently depending on who the party leader is, including the Ghosts that join as guests.</li><li> If you try to bring Shadow to Narshe, where you would have the option of changing your party, he leaves. He also leaves if you hire him before going to the opera house, in case you thought to try and get him to come to Vector. (However, their foresight on this has limits; if you manage to end up with Shadow as the only person in your party - due to hiring him with Gau and leaving Gau in the Veldt, say - this will lead to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">Game-Breaking Bug</a>.)</li><li> When Locke heads into the South Figaro secret basements, he acts differently based on his current outfit. As a merchant or in his normal clothes he hides from the Imperial leaving Celes' room, but as a soldier he pretends to be standing on guard and salutes as they pass. Celes in turn reacts differently to him depending on his outfit.</li><li> When it's time to head to the Sealed Gate, you need Terra in the party and a party without her won't pass the Imperial Base. However, if you make a party with <em>only</em> Terra in it, she still turns back, as there's a brief scripted battle at the end of the area that the party members other than her participate in.</li><li> Some small scenes are very obscure and require the player to go out of their way to see them, but the developers expected you might. After Sabin joins the party shortly before reaching the Returner hideout, if you go all the way back through Mt. Kolts to South Figaro and talk to Duncan's wife, Sabin will have a brief scene where they talk about Duncan. If you return to the <em>Blackjack</em> after the imperial banquet, you can view a cutscene of Setzer and Cid repairing the airship that foreshadows the character revelations about Setzer that come in the World of Ruin. If you play through the World of Balance without ever talking to Shadow, the scene where you meet General Leo in Albrook is different to accomodate Shadow's introduction and naming.</li><li> When facing Humbaba in the World of Ruin, once he's attacked after being weakened below a certain HP threshold, he's scripted to counter with Humbaba Breath to remove two characters from battle, and then when the battle with him starts over Terra rejoins the party. If you manage to kill him outright before he does this, however, he's still scripted to use Humbaba Breath once upon dying, ensuring that there will be at least one empty spot in the party for Terra to enter in the second round.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DialogueTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DialogueTree">Dialogue Tree</a>: The dinner party. It all leads to the same place, but different choices give you rewards based on your etiquette during the dinner.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">Difficult, but Awesome</a>: Gau, Relm, and Mog are among the most hideously-underrated and overlooked characters in the series, even though all three of them can be utterly devastating when raised properly, and they all have access to some of the game's best armor and weapons. Especially in the SNES version.<ul><li> Using such equipment, Gau and Mog can easily max out their defense, and Relm has the highest magic stat in the game. Yes, even more than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryandGameplaySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryandGameplaySegregation">half-esper Terra</a>!</li><li> This is especially true of Gau. For those who are too lazy to build his list of Rages, he'll be very weak compared to everyone else, but if you take some time to get some of the better Rages, Gau becomes an extremely powerful character with a Rage for every situation, giving him access to very powerful magic that doesn't cost a single mp and various immunities and automatic statuses, with the only downside being that he becomes uncontrollable once a Rage is chosen and can't change it. And then there's Wind God Gau. Give him a Merit Award and an Offering and Cyan's Tempest weapon and use Stray Cat, and you have a 50% chance to deal four incredibly massive hits that damage everything on screen, making Gau by far the strongest character.</li></ul></li><li> <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultySpike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultySpike">Difficulty Spike</a>:<ul><li> Not as bad as other examples below, but Sabin's scenario after he got separated with the party in Lethe River qualifies. Edgar/Terra/Banon's scenario is the easiest since they are not only a group of three, but also the enemies in their scenario are fairly easy to defeat and there are <em>no bosses</em>! Locke's scenario is a not-so-difficult stealth mission and there's only one boss. Those two scenarios are pretty easy and fast to finish. Sabin's scenario, on the other hand, is <em>considerably long</em>, has some more difficult enemies (though Sabin's Blitz makes it easier to take care of them), one party member (Shadow) may leave him at any time except during Phantom Train, and another party member (Gau) has unusual battle mechanic. One of the bosses, Phantom Train, is also very difficult unless you took advantage of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReviveKillsZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReviveKillsZombie">Revive Kills Zombie</a>.</li><li> The fight to defend the Esper in Narshe. You have to split up your 7 characters into 3 different parties, typically putting 2-3 characters per party. You then have to move all three groups to blockade the imperial troops from reaching Banon. The fights are reasonably challenging, depending upon the make-up of each party, but not too bad. What makes it really hard is that the imperial troops keep moving even when control is taken away from the player during battles starting and ending. This makes it pretty hard to heal your characters, or in a worse case scenario, move a party to stop a soldier from reaching Banon (automatic game over). This difficulty could qualify as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew">Interface Screw</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComputerIsACheatingBastard">Computer Is a Cheating Bastard</a>.</li><li> Zozo. Enemies suddenly have enough HP to survive more than one round from you, they begin using magic attacks regularly, and one type of enemy can even use items to heal itself or allies. Another throws weapons at you for a ton of damage. It's also one of the few dungeons to not have a save point.</li><li> The Floating Continent. The random encounters are much stronger than you expect (if the party had trouble beating the Air Force boss they fought earlier, they should get off the continent and start grinding), and on top of that, Ultima Weapon can be surprisingly powerful. Further compounding the problem, should you decide to save, you cannot get off unless you get through the entire dungeon! That's right, the cop out is right before Ultima Weapon, so you still have to fight incredibly difficult random encounters and trudge through the entire dungeon just to get off of the freaking island!</li><li> The GBA/mobile version in general can qualify, if you're used to exploiting some of the better-known bugs of the SNES version. Vanish + Doom and Vanish + X-Zone/Banish doesn't work on bosses anymore. The evade stat works properly so that you can't be nigh unkillable with just magic evade anymore and it also means that enemies can actually dodge your physical attacks since evasion now works. Blind actually works properly and you'll have to deal with it when it pops up.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DinosaursAreDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DinosaursAreDragons">Dinosaurs Are Dragons</a>: People refer to the Dinosaur Forest enemies as dragons. Also, the designs for dinosaurs are used as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">Palette Swaps</a> for actual dragons. They also have some incredible attacks, like Meteor and/or Ultima.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss">Disc-One Final Boss</a>: The recurring boss character in <em>Final Fantasy</em>, Ultima Weapon ("Atma" in the SNES version), shows up for the very first time to block your path to the Imperials on the Floating Continent. It's oddly-erudite, has six limbs, is covered in some kind of metallic tubing, and exhales blue smoke. According to an NPC scholar who specializes in ancient weapons, a number of Ultima Weapons were manufactured during the War of the Magi. One is the sword you find in the Cave to the Sealed Gate; the other is a living weapon bred for destruction. You find another one minding its business in Kefka's Tower, and an optional Omega Weapon (named after the superboss in <em>VIII</em>) waits in the GBA's Dragon's Den.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalDungeon">Disc-One Final Dungeon</a>: The Floating Continent.

Stray Cat alone will carry you up until the Floating Continent. Then there's Quake and Gigavolt; the latter is equivalent to Thundaga which you're not supposed to learn until the second half.

See that page for the examples.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a>: <em>VI</em> has more cut content than perhaps any other entry. A lot of it is still floating around in the ROM's coding. You can <a class="urllink" href="https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VI_dummied_content">read a comprehensive list on the fan wiki<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>; it's super-interesting. The following are pertinent to the article at hand:<ul><li> Unused bosses like the Kaiser Dragon and Colossus. The former is famously still present in the game's coding. He has introductory dialogue, so it's obvious that he was a planned Dragon boss, but no AI script. He would reappear in the GBA remake after you beat the Dragon's Den and slay all of the Dragons again.</li><li> Two events involving Baram and "Clyde" arriving in Thamasa. This indicates that one or more of Shadow's dream sequences was cut.</li><li> A number of character sprites, including Terra in her Esper form, a Merchant from occupied South Figaro, the Ghosts, and General Leo have a <em>complete</em> set of sprite animations like the main party, such as: turning their heads, wagging their fingers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildTake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildTake">wild takes</a>, laughing, and so forth. And they all have sprites for casting magic in battle. The Imp takes the cake: it has a full spritesheet, including a chocobo-riding sprite and <em>a Magitek armor-riding sprite</em> (just like Biggs and Wedge!).</li><li> Leo has a fully-functional sprite for chocobo-riding across the WoB in Mode 7. And if you hack the game (either to include General Leo in your party or simply switch to the alternate color palettes for the characters) during the confrontation on Kefka's Tower, Leo shows up in the cutscene before the final battle, suggesting that he was originally going to be present. There actually is a way to properly recruit Leo into the party (see <a class="urllink" href="http://lparchive.org/Breaking-Final-Fantasy-VI/Update%2013/">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>), though it wasn't intentional on the part of the devs.</li><li> Terra's father Maduin is briefly playable in a flashback to the Easper World. He actually has some set stat levels, as well as a pair of Sprint Shoes. The main menu is disabled during the flashback, so players can't see either of these.</li><li> Four Rages exist in the game that cannot be learned by Gau. Siegfried and Typhon don't appear on the Veldt without a hack. Neither Death Warden or Tonberry can be learned due to a programming error: Death Warden doesn't appear in the enemy arrangements on the Veldt. Tonberry actually <em>can</em> be learned and shows up last on the Rage list, but he can't be selected thanks to a bug which always leave such spaces blank. At least Death Warden was fixed in the Advance version. Tonberry is still unplayable.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonTown">Dungeon Town</a>: This game, next to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em>, contains some of the most prominent examples of this trope. You begin the game stepping on Narshe guards with your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> in the city streets, which culminates with a trip through Narshe's mines. Later on, you are forced to infiltrate an occupied South Figaro as Locke, having to solve some logic puzzles in order to get from the east side of town to the west. Once you pick up Celes, the under works of the town become a traditional combat-oriented dungeon. Sometime afterwards, you have to go to the dangerous and run-down Zozo and deal with armed homeless men and magical prostitutes before dealing with a gang-leader named Dadaluma. And after that, there's Vector, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookBouncer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookBouncer">where guards will be eager to boot you out of the upper part of town</a>. In the World of Ruin, Narshe is all but abandoned, and monsters swarm the streets, and Owzer's House is invaded by a haunted painting...or two.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">Earn Your Happy Ending</a>: Probably one of the kings of this trope, as <em>the world ends halfway through the game.</em> Or at least, it nearly ends. Yet by the time the credits roll, most of the main cast has resolved their core conflicts and can move on with their lives.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthquakesCauseFissures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthquakesCauseFissures">Earthquakes Cause Fissures</a>: The Quake spell makes holes instead of fissures.

In an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">Gameplay and Story Integration</a>, if you force these monsters to run out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Magic Points</a>, they will die.

As long as you are mainly playing the same characters for most of the content (probably Celes, Sabin, and Edgar), not fleeing from battles, generally doing all of the quests and getting all of the chests, there should be enough content in the game to get the main characters into the low to middle 40s, and through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeakedExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeakedExperience">Leaked Experience</a> everyone else into the mid-30s, which is enough to get all the way through Kefka. It will be more challenging (which brings this easy game more into a moderate difficulty), and you will almost certainly need to have at least one character learn Life 3/Rerise, but it's perfectly doable. Of course, with the Esper system encouraging you to learn all of these neat spells, most players will end up with characters more than high enough to make the endgame pretty easy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a>: When the opening narration says "Yet there now stands one who would reawaken the magic of ages past, and use its dread power as a means by which to conquer all the world," watch the bottom right corner of the screen&mdash;you'll catch a brief glimpse of Kefka.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreeFallFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreeFallFight">Free-Fall Fight</a>: When riding the waterfall, and later when fighting the Air Force.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromTheMouthsOfBabes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromTheMouthsOfBabes">From the Mouths of Babes</a>:<ul><li> Locke &amp; co. get some plot-relevant foreshadowing and some pretty clever hints from the rich man's young daughter in South Figaro.</li><li> It's also how Relm <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">shakes Strago out of his brainwashing</span>. <em>"And as foul mouthed as ever."</em></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrothyMugsOfWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrothyMugsOfWater">Frothy Mugs of Water</a>: The Pubs/Bars were changed to Cafes in the SNES version, and in the PS version people still refer to them as cafes but the graphic of the signs has been reverted to say Pub.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyOctopus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyOctopus">Funny Octopus</a>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain">antagonistic but incompetent</a> Ultros/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">Orthros</a> is a large purple octopus prone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">Incredibly Lame Puns</a> and pathetically easy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle">Boss Battles</a>.</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G - I&nbsp;</div><div id="folder2" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">Game-Breaking Bug</a>:<ul><li> The U.S. SNES release has an incredible number of bugs in it. Relm's Sketch ability missing on the wrong monsters can lead to unpleasant side-effects, the worst of which being deletion of save games. However, it can also fill your inventory with zillions of copies of the game's best equipment. Also, killing Doom Gaze with Vanish/X-Zone prevents the boss from dropping the Bahamut magicite because the drop is triggered by a counterattack script and X-Zone and similar abilities prevent counterattacks from being triggered. (Note that it is not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">Permanently Missable</a>, since this also causes the game to fail to mark Doom Gaze as defeated, meaning he'll continue to reappear until you beat him the proper way.)</li><li> There is also a bug where, in the World of Ruin, the player can <em>re-shift</em> the world back to the World of Balance. This is done by abusing a script during the Opera House event where the player doesn't get a game over if they die, they're merely teleported outside. Thus if the player leaves one of the unique rat enemies in the rafters alive until the World of Ruin, then fights them and loses, the script puts them back outside in the World of Balance. Though it does simplify the saving-the-world idea, the player is without an airship and several critical locations no longer exist, including the final dungeon, so the game is pretty much unplayable from then on.</li><li> There's an obscure, but extremely dangerous bug where if the player gets a Game Over 52 consecutive times on the World Map, it will interfere with the game's coding.</li><li> Usually if the game code directs the player character or an NPC to walk along a scripted path, they're also given the temporary ability to pass through any wandering <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPCs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPCs">NP Cs</a> that might get in their way, as the script will not return control to the player until the character reaches their "mark". However, there are a few places where the "pass-through" ability is not granted, and unlucky RNG path-selection for the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPCs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPCs">NP Cs</a> can cause them to block the moving character's path and trap them both, leaving the script unable to exit and the player unable to regain control.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">Gameplay and Story Integration</a>:<ul><li> Before he joins the party in the burning house in Thamasa, Strago and the rest of Thamasa's residents are seen attempting to extinguish the fire using magic.

Doesn't really explain all the special attacks and abilities characters can use that deal magic damage, like Shadow's Skeans, some of Edgar's Tools, and Sabin's Blitzes. While it is feasible that perhaps monsters can still use magic and humans may have minor latent magical abilities (since supernatural things <em>do</em> still exist), that doesn't explain how Gau can somehow gain the ability to use magic by mimicing the behavior of monsters with his Rages, yet once he comes out of it he suddenly forgets.</li><li> The enemy encounters in the secret passages of South Figaro never change, so even though the town has been vacated by the occupying Imperials, troopers and their attack dogs can be encountered in the basements.</li><li> Throughout the game there's a lot of "canned dialogue" for a lot of cutscenes, as the developers likely didn't care or didn't have room to include specific dialogue for every possible character that might be present.

Ultima is traditionally depicted with red trimmings, whereas Omega is blue.</li><li> Ultima Buster, another Weapon which is chilling in Kefka's Tower, made a return appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em>. However, since Ultima and Omega already appeared in that game as unique enemies, "Ultima Buster" uses the same model as a previous boss.</li><li> One of <em>VI</em>'s many hidden enemies, Brachioraidos (a.k.a. Brachiosaur in the Woolsey translation, among other names), is another recurring monster. He hangs around in the woods near the Veldt, which is dubbed the Dinosaur Forest, and it's a good place for leveling. Its appearance always varies wildly, so you likely won't recognize it. But it usually drops a good item like a Hero's Shield, Ribbons, or food for breeding black chocobos in <em>VII</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leitmotif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leitmotif">Leitmotif</a>: One of the earliest examples in video games, where every major character and key events get their own unique themes, with variations remixed into event music.

It is possible to use Odin for all the status buffs/magic learning you want to use, <em>then</em> upgrade it, but it means you miss out on Quick until late in the game. Partially averted in the GBA release with the inclusion of the Gigantuar Esper, who offers a second means of increasing speed.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">My God, What Have I Done?</a>:<ul><li> According to the Esper legend, the Warring Triad experienced a brief moment of clarity when they realized the horror they had brought upon the land, leading to their decision to seal themselves, and their magic, away from the world.</li><li> Gestahl seems to undergo one of these as well.

This can actually work against you, as using one of those weapons against enemies that are immune to instant-death will cause the weapon to activate its instant-death ability every time, which momentarily wipes out the foe, only for it to come back a second later, effectively making it impossible to damage these enemy types with normal attacks if you're using weapons that have a chance to hit with instant-death. One of Cyan's Bushido moves and Relm's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a> will do this too.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneStatToRuleThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneStatToRuleThemAll">One Stat to Rule Them All</a>:<ul><li> Magic is the most important stat, as end-game spells easily outstrip the most powerful weapons, Tools, or Bushido, Sabin's Blitzes mostly base their power on magic.

By the time dual wielding Locke becomes viable, you're probably so overpowered it's almost not funny.</li><li> There's also Magic Evasion in the SNES and PS versions. Due to a bug, the Physical Evade stat is worthless and instead Magic Evasion determines your ability to dodge both physical <em>and</em> magical attacks.

There is also a lot of variety. It has the traditional "major elemental attack" set (Ifrit, Shiva, Ramuh, etc.) and status inflicting ones (Cait Sith, Catoblepas, Phantom, etc.). Then it has a few oddball ones, like Golem, which acts as a physical damage absorbing shield till he runs out of HP, or Quetzalli, which initiates a full party jump attack. You may only get to summon an Esper once per character per battle, but they at least serve more strategic roles than arguably any other game in the series.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalSuicideBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalSuicideBoss">Tactical Suicide Boss</a>: Ymir (also known as Whelk in the SNES and PS versions) in the Narshe mines.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a>: The Genji Glove you can get in the Returner Hideout is far more useful than the Gauntlet you can get as an alternative, but getting the Genji Glove requires you to continually refuse Banon and miss some important plot development. However, if you refuse Banon once and then talk to the Returner walking around in the treasure room where you can get the Air Lancet and the White Cape, he will give you the Genji Glove. You can then go and accept Banon's request, and watch the Returners' strategy meeting.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a>: In the GBA version, a Figaro guard mentions that there were some Kefka worshippers who insist on spelling Kefka's name with "C's," which is both a reference to Kefka's Japanese spelling of his name, as well as poking fun at certain fans who insist on spelling Kefka's name the Japanese way.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeYourTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeYourTime">Take Your Time</a>: Averted in the World of Ruin, where Kefka is not in a hurry himself. Also generally averted in the main plot itself because it's clear that things are happening, but if there isn't a timer on the screen, it's generally a justifiably longer process (military invasion, massive troop movements, etc) that proceeds at the speed of plot, allowing you to level grind.<ul><li> Played straight in WOR Tzen.

He actually manages to plant some seeds of doubt in Locke, causing Celes to become somewhat distant towards him later on. Locke's doubt is helped somewhat by the fact that the infiltration of the Magitek Research Facility was suspiciously easy, and the fact that Celes doesn't immediately try to counter Kefka's arguments, though he later admits that the doubt was "just for a moment".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeLinesSomeWaiting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeLinesSomeWaiting">Three Lines, Some Waiting</a>: Early in the game, Locke goes to South Figaro to stall the Empire, and later when going through the Lethe river Sabin is separated from the party.

The in-game tutorial says "Choose Blitz, press the Control Pad left, right, left, then press the A button!" While technically correct, the game fails to mention that you're supposed to input the command while an otherwise innocuous arrow is pointing at Sabin. Most new players will try instead to press A while the arrow's up (since the arrow is usually the means to select the target character of a given action), then hastily input the Blitz, which is already way too late. The game will never try to correct your timing even after dozens of failed attempts, so naturally, many players just think they haven't inputted the button combination fast enough.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoHeadedCoin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoHeadedCoin">Two-Headed Coin</a>: Used against Setzer <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and in Edgar &amp; Sabin's backstory to guarantee the former the throne and the latter his freedom</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncommonTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncommonTime">Uncommon Time</a>: The final movement of "Dancing Mad" alternates mostly between 4/4 and 7/8, although a few measures are in 2/2.

One should also ask how three men are sharing a single diving helmet.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaterSourceTampering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaterSourceTampering">Water Source Tampering</a>: Early in the game, Kefka does this to the village of Doma.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a>: Kefka's "Light of Judgment". Magitek Armor's basic attacks are elemental versions of this. Air Force and a couple other mooks use the Wave Cannon attack, a Lightning-based attack.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhammyBid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhammyBid">Whammy Bid</a>: In the Auction House, if the kid wants something, expect his father to pull this off.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a>:<ul><li> The Esper Cave and the events on the Floating Continent.</li><li> And before that, Kefka killing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">General Leo.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a>:<ul><li> You could easily be forgiven for wondering this about Siegfried.</li><li> Banon and Arvis are nowhere to be found in the World of Ruin. It's likely they were killed when the world was demolished, or by Gestahl if they were still in Vector when he dropped the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a> facade. The fact that Locke and Edgar, who have been friends with them since many years before the start of the game, seemingly <em>forget they ever existed</em> is rather inexplicable, though.</li><li> Vargas is another possibility. While it's likely he was killed in his only appearance, he didn't have the usual death animation of most enemies. Nonetheless, he's never seen nor mentioned again after that.</li><li> The lone Doma sentry who splits up from Cyan to help him search for survivors after the castle's water supply gets poisoned by Kefka. He's never seen or heard from again after the Imperial withdrawal from Doma or the World of Ruin.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a>: In Locke's backstory, he was too slow to keep Rachel from falling down a cliff during their cave exploration, which led to her contracting amnesia. Rachel's father and the Kohlingen citizens understandably called out Locke on this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim">Why Don't You Just Stab Him?</a>: Averted in a rare heroic example by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar">Celes</a>, who rather practically <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">stabs Kefka while his back is turned right before he destroys the world</span>. Unfortunately it wasn't a fatal blow.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox">Wide Open Sandbox</a>: The entire World of Ruin, after you get the airship, is nothing but voluntary character-centric <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidequest">sidequests</a>, which was a really big deal at the time. It fits the plot of the game at that point, as all that's left is Kefka's tower, but you need to find your allies to stand a chance.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolfMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolfMan">Wolf Man</a>: Lone Wolf the Pickpocket, and a few Espers.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WombLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WombLevel">Womb Level</a>: The Zone Eater's Belly. Kind of. The place isn't very organic, since it looks the same as any other cave and features the most random of enemies, like ninjas, dancers, frogs, thieves, demons, cursed samurai, and even flying zombies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds</a>: It's hinted that Kefka doesn't destroy because he finds it fun, but because he's so insane from Magitek experiments corroding his mind that he can't feel love and friendship anymore, and now causing death and destruction is the only thing that can make him happy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsJustAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsJustAwesome">The World Is Just Awesome</a>: The Ending sequence.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldSundering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldSundering">World Sundering</a>: World of Ruin. "On that day, the world was changed forever...".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Wretched Hive</a>: Zozo, a town far up in the rainy mountains where corpses and garbage rot in the streets, and there are actually random encounters, both indoors and outside, and even an end boss.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wutai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wutai">Wutai</a>: The Kingdom of Doma is a technologically simplistic yet respectable nation guarded by samurai like Cyan. Later on, there's the Ancient Castle, where the ghosts of long-gone Samurai warriors can be encountered in random battles, along with the eastern-looking Blue Dragon and the recurring summoned character Odin making an appearance.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YeOldeButcheredeEnglishe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YeOldeButcheredeEnglishe">Ye Olde Butcherede Englishe</a>: Cyan in the US version. It's fixed up in the GBA version. Really well, too. His thee/thou differentiation is accurate most of the time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNumberSix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNumberSix">You Are Number 6</a>: Two bosses in the Magitek Lab, both presumably Magitek creations of Cid.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveWaitedLongEnough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveWaitedLongEnough">You Have Waited Long Enough</a>: Part of the Opera play.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourPrincessIsInAnotherCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourPrincessIsInAnotherCastle">Your Princess Is in Another Castle!</a>: Before disc changing became a norm, the Floating Continent gave all the signs of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">The Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a>. All the empty spaces in the menus and the entire other side of the map packed in the game usually give it away, though.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroEffortBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroEffortBoss">Zero-Effort Boss</a>:<ul><li> In the SNES version, due to a programming error, casting Vanish and then either Doom or X-zone will instantly kill the enemy.</li><li> In the battle aboard the Phantom Train, Ziegfried only has 100 HP and will die in one attack. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, as Ziegfried had been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilesGloriosus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilesGloriosus">talking about</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">how good a swordsman he is</a> just before the fight.
