The game was released in Japan on March 26, 2016 for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxOne">Xbox One</a> and PC, with an international release on April 12th. The first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DLC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DLC">DLC</a>, titled <em>Ashes of Ariandel</em> was released on October 25, 2016. The second and final, <em>The Ringed City</em>, was released on March 28, 2017.</p><p>Long after the events of the first two games, the First Flame is once again fading, and as before, the Undead are rising from their graves. A bell awakens the Lords of Cinder, individuals who in past ages had successfully linked the fire in the hope that they will do it again and prolong the Age of Fire. However, for various reasons, all but one of the Lords refuse to fulfill their duty.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>You take the role of an Unkindled, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnchosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnchosenOne">a nameless accursed undead unfit to even be cinder</a>. In this purgatory abandoned by lords, it falls to you to take the souls of those once great heirs of fire... to either link the flames yourself, or bring the world to its final end. And so it is that ash seeketh embers.</p><p>Gameplay is a "best of" the mechanics from the previous <em>Souls</em> games and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne">Bloodborne</a></em>. Combat borrows heavily from the first <em>Dark Souls</em>, including many of the player animations, though some features from <em>Dark Souls II</em> return, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkillPointReset" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkillPointReset">Skill Point Reset</a> items and optional voice chat. Co-op and invasions work similarly to how they did in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls">Demon's Souls</a></em> and <em>Dark Souls</em>, using soul level range rather than the soul memory system from <em>Dark Souls II</em> but with an added adjustment based on how far the player's weapons have been upgraded. Mechanics from <em>Bloodborne</em> include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargedAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargedAttack">chargeable heavy attacks</a>, faster, more aggressive combat, and a weapon dependent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StanceSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StanceSystem">Stance System</a>. <em>Dark Souls III</em> also replaces the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VancianMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VancianMagic">Vancian Magic</a> system from the previous games with a "Focus Meter", a la the Magic Meter from <em>Demon's Souls</em>. Lastly, every weapon in the game has a "Weapon Art" that gives the wielder a unique attack, from shieldbreaking uppercuts with the swords to rushing stabs with spears. More unique weapons also have their own Weapon Arts, and all arts also draw from the Focus Meter. The Focus Meter itself can be replenished from a unique Ashen Estus Jar, forcing the player to divide up their healing if they wish to have access to a wider variety of useful methods of engagement.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Previews: <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RAlGv-IW4g">Only Embers Remain<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VxP-r1ZqQI">The Fire Fades<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhxngUz6C3U">Darkness Has Spread<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGllLbkIct4">Opening Cinematic<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic4EHyRm_Tw">DLC #1 Announcement Trailer<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezosSMzPdNQ">DLC #2 Announcement Trailer<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></p><hr><h1><em>Dark Souls III</em> contains examples of:</h1><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A-D&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbdicateTheThrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbdicateTheThrone">Abdicate the Throne</a>: The Lords of Cinder, with the exception of Ludleth. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> To be specific, the Abyss Watchers and Yhorm do so by accident, Aldrich and Lothric willingly.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob">Aerith and Bob</a>: The names in the game vary from exotic, like Greirat, Leonhard, or Sirris to familiar ones like Andre or Emma.

At the end of all your struggles, if you choose to link the First Flame once more, the flame is so weakened that it barely even covers your character, and you simply sit down quietly as the screen fades to black. The implication is that you're only pointlessly delaying the inevitable, and your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> is a completely futile effort</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">Anti-Frustration Features</a>:<ul><li> In <em>really</em> out-of-the-way places, there is usually a Homeward Bone or two lying on a body. This is so you don't have to teleport out using the Darksign and lose your souls if you're in no shape to continue on. Near the start of the endgame, you can also pick up an item called the Coiled Sword Fragment, which works just like the Aged Feather from <em>Dark Souls II</em>.</li><li> Using a Homeward Bone or the Coiled Sword Fragment gives you the choice of either warping back to the Firelink Shrine bonfire or the last bonfire you rested at.</li><li> Returning from <em>II</em>, resting at a bonfire repairs your weapons to full, making constant trips to a blacksmith no longer necessary unless you break them. However, the rate of weapon degradation is much slower, closer to what it was in the first game, which means you'll virtually never be forced to swap. The only time you might actually risk weapon breakage is if you overuse a weapon that loses durability with a special attack. Additionally, repair powder to restore durability is much more accessible, being available in basically unlimited quantities more or less from the beginning of the game and costing 600 souls as opposed to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII">Dark Souls II</a></em>'s 2500.</li><li> Homeward Bones now activate <em>much</em> faster than they used to.</li><li> Some enemies will occasionally give extra doses of Estus upon death, alleviating the need to constantly backtrack to a bonfire to refill the Estus Flask.</li><li> You don't need to play online in order to get the covenant rewards, as some enemies in the world will have the covenant items as a rare drop. Granted, that presents its own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemFarming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemFarming">headaches</a>, but it's better than being locked out of the covenants due to poor internet connection.</li><li> Combat items such as Firebombs and Throwing Knives have stat scaling, just like in <em>Bloodborne</em>.</li><li> You can toggle whether or not certain consumable items (throwing knives, homeward bones, bolt/arrows, etc.) will refill when you rest at a bonfire.</li><li> Picking up special ashes in endgame areas allows the player to buy the high-end crafting materials<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1a8id');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1a8id" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1a8id');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">such as Titanite Scales or Twinkling Titanite</span> in unlimited quantities, as long as you pony up the souls required. There are also 8 Titanite Slabs per playthrough, with three more in the first DLC area, as opposed to 1. There are also 4 Titanite Slabs in the second DLC, resulting a total of 15 Titanite Slabs per playthrough. This is better than the old systems, where you'd be lucky to upgrade more than one or two weapons to 10+ per playthrough.</li><li> For players without online access, NPC summon signs are available for many more boss fights than the first game (though not quite as many as the second). This is especially useful for mage builds, allowing the phantom to keep the boss busy while you pelt it with magic.</li><li> Titanite from Crystal Lizards now appears in the inventory directly, as it did in the original game but not the second. This means no more lost Twinkling Titanite because it ran off a cliff or you died before picking it up.</li><li> Unlike <em>II</em>, where merchants willing to buy your spare crap were as rare as hen's teeth, you have reliable access to a merchant who will pay for Broken Straight Swords, pairs of Deserter's Trousers and suchlike from the moment you gain access to Firelink Shrine.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcSymbol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcSymbol">Arc Symbol</a>: In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls">Demon's Souls</a></em> we had fog and demons, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsI">Dark Souls</a></em> had fire and darkness, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII">Dark Souls II</a></em> had memory and cycles, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne">Bloodborne</a></em> had blood, eyes, and dreams/madness. This game's symbols are embers/cinder, ash and ice.<ul><li> The DLC also contains their own symbols, with frost and rot for <em>Ashes of Ariandel</em>, and rings and blood for <em>The Ringed City</em>.</li><li> Many powerful bosses will wield flaming swords. All of the Lords of Cinder, for instance, will wield some sort of flaming weapon midway into their boss fight.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance">Artificial Brilliance</a>:<ul><li> Certain enemies have unique moves that prevent you from fishing for backstabs. For example, shield-wielding enemies will try to anticipate your movement and will use a backwards shield bash to knock you away.

Even casters can get some good use out of it thanks to the low stat requirements. The Knight starts the game with one in hand, but the Hollow soldiers in Lothric's first area also drop them semi-frequently.

Amongst players it's not unknown to call him "Parry God Hodrick" since he will use his Sunset Shield to great effect parrying both players and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sirris</span>, followed by landing highly damaging ripostes. When summoning him in Crucifixion Woods, his cheating can be especially <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JusForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JusForFun/Egregious">Egregious</a> as he has a massive health pool and deals at least two to three times as much damage as a regular phantom should at that level; it's very common for players (as well as phantoms and invaders) to get parried by Hodrick while trying to whittle him down, and then get riposted from full health to zero in a single attack.</li><li> Knight Slayer Tsorig is another case of this. Even if he's wielding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">the Fume Ultra Greatsword</a>, he still hits tremendously hard with it, far more so than a player could with the same weapon; it isn't unheard of for Tsorig to kill a fully healthy player in two hits. And like Hodrick, if he manages to land a riposte on the player (likely from breaking their guard with an attack), it will most often bring them from full health straight down to zero instantly.</li><li> Wearing the Obscuring Ring makes you invisible from a distance, but only to other players &mdash; AI enemies can still spot you, including AI phantoms. This can make the invasion against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Leonhard</span> especially ridiculous, as he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRulesAreNotYourRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRulesAreNotYourRules">wears the same ring himself</a>. Conversely though, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Slave Knight Gael</span> can still spot <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Blackflame Friede</span> whenever she goes invisible.</li><li> Desert Pyromancer Zoey from <em>The Ringed City</em> has a lot of tricks up her sleeve, owing to being a hostile NPC in the final DLC of the series. All she has is a Pyromancy Flame and a Whip, the latter of which is normally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeWeapon">Joke Weapon</a> when wielded by any player character. Except that if she connects with any of her attacks, including with that whip, they'll deal an absurd amount of damage, far more than what would normally be possible. Fortunately, unlike Hodrick she doesn't have a huge health pool or a weapon capable of riposting, so defeating her is quite manageable.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityPorn">Continuity Porn</a>: There are a few nods here and there to <em>Dark Souls II</em>, but the vast majority of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call Backs</a> are to the first <em>Dark Souls</em> &mdash; and there are a <em>lot</em> of them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolButInefficient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolButInefficient">Cool, but Inefficient</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingAShadow">Dark builds</a> in the vanilla game.

The only weapon with innate Dark damage is the Dark Hand, which is good <em>despite</em> its element rather than because of it - for everything else you need to use Dark Blade (which is outclassed by Lightning Blade), or infusions (which are hard to use effectively). Finally, Dark damage follows the same damage formula for the much more flexible Fire damage. The only reason to use it over Fire is if the enemy in question resists Fire but not Dark. Averted by the DLC areas, however - <em>Ashes of Ariendel</em> adds the powerful Onyx Blade and a boss weak to Dark, while <em>The Ringed City</em> adds several powerful Dark weapons, some of which can be buffed or infused, the Blindfold Mask which increases all Dark damage, and the first boss of the area is weak to the element.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword">Cool Sword</a>: All over the place, as is usual for <em>Dark Souls.</em></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorridorCubbyholeRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorridorCubbyholeRun">Corridor Cubbyhole Run</a>: There's a couple of skeleton ball boulders in the Catacombs of Carthus that you'll have to do this with.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a>: Though the world of <em>Dark Souls</em> has never been very cheerful in the times of the games, this game takes it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>.

As for the NPC's who show up, Lothric is described as a "transitory land" where the lands of the various Lords of Cinder converge, and time is pretty weird, meaning that, for example, killing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gwyndolin</span> in the first game isn't incompatible with his appearance here.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory">Damn You, Muscle Memory!</a>: A big problem for many new players of the PS4 version coming off of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne">Bloodborne</a></em>.

On some weapons, however, the name is slightly different, to accommodate for character limits and/or awkward naming. For instance, infusing the Dark Sword with a Dark Gem will cause it to be called the "Reinforced Dark Sword" instead of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment">Dark Dark Sword</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">Disc-One Nuke</a>:<ul><li> A downplayed version of this, the very first Mimic you encounter (on the High Wall) will yield a Deep Battle Axe. This weapon will reliably enable players in the early game to easily do 200+ damage long before they can make similar weapons or even be able to reinforce non-elemental weapons to that level of damage.

Infusing it into a weapon will make it deal fire damage, which is powerful against both the Starved Hounds and the terrifying Pus of Man enemies. It doesn't scale with stats, but it's passable against all enemies until fairly late in the game, and by then you can switch it out for something that does.<ul><li> Not scaling with stats is part of what makes both of these weapons almost specifically Disk One Nukes. Infusions that don't scale, but instead have high base power, which make them ideal for characters that only have the stats to equip the weapon and not much more... like just about any starting character would.</li></ul></li><li> Also in the High Wall, the Astora Straight Sword. Normally a relatively below-average weapon, it takes to the Raw Infusion oddly well, trading its mediocre scaling for a very impressive damage boost (around 25% instead of the usual 15%), to the point it is on par with or even better than most early game <em>greatswords</em> in terms of damage, while being much lighter and faster.

Enemies are <em>far</em> more aggressive and damaging across the board, with even common hollow soldiers easily capable of killing you in 2-3 blows at most, and while your stamina and doging ability have been jacked up to let you counter this, this will require a significant shift in combat style for series veterans as they adapt to the more <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne">Bloodborne</a></em>-esque combat style.

As moving through swamps is slow even while rolling, the dagger is more commonly used to move through swamps than to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">actually attack,</a> as the quickstep is easily spammable and is not hampered by the swamp at all.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHandedZweihander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHandedZweihander">One-Handed Zweih&auml;nder</a>: As ever, you can one-hand greatswords and the like if you have enough strength. The Farron Greatsword is particularly notable: it <em>can't</em> be two-handed because the button to two-hand it instead draws the parrying dagger, allowing you to use the jumpy, flippy, spinny combat style of the Undead Legion. While wielding a sword as long as you are tall in one hand.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a>:<ul><li> The Pus of Man-infected enemies erupt into serpentine monsters of the Abyss.</li><li> The increasingly difficult three-phase boss fight against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sister Friede</span> in the <em>Ashes of Ariandel</em> DLC is the perhaps the greatest qualifier of all bosses in the Souls series to date.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanedEtymology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanedEtymology">Orphaned Etymology</a>: The Braille Divine Tomes are a particularly egregious case. While the development of a tactile writing system in a medieval fantasy setting is explainable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> (the Way of White religion venerates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindSeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindSeer">Blind Seers</a>, so naturally they'd develop a writing system they could understand), the name of the writing system, which is derived from the surname of a 19th century French educator from our world, most certainly is <em>not</em>. The Japanese version simply calls them "dot-writing" tomes. That said, similar to <em>Bloodborne</em> using Hippocratic Oath, the translators probably went with a term that Western audiences were familiar with.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">Permanently Missable Content</a>: There's a pretty significant amount of content that you'll lose forever just because you advanced too far in the game without finding it:<ul><li> Once Yoel of Londor has given you five Dark Sigils, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he dies</span>, and Yuria takes his place. This happens anyway when you reach the Catacombs of Carthus, except Yuria never shows up, so you'll lose access to her wares, her questline, the Londor Pale Shade's assistance at certain bosses, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">one of the game's endings</span>.</li><li> Similar to the above, it is possible to fail Yuria's quest by doing certain things to either anger her or foil her plans, but one of the more inadvertent ways involves Anri of Astora. When you encounter Anri in the Catacombs of Carthus, you learn that she/he is searching for Horace, who got separated from her/him; it's possible to find Horace farther down in Smouldering Lake, only he's turned hollow and will attack the player on sight. If the player doesn't kill Horace, and later sends Anri to his location, she/he will be forced to put him down, and then end up hollow her/himself, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">denying the player a spouse as well as the final three Dark Sigils necessary for the Usurpation of Fire ending</span>.</li><li> Orbeck of Vinheim, in exchange for teaching you sorceries, demands that you find him knowledge (meaning, give him scrolls to let him teach you more spells). Normally this is relatively easy to accomplish since it's possible to pick up at least two scrolls in the area immediately after encountering him, if one explores thoroughly enough. However, failing to give him even a single scroll before defeating four bosses will cause him to leave Lothric for the remainder of the playthrough. This not only denies the player the ability to become an effective sorcerer, but also any gifts he may give the player, prevents him from coming to the player's aid for the second-last boss of the game, as well as locking out an extra weapon that can be obtained after Orbeck's death.</li><li> The Mound-Makers covenant has two methods of joining, both of which are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">obscure</a> and easy to lock yourself out of permanently. The first involves talking to two NPCs that are identical to enemies, and becomes impossible as soon as you try to fight the Curse-Rotted Greatwood. The second is to reach the end of Sirris's questline, and that becomes unavailable if you've offered a Pale Tongue to Rosaria to deepen your allegiance to her covenant.</li><li> Speaking of Sirris and Hodrick, completing Sirris's questline involves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBranching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBranching">breaking a part of Rosaria's</a>. In order to get the "Proper Bow" gesture, one must defeat Yellowfinger Heysel when she invades the player, offer at least one Pale Tongue to level up at the Rosaria's Fingers covenant, and then summon Heysel as a white phantom at the Abyss Watchers fight. However, offering that Pale Tongue will anger Sirris, causing her to disappear for the rest of that playthrough; completing Sirris's questline requires staying on her good graces until at least Aldrich, who is encountered well after Abyss Watchers. Thus, it will be impossible to obtain both "Proper Bow" and the Silvercat Ring and Hodrick's armor set and shield in the same playthrough.</li><li> Greirat of the Undead Settlement's questline can be tricky to finish. After taking the time to find him and release him from his cell in High Wall of Lothric, and then finding Loretta in the Undead Settlement, he can be sent out to pillage goods to expand his merchant stock. Only, on his second pillaging journey, it's quite possible for him to fail to make it back alive, and the only way to save him involves either a specific order of events involving Unbreakable Patches, or advancing Siegward of Catarina's questline up to a certain point but no further. Fumbling either of these (which in and of themselves can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> moments) will deny players the chance to send Greirat on his final pillaging journey in Lothric Castle, and thus additional wares.</li><li> The Symbol of Avarice can be lost if the player kills every mimic without finding the helm. This isn't likely given the drop rate of the item compared to the number of mimics, but is still possible. The player will need to go through New Game + for another shot.</li><li> NPC invasions stop happening if you defeat the boss of the area, taking their items with them. For example, if you haven't killed Longfinger Kirk on the ground floor of the Cathedral of the Deep by the time you take out the Deacons, that will lock you out of the Barbed Straight Sword and Armour of Thorns set.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalNetwork">Portal Network</a>: Like in <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>Dark Souls II</em>, bonfires can be used to teleport. Unlike in <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>Dark Souls II</em>, bonfire teleporting is required to travel between Firelink and the rest of the world, as Firelink is disconnected from the main world a'la the Nexus in <em>Demon's Souls</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice">Power at a Price</a>: The "Stomp" Weapon Art on some weapons involves the player poising through their opponent's attack without getting stunned for the chance of trading with much more damage.<ul><li> A more straightforward example is the Power Within pyromancy.

The Shrine Handmaid notes that they must be the ashes of someone "most foolish".</li><li> Similarily, the description of the Calamity Ring states that it "has no useful powers, and is merely a symbol of dragon worship, a thing quietly passed down amongst its most fervent adherents, some of whom become convinced the task has been bestowed upon them as a sacred duty", seemingly poking fun at players who use it just to make the game harder.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeSongReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeSongReveal">Theme Song Reveal</a>: Some of the bosses have themes which reveal big lore and character implications.<ul><li> The Abyss Watchers theme has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a bell ringing in the background.

Making the effect even more pronounced and confusing, the Untended Graves and the Cemetery of Ash, and their related Firelinks, <em>share the exact same player messages and bloodstains</em>. If you die to Champion Gundyr, you can actually go back to the <em>Iudex</em> arena to retrieve your souls! It's best summed up that the Untended Graves is reality, where Gundyr failed the linking of fire and the first flame went out. Ludleth then created a time loop that the main game takes place in and became a Lord of Cinder to give everyone a little more time (evidenced by the Handmaid recognizing you and the souls trick, which shows the main game occurs after the Untended Graves). The Dreg Heap and final boss occur at the very end of the time loop, right before Ludleth's linking wears off.</span></li><li> Archdragon Peak adds another dimension to the confusion. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> There, the sun is always bright and hale unless the storm is raging, whereas in the main area of the game it may be bleeding darkness or even wholly consumed by the dark.

Additional weapons will also now appear on your player character even when not in use.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VolcanicVeins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VolcanicVeins">Volcanic Veins</a>:<ul><li> The Lords of Cinder have these, along with a flaming weapon to emphasis their status as true Lords of Cinder.</li><li> Using an Ember item will give you Lord of Cinder status and cause these to appear on your character model, at least while you're wearing armor.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss">Wake-Up Call Boss</a>: This time as early as the <em>first boss</em>! Iudex Gundyr is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> that can easily punish fresh players for timing their rolls incorrectly, using up their stamina and getting greedy when there is a sudden break in the fight. It also serves as this in terms of showing that there are two phases to nearly every boss fight, which brings a new pattern to learn and is often more damaging than the first.<ul><li> The Abyss Watchers can be this as well, seeing how they are the first Lord of Cinder encountered. They are <em>more</em> of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> than Gundyr, and has the addition of having a multitude of damaging combos that has fire buff later on, no start up time that allows a player a good few hits in before the fight starts and having another health bar after the first one is depleted, meaning an unprepared player can easily risk running out of estus before the fight even is halfway over.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a>: The sorcery Soul Stream, which is one of the most damaging spells in the game, but also has the longest wind up of any spell.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakSauceWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakSauceWeakness">Weak Sauce Weakness</a>: Some enemies react very poorly to fire, and spend a good deal of time writhing in pain instead of trying to hit the player. The prime example are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WormThatWalks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WormThatWalks">maggot creatures</a> near the Cathedral of the Deep, where having a torch out is enough to get rid of maggots burrowing into your skin and hitting the gross beasts will stop them from attacking. The Hollows with the giant black monsters coming out of their back is another one.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfXSlaying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfXSlaying">Weapon of X-Slaying</a>: A few weapons do more damage to certain types of enemies than others.<ul><li> The Hollowslayer Greatsword transposed from the Curse-rotted Greatwood's soul <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">specifically the part of it embodying Lucatiel's own fear and hatred of going Hollow which became one of the curses sealed in the tree</span> does extra damage to Hollow enemies. This encompasses the rank and file Hollows all the way to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the bosses of both DLC expansions.</span></li><li> The Black Knight weapons were wielded by knights tasked with slaying the chaos demons of Lost Izalith and thus do more damage to demons. There aren't many demons left by the time this game takes place, but the ones who are still around are formidable enough that having these weapons handy is a good idea. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Particularly when fighting against the Demon Prince.</span></li><li> The Abyss Watchers dedicated themselves to hunting the Abyss. As a result, both of the weapons that can be transposed from their Soul of the Blood of the Wolf, namely their signature Farron Greatsword <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and the greatsword of their inspiration Artorias</span> do more damage to the creatures of the Abyss. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This includes one of the most powerful bosses in the game, Darkeater Midir.</span></li><li> Some weapons fit this lore-wise but in gameplay just inflict a damage type said enemy is weak against. The Lothric Knight Greatsword for example has item lore stating it was forged for dragon hunting, but rather than doing extra damage to dragons specifically it is simply imbued with lightning since dragons are vulnerable to lightning.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdSun">Weird Sun</a>: It gets progressively weirder as the game progresses. At first it appears normal, albeit hidden behind clouds. After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killing the first three Lords of Cinder</span>, it becomes black with a ring of fire around it, as if undergoing a total eclipse, and the sky turns red. Finally, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> arena, the eclipse effect is even more pronounced, and the sun appears to be <em>bleeding fire</em> down to the ground. In this last form, it looks eerily like the Darksign itself...<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And in the Usurp the Fire ending, when you've claimed both the Dark Soul and the First Flame, it turns into a giant Humanity sprite.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a>: Irithyll of the Boreal Valley. Not only do you meet the Pontiff of the religion you've been fighting for the first half of the game <em>and</em> enter the city that's been whispered about and built up for this long, you also eventually discover <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the ruins of Anor Londo, and it's revealed that Aldrich's title of "Devourer of the Gods" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHyperbole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHyperbole">isn't hyperbole</a> as he's found wielding poor Gwyndolin's upper half as a weapon.</span><ul><li> Everything from Lothric Castle onward if you did it in the correct order (i.e. not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking">Sequence Breaking</a> by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killing Emma to summon the Dancer of the Boreal Valley</span>).
