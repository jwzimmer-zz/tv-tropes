It's also an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HGame">eroge</a>, though the explicit content is a small part of the overall game and can be disabled if the player so chooses.</p><p>Hisao Nakai, an ordinary teenager living an ordinary life, has it turned upside down when a congenital heart defect forces him to attend a new school after a long stay in the hospital. Despite his initial feelings of alienation and difficulty fitting in, Hisao comes to befriend his new classmates while pursuing a romantic relationship with one of the five girls he has class with.</p><p>Contrary to what that synopsis would suggest, the game is much more thoughtful and mature than it initially lets on. The subject matter is handled very tastefully, with Hisao's newfound friends not only being complex and engaging, but also challenging the stereotypes associated with their disabilities. In broader terms, the game actively deconstructs the more implausible and unsavory cliches associated with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingSim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingSim">Dating Sim</a> genre. Special care is taken to defy the stock character archetypes that regularly crop in anime, instead portraying Hisao and his friends as flawed, impetuous young people with relatable fears and struggles. Instead of being shallow escapism, the end result is a well-written coming-of-age drama with self-acceptance as a central theme. "Katawa" [&#29255;&#36650;] is actually a Japanese word meaning "imperfect" or literally, "one wheel" (not a polite word to use, it has about the same connotations as "crippled." See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntentionallyAwkwardTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntentionallyAwkwardTitle">Intentionally Awkward Title</a> below). The concept is based entirely on a <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181206202207im_/http://shimmie.katawa-shoujo.com/image/1.jpg">single-page<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusMaterial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusMaterial">omake</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doujinshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doujinshi">doujinshi</a> artist RAITA (aka the character designer for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles">Valkyria Chronicles</a></em>).

The game takes place at the fictional Yamaku High School for disabled teenagers, and all the main characters have some sort of disability, including <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_QT_syndrome">Long QT Syndrome<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (the hero, Hisao).</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>A demo of the game, titled "Act 1", was released in May 2009, and covers the entire first Act of the final game, before it branches to paths specific to each girl. It proved popular and was eventually translated into eight languages (English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Russian, and both simplified and traditional Chinese). The full version <a class="urllink" href="http://katawa-shoujo.com/">(also free of charge)<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was finally released January 4th, 2012, on the fifth anniversary of the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/FourChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/FourChan">4chan</a> thread that started the game's development.</p><p>The characters also make an appearance in the fanmade Flash game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KatawaCrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KatawaCrash">Katawa Crash</a></em>, an irreverent, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a>-filled remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NanacaCrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NanacaCrash">NANACA&#134;CRASH!!</a></em> made while the VN was in the late stages of development.

It was originally set to be released on February 14th, with the cast being unveiled every two days, but this was been pushed back until all the minor characters of Act 1 were unveiled, meaning that the release date was constantly pushed back.

Kenji seems to believe this is the case but in truth, great responsibility doesn't come with great power at Yamaku. The local student council has to perform a superhuman amount of tasks for the school festival, but can't seem to get the rest of the student body to take part of it off their hands. Might be different if the student council wasn't so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClubStub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClubStub">understaffed</a>.</li><li> It's revealed in Shizune's route that the Student Council is so small because of her attempts to <em>play this straight</em>. Before she became President, the Student Council was quite larger, but didn't actually <em>do</em> anything aside from hand out mail and surveys. Shizune attempted to get the Student Council to take on significantly more responsibility, but ended up driving off everyone but Misha due to her abrasive methods.

Implying that she does have romantic feelings for him, but he never notices and she isn't going to say anything about it.

How much of this is deliberate and how much is just lack of research is impossible to say.<ul><li> In one instance, Hisao orders (and receives) a turkey sandwich at the Shanghai, which is treated as unremarkable. Turkey is largely unavailable in Japan outside specialty shops that cater to foreigners, and most Japanese who haven't been outside the country have rarely, if ever, had a chance to try it.</li><li> Another case is the date of Tanabata, which may have been moved for the sake of the plot (After all, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">7/7</a>, right? That's before first-term finals!). In fact, Tanabata is celebrated from August 6-8 in Sendai (and much of the Tohoku region), after the start of summer vacation. On the other hand, Tohoku celebrating Tanabata at unusual time isn't all that common knowledge even in Japan.</li><li> With rare exceptions, the characters tend to address each other by their given name alone, whereas normally in Japan one would address someone by their surname plus an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseHonorifics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseHonorifics">honorific</a> (unless they're <em>very</em> well-acquainted). The writers worked around this with the girls asking for more informality, but it's still odd if you are used to stories set in Japan. This is probably a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention">Translation Convention</a> resulting from the development team's effort to avoid "anime-isms". Similarly, characters address their older siblings by first name, rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseSiblingTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseSiblingTerminology">Japanese Sibling Terminology</a> or any equivalent.</li><li> In Lilly's path, she, Hisao and Hanako talk about distances using the Imperial units. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lilly's mother hails from the UK</span>, but that wouldn't explain Hisao and Hanako being so familiar with them.</li><li> The sign language taught at Yamaku and used by Shizune and Misha would presumably be <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_sign_language">Japanese Sign Language<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, which naturally has signs corresponding to Japanese kana. Despite this, when Misha tutors Hisao, she begins with the Latin alphabet as if it were a Western sign language like ASL. It's possible that this is just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention">Translation Convention</a>, but it's still a little jarring.</li><li> In Act 1, Misha takes Hisao's "maybe" answer to her invitation to join the Student Council with a measure of relief, as she sees it as better than him refusing, whereas <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapanesePoliteness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapanesePoliteness">Japanese often say "maybe" rather than outright refusing</a> (although Misha is typically unable to grasp subtle social cues). However, Hisao ultimately does not join the Student Council in four out of the five routes, and in Shizune's, he points out that he did not wish to do so at first.</li><li> "French vanilla tea"? This is tacky by Western standards, but in Japan, where green tea is the norm, it sounds downright implausible.</li><li> Hugging friends is a rather American thing to do. Europeans do not typically do that unless they are lovers, and the Japanese even less.</li><li> Hisao shakes hands with some characters on first meeting, and Rin jokes about not being able to do so. While hand-shaking is not an unknown custom in Japan, most people bow instead.</li><li> The game's characters seem to be more familiar with chess than shogi, despite the latter being much more common in Japan. When you learn Hanako mostly plays chess with Lilly, it seems plausible that Lilly learned the game from her Scottish family and taught it to Hanako, but it doesn't really make sense for anyone else.

These comments can just as easily apply to some of her fans.<ul><li> While Hanako's path was intended from the very beginning to drop this trope on the player (according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>), Rin's can also be interpreted similarly. If you really give it some thought, you will realize very quickly that from the very moment you first meet her, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it's incredibly obvious that something is off about Rin's behavior. But she's just so charming, isn't she? Her quirkiness is just so adorable, it's probably just a sign of true intelligence!. And then you go, and, as Hisao, push her further and further into insanity <em>despite her constant (in the beginning) objections and the fact that she obviously isn't interested</em>, because <em>she's so smart and cute, right?</em> One of the endings implies that she'll <em>kill herself</em> because of the "lessons" you taught her</span>.</li><li> Somewhat less dramatically, the typical path to Shizune's route requires you, as Hisao, to act like a bit of a bastard towards most of the other girls. First Hisao can't make too many choices that are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">friendly to Lilly or Hanako</span>, culminating with him getting caught in the middle of an argument between Shizune and Lilly where he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(unintentionally) insults Lilly right after she had just defended him to Shizune</span>. Then, if Hisao has persisted in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">exercising with Emi in the mornings</span> while also pursuing Shizune's path, a day will come when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Emi invites him to lunch with her, even promising to make his lunch for him, and he accepts her offer. Later that morning, though, Shizune also invites him to lunch that same day. Hisao <em>must</em> accept Shizune's invitation in order to reach her path, and if he does accept then Shizune drags him off immediately, which means that Emi gets stood up with no warning and no apology after she asked him out first, offered to treat, and did all the work of preparing a nice lunch</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair">You Gotta Have Blue Hair</a>: The hair colors, while a little too various for what is at least nominally a Japanese school, tend to remain in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlondeBrunetteRedhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlondeBrunetteRedhead">Blonde, Brunette, Redhead</a> spectrum, and Misha's bright pink hair is immediately commented upon <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(and revealed to be dyed in both Lilly's and Shizune's routes)</span>. However, dark-haired characters tend to have blue or purple highlights, and their hair colors are listed as such on the homepage.
