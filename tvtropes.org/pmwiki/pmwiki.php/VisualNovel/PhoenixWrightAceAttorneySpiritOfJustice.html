"<em>Turnabout Trial 6</em>") once more stars unflappable defense attorney Phoenix Wright and his fellow lawyers.</p><p>Phoenix Wright is on a trip to the Kingdom of Khura'in to visit his old friend Maya Fey, who is currently on a training expedition there. Knowing it'll be a few days before he can see her, Phoenix takes an opportunity to tour the local area, but his 9-year old tour guide, Ahlbi Ur'gaid, is suddenly arrested on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysMurder">charge of murder</a>. Phoenix decides to sit in on the young defendant's trial, but he is shocked to find that their nation's court system does not use defense attorneys in their trials. Instead, the prosecution indicts suspects, and the court then relies on mystic oracles to presume the defendant's guilt or innocence. Unwilling to let such a ridiculous notion stand scrutiny, Phoenix leaps to his tour guide's aid and offers his defense amid heavy resistance from both the audience and even the defendant himself. Also participating in the trial is the mystic princess Rayfa Padma Khura'in, daughter of Queen Ga&#146;ran Sigatar Khura&#146;in, in a unique role: not as prosecutor, witness, or judge; but to conduct the "Divination S&eacute;ance," a ceremonial dance that can channel the visions of the victim through the "Pool of Souls". Phoenix soon gets wrapped up into a plot involving a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">revolution</a> led by the shadowy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelLeader">Dhurke</a>, and a corrupt justice minister by the name of Inga who hates lawyers.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>While Phoenix deals with the attorney-less justice system of Khura'in, the other lawyers of the Wright Anything Agency, Apollo Justice and Athena Cykes, are left to handle business back home, with Apollo in particular learning to stand in court on his own. However, as Phoenix left for Khura'in, Khura'in comes to Apollo and co. in the form of international prosecutor Nahyuta Sahdmadhi, a monk who sees attorneys as obstacles preventing murder victims from resting in peace.</p><p>Key to the game is the new "Divination Seance" gameplay mechanic, which is how the court system of Khura'in renders its verdicts, namely by conjuring images of the last things the deceased saw or felt before their death. The defending attorney can then examine the "footage" of the event and pick out inconsistencies either from within the vision itself or with evidence of the crime. The five strike penalty system from the first game returns (compared to the "life gauge" system that has been in use since the second game). The developers have said that Phoenix has no new challenges left at home, so sending him to a new land would give him a new set of court rules to work with, reigniting the sense of urgency in court.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The game was originally announced on September 1, 2015 and appeared at the 2015 Tokyo Game Show in a playable form. The Japanese version launched on June 9, 2016 and arrived in English-speaking territories on September 8, 2016. As with <em>Dual Destinies</em>, only the Japanese release features both physical and digital releases, with the English localization being strictly digital via the Nintendo 3DS eShop. It was later released on the iOS and Android mobile platforms on September 21, 2017.</p><p>A character sheet for the whole franchise can be found <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/AceAttorney">here</a>.</p><p><a class="urllink" href="http://www.capcom.co.jp/gyakutensaiban/6/">Official website (Japanese)<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> The TGS 2015 trailer can be found <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqZOzoSEQa4">here (English-subbed)<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMPtENBMFGo">here (dubbed)<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

Her mobile phone is broken, and Phoenix thinks something bad has happened to her. Not actually, because Nahyuta Sahdmadhi happened to drop by and immobilize the rebel before he could do any harm to her, but Phoenix decides to go immediately to Khura'in to check up on Maya. In the game proper, this assault is never talked about. It's said that Phoenix just went there because Maya was finishing her training to be the Master of Kurain Village.

How? The main prosecutor in this game and Khura'in in general dismiss most of what you say by pointing out you're a filthy, unclean lawyer who should get executed and thrown to hell. This is no exaggeration, as the trial's public itself demands Phoenix's execution after his claims against the legal system in "The Foreign Turnabout".

Like Dahlia Hawthorne and Iris, they are twins where one of them is genuinely kind while the other only pretends to be nice, and bosses the other sister around. The main differences are: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bonny and Betty's interactions with each other are seen on-screen while the interactions between Dahlia and Iris took place off-screen, Bonny eventually stands up to Betty while Iris never manages to stand up to Dahlia, and Betty isn't actually evil like Dahlia.</span></li><li> Case 2 is similar to case 2-2, as both involve assistants of a lawyer being set-up to be framed for murder while performing their family art, and the person framing them is a fellow practitioner in the art.

The second time is when after Geiru reveals her lethal allergy to buckwheat, which debunks Athena's theory that she killed Taifu with the soba dough. After a review, Athena remembers that part of the "Three Freshes" involves never to let soba dough rest, which gives a piece of evidence a new meaning: The "Do not disturb" note. Turns out that Taifu didn't write it because he wanted to take a nap, he was actually making udon dough, which does require resting. The lack of buckwheat at the crime scene save for the containers in the fridge means that it was possible for Geiru to suffocate Taifu with the udon dough.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhov's Gun</a>:<ul><li> The Founder's Orb, which went missing in Case 1, plays a crucial role in Case 5. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It triggers a civil trial pitching Apollo against Phoenix in the first half of the case, and is an item needed to start Dhurke's revolution (because it can bestow spiritual power apparently).</span></li><li> The Magatama of Parting is presented in Case 3 as a red item that becomes brown when its power is used up in kicking a spirit out of a channeler's body. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">You find brown magatamas in Inga's murder location two cases later, hinting at the fact that there was some spirit channelling going on in the tomb.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman">Chekhov's Gunman</a>:<ul><li> Puh'ray Zeh'lot is seen early in Case 3 as a devout monk praying the day away during the Purification Rite, although Phoenix doesn't meet him personally.

When Apollo explains to Athena that their trial is a civil one, the latter appears confused over the fact, prompting a quip from former that she's "acting like [he's] speaking Swahili". Although Athena explains that her confusion comes from her thinking that the agency specified in criminal law, her confusion over civil trials, as well as the issue regarding the type of law they're supposed to handle, makes a lot more sense in the Japanese version. Civil trials are a <em>very</em> modern addition to the Japanese legal system, and are still extremely rare. As opposed to the west, where lawsuits are commonly considered to be thrown about <em>too</em> much, in Japan, they are considered an extremely taboo way of resolving disputes, to the point where a specific subset of civil attorney do not actually exist (such causes are typically handled by ordinary "bengoshi" lawyers or by patent attorneys).<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">On the other hand, this in itself creates an impact that is ''gained'' in the localization;</a> Khura'in's legal system, which evidently does not have civil trials at all, comes across as even more broken and behind-the-times when put up against civil trials being so ingrained into western legal systems to the point where most westerners think of them as such a basic part of a legal system that they don't even consider that places like Japan have not had them until <em>very</em> recent history (and even them, in very limited circumstances). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The game's ending infers that the country is beginning to properly implement civil lawsuits in the legal system which, to western players, makes the overhaul to the system seem much rawer then to Japanese players, where such a thing is simply a reflection of what is really happening in their own home country at the moment, albeit turned up a notch.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostMyAppetite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostMyAppetite">Lost My Appetite</a>: In the end, Bucky Whet delivers an order of prepared soba noodles to Simon Blackquill while heavily drunk enough that he gets nauseated.

While he was there, he witnessed and took a photo of Queen Ga'ran performing spirit-channelling duties for a client. In court, the prank helps determine when Inga was really killed due to the gunshot-sounding noise (the firecracker) and the male laughter (Datz). The photo Ahlbi took at first supports Ga'ran's alibi, but a bit of digital-enhancement on it by Ema reveals a large burn scar on "Ga'ran's" chest. Apollo looks at Ga'ran's <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CleavageCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CleavageCut">Cleavage Cut</a> and notices that the scar isn't there.

Sadly, Edgeworth reveals that the victim's autopsy determined that he was struck <em>twice</em> with the murder weapon which Ellen was seen holding in front of the dead victim. He points out that this disproves any act of self-defense since he theorises that Ellen dealt the second blow to finish him off, likely making this a murder case whether she did it or not. Since this happens early on, expect to see more work to do.</li><li> Also from the DLC case, Ema reconstructing the broken pegabull lantern the victim was found in causes a <em>slight</em> bit of confusion since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she mixed up the handles to the door in the back. Both were different colors, with the unpainted one covered in blood that was actually placed on the inside from the start.

In the trial you find out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Phoenix's client murdered the archeologist who was supposed to hand over the orb, and that he kidnapped Maya, which is why Phoenix is defending him</span>. Then you go to Khura'in, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dhurke is arrested for the murder of Inga, the Justice Minister</span>. Further investigation reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Queen Amara was Dhurke's wife, and Dhurke tells you that he's secretly dying</span>. The final trial is no less shocking, what with the reveal that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dhurke was dead before the case even began, Queen Amara is alive and was disguised as Nayna, and Queen Ga'ran killed both Apollo's biological father and Inga. Plus Nahyuta is Rayfa's brother</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a>:<ul><li> Revisualizations (the gameplay segments where your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> goes over everything that happened so far in their head to reach a conclusion) normally end with one of these, but Case 3's turns all assumptions about the case upside-down: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tahrust's death was a suicide.</span></li><li> One line happens near the end of the game that pretty much shook the series going forward: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Apollo decides to stay in Khura'in.</span></li><li> For once in the series there is a Wham Contradiction. To wit, the player is shocked when they <em>deduce the contradiction</em> to a line uttered by a witness. It happens in "Turnabout Revolution" when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Amara says that Minister Inga was the sole victim and that there was no other spirit to channel until he was dead. Dhurke's bloodstains contradict that claim and prove that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong">he died</a> as well as Inga</span>.</li><li> At the end of the day 1 investigation of the last case, Apollo runs into Phoenix and they argue who the Founder's Orb belongs to; Apollo claims it belongs to Dhruke while Phoenix argues it belongs to his client. Mr. Wimperson. At the end of the argument, Phoenix drops a bombshell on Apollo:</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Phoenix</strong>: I'm really sorry it's come to this, but...</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Apollo</strong>: Mr. Wright? I don't understand.</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Phoenix</strong>: Let me spell it out then. If you continue to claim that the crystal belongs to your client...then I will <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> be seeing you in court</span>.</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Apollo</strong>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigWhat">Wh-wh-whaaaaaaaaaaaa!?</a></div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamShot">Wham Shot</a>:<ul><li> "The Rite of Turnabout" has a major one.

Noteworthy ones include:<ul><li> Two shots back-to-back occur when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sgt. Buff announces that they will now reveal who they look like, the next shot displays a wheelchair, then the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeetFirstIntroduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeetFirstIntroduction">Feet-First Introduction</a> reveals that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamusIsAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamusIsAGirl">Sgt.

Rayfa actually has a much bigger role in the main story than Maya does. However, in the DLC case, she plays a much larger role as Phoenix's assistant in both investigations and in court.</li><li> Blackquill and Edgeworth appearing in the promotional material, however, is a bit more played straight; both only appear in one court case each: 6-4 and 6-5 respectively. 6-4 can be likened to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler</a> case altogether, and in 6-5 Edgeworth's role ends shortly after he appears.
