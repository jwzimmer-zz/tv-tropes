She soon finds a boy stumbling out of a different locker, who also doesn't know how he got there. He introduces himself as Shuichi Saihara, the Ultimate Detective. At the behest of five bear-like mascots calling themselves the Monokubs, Kaede and Shuichi explore the Ultimate Academy and meet 14 other Ultimate high school students, the very best in their fields selected by the government's Gifted System. Soon, however, they are introduced to the Monokubs' "father", Headmaster <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MascotVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MascotVillain">Monokuma</a>, who explains to the sixteen Ultimates the rules of their new lives: they are trapped inside the Ultimate Academy for Gifted Juveniles, and the only way to escape is to kill one of their own and successfully get away with the crime in a class trial.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Kaede soon discovers that they are indeed trapped, and she, Shuichi, and the other Ultimate students are forced into playing Monokuma's sadistic Mutual Killing Game, with the Monokubs piloting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> called Exisals to enforce the rules.</p><p>The game retains the same basic set-up as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc">Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Danganronpa2GoodbyeDespair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Danganronpa2GoodbyeDespair">Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair</a></em>, with once again the story being divided into segments of Daily Life where the player interacts with the other characters, and the investigations and trials where it must be deduced which one of the students is a killer. Many elements, however, have been updated, with many technical aspects changed, multiple testimonies displayed at once during debates, "Debate Scrums" where the students split into two sides in a debate and the new ability to utilize "lies" to solve trials. And, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MascotVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MascotVillain">Monokuma</a> has once again returned, it was announced pre-release that previous characters will not make an appearance, with the setting being Hope's Peak Academy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a>.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p></p><hr><h2><em>Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony</em> provides examples of:</h2><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tropes A-F&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquittedTooLate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquittedTooLate">Acquitted Too Late</a>: Kaede was not actually Rantaro's killer; Tsumugi was. However, this isn't proven until Chapter 6, long after Kaede was wrongfully executed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvertisedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvertisedExtra">Advertised Extra</a>: Everyone assumed K1-B0, the robot boy on the initial advertisement poster, would be the game's protagonist. However, the second trailer reveals that the game's true main character is a girl named Kaede Akamatsu. It then turns out to be a double <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a> with Shuichi being the <em>true</em> protagonist, with K1-B0, Himiko, and Maki being playable for the last trial as well. In fact, with Kaito and Maki being two-thirds of the game's primary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio">Power Trio</a> and K1-B0's vitality in the endgame, ultimately taking down <em>Danganronpa itself</em> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>, while Shuichi spends so much time after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a>, it could be argued that the initial poster was right all along.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a>: The aesthetic certainty looks this way. The classroom shown in the PV looks like it's been abandoned for a while, and there is foliage on the dome. That's because the backstory created for the game says that the school spent a few centuries looking for a new planet after the Earth's destruction was eminent from meteor showers and a virus pandemic, before Monokuma piloted the spaceship back to the now-uninhabitable Earth.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeForeignThemeSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeForeignThemeSong">Alternative Foreign Theme Song</a>: Western localizations replaced the ending theme, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BnZLuW92Hw">"Dan Kusari -break-"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MegumiOgata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MegumiOgata">Megumi Ogata</a>, with an extended version of the opening theme titled <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m584u27GcBQ&amp;t=4s">"The END of DNG"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbidextrousSprite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbidextrousSprite">Ambidextrous Sprite</a>: Kaito always wears his left jacket sleeve and leaves the right side over his shoulder, but his Debate Scrum sprites when opposing the player are flipped so he wears his right sleeve. This is odd considering other characters' Debate Scrum sprites are customized so details such as Kirumi's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeekABangs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeekABangs">Peek-a-Bangs</a> and Gonta's bug box are always on the correct side.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousEnding">Ambiguous Ending</a>: In the game's ending, it is ultimately left unclear how much of what Tsumugi revealed is the truth and how much isn't. As Shuichi notes, the only thing that cannot be denied is that they're alive.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation">Ambiguous Situation</a>: Many of the love hotel events are ambiguous about whether or not Shuichi ends up having sex with whichever classmate he brought with him. Some characters' events, like Kaede's, Tsumugi's, Angie's, Himiko's, Miu's, and Korekiyo's, strongly imply that they do end up sleeping with Shuichi (with or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedyRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedyRape">without his consent</a>), but other characters' events are somewhat less clear. For instance, Maki asks Shuichi to "make a real family with her", Tenko insists that Shuichi can't be bullheaded if she asks him again to "do anything to her", and Gonta remarks that he's "not going to let [Shuichi] get any sleep tonight".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowForSomeoneCompletelyDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowForSomeoneCompletelyDifferent">And Now for Someone Completely Different</a>: After Kaede is revealed as the blackened in the first trial, Shuichi takes over as the main character. Then, at the final class trial, K1-B0, Himiko, and Maki all became playable characters.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues">And the Adventure Continues</a>: In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">The Stinger</a>, after Danganronpa has been destroyed, the final three survivors emerge from the rubble and wonder what is real or not about the outside world they are about to leave to.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">Anti-Frustration Features</a>: In addition to the "Start from the beginning" and "Start from Class Trial" options when starting a chapter present since the first game and the "Start from Deadly Life" option added in the second, this game gives you the option to start from the chapter's first Free Time period, making it easier to get the Friendship Fragments. This is especially helpful for Kaede's events, which cannot be experienced in Love Across the Universe.<ul><li> A unique case that happens in-universe. In the past two games, whenever the body discovery announcment played, Monokuma simply says that after a certain amount of time the Class Trial will begin after investigation. This meant that one of the three people that discovered the body usually has to go out and gather any one else present to the site of the dead body. Now, in this game, whenever there is a dead body discovered, Monokuma now tells everyone to meet up at the site where the dead body is.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">Anyone Can Die</a>: This is a <em>Danganronpa</em> game, where the cast is encouraged to kill each other to escape. No one is safe. Not even the character who was advertised as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist">The Protagonist</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">Apocalypse How</a>: It seems that the meteors and the deadly virus they brought caused total extinction of all life on Earth, with the only exceptions being the students in the Gifted Inmates Academy. Outside of the academy, there isn't even any trace of oxygen to breathe. Then this all turns out to be false.<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ApocalypseHow/ClassZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ApocalypseHow/ClassZ">Class Z</a>: Shuichi defies the fictional reality of Danganronpa by believing in his friends' effect as fictional characters changing the world as he knows it, by disappointing the audience rather than giving them the hope/good ending that they desire. The result of this is that K1-B0, the audience's protagonist, destroys the containment for the Ultimate Academy for Gifted Juveniles, and ends the universe of Danganronpa itself, allowing Shuichi, Maki, and Himiko to successfully escape.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcNumber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcNumber">Arc Number</a>:<ul><li> The number 3 shows up a lot in here.<ul><li> During Chapter 3, there were three people that died in the chapter.

This is apparent in Chapter Four where Gonta crossed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a> by learning the truth of the outside world and believing that it would be easier to die, and the students not wanting to believe that Gonta was the culprit of that case.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch">Bait-and-Switch</a>: The entirety of the first chapter is most appropriately defined with this characteristic. The events are as follows: Kaede unifies everyone; everyone tries to escape; Monokuma retaliates against Kaede's efforts; Kaede takes advantage of said retaliation to kill the mastermind; the attempt fails in two gray ways; the perspective of the player switches from her to Shuichi; after explaining why she tried to kill, Shuichi exclaims about the fact that there was never a mastermind and that his deductive skills failed; after the lament and motivation given to the group, she's brutally executed by Monokuma.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">Bitch in Sheep's Clothing</a>:<ul><li> In the demo, should the class trial proceed as usual, it's implied that Makoto Naegi is the culprit. That means that reliable senior who helps Kaede along is deliberately stranding her into making the wrong decision. Subverted in that Yasuhiro Hagakure is only pretending to be dead, and Makoto and Hajime Hinata are just acting. However it's actually a double subversion, because acting and pretending to take part in a killing game turns out to be a major plot point and part of the mastermind's plan in the main game, extending the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">Bitch in Sheep's Clothing</a> title to Hajime and Yasuhiro as well.

At least, not one introduced in this game, anyway. That doesn't stop her from singing the credits song as usual, though (at least in the Japanese version).</li><li> This is the first game where Junko Enoshima isn't the mastermind.

And unlike the first two games, the Chapter 2 culprit tries their hardest to escape execution.</li><li> This is also the first non-spinoff game where the protagonist is a girl. For the first chapter, anyway.</li><li> This is the first game where the student with an unknown talent dies.</li><li> This is also the first game where the Ultimate Hope dies.</li><li> Unlike Makoto and Sayaka from the first game, and Fuyuhiko and Peko from the second game, none of the students knew each other before coming to the school.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust">But Thou Must!</a>: At the end of every trial, you have to vote for who you think is the culprit, which you can either go with the rest of your classmates, or vote for someone else like the victim. However, in Chapter 5, the game forces you to vote for the culprit, and won't allow you to choose anyone else.<ul><li> Subverted in a way at the end of Chapter 6. In order to actually progress and end the killing game, the player will need to ignore rigged minigames and questions by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">letting their time limit run out</a>.</li><li> In the Ultimate Talent Development Plan, in one event involving a MonoMono Machine, both options are "Give it a spin!"</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a>: The Chapter 5 execution in this game is a throwback to the execution of Jin Kirigiri in the first game's prologue.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious">Captain Obvious</a>: During Chapter 3, after the Caged Child ceremony, Korekiyo takes off the sheet off the cage to reveal Tenko, unmoving and lying in a huge pool of blood.

Several "previous installments" with goofy subtitles are mentioned in the sixth trial. Almost makes one wonder if the writers are trying to make a point.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingGag">Casting Gag</a>: Every character shares an English voice actor with a character from one of the previous games, leading to some amusing situations.<ul><li> Leon and Shuichi share a VA, as do Sayaka and Tsumugi. This creates some nice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds">Book-Ends</a> for the series as a whole, since <em>DR1</em>'s killing game began with Leon killing Sayaka and <em>DRV3</em>'s killing game ends much the same way (with Shuichi exposing Tsumugi as the mastermind, leading to her death by falling rubble).</li><li> Chapter 1 essentially has Sayaka trying to frame the protagonist for murder once again, only this time she succeeds. In addition, Kaede has the same VA as Kyoko, so a mastermind once again tries to frame Kyoko for murder but succeeds this time around (<em>DR1</em>'s non-canon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadEnding">Bad Ending</a> notwithstanding).</li><li> Rantaro won the previous killing game. He also shares a VA with Hajime, who won the previous killing game that we got to see. Rantaro also got a number of perks as a reward for winning the previous game, making him somewhat overpowered compared to everyone else. Much like how Hajime became Izuru, who is <em>very</em> overpowered compared to everyone else. In addition, neither Hajime nor Rantaro can remember what their talent is.</li><li> Korekiyo shares a VA with Teruteru, who, let's face it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves">would</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves">definitely</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves">have sex with his own sister if he had one</a>. They both also commit murder for the sake of a female relative (Teruteru so he can leave the island and check on his sick mother, Korekiyo to send more "friends" to his dead sister in the afterlife).</li><li> Miu and Akane share a VA, creating some amusing contrast since Akane is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentFanserviceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentFanserviceGirl">Innocent Fanservice Girl</a> who doesn't even seem to know what sex <em>is</em>, while Miu is a raging pervert to rival even Teruteru.</li><li> Kiyotaka and Monotaro share a VA, another contrasting pair since the former places great importance on studying while the latter is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgetfulJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgetfulJones">Forgetful Jones</a> who couldn't study his way out of a paper bag and only manages to get by through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance">Achievements in Ignorance</a>.</li><li> Nekomaru and Monokid share a VA. Monokid often yells about his "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagingStiffie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagingStiffie">rock-hard rager</a>", and a <em>very</em> noticeable feature on Nekomaru's (human) sprites is his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagPenis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagPenis">massive bulge</a>.</li><li> Gundham and Ryoma share a VA. Ryoma is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">Death Seeker</a> who, despite his efforts, could not find a reason to live and allowed himself to be killed, while Gundham believes that giving up on life is a blasphemy against life itself.</li><li> A non-DR-related casting gag occurs from Kokichi sharing his English VA with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">"Digimon Emperor" Ken Ichijouji</a>. Not only is Ken actually the evil supervillain Kokichi claims to be (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">at least initially</a>), but his Digimon partner and long-suffering lackey during his stint as the Emperor was Wormmon, a bug-like Digimon. Who does Kokichi always rope into being <em>his</em> lackey? Gonta, who is obsessed with bugs.</li><li> Kirumi's VA also voices 2B from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NierAutomata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NierAutomata">NieR: Automata</a></em>, and the two characters look quite similar to each other.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes">Cast of Snowflakes</a>: As always, the design for every character differ wildly from the other.

The color has been heavily used in advertisement and in the game itself as a way to represent lies. Whenever lies are used in the court, pink eyes appear on the screen and a good part of the game interface switches to pink, including the bullets themselves (The Truth Bullets appear as white letters, while Lie Bullets are pink). During the game's opening, a pink eye appears blinking, right after a bullet is filled with pink. Also, a shadow of all characters appears during their introductions, with their pupils colored in pink. Kaede, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyProtagonist">Decoy Protagonist</a>, also wears pink clothing to better contrast her to Shuichi, our true protagonist, who's associated with "honest" blues.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsaccharineWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsaccharineWorld">Crapsaccharine World</a>: Tsumugi claims that there is absolute peace in the outside world, but because everything is so peaceful, everyone is bored out of their wits and need to watch teenagers murdering each other on TV just to get some excitement in their lives. And said teenagers all willingly and eagerly sign up to get their minds wiped and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories">Fake Memories</a> implanted so they can murder each other on their favourite TV show, if the tapes are to be believed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a>:<ul><li> Chapter 5: The end of all life on Earth. After the Future Foundation was able to suppress the Remnants of Despair and rebuild the world, a meteor shower began, and these meteors carried a lethal virus that threatened to infect everybody.

However, Kokichi Oma, a Remnant of Despair, brought Monokuma aboard the arc, redirected the spaceship back to Earth, and designed the killing game with the intention of plunging humanity's final hope into despair.</li><li> Chapter 6: This is all a lie. The world was never destroyed in any sort of apocalyptic event, and the Remnants of Despair are nothing but fiction, as is <em>Dangonronpa</em> itself. However, the <em>Danganronpa</em> franchise is so popular that it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrumanShowPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrumanShowPlot">spawned a reality TV show</a> where teenagers willingly and excitedly sign up to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">mind-wiped</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories">implanted with the identites</a> of <em>Danganronpa</em> characters so they can murder each other on TV.

These examples were part of the reason why the cast figures out the flashback lights only gave fake memories.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">Cruel and Unusual Death</a>: Many of the executions, with some of them being among the most gruesome in the series to date.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory">Damn You, Muscle Memory!</a>: The PC port has many control differences compared to the PC ports of the previous two games. The right mouse click fires the truth bullet and left click fires the silencer, while it was the opposite in the previous games; Enter highlights observable objects rather than Tab, Esc fast-forwards through text and exits areas rather than Ctrl and R respectively, and F3 brings up the controls instead of Esc. Fortunately, all of these except the mouse can be changed by editing the game's config.txt file.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a>: The game has been described by the developers as "psycho cool", and uses a darker aesthetic compared to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Danganronpa2GoodbyeDespair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Danganronpa2GoodbyeDespair">Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair</a></em>.

Not only are the previous installments in the game actually fictional, as are all of their events in the world of V3 (Despite what Chapter 5 leads you to think), but the many aspects of the series are seen as nothing but amusement to the masses that watch the killing games happen, of up to 53 seasons worth. It even rips apart the Hope vs Despair dynamics of the previous franchise installments as well. While despair is still seen as horrible, Shuichi comes to the conclusion that <strong>Hope itself</strong> as portrayed in the series is just as bad, as Hope winning against Despair will merely encourage Team Danganronpa, the true masterminds of the franchise, to make more needless killing games. It takes not Hope or Despair winning, but <em>Disappointment</em> winning instead to end the grisly TV show, once and for all.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap">Death Trap</a>:<ul><li> The ramp of books and flashing camera set up in the library, intended to lure the victim to the bookcase while a cannonball rolls down the ramp and drops on their head from above.</li><li> The occult ritual, which has the participant unknowingly kneeling on a see-saw floor board, which is used to propel them upwards into a sickle blade sticking through the bars.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemoBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemoBonus">Demo Bonus</a>: Transferring your save data from the demo into the full game causes you to start off with additional money, the Nail Brush item (needed to unlock one of the early extra scenes), and the Machine Gun skill (normally only available through playing minigames in an area that isn't even accessible until the second chapter).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight">Developers' Foresight</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>.

However, Kokichi wasn't wearing a shirt when he entered the hydraulic press, so this is a plot hole. This was changed from the Japanese version (presumably to show the hole in the sleeve which was missing in the Japanese version), where Kaito's arm was closer to his body and thus hidden from the camera before it came down, which is how the switcheroo was pulled off. A similar error happens earlier, when the Chapter 1 verdict wheel is inexplicably changed to show Shuichi's pixel icon without his hat.</li><li> The game consistently uses a different word to refer to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> (&#39318;&#35584;&#32773;, commonly fan-translated as "Ringleader", instead of the more common &#40658;&#24149;), a nuance ignored in the localization, which sticks to just using "Mastermind". This causes problems because, in the final trial, Tsumugi says that, while she may be the mastermind (&#39318;&#35584;&#32773;), the actual mastermind (&#40658;&#24149;) is the outside world desiring the killing games. This results in the localization having Tsumugi claim they're <em>both</em> the mastermind, turning a fairly major twist revealing the true meaning behind a seemingly minor detail into utter nonsense.</li><li> Also in Chapter 6, when the mastermind explains how the Danganronpa TV show is "everyone's killing school semester" (the game's Japanese subtitle), one of the audience comments says that they finally get it. Since the English subtitle is changed to "Killing Harmony," referring to Kaede's death in the first chapter, this instead comes off as an unexplained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LateToThePunchline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LateToThePunchline">Late to the Punchline</a> gag.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a>:<ul><li> There is an <a class="urllink" href="https://danganronpa.wikia.com/wiki/File:Danganronpa_V3_Miu_Iruma_Sprite_(Unused)_(2).png">unused sprite<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> of Miu that can be found in the game's code, intended to be used for when she was angry.

Keep the name "Team Danganronpa" in your mind for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening">the finale.</a></li><li> The game's start-up uses the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsAWorkOfFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsAWorkOfFiction">This Is a Work of Fiction</a>" message, explaining all the characters and events are fictional. Which is quite odd as how it never appeared in the previous games. It turns out to be quite literal.</li><li> In the prologue when the Monokubs are explaining the killing game, Kaede has the following thoughts that hint towards the biggest twist in the franchise:<div class="indent"><strong>Kaede</strong>: A lie... More like fiction... Like a story on TV... A scenario so removed from reality, we can hardly believe it's happening.</div></li><li> When Kaede first meets Tsumugi, she says that her favorite episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KiteretsuDaihyakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KiteretsuDaihyakka">Kiteretsu Daihyakka</a></em> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Doraemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Doraemon">Doraemon</a></em> in the English version) is #53. This foreshadows the game being the 53rd killing game and her being the mastermind. <a class="urllink" href="http://kaibutsushidousha.tumblr.com/post/169633676249/kodakas-anniv3rsary-tweets">According to Kodaka, she let that out because she was nervous.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></li><li> Over the course of the game, characters occasionally but consistently use the words "lie" and "fiction" synonymously, one example being Trial 3 where Korekiyo declares that the accusations of him being the culprit are "just fiction".</li><li> A massive amount regarding a single twist. The mastermind being Tsumugi Shirogane:<ul><li> During the first trial, Korekiyo brings up the point of the culprit being the mastermind. Shirogane instantly shoots him down.</li><li> After the first trial, Tsumugi can be found around the sealed door.</li><li> In Chapter 5, Tsumugi is the one most reluctant to go along with Kaito's plan to fight Monokuma.</li><li> Later in Chapter 5, Kokichi claims that he is the mastermind. Tsumugi instantly reacts with shock.</li><li> The Flashback Light the group gets in Chapter 5 contains information that directly contradicts later revelations concerning Kokichi. That's because Tsumugi faked it so to try and realign the killing game.</li><li> Tsumugi's seat in Class Trials is right in front of Monokuma's throne - which was the real Junko Enoshima's seat in the original game.</li><li> Chapter 1: The scene where Rantaro Amami paints Kaede Akamatsu's nails while a jealous Tsumugi Shirogane watches takes on a new light after Kaede is executed for Rantaro's murder and it turns out that Tsumugi orchestrated the entire thing.</li><li> Why is it that Tsumugi's face is not shown in the Chapter One execution, compared to everyone else? Is she actually elated?</li><li> During the first trial, when Gonta tells everyone that he was watching a documentary about bugs to prepare for battle mentally, Tsumugi asks if he was trying to imagine himself as "a giant mantis with swords for hands". She was referencing the execution she had devised for him, which we see three chapters later.</li><li> Early in Chapter 2, Miu takes a jab at Tsumugi's plain appearance, pointing out that without her glasses, she wouldn't be noticeable at all. Tsumugi replies that her glasses are in fact the only thing hiding her terrifying true form. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasticConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasticConfession">At the time it's easy to brush that remark off as the ramblings of a hardcore otaku, but come the final Class Trial, her words are chillingly prophetic.</a></li><li> After the trial where Gonta died, Tsumugi was the one to see Kokichi's completed message. It's very likely that it was not a coincidence that Tsumugi just so happens to see that message after Gonta died.</li><li> On a meta level, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DorothyEliasFahn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DorothyEliasFahn">English voice actress</a> played Sayaka from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc">the first game</a>. Both of these women ended up starting the killing game in a way.</li><li> Her talent being the Ultimate Cosplayer is one of the obvious hints that make one indecisive. It's a more obvious hint to her being the mastermind of this game because it's one of the most meta concepts included in Danganronpa: a character who is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doppelganger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doppelganger">most talented at playing as other fictional characters</a>, to the extent where she even says "Tsumugi Shirogane" is just another identity trick of hers.</li></ul></li><li> The demo. During the class trial, there isn't enough room for the entire cast of <em>V3</em> in addition to Makoto Naegi and Hajime Hinata, so Monokuma has Rantaro Amami and K1-B0 sit out. Who would ever think that one of them would <em>actually</em> be the first victim and not participate in any of the class trials?</li><li> During the prologue, the chapter title appears as normal, with the text perfectly straight. After getting their clothes from the Monokubs and are subjected to a blinding light before being put back where they came from, the chapter title is suddenly lopsided and everyone remembers their talents and background. A <em>huge</em> clue into the final twist of the game...</li><li> At one point in chapter 4, Himiko suggests that K1-B0 should self-destruct to open a hole in the wall, thus making himself useful. This remark loses the humor behind it when he does just that at the end of the game to let the survivors escape.</li><li> The Limited Edition box (which is also the "box art" of the English demo) featuring K1-B0 shows his true identity when it was revealed in Chapter 6 as not only as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn">Unwitting Pawn</a> of being the cameraman working for Team Danganronpa, but also as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> "Protagonist".</li><li> The pre-release promotional materials (like official arts and merchandises) often paired Kaede with Rantaro. Before the game's release, many people speculated that they will be the new Makoto-Kyoko or Hajime-Nagito pair. In truth, they are the first characters to die in the game.</li><li> During the Chapter 2 class trial, Kaito Momota claims that he hid inside the girls' restroom to escape Gonta Gokuhara, who was dragging everyone to his entomology lab. There's a hidden passageway in a girls' restroom, but since Shuichi Saihara and Gonta are both boys, they wouldn't ever have the chance to find anything hidden inside.</li><li> Opening has a silhoutte for every character which has purple glowing eyes except Rantaro directly became a shadow, this foreshadows unlike everyone he knew what situation he was in due to his survivor status.</li><li> At the beginning of the virtual world segment in chapter 4, after Kokichi and Gonta's avatars appear, it takes oddly long before Gonta reacts to his surroundings and the avatars. Possibly an early indicator that Gonta mixed up the "consciousness" and "memory" cords in his headset. It's also hinted back in Chapter 1 that Gonta is left-handed, as he lifts the manhole cover with his left hand. This is significant, because Himiko used the trick to remembering which one is her right hand as "the one I hold my chopsticks in", which would be reversed for Gonta.</li><li> Chapter One's title (<em>Me and My Class Trial</em>, with the first "me" being written in Kaede's speech pattern and the second in Shuichi's) directly alludes to the fact that both Kaede and Shuichi are protagonists.</li><li> When Shuichi discovers his Ultimate Detective Lab for the first time in Chapter 4, he examines a bookshelf and finds "about 50" files that document murders and the tricks involved. If you actually look at the bookshelf, you can count exactly 52 files. All of the murder mysteries that occur in <em>Danganronpa <strong>V3</strong> </em> will probably be included in the <strong>53</strong>rd file if there ever is another killing game with another Ultimate Detective among the cast. Additionally, it's mentioned the earliest among the files include drawings instead of photographs. Tying into the fact the earliest killing games were fiction.</li><li> Before everybody uses the flashback light in Chapter 4, Kokichi tells Kaito that he doesn't have the balls to use the flashback light, which immediately provokes him into activating it. Come the class trial, Kokichi plays Kaito like a fiddle by making fun of him and his values, which nearly gets everyone killed by voting for the wrong culprit.</li><li> An early Monokuma Theater has Monokuma complain about how long the series has been going on.</li><li> In the trial intermission for Chapter Two, Monokuma suggested to skip to the next chapter. Monosuke then stated that they don't know who the culprit is, in which it was followed by Monotaro asking about the killer of the precious victim. This could be considered foreshadowing as how nobody really knows the <em>true</em> culprit behind Rantaro's death and how Kaede received a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiscarriageOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiscarriageOfJustice">Miscarriage of Justice</a>.</li><li> In Chapter Five, <a class="urllink" href="https://78.media.tumblr.com/7c85f53b367c1bb44735b34727e5cbac/tumblr_inline_ozljsx36nD1reph00_1280.png">one of the Exisal's poses<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> looks very similar to <a class="urllink" href="https://78.media.tumblr.com/5beac407708eba5008340c1460d05cc7/tumblr_inline_ozljtmyOwf1reph00_1280.png">Kaito's<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandBehindHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandBehindHead">Hand Behind Head</a> gesture, hinting that it was Kaito inside there all along.</li><li> There has been a couple of hints that Kokichi was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAllAlong">Good All Along</a>.<ul><li> In Chapter Two, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdealHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdealHero">Kaito</a> suggested that it would have been better if everybody were to watch their videos together in which that was what Kokichi tried to do earlier in this chapter.</li><li> He outright calls <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller">Maki</a> a worse liar than him, and he proceeds to out her true talent.

In V3 proper she uses her rocker one, a hint that it isn't really her.</li><li> The first four culprits have their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">Fatal Flaw</a> overshadow them the most throughout the game, and display a great possibility of their identity as the chapter's main antagonist.<ul><li> Kaede assumes that no one will kill anyone even when a time limit that guarantees everyone will die simultaneously is started. This foreshadows how paranoid she is as the assumption is in itself a logical fallacy.</li><li> Kirumi is a character who would adhere to <em>any</em> request. Therefore, the motive videos showing someone's special acquaintance would make her be the most submissive to Monokuma.</li><li> Korekiyo constantly talks about love in the story, his sister in Kaede's Free Time events, and directly tells the player that he has the appearance and personality of a potential culprit during the investigation of Rantaro's murder.</li><li> Gonta and Kokichi are regularly seen together. Gonta also asks Kokichi's permission to converse with Shuichi after Chapter 1, since he fears that Kokichi would do something rash to him if he randomly disconnected from their bond.</li><li> Kaito's ideology of believing in others and not suspecting others creates an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inversion of the trope</a> would lead him to believe that working with someone else who wants to end the Killing Game (who turns out to be Kokichi, as Chapter 4 reveals) can create a plan that would <em>actually</em> end the game.</li></ul></li><li> Very early in the Chapter 1 trial, Kochichi declares he knows who the culprit is. The Monokubs are shocked, since if he's right, he would set the world record for fastest class trial. They then reminisce wistfully about the previous record holder's amazing performance in trials and mourn for him as he is apparently dead. Initially, it just seems like the kubs are spouting random nonsense as usual, but with the revelation of Rantaro being the Ultimate Survivor who won the previous killing game, they were probably talking about him. Monokid's lament that he "soared through the enemy fleet all badass, just to die like a little punk" fits with this, since simply being snuck up on and bashed over the head would be a horribly anticlimactic and disappointing way for someone who was most likely the previous game's protagonist to be killed.</li><li> As mentioned under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseMusic">Artistic License &#150; Music</a> above, "Der Flohwalzer" is played on mostly black keys, but is played on only white keys during Kaede's execution.

On both Miu and Kokichi's ends, this is the closest the black and white of a murder case has succeeded in getting everyone but the culprit executed, which is well evidenced in the fact that this is also the last straightforward victim identification in the series, and the fact that the motive this time is labelled as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself">"the secret of the outside world"</a>, which is what ALL series motives can be technically portrayed as.</li><li> Appropriately, the trope is turned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> for the above as it is also the fourth murder case.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameUp">Frame-Up</a>: Kaede's shot put ball trap actually missed Rantaro entirely, and he was killed by Tsumugi, who hit him over the head with an identical shot put ball immediately afterwards.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyBackgroundEvent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyBackgroundEvent">Funny Background Event</a>: In Chapter 6, basically all of the audience comments count as this, but special notice goes to one particular commenter who's apparently <em>really</em> horny for Shuichi, and the only thing they comment on is how nice his body looks.</li></ul></div><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tropes G-T&nbsp;</div><div id="folder1" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">Gameplay and Story Integration</a>: When Kaede mentally urges Shuichi to out her as the first culprit and hands the player's control over to him, the UI, highlighted in Purple, turns off, then comes back on highlighted in Blue a second later when Shuichi becomes the protagonist. This occurs again during the last trial with the rest of the survivors, with K1-B0's being White, Himiko's being Neon Blue, and Maki's being Red.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">Gratuitous English</a>:<ul><li> Monokuma Files have their information written in Japanese and English, with the English texts looking like something out of Google Translate.</li><li> The Monokubs' theme, "Rise and Shine, Ursine!" has the lyrics "He is all that remains of a once-powerful nation.

The <em>real</em> Masterminds are actually the executives of the Danganronpa TV series and anyone else involved in its creation, and we never get to see them in the main game, as they reside outside the setting of the school.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>: Angie's second Free Time Event is only available once Kaede's lab opens up. The game never gives any hints as to this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyEndingMassage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyEndingMassage">Happy Ending Massage</a>: During Chapter 2, Tenko Chabashira requests for a "celebrity-like vacation" to be initiated for her with the assistance of Shuichi, who has a parasol in his possession at the time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomDrop">(if the gift is somehow given to you before Chapter 2 starts)</a>. Both Tenko and Kirumi gather a few other people (Himiko, Angie, Keebo) to join Tenko in this event, something Shuichi was unsuspecting the possibility of, for other people to join her and "become a celebrity" too... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingThePlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingThePlayer">She also provides swimsuits for the girls involved, something Shuichi (and not the player themselves as shown by the CG) is told not to stare at as the girls are actually casually clad in them</a>.

The possibility is raised by the end of chapter 5 that it's Junko again, culminating in the real mastermind pretending to be her. She justifies how impossible it is for Junko to be back by saying that even if it's repetitive or nobody wanted it by this point, she's <em>always</em> been behind everything in the franchise, so it must be the case. In the end, though, this is a lie, and Junko is not actually related to the events at all.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeIsScary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeIsScary">Hope Is Scary</a>: The usual climax of picking which side the characters would choose is getting harder in this game because both sides don't have a good resolution when they picked one of them. If they pick Despair, K1-B0 would get executed and the game will continue. If they pick Hope, then Tsumugi will get executed but Shuichi, Maki, Himiko and K1-B0 will have to pick two people on who will join for the next game. This was the reason why they pick <strong>neither of them</strong>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotterAndSexier">Hotter and Sexier</a>: Given the new love hotel feature this game is certainly more "suggestive" than the previous entries in both the main story and the dating sim mode. Buying the "Key of Love" allows the main character to play out one of their classmate's most desired fantasy, with the player character being seen as that student's "ideal partner". Depending on who happens to show up when the player visits the love hotel, there could be a heavy implication that the characters end up sleeping with each other. More of the characters here are also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualKink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualKink">more open about their sexual interests</a> than those of previous games, like the two BDSM enthusiasts (Miu and Korekiyo) have this appear in just their character designs.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImaginedInnuendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImaginedInnuendo">Imagined Innuendo</a>: In Chapter 1, Kokichi asks Kaede how far she has gone with Shuichi.

[...] So trust no one, Kaede... Or you'll lose, got it?</div><ul><li> In the same chapter, Kaito calls out Shuichi (the insecure Ultimate Detective) for excluding him from the list of suspects without a good reason.</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Shuichi:</strong> Ah, don't worry... you're not a likely suspect... <br><strong>Kaito:</strong> Hey, that's not something a detective should say! <br><strong>Shuichi:</strong> What? <br><strong>Kaito:</strong> If you suspect me, you better pursue it to the end. Investigate until you're satisfied. If you don't do that, you'll never reach the truth. Rantaro will have died for no reason. This is where you need to let your <strong>Ultimate</strong> talent shine!</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceSpoiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceSpoiler">Interface Spoiler</a>:<ul><li> Unlike the previous games, now you manually vote on who the culprit is at the end of the class trial. You don't have to actually vote for the culprit because everyone else will do so, but you do need to vote for <em>somebody</em> or you get a game over. The significance of this comes at the very end of the final case, where the remaining survivors perform a suicide pact by all refusing to vote for hope or despair.</li><li> In the first chapter, Kaede can't get more than two Free Time events from any character, because the game intends you to collect all of them with Shuichi instead.</li><li> On a less "spoiler" note and more "capable of being figured out by a perceptive player", you can get the sheet music and metronome presents from the MonoMono Machine, which would obviously be best appreciated only by Kaede as a recipient. There is also the "Gun of Man's Passion," which like the items "A Man's Fantasy" and "Man's Nut" in the first two games, unlocks a hidden <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">fanservice</a> scene of spying on girls bathing, which makes much more sense for a male protagonist.</li><li> Perceptive players will also notice that during a character's second Free Time event, they will speak a fully voiced line or two near the end, something only reserved for final Free Time events in <em>Danganronpa 2</em>.</li><li> Also, you can find hidden Monokumas as Kaede, but unlike the previous game there's no display rack for them in her room. The rack is in Shuichi's room.</li><li> In previous games, your Influence Gauge emptying would result in all the survivors voting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> guilty, which, since said individual isn't the culprit, would result in Monokuma declaring that everyone besides the blackened will be executed. This time, however, the game over sequence cuts off just before the votes are cast. This is most likely because in the first trial, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyProtagonist">Kaede</a> is considered the culprit (as the person who takes the fall for the mastermind's crime), so executing her would be the correct decision.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho">Ironic Echo</a>: The series' <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

You've managed to get him to confess to Tenko's murder, but with a laugh, he reminds everyone of Monokuma's rule stating that if two different people commit murder at the same time, only the first body discovered counts for the trial, and the second one is a wasted kill with no blackened. He says he didn't kill Angie, whose body was discovered first and uses the fact that Monokuma didn't come up with that rule until after both bodies were discovered as proof that he didn't factor it into his murder plan. You then spend a little while refusing to let him be prematurely voted as Angie's killer, setting him up for this. It turns out he actually did kill both girls, and by admitting to killing Tenko, he ended up unwittingly providing evidence that links him to Angie's murder.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KaizoTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KaizoTrap">Kaizo Trap</a>: After a grueling fight with the true final boss of the Despair Dungeon, Monokuma V3, you gain access to the final chest trove with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">Ultimate Lucky Student Proof</a>.

That is because, when he had to connect the cords to the VR set, he followed Himiko's nervous instruction, which indicated that the red cord goes on the "hand you hold your chopstick in", referring to her right hand. <em>No one knew Gonta was left-handed until he said it... <strong>almost at the end of the trial</strong>.

In the finale, Shuichi Saihara rejects K1-B0's hope, as a hope-filled ending for this season of <em>Danganronpa</em> would stimulate the audience and lead to future killing games. Just as much as an ending filled with despair. The ending Shuichi goes for instead is an ending full of <em>disappointment</em>, where everyone threatens to commit suicide together with the intention of pissing off the audience so much that they never want to watch the show again, resulting in its cancellation.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightsOffSomebodyDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightsOffSomebodyDies">Lights Off, Somebody Dies</a>: When Shuichi, Kokichi, Himiko, Korekiyo and Tenko perform a ritual in the dark, Tenko- who is inside a cage, under a sheet, weighed down by a statue - is killed in the time it takes to say the incantation once the candles are put out, without piercing or removing the statue, sheet or cage.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedRoomMystery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedRoomMystery">Locked Room Mystery</a>: A body is found inside a room that could only be bolted from inside.

In Chapter 5 Maki confesses to having "fallen for" Kaito before his execution, but he directs the conversation back to his and Kokichi's plan after telling her that if she fell in love with him, she can learn to love herself.</li><li> Tenko is clearly infatuated with Himiko, but due to their vastly differing personalities, Himiko usually responds with mild annoyance or indifference and starts to prefer the company of Angie. Just as it seems like the two of them have bridged the growing distance between them, Tenko is killed in the s&eacute;ance - and for added injury, Himiko would have died if Tenko hadn't volunteered to take her place.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegamixGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegamixGame">Megamix Game</a>: Characters from the previous game appear in the last trial, and each murder case is more thematic and exclusive compared to the previous two games.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime">Metal Slime</a>: In <em>Despair Dungeon: Monokuma's Test</em>, copper, silver, gold and platinum version of the Monokumamels (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoomba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoomba">generic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> of the mode) will occasionally appear which are strong as hell by comparison. The higher the floor number, the higher the version will show up. They have really high defense and attack stats and can run away.

Thus it has room to play with and comment on the familiar aspects of the franchise.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityKitchenSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityKitchenSink">Morality Kitchen Sink</a>: The morality of the cast is <em>very</em> diverse to say the least.

This is in line with his own game's Case 3, where "belief without doubt is a lie" is the underlying theme.</li><li> Kokichi dislikes pork's feet. This could be viewed as a reference to Hiyoko's nickname towards the Ultimate Imposter in DR2 with her calling them "Mr. Porkfeet".</li><li> Other items in Mind Mine in the demo besides the kitchen knife are a crystal ball and a dumbbell.</li><li> One of presents is a white grabbing hand called "Tentacle Machine", referencing Kotoko's "motivation machine" she used to molest Komaru in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanganronpaAnotherEpisodeUltraDespairGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanganronpaAnotherEpisodeUltraDespairGirls">Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls</a></em>.</li><li> The "Outlaw Run" game in the casino has you driving a car in Towa City and running over blue and purple silhouettes representing civilians.</li><li> During Rantaro's second free time event, he tells Kaede that he could be the Ultimate Murderous Fiend for all they know.</li><li> The first Rebuttal Showdown is against the victim of Chapter 2, just like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Danganronpa2GoodbyeDespair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Danganronpa2GoodbyeDespair">Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair</a></em>.</li><li> By all initial appearances, it looks like Ryoma's Chapter 2 murder harkens back to an unused execution from the first <em>Danganronpa</em> game. In it, Aoi Asahina was put into a tank for a magic show trick, and when the curtain goes up again, only her bones remained.</li><li> Angie's first free time event makes a reference to Jabberwock Island:<div class="indent"> <strong>Angie</strong>: I sorta remember a place like that... Jabba-something Island, I think?</div></li><li> In the Neo World Program, Himiko is disappointed that it's a snowy mansion and chapel, and wishes it was a tropical island.</li><li> During the first class trial, everyone has to discuss the possibility that someone was able to kill the victim from another room by throwing a shot put ball at them with lethal force. Just like how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc">Leon Kuwata used his throwing skills to access an incinerator that was blocked off with a gate</a>.</li><li> During the third class trial, it was falsely suggested that one of the victims committed suicide just like in <em>Danganronpa 2</em>.</li><li> Kaede isn't the first musician in the series to be killed by strangulation with a rope and had her lifeless body left hanging. Additionaly, her execution finishes with a Casting Gag as her body is crushed. It gets even better when it's revealed that the Chapter 1 Class Trial, just like the Chapter 5 Class Trial of the original game, is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameUp">Frame-Up</a> orchestrated by the mastermind in order to cover up their own crimes. However, it was possible for Makoto Naegi to outwit the mastermind in the original <em>Danganronpa</em> (and the canonical choice as well), to the point that even when Monokuma attempts to execute him in retaliation he's foiled by Alter Ego. By contrast, the mastermind's scheme goes off without a hitch in <em>V3</em> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantThwartStageOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantThwartStageOne">it's impossible to save Kaede even if you're aware of the truth.</a></li><li> Gonta's execution references how the past Chapter Four killers died as he was poisoned like Sakura and he was run over by animals like Gundham. In addition, an AI version of himself is executed as well, similarly to how Alter Ego was executed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc">the first game</a>.</li><li> Just like in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc">the first game</a>, the Chapter Five victim was unknown at the start of the investigation.</li><li> Just like in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Danganronpa2GoodbyeDespair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Danganronpa2GoodbyeDespair">the second game</a>, Chapter Five has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate">Token Evil Teammate</a> orchestrate his own death in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit">Thanatos Gambit</a>.</li><li> Kaito's execution is a recreation of the Headmaster's execution in the first game's prologue. However, Kaito succumbs to his disease before it can be finished.</li><li> Tsumugi's skill is called "2D Love" which is a reference to Hifumi's love for 2D Girls.</li><li> The third murder involves a katana with gold leaf covering that easily rubs off, just like the first murder of the first game.</li><li> During the third trial, Tsumugi suggests that Tenko's murderer may have stabbed her from below by hiding in the crawl space under the floorboards and marking her location with glowing paint, which is how the first murder of the second game was carried out.</li><li> Once again, an Alter Ego character comes into play. This time, the survivors use Alter Ego Gonta to find out their motivation for committing the fourth murder, since the flesh-and-blood culprit is suffering from amnesia due to a botched entry into the Neo World Program.</li><li> The mastermind's room contains the same type of monitor seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3">Danganronpa 3</a> Future Arc</em>.</li><li> The Hope's Peak Academy Monopad theme costs 11037 casino coins.</li><li> In K1-B0's event with Miu in the Ultimate Talent Development Plan, she suggests giving him the feature to "cry" juice and tea from his eyes, similar to Mechamaru.</li><li> During the final trial, one of Tsumugi's lines is phrased very similarly to one of Junko's lines from Case 6 of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc">the first game</a>, though altered to reflect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrumanShowPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrumanShowPlot">the nature of the new killing game</a>:</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Junko (DR1):</strong> In other words, if you see despair as the enemy, then your enemy...is the world itself!</div><div class="indent"><strong>Tsumugi:</strong> So if you want to make me your enemy...then your enemy is the world of <em>Danganronpa</em> itself!</div><ul><li> Then following that she says lines, cosplaying as different characters that are references to things they have said in the past games or that stay in-character: The final piece of evidence that reveals Leon as the first killer in DR1 is when the characters realize Sayaka's dying message was a series of letters not numbers.</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Leon:</strong> But isn't it just rad how it looks like a letter but it's really a number!</div><ul><li> After Nagito earns the prize from the final dead room he learns Hajime has no talent:</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Nagito (DR2):</strong> An average, talentless human....That's right, you were never an Ultimate! you had no talent whatsoever.</div><div class="indent"><strong>Nagito:</strong> You're just normal, average, everyday people, with no Ultimate talent whatsoever.</div><ul><li> Chiaki's speech to Hajime during the final class trial in DR2 is said as words of encouragement to inspire the indecisive Hajime to just act, with the faith everything will work out. However, Tsumugi repeats this phrase, telling the V3 cast, they believed in their fake talents so much that just acting upon them led to desirable outcomes.</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Chiaki (DR2):</strong> I guess what I'm trying to say is... If you just do it, things will turn out okay.</div><div class="indent"><strong>Chiaki:</strong> Kinda like a form of auto suggestion...you know like if you do it, it'll all work out.</div><ul><li> In DR2 Sonia is a serial killer enthusiast. In V3 Tsumugi compares giving the V3 cast fake talents, personalities, and upbringings to what happens in the Netflix series <em>Making a Murderer</em>.</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Sonia:</strong> Much like that delightful documentary <em>Making a Murderer</em>.</div><ul><li> In DR2 the 4th Trial is spurred on due to Gundham's displeasure with his friends resigning themselves to die and no longer trying to live, all to avoid killing each other. Tsumugi uses his line to show displeasure with everyone refusing to vote (grounds for immediate death), to end the killing game with a unsatisfying ending for the audience.</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Gundham:</strong> Such foolishness! To cast your life away is the height of stupidity./(Non-stop debate) To choose death is a blaspheme against life itself.</div><ul><li> The DR2 ending was about Hajime moving to the future with all it's uncertainties, and the importance in deciding your own future. In the same Non-stop debate as above Tsumugi uses it as an excuse for why the V3 cast should move forward.</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Hajime:</strong> You can't throw away your futures.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">Multiple Endings</a>: This game has four endings.<ul><li> Good ending: The kids make it to the end of the Death Road of Despair during the first chapter and everyone gets to leave without a single person dying.</li><li> Bad ending: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins">Tsumugi succeeds at destroying everyone's hope verbally, they learned about their past lives and the fact they auditioned for the killing game...</a> But it's actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FissionMailed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FissionMailed">Fission Mailed</a>.</li><li> True ending: (picking up where the false bad ending left off) Everyone gets their moment of glory and together they decide to end the killing game. Though K1-B0 sacrifices himself by killing Tsumugi and destroying the school.</li><li> Another bad ending that's more like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver">Non Standard Game Over</a>: Shuichi ran out of time during the final investigation, and K1-B0 decided to destroy the entire school because of that.</li><li> The Dangan Salmon Team has three endings.

If you get to the evening of Day 10 with at least one classmate's values maxed out, you can view their endings.

Turns out it's an almost literal meaning. There were 53 killing games including the current one. V can also stand for 5. There's also three survivors, or in other words, 3 people were victorious. This is also to differentiate it from the anime which completes the Hope's Peak Academy's saga &mdash; it should in theory limit confusion by not having the main games jump to the number 4.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel">Off-Model</a>: Some of the cutscene CGs look like they are drawn by different people who are obviously trying to mimic the game's signature style. Also, Tenko is missing her left hand in the CG showing all the students after the killing game starts, and in the PS4 and PC versions, Kaito doesn't have his goatee in the scene where the students get their Ultimate clothes in the prologue.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWomanWail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWomanWail">One-Woman Wail</a>: The track that plays when a corpse is discovered, as usual.

Of course, this is all intentional, since it's meant to emotionally torment the characters by giving them a slight hope of escaping, and completing it would make the rest of the game pointless, although it does grant an alternate ending. Later in the game, you need to clear the Death Road to advance the story, but this time you're armed with special hammers that can disable all the traps, making it much easier.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoolScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoolScene">Pool Scene</a>: The hidden bous scene in Chapter 2, where Shuichi sets up a parasol for Tenko at the pool, who brings Angie, Himino and K1-B0 along for a "celebrity like vacation" at the poolside, with Kirumi pampering them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUpLetdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerUpLetdown">Power Up Letdown</a>: The "better" Psyche Taxi granted by the Twin Six skill will just make you crash into the walls and other cars with its faster top speed and big fat ass blocking your view, while also causing you to miss letter cubes that would have otherwise been perfectly timed to move into your path if you were using the default taxi.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductionForeshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductionForeshadowing">Production Foreshadowing</a>: Two mannequins on the left side of Tsumugi's research lab feature the costumes of Sachika Hirasaka and Yuma Mashiro from Spike Chunsoft's then-upcoming game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZankiZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZankiZero">Zanki Zero</a>: Last Beginning</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicDomainSoundtrack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicDomainSoundtrack">Public Domain Soundtrack</a>: <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja7v4JTsLVw">Clair de Lune by Debussy<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is used twice, when Shuichi grieves over Kaede at the end of the first chapter, and during the Rebuttal Showdown between K1-B0 and Shuichi.

This time, Kokichi Oma and Kaito Momota work together to hide the identity of the victim's corpse and make it impossible to tell for sure which one is dead and which one is still alive.</li><li> The Chapter 6 class trial brings to light an earth-shattering revelation that renders everyone's motives for murder completely meaningless.</li><li> Similar to Sakura Oogami and Chiaki Nanami's roles as the "Traitor" in their games, K1-B0 joined in as one. Although, he wasn't aware that he is one.</li><li> In Chapter 3, there is always one fake-out death. The first game has Hifumi faking that he is dead to complicate the order of the murders. The second is Nekomaru's, who was barely alive after the impact of the missile. <em>V3</em> has Kokichi looking like he's dead, but turns out okay before the cutscene ends.</li><li> Chapter 3 features two victims once again.</li><li> Shuichi Saihara fills the male high school student with an ahoge protagonist role as his predecessors did before. Chapter 1 protagonist Kaede also has one, as does in-universe protagonist Keebo.</li><li> The final victim, Kokichi, has the most brutal death, similar to Mukuro, Nagito and Ruruka. His body is so destroyed the rest of the group is unable to identify him.</li><li> The more a character was promoted during pre-release, the more said character is going to die in first chapter &mdash; Kaede is the newest member of the club, joining Sayaka, the Ultimate Imposter, and Chisa.</li><li> The highest title of the game similar to what Makoto Naegi and Hajime Hinata (as Izuru Kamakura) got as the Ultimate Hope was achieved by K1-B0, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> protagonist, in the final trial.</li><li> Maki has a hidden talent, similar to how both Toko and the Ultimate Imposter have hidden talents.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a>:<ul><li> When exploring the cold sleep room, it's revealed that Kaede has a younger twin sister, suggesting that maybe she could be the mastermind and the two are trying to emulate Junko and Mukuro. This turns out not to have a bearing on anything, and said sister may not even be real, especially since it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Tsumugi who suggested (and probably wrote) it.</a></li><li> In the first case, it's suggested that the victim could be killed with a ball thrown from a room directly opposite, and Gonta (who was in that room at that time) is implied as a possible culprit since he had the strength to kill with a thrown ball. In the end, this turns out to be irrelevant.</li><li> In Chapter Four the characters enter a virtual-reality world, using high-tech VR headsets. Miu speculates that if someone connected their VR headset wrong, they might "body swap with someone". After a murder happens in the virtual world, this throwaway line seems to hint that body-swap shenanigans are in play, e.g. the murderer body-swapping with the victim or something like that. Nothing like this happens, however (although the solution <em>does</em> involve one of the characters connecting the VR headset wrong and having their mind messed up as a result).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedIsHeroic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedIsHeroic">Red Is Heroic</a>: Of the five Monokubs, the red Monotaro acts as the de facto leader of their sentai parody team and is the only one to briefly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">act on the side of the students</a>.

Choose despair, and K1-B0 is executed and the killing game continues. Either way, the audience is sated and <em>Danganronpa</em> will continue.
