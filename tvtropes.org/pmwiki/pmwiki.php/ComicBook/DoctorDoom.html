His community was persecuted by the aristocratic regime of Latveria, which played a part in getting Victor orphaned. His mother in her quest for revenge against Latverian soldiers made a deal with Mephisto for power to gain revenge, but her actions backfired and her use of magic led the people of a village to burn her for being a witch, with Cynthia's soul damned to hell. His father Werner, years later, was summoned to treat the nephew of the Baron, and when the nephew couldn't be saved, Werner was blamed, and father and son were chased out of home often travelling in harsh conditions. Werner got frozen protecting Victor from the elements and after being rescued died shortly after. On his father's death, Victor came across his parents' effects, and found a trunk of artifacts belonging to his mother that showed her occult books and instruments. Sympathetic to his father's scientific bent and his mother's mystical bent, Doom from an early age began to combine both and sought to master both magic and technology. As a teenager, Victor became a Romani guerrilla revolutionary, building gadgets of unusual sophistication subverting and dodging the Latverian government and its secret police, protecting his community and always being a step ahead of everyone.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Word of his exploits attracted a sponsorship from the US Government, who perhaps in an aim to subvert the Latverian government and build up a new client in Eastern Europe, offered the dashing young rebel an opportunity to study in America. On his arrival to America, Doom had a fateful meeting with Reed Richards, the only man on the planet whose intelligence could even approach Doom's, to whom he grew an immediate dislike. Wishing to resurrect his dead mother, Doom constructed a device that could build a portal to Hell intended to communicate with the dead, and allow him to free her soul. When working on his calculations, Reed Richards walked into his room and noticed that his calculations were slightly off and tried to warn him about the flaw in the machine, but Doom, angered at what he saw as an invasion of privacy, continued to work with disastrous results: The device exploded and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScarsAreForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScarsAreForever">damaged his face</a>. Expelled from the university after the accident, Doom traveled the world until he collapsed on a Tibetan mountainside. Rescued by monks from a mysterious order, Victor quickly mastered the monks' secret disciplines, as well as metallurgy. Doom then forged himself a suit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a>, complete with a scowling mask, which he has used (with some modifications) since that day, and took the name Doctor Doom. Shortly afterwards, he led a revolution that toppled the reigning kingdom of Latveria. Upon coming to power, he became a dictator and tyrant, ruling Latveria with an iron fist and using his status as head-of-state to expand his influence on a global scale. Doom's path was soon to once again cross that of Richards, this time along with Richards' family, who became his sworn enemies.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Starting from <em>The Amazing Spider-Man #5</em> however, Doctor Doom started appearing in stories with other heroes, both out of his considerable popularity and his versatility. As many writers and fans note, Doctor Doom's rich character and complex origins allows one to fit him in, and play off, in almost any genre and against any hero. As such he's been consistently a Marvel-wide villain from his inception, making notable appearances as a villain and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">Foil</a> for the likes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>, The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorStrange">Doctor Strange</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">Thor</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LukeCageHeroForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LukeCageHeroForHire">Luke Cage</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SquirrelGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SquirrelGirl">Squirrel Girl</a></em> and more.

Furthermore, when the Fantastic Four helped Prince Zorba depose Doom, they were so horrified at his resulting destructively murderous tyranny that they had to help Doom depose him for the sake of the people of Latveria, and they couldn't get rid of Doom next because Victor prepared too well against them to prevent that.

Indeed, he's so well known that non-comic readers often haven't even heard of the other, lesser enemies of the Fantastic Four. Doom was even used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IronManArmoredAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IronManArmoredAdventures">Iron Man: Armored Adventures</a></em> while the Four weren't, with his origins being changed to having his face scarred by an explosion he used to kill the Latverian royal family, but which also killed his mother and bride.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce">Broken Ace</a>: This is largely the point of Doctor Doom. He's a scientific genius to rival Reed Richards, a magical prodigy who approaches Doctor Strange in power, and physically fit enough that he can kill lions bare-handed; he rules a nation as semi-benevolent dictator, adheres to a code of always repaying his debts, has enough willpower to stare down the Purple Man without flinching, and wears a suit of armour on par with that sported by Iron Man. He could, in theory, be one of the Marvel Universe's greatest forces for good, because in power level you can pick almost any three superheroes and he's the equal of all of them. Unfortunately for the Marvel Universe, his egomania will never stop clouding his judgment. When Reed Richards pointed out a mistake in Doom's calculations, he spat in Reed's face, and when his experiment went wrong and scarred him, he blamed Reed rather than admit, even to himself, that he screwed up, and dedicated the rest of his life to a needless revenge for a nonexistent crime. His hideous scarring is his own fault because believing his good looks to already be ruined by the thin scar he had received, he donned the iron mask to his first suit of armour without waiting for it to cool first. His people fear him more than love him; he has no friends; most of his intellectual equals are superheroes who would be suspicious at an invitation to discuss something; he's a pariah on the international stage. All because of his swollen ego. Ultimately, deep down he&#146;s an angry, bitter, petty little man who can never admit a mistake, devotes all his brilliance and talents to showing up his old college rival, and once killed the only woman who ever loved him for just a little more power.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday">But for Me, It Was Tuesday</a>: Once, a misshapen creature attacked Doom, claiming he had once used him as the subject of an experiment and declared himself "the man whose life you destroyed."

Moreover, it is stated that such self-destruct mechanisms are installed under all Latverian villages. Nowadays Doom, who is depicted as caring to some extent about all of Latveria, would never contemplate such a heinous act.</li><li> He's also taken to wearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassInANiceSuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassInANiceSuit">a finely tailored suit</a> instead of his more familiar armor, no longer refers to himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdPersonPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdPersonPerson">in the third person</a>, and while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOfWealthAndTaste" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOfWealthAndTaste">he once had one of the finest French chefs on his staff</a>, he waited for Tony Stark at a children's hospital while consuming a bag of potato chips. He also proclaimed that he no longer wishes to rule over Latveria, as he's seen his true calling ahead of him.

Perhaps one of the more obvious contrasts, Doom sports a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCape">Badass Cape</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> compared to the relatively simple designs the Fantastic Four have in their uniforms.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosetGeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosetGeek">Closet Geek</a>: Enough so to correct Spider-Man on an <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry.

Generally this does little to improve the overall results of his many conspiracies beyond giving the heroes (and sometimes other villains) a good workout.

All Spider-Man could do to convince Doom to stave him off is to bargain with him (both of them were after a jewel thief who stole a valuable gem, which happens to be a Latverian artifact and a heirloom belonging to Doom's mother). Doom relented and gave Spidey 24 hours to find the thief, recover the artifact or he would kill both him and that thief.

Additionally, Byrne also created a compromise that's often used - namely, the accident gave him a small scar, but when he put on his mask for the first time, it hadn't cooled yet, and it gave him actual severe burns - Doom would rather be maimed under his mask than spend even a few more seconds with a tiny flaw for all to see, and it dovetails with the idea that most of Doom's problems are self-inflicted.</li><li> In general, Doom's general voice ranges from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">reserved, calculating, and articulate</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">ranting, mercurial, and pretentious.</a> Consensus is that the first one is more intimidating, while the second is more fun.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Determinator</a>: The only thing more impervious than Doom's armor is Doom's <em>will</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiplomaticImpunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiplomaticImpunity">Diplomatic Impunity</a>: As the rightful sovereign of Latveria, superheroes hesitate to act against Doom when he is in the USA on diplomatic business; being the legitimate ruler of Latveria, he cannot be arrested for his crimes without causing a diplomatic incident.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilityAsAnExcuseForJerkassery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilityAsAnExcuseForJerkassery">Disability as an Excuse for Jerkassery</a>: Doom uses the excuse that he finds Reed Richards responsible for the accident that caused his scarring as justification for hounding him.

To quote an old maxim, "He who fights and runs away, lives to fight another day." Though even Doom can forget this when dealing with matters of the heart: following a fight with the Hulk, he refused at the time to admit that he had lost, even though the only thing keeping Hulk from killing Doom was Valeria, as she reminded him of Betty Ross.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Large Ham</a>: Doom not only refers to himself in the third person, he can also speak <strong>IN CAPITALS</strong> when necessary.

His pride generally prevents him from breaking his word outright, but breaking the spirit of it is fair game. Once, Dr. Doom trapped poor Franklin in Hell, and while holding baby Valeria, promised Reed he'd release his child if he surrendered. Reed complied, and Doom promptly... put Valeria down.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouCrazy">Love Makes You Crazy</a>: This trope came irresistibly when he found himself pausing to rescue his lover Valeria during a confrontation with the Hulk. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGoodDeedGoesUnpunished" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGoodDeedGoesUnpunished">And because he was thus distracted, the Hulk was able to grapple him and nearly crush him</a> before Valeria, who reminded the brute of Betty Ross, convinced him to let him go.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a>: A scientist that uses his profession to try to conquer the Earth, and then some.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMyMonsterGrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMyMonsterGrow">Make My Monster Grow</a>: Doom assumed giant form in <em>Secret Wars</em> and <em>Avengers: The Children's Crusade</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a>: Doom is one of the few residents of the Marvel Universe who possesses the skill and genius required to combine sorcery and super-science.

What <em>truly</em> damaged Doom's face was when he had his original suit of armor forged and impatiently decided to put the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFace">still red-hot metal mask on</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisBlamed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisBlamed">Mis-blamed</a>: In-universe, often there are those who blame Doom for their own failings or flaws.

He was still vastly superior to all other beings. Still, Doom chose to help the heroes simply because it allowed him to stretch his still-impeccable intellect and retain mental lucidity for greater periods of time. It was made known in no uncertain terms, however, that if he ever became healthy again, Doom would once again put the world under his iron fist.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralSociopathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralSociopathy">Moral Sociopathy</a>: Doctor Doom subscribes to a personal code of honour that concerns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyWord">always keeping his word</a>, repaying any debt he owes to another, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing">looking after the welfare of the people of Latveria</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">working to eradicate poverty, famine, disease, and war</a> via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">world domination</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsMilkSquick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsMilkSquick">ruthlessly avenging any and every insult to his character, real or imagined</a>.

Doom could always feel the demon's claws on his face as was constantly plagued by taunting nightmares, and was eager/impatient to put on the armor because he had it enchanted to block those feelings.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyopicConqueror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyopicConqueror">Myopic Conqueror</a>: He once successfully conquered the entire planet.

Taken even further in some versions of his origin, where the scarring is fairly minor, but he insists on putting on his famous mask before it's finished cooling, due to his need to "conceal" the imperfection.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">Never My Fault</a>: The entire basis of Doctor Doom's vendetta against the Fantastic Four is that he is unable to accept that Reed Richards was actually right when warning him of a critical error in his calculations during an experiment Doom was conducting. Doom dismissed Reed's warnings as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoureJustJealous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoureJustJealous">jealousy</a>, only for the experiment to blow up in his face. The idea that Richards was correct- and therefore, in Doom's eyes, smarter than him- was so abhorrent to Doom that he concluded that Reed had deliberately sabotaged Doom's experiment, and so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">has attempted to creatively kill Richards and his family on numerous occasions</a>. Even more jarring is that the retcon shows that Doom really was right and Richards was indeed wrong: the machine worked perfectly.

It is not surprising then that he does make few promises, or that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">very carefully words</a> those promises which he does make.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoChallengeEqualsNoSatisfaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoChallengeEqualsNoSatisfaction">No Challenge Equals No Satisfaction</a>: Ran into this <em>Emperor Doom</em>.

Needless to say, it makes for an interesting showdown when he's fighting Iron Man. Indeed, while the armor was one of Doom's first inventions (aside from Stark's, it's arguably the most famous example of this trope), it has been upgraded and improved several times over the years; no matter how powerful its technology is, it can <em>always</em> be better.

The accident that damaged his face happened because he was too arrogant to believe Reed Richards had found an error in his calculations. The minor scar Doom received he saw as horribly disfiguring due to his vanity, and in desperation to hide it he ended up really messing his face up. He was unable to even admit to himself of his mistake in either instance. His supervillain-sized lust for power is rooted in his belief that he should be second to no one, particularly Richards. This is also why he always rebuffs others' attempts to rehabilitate him. He just can't accept the pity and sympathy of others. Doom views himself as insuperable, and many setbacks have occurred as a result of letting that belief get in the way of more immediate concerns.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild">Psychopathic Manchild</a>: Is sometimes portrayed as this, especially when Richards is concerned.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">Pyrrhic Victory</a>: Regarding Doom's mother's soul.

He could have responded to him faster than the heroes did, Latveria being a neighboring country.</li><li> Some, like the Invisible Woman, have also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCouldHaveUsedYourPowersForGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCouldHaveUsedYourPowersForGood">said that there are far better things that Doom could be doing that than trying to kill Reed Richards</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Storm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Storm">Storm</a> herself has pointed this out when he was helping her friend Shadowcat.</li><li> He was once on the giving end of one when he pointed out to Tony Stark that if he truly wished to help the infirm children at the hospital he was visiting, he would do better to simply find cures for their ailments.

Reed has everything Doom doesn't <em>quite</em> have: a family, loyal friends, public acknowledgement, admiration from people who aren't brainwashed subjects of his own dictatorship, good looks (which Doom once <em>had</em>, and blames Richards for their destruction), acknowledgment as a hero, and most important of all, a handful more IQ points, which he has used to defeat Doom and foil his plans time and time again.

He later became known as the Dreadknight, and spent most of his time opposing Iron Man.

Doom's experiments in transdimensional shifting blew up his dorm room and got him expelled before he'd attained a degree. Nevertheless, Doom's raw intellect has transformed feudal Latveria into a showpiece of Europe. Further, Doom studied the arcane arts, seeking to free his gypsy witch mother's soul from the lower netherworld.

Doom's response:<div class="indent"><strong>Doctor Doom</strong>: <strong>Gratitude??</strong> Such weak words are not for <strong>Doctor Doom!</strong> <strong>Here</strong> is your reward! <em>(slaps him)</em> Be grateful I do not put you to death for knowing how I have been <strong>tricked!</strong></div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In the <em>Books of Doom</em> story, due to it being one of his many Doombots</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUsurper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUsurper">The Usurper</a>: Doom replaced certain members of the royal family and had others killed in order to take the throne from the Duchy it was under.
