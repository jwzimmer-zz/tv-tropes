As they travel the land, they encounter the desert-dwelling Sunfolk elves, the childless Gliders, the pragmatic Go-Backs, the sea-bound Wavedancers and many more friends and adversaries of different species. Over the course of a plot that spans tens of thousands of years, the Wolfrider families and their loved ones come to uncover the secret of their otherwordly ancestry.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>After many years of successful publication, the creators decided to let other authors and artists step in.

Wendy Pini eventually returned to the series.</p><p>The main series concluded with the four volume series 'The final quest' that ran from Janaury 2014- February 2018 which was ahead of the series 40th anniversary. A new series, <em>ElfQuest: Stargazer's Hunt</em> began November, 2019.</p><p>The full series has been re-published many times over, although the original hand-drawn pencils and organic colors were never redone.

Special shout-outs to Leetah's floorlength duster from the second book (which is not worn with an actual shirt), Dewshine's strapless-and-plunging-neckline dresses that seem to casually ignore gravity, Tyldak's fur singlet thing that may or may not technically be his own hair, and pretty much everything Strongbow has ever worn.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless">The Ageless</a>: The Elves, Trolls, and Preservers do not die of old age as long as they're either pureblood or a hybrid between any of those three.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirHugging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirHugging">Air Hugging</a>: in the first novel.

Savah calls him a fighting cockerel a few times.</li><li> Skywise is a fox, and frequently shows foxlike traits like trickery and playfulness.</li><li> Leetah is a cat, particularly in some of her more graceful moments and somewhat haughty demeanor.</li><li> Winnowill is a snake. Her hair is reminiscent of a cobra's hood, and she's frequently referred to as a "black snake". She's occasionally drawn in conjunction with spiders, in some of her less-than-virtuous moments.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Adaptation</a> (<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elfquest#Animated_video_series">Never made it to the air.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a>: This is Venka's power, which made her one of the strongest weapons the Wolfriders ever had against Winnowill.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApeShallNeverKillApe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApeShallNeverKillApe">Ape Shall Never Kill Ape</a><ul><li> The "first" time this happens ("in the collective memory of the tribes" at least, and after several failed attempts), when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Strongbow kills Kureel</span>, he falls into a deep depression for over a full issue.</li><li> Before Cutter and Strongbow had to kill humans to rescue Redlance at the beginning of the series, Cutter hadn't even been sure it was possible to do so; this implies that this trope had previously extended to Ape Shall Never Kill <em>Other Species</em> Of Ape.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArborealAbode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArborealAbode">Arboreal Abode</a>: While the Wolf Riders lived in the Holt they made their homes in the Father Tree, which had been hollowed out by Goodtree.<ul><li> Later on, during <em>Kings of the Broken Wheel</em>, they take this even further by having Redlance shape their dens almost in the canopy, to avoid ever being discovered by humans.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmsAndArmorThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmsAndArmorThemeNaming">Arms and Armor Theme Naming</a>: Strongbow's son is named Dart, and Dart's son is Bowki (combining his father's name with his erstwhile friend Geoki). The line can be extended to four generations if you use "archery" rather than "weapons" as a theme: Strongbow's mother was named Trueflight.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AstralProjection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AstralProjection">Astral Projection</a>: Some elves, like Savah and Suntop, have an ability to "go out" of their bodies.

It's also what makes the catch-up scene near the beginning of the very second story, <em>Siege at Blue Mountain,</em> somewhat clunky. The Pinis managed to avoid it, mostly, in the third story, <em>Kings of the Broken Wheel</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a><ul><li> Nonna and Adar, and later their adopted kids (who are named after various WaRP projects).</li><li> In addition to this, Wendy has stated that while Nonna and Adar are the human counterparts of her and Richard, Cutter and Skywise are their elven counterparts. Wendy's initial plot included killing off Skywise early on, in the ninth issue, but when she mentioned it, Richard reportedly said "You can't do that, he's my elf."</li><li> What tipped the scales was the fact that Skywise was the nearest thing his tribe had to an astronomer, since that was also Richard's hobby.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter">Babies Ever After</a>: Practically every story arc ends with one elf pregnant: Rainsong starts out pregnant in the very first issue, Leetah is pregnant at the end of the first arc, Dewshine <em>and</em> Kahvi at the end of the first Palace war, Nightfall after the elves move to the new continent, Tyleet (Nightfall's daughter) at the end of the arc before the second Palace war, Krim at the end of the second Palace war, Behtia after the <em>little</em> Palace war, Dodia after the Forevergreen quest, Moonshade after The Searcher And The Sword, and Brill after Discovery.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesMakeEverythingBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesMakeEverythingBetter">Babies Make Everything Better</a>: Played <em>utterly and completely</em> straight, usually. Justified by the elves' tiny population and slow rate of reproduction (between the <em>two year</em> pregnancies and most elves' inability to conceive without Recognition, a couple with three children is considered <em>absurdly</em> fertile). Rare exceptions include:<ul><li> Winnowill, whose child is half-Troll. It's an especially unique subversion, since Winnowill gave birth to him after the Gliders became infertile. For her to have borne a child should have been a huge positive event for them, if not for his being half-Troll, and Winnowill tortured him into insanity to protect her secrets.</li><li> Skywise, whose initial reaction to seeing his daughter Yun is somewhat of an "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a>". He's visibly relieved when Yun immediately says she doesn't expect him to act like a daddy. They quickly become friends.</li><li> Also somewhat subverted with Pike, being the child of Rain and Rain's first lifemate. As a wolfrider, he <em>should</em> technically have been born as a result of Recognition, it being the only way for wolfriders to have children within the tribe. However, Rain was a healer, and managed to use his powers to force conception, resulting in Pike. All sides agree that the experiment should be considered "tampering with nature too much", and although it's never really revealed whether or not Pike has anything wrong with him, Leetah expresses (carefully worded) concern over his ability to ever Recognize someone himself. However, the process is repeated by Leetah on purpose when she helps Nightfall and Redlance conceive, using the Palace's magic amplification to complete the experiment and to force both conception <em>and</em> Recognition. Apparently that worked much better, since Tyleet ends up with a soul name and ability to Recognize.</li><li> Ember and Teir. She's not that interested in becoming a mother, and when they recognize in the middle of a pitched battle, it seriously complicates things at the worst possible moment. They end up having the magic-users suppress their recognition until they're ready for it some time down the line.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a><ul><li> The Go-Backs, who don't do any of that magic stuff. They just fight bears. With spears. They die often, but they make a <em>lot</em> of babies without even needing to Recognize. When a young Go-Back does turn out to have telekinetic powers, Kahvi tells him in very clear terms to cut it out (until it later proves useful).</li><li> Lehrigen: He's human. And he learns enough tracking and woodlore to put him on an equal footing with the elves. He even picks up their language somehow.</li><li> Tyleet's adopted son Little Patch, thanks to being raised by the Wolfriders from birth.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBaroness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBaroness">The Baroness</a>: Winnowill.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGrabsAGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGrabsAGun">Batman Grabs a Gun</a>: Strongbow <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kills Kureel</span>. Later, in the Final Quest arc, he plays it even more straight, when he <em>actually</em> grabs a gun and kills a human warlord with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAimingSkills">Improbable Aiming Skills</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleOfWits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleOfWits">Battle of Wits</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted">Subverted</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness">Beauty = Goodness</a>: Averted with elves, Winnowill is a stunner and about as malignant as you can get, whereas bent old Ekuar is probably the most selfless elf ever. But played pretty straight with humans &mdash; you can generally gauge how much of a threat a particular human is going to be by the ugly-factor.<ul><li> In the case of elves, at least, the trope itself is present in their culture, partly because of their belief that elves don't kill their own and partly because being attractive is just sort of the default state of elven appearance in general. Cutter learns the hard way that an elf can be every bit as bad as (or worse than) a human through Winnowill, and Leetah is genuinely surprised to find out that humans aren't ugly monsters.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelatedHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelatedHappyEnding">Belated Happy Ending</a>: For Ahdri and The Broken One. Aurek, too.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterAsFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterAsFriends">Better as Friends</a>: Shuna thinks she and Kimo would have been a couple if they'd been of the same species. It's unclear whether or not Kimo agrees, but regardless, they end up being best friends (she also seems to be in denial about the fact that Kimo is Dart's lovemate).<ul><li> Cutter and Nightfall. As the youngest children in the tribe, it seemed like they would end up together, but Nightfall soon became Redlance's lifemate. After Leetah is kidnapped, Redlance and Nightfall invite Cutter to become their mate for as long as it takes, but never see him as their lifemate. Both before and after that long period, the four of them frequently share a bed; Nightfall and Redlance stated that they thought of Leetah as a part of their family after she used her healing magic to help them conceive.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>: Winnowill.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a>: The Go-Backs' first appearance.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo">Big "NO!"</a>: Leetah's reaction when Ekuar verifies that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rayek has kidnapped them some ten-thousand-odd years&mdash;well beyond Cutter's possible lifespan&mdash;into the future</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a>: What Winnowill does to many of her victims, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph">twisting their forms into monstrous shapes</a>.

He even implies that the Wolfriders being forced into the troll caves and the tunnel of golden light was factored into his plans, because he was prepared to push them out of the desert if they stayed there too long.

At least for a time.</li><li> Later in <em>Stargazer's Hunt</em>, Timmain reveals this to Skywise. He doesn't quite go mad, but has a rather severe breakdown over it.

While most elves are tied to nature and depend on it (with "the restless ones" as the most extreme example), humans have a tendency to mess with nature in unhealthy ways. This goes back to the beginning of the original quest, where the human shaman orders a cleansing of the forest, burning it to the ground. Later, humans are not above trying other methods in the same vein, forcing the elves to fight, not only for their way of life, but for the preservation of nature itself.

The Wolfriders are very young by elf standards (even Treestump), but they outclass <em>every</em> other elven culture, physically, spiritually, or both, with the explanation that their culture has been fighting humans since the tribe began. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Timmain pretty much declares it when she explains the origins of the elves.

They also have no magic or Recognition, and only Kahvi can send.</li><li> The Wolfriders themselves have the distinction of being the only tribe that has been consistently breeding through Recognition (which ensures the resulting children will have the strongest possible combination of their parents' genes)<em>and</em> dying often enough for their numbers to need replenishing, meaning they've gone through several generations of genetically-ideal pairs of parents producing genetically-ideal children. The Sun Folk rarely have children and the Gliders have none at all <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> unless you count Tyldak</span> because they have healers to tend accidental injuries and don't engage in combat.

It's triggered when he meets his daughter Venka for the first time, who was trained her whole life to stop him. She refuses to, telling him that it has to be his own choice. It should be noted that the grief he felt when he was told Venka died at birth was his impetus to begin the sequence of actions that culminated in in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">Heel Realization</a>.

To their credit when the situation changes, the Sun Folk accept the need to train to become tougher. As it is, they have no choice since Leetah and most of the Wolfriders have to leave and find Cutter and Skywise on their quest, but at least one of the remaining Wolfriders, Rainsong, has yet another child on the way and she knows he, who would be called Mender, will become a healer himself in due time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan">The Plan</a>: Two Edge <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> manufactures a war between Elf and Troll over a period of <em>centuries</em> just to figure out his identity</span>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette">which then falls apart almost immediately</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyComicRelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyComicRelief">Plucky Comic Relief</a>: Pike, for much of the series.

In the first story arc, Leetah Recognizing Cutter isn't a problem because she's already seeing Rayek; it's a problem because Rayek doesn't want to be part of a triad with Cutter. After the Palace was found, Pike, Krim and Skot become a lifemate triad without Recognition. Cutter comes to live with Nightfall and Redlance during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlowPath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlowPath">The Slow Path</a> when Leetah is gone. Dart has two lifemates for a while when he Recognises a Sorrow's End elf while in wrapsleep. Dewshine, Scouter and Tyleet eventually become lifemates as well and choose to share soulnames. Cutter and Skywise consider themselves Recognized lifemates as much as is possible for two elves of the same sex. Aside from steady relationships, almost all elves freely switch sexual partners when they want to &mdash; Moonshade and Strongbow being the only known exceptions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPerversionPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPerversionPotential">Power Perversion Potential</a>:<ul><li> The healers. In the novelization <em>Journey to Sorrow's End</em>, it's explained that Leetah can compensate herself for the sometimes dangerous work of healing by learning "secrets" about her patients that she can unlock as a gift later, if she chooses. Winnowill probably also used this to manipulate Voll, Rayek, Two-Edge's dad, and maybe even Tyldak.</li><li> In one storyline, Leetah once joined Nightfall and Redlance while they made love (or was at least in the same room, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexyDiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexyDiscretionShot">it's left intentionally vague</a>), using her healing powers to allow them to conceive (as they weren't Recognized, Nightfall and Redlance could not conceive without Leetah's assistance). By the time she's finished, she's so horny she can barely speak &mdash; she just gives Cutter this smoldering look that says "We are leaving the party <em>right now</em>."</li><li> In a later story (though speaking to an earlier time) Leetah is shown to have the ability to "encourage" Recognition in others and has sessions as an "Initiator" that involve lots of group sex or petting sessions. Rayek asks her to show him something she's never shown another and a later panel shows him having his mind fairly well blown. In later times, Cutter implies Rayek is not the only one to experience special "gifts" from Leetah's powers. Skywise states he has heard rumor Leetah can (whisperwhisper) and Cutter replies "I'd be nutmash if she did that all the time. Couldn't walk straight, let alone be chief." It seems Mender has this ability from his healing gifts in some measure as well. When Mender joins the Wolfriders and he and Leetah are hanging out at the swimming hole with the tribe, it is noted yet again how Leetah and Mender's combined healer's auras are making everyone incredibly horny and as pages previous there were complaints of no recent Recognitions or pregnancies, it appears to be another example of "Initiation" to raise and encourage fertility.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreciousPuppy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreciousPuppy">Precious Puppy</a>: Choplicker in the original series: he's Ember's wolf companion and cuteness personified as a cub.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a>: Including one character (Strongbow) who rarely if ever talks, relying on telepathy instead.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicSurgery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicSurgery">Psychic Surgery</a>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands">healers' powers</a>.

Humans always seem to lack one quality to really make a character whom you would want to identify with: If a human is morally a good guy, they usually meekly admire the elves (Nonna, the Woodcutter). If they're proud, they're megalomaniacal (Grohmul and Angrif Djun, Aramak). If they're intelligent and skillful, they're also morally questionable (Lehrigen the bounty hunter) or duplicitous (Gifa, Pei-Lar). Human families never seem to be truly complete either. Either they're abusive, or the couple are not truly in love with each other, or they're implied to be barren (Nonna and Adar), or they cannot depend on each other (old Little Patch being abandoned). Those humans who have a good relationship with the elves, seem to reject their own species (Khorbasi and, to a lesser degree, Shuna). <br><br>Exceptions to this trope in Elfquest are rare but not quite nonexistent. Adar (Nonna's husband and Richard Pini's literary stand-in) and Bolli (the Woodcutter's wife) stand out as skeptical and practical-minded folk who nonetheless are ready to work with the elves. The naval explorer Cam Triompe sees the elves with an advanced, almost anthropologist's eye, and in later stories is openly allied with two elves helping to fight off a local human despot.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuest">The Quest</a>: It's right there in the title.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestForTheRest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestForTheRest">Quest for the Rest</a>: The titular Quest is all about this, as it's about the Wolfriders searching for other elves so their tribes can unite.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne">The Quiet One</a>: Strongbow and Tyldak.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Railroading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Railroading">Railroading</a>: The courtship trial for Leetah. There was pretty much no way Cutter was going to lose. Rayek points out that Cutter cheated at the test of wits, but no one cares. Savah rules Cutter the winner because he supposedly didn't know the lodestone was anything but lucky, but he believed in its 'magical' properties from the get-go. Ultimately, though, it was the test of courage that decided the issue - the moment Rayek lost face he knew he'd lost the trial. More importantly, Recognition means that Cutter and Leetah were forced by nature to have a child, no matter what her choice of lifemate would have been.

However, Cutter is far too much of a gentleman to <em>ever</em> considering taking that option, preferring to reason with her with more patience than his father would have ever displayed. Leetah realizes that choice on his part despite the great discomfort the urge imposes on anyone resisting the urge says a lot about how much a considerate and civilized man he is.</li><li> Dewshine, later on, Recognises Tyldak and genuinely gets into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MateOrDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MateOrDie">Mate or Die</a> situation because of how emotionally incompatible they are.

Leetah attempts this with Cutter by demanding she be allowed to choose when and with whom she lifemates (Wolfrider's take it as a given that if you Recognize, you lifemate. Dewshine is a famous example of throwing this aside). She insists Cutter and Rayek go through the Trial of Hand, Head and Heart because both are pushing for her hand and she doesn't want to be railroaded by either, or by Recognition and hopes these trials will scare both off.

No, not merely a mer-man; a fish-man, giant fins all over and everything.

Winnowill (and Jink) exhibit flesh-shaping. Tyldak is the best example of flesh-shaping vs. shapeshifting. Winnowill pulled the flesh from his own body to create his wings. His wings are grossly misshapen fingers and skin-flaps in between. Timmain is a true shapeshifter. When she took on wolf form to learn to hunt and provide for her people, she said the form started changing how she thought until she was forgetting herself and even her fellow High One's could not lure her back to her old form. Timmain births Timmorn before giving herself over fully, finally, to her wolf form and lives in that form not even being aware she was once an elf until the Palace forces her elf form back onto her 10,000 years later.

Cutter has no idea when his (immortal) lifemate Leetah and their (mortal) children will ever appear again, and he knows that he will die after roughly six thousand years. The first five centuries are torment for him and his tribe, and they eventually decide to have themselves wrapped in a time-freezing cocoon.

Later chapters show that Cutter's time without his family severely traumatized him &mdash; he could simply not stop <em>counting</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallAnnoyingCreature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallAnnoyingCreature">Small, Annoying Creature</a>: The Preservers, but especially Petalwing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a>: The High Ones decided to land on the World of Two Moons because they observed that the resident humans had legends of immortal beings with magical powers and thought others of their kind had settled there. They took on elfin forms in order to match the humans' depictions of these beings and be recognized as more of the same kind. But due to meddling by the proto-trolls, they wound up 20,000 years back in time...and became the inspiration for those same legends.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a>: Rayek to Winnowill.

Why not?!</div></li><li> The Wolfriders, too, have this attitude in the beginning, when only the males take part in the fight with the humans, or the raid of the Sun Folk. However, it's a rational decision, since they have about twice as many male elves, and think they're the last elves in the world. Once they discover the Sun Folk, they go back to normal. What's interesting is that the Sun Folk presumably have the same "we must protect the females" mentality from when THEY had a severe shortage of females (they're all descended from Savah and one other) and have just kept that attitude long after numbers had evened out.</li><li> It's also the attitude of most of the humans, but since they're stone-aged tribes, that's not odd.</li><li> The warrior trolls all seem to be male.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/STDImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/STDImmunity">STD Immunity</a>: Nobody <em>ever</em> mentions it, although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands">the healers' powers</a> could probably take care of anything that came up.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoner">The Stoner</a>: Pike. His love for the mellow world of a dreamberry haze makes him excellent at telling colorful stories, and he became the tribe's historian ("Keeper of the Howl") because of it.<ul><li> Justified in that dreamberries not only get elves high but also improve their memories - which the Wolfriders don't generally have much use for on account of living in the "Now of wolf-thought".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyEthnicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyEthnicity">Suddenly Ethnicity</a>: Kahvi.

Looks like a manga (Kamui no Ken mostly), reads like 1970s super hero comics.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TangledFamilyTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TangledFamilyTree">Tangled Family Tree</a>: As one could expect by the rules of recognition. Especially tangled when you consider Venka&acute;s daughter Satreeka, born at the end of the Final Quest arc. Venka is the daughter of Kahvi and Rayek. She implies that her daughter is part glider, part go-back, part sun folk and part wolfrider, thus making <em>Windkin</em> the only plausible father - who also fathered Teir by Kahvi, Venka&acute;s mother. That would be (almost) like siring a child by your lovemate&acute;s daughter, or getting pretty close to an incestuous relationship. Teir would then be both brother <em>and</em> uncle of Satreeka. However, it's subverted after Venka reveals that her lovemate Mirff is Satreeka's father, and he's just a Go-Back. She took Satreeka's name from those of members in all elven tribes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearfulSmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearfulSmile">Tearful Smile</a>: Especially the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.elfquest.com/gallery/OnlineComics/OQ/OQ16/DisplayOQ16.html?page=0">magnificent cover<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> for <em>ElfQuest</em> (original series) #16.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThankYourPrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThankYourPrey">Thank Your Prey</a>: Mentioned in <em>Kings of the Broken Wheel</em> #5</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming">Theme Naming</a>:<ul><li> Trueflight -&gt; Strongbow -&gt; Dart -&gt; Bowki.

The wolves then attempt to leap over the trolls, which seems slightly implausible with the elves lowering their centers of gravity.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VaporWear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VaporWear">Vapor Wear</a>: As of <em>Final Quest</em>, female elves living in the palace mostly tend toward translucent gowns and nothing else.

They still have their warrior culture, and want to fight <em>something.</em> This leads to them causing occasional trouble for the other elves.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingShirtlessScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingShirtlessScene">Walking Shirtless Scene</a>: Cutter and Skywise, plus some other male elves, wear nothing more than vests most of the time, which bare their abs.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">War Is Hell</a>: The depiction of the elves' war for the Palace of the High Ones does not shy away from this trope.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaknessTurnsHerOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaknessTurnsHerOn">Weakness Turns Her On</a>: It's stated in the novel that Nightfall and Redlance first got together partly because she felt protective of him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">"Well Done, Son!"

I was sure you'd disapprove.</div><div class="indent"><strong>Strongbow</strong>: I do, you're wasting your time with these shivering fawns. But it's your choice.</div></li><li> Strongbow only communicates using telepathy, and only speaks (whispers, rather) to Dart when he's truly proud of him. Then he unexpectedly has a third child who hates Sending... and <em>loves</em> talking. And they name this child... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Chitter</a></span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a>: If this is the right trope, it's deconstructed in Rayek. The darker side of Rayek's nature shares with Winnowill this alarming idea that "I really do know what's best for my people" coupled with "they can't make the right choice so I'll make it for them." Effectively, one of the greatest sins an EQ villain can commit is choosing to deny the free will of those around him, especially loved ones.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Issue 11 of Final Quest reveals that Cutter has half of Timmain's Soul. He doesn't react well.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">What Measure Is a Non-Human?</a>: Initially, this applies to the elves from the perspective of the humans, who consider them evil spirits to be hunted down and killed in the name of their own great spirit Gotara. However, we see more variety as new tribes both human and elf show up, and though the protagonists' relationship to humans remains cautious out of necessity, they in turn are generally not overly comfortable killing even humans. Meanwhile, trolls do seem to rate somewhat lower than either elves or humans &mdash; they're uncomfortable allies at best, outright enemies of the elves at worst, and they're rarely if ever viewpoint characters despite having <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">arrived with the elves' ancestors</span> and thus presumably about the same amount of background history.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry">Wife Husbandry</a>: Most prominently Rayek and Leetah. Redlance and Nightfall also count, as do Scouter and Tyleet. Justified as elves can live for thousands of years and become sexually active as soon as they hit puberty.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrapItUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrapItUp">Wrap It Up</a>: The <em>Final Quest</em> series is going for a world speed record for Olympic Plot Thread Resolution.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongAssumption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongAssumption">Wrong Assumption</a>: Rayek thinks he's the story's dashing hero, first battling against the filthy savages who come to steal his destined lifemate, then saving the elven race by travelling through time, to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong">Set Right What Once Went Wrong</a> and be with aforementioned destined lifemate in perfect harmony forever. <em>Everyone else</em> disagrees.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiGuys">Yaoi Guys</a>: Many. Dart is the trope's poster boy for the series, having had three male lifemates and only one female one (who he Recognized and shared with her male lifemate). Cutter and Skywise are also sexually involved.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreWorthHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreWorthHell">You Are Worth Hell</a>: When Rayek makes himself into a living prison for Winnowill's soul, Savah <em>immediately</em> follows him so that they can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkTheEarth">Walk the Earth</a> together for all eternity. Rayek is moved, but tells her she has no place in his new life. His mentor Ekuar follows him instead. It's also somewhat implied that Rayek trapping Winnowill inside him is not just to save the world, but also because he doesn't want to live without her &mdash; even as her living prison, he loves her, and would rather suffer a living hell for all eternity than be without her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreTheTranslatedForeignWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreTheTranslatedForeignWord">You Are the Translated Foreign Word</a>: Done only <em>once</em>, with Tyleet's introduction. In all other instances, we only see either the Elvish word or the translation. Tyleet, said to mean "healer's gift", was the first real key the readers got to the Elven language (Tyl = gift, Leet = heal-, from which could then be concluded: Leetah = Healing Light, Tyldak = Gift Of Wings). A minor example later on in the series is when Rayek refers to himself as the "Child Of The Rocks". It's a literal translation of his own name (Ray = child, Ek = rock). (Rock-shapers like Ekuar and his late friends Osek and Mekda also have the "rock" element in their names. Averted with Ahdri as her talent isn't discovered until later in life.) The Pinis said it took a while to come up with the name Tyleet, by combining elements of Tyldak and Leetah's names and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">retConning</a> the derivation of Tyldak as "Gift of Flight".</li></ul><hr>
