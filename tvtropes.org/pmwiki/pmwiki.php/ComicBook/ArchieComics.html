It debuted in <em>Pep Comics</em> #22, 1941 in a story drawn by Bob Montana. A cast slowly grew around him and his buddies, and by the mid-1950s, the world had for the most part developed into the cast we'd now recognize. Preaching that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a>, a large array of stock plots and occurrences (the Love Triangle of Archie, Betty, and Veronica; Jughead conspiring against Reggie or women; Ethel chasing Jughead; Reggie chasing Midge and confounding Moose; Dilton being smart; Chuck obsessing over comic books; Archie and Jughead running afoul of the teachers, etc.) have become among the longest-running motifs in fiction. With the start of Dan DeCarlo as primary artist in the '60s, Archie Comics created its "house style" &#150; one that lasted all the way til 2015, when artists Fiona Staples, Adam Hughes, and Erica Henderson were brought onboard to reinvent the visual look of Archie and his associates in main continuity.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Though the eternal love triangle is the heart of the series, and only the Big Four (Archie, Jug, Ron, and Betty) have any kind of long-running success in solo books, the recurring cast is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">huge</a>, and has only grown as the decades passed. It's very possible to have an <em>Archie</em> story where none of the Big Four appear at all.</p><p>With romance so core to the series, its fanbase is inevitably mostly female (gazing at issues featuring 'dress up' and 'design outfits for the girls to wear', this should be unsurprising). But there is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">significant fanbase of men</a> who grew up reading the books as boys. Archie Comics is also famous, or infamous, for keeping everyone the same age, and altering only the fashion and accessories&#133; making Archie Comics a stereotype-laden snapshot of each decade. Bell-bottom jeans, Nehru jackets, citizens-band radio, disco, etc. are all brought in as new fads and then slowly dropped as new fads come in.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0bvc4');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0bvc4" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0bvc4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The one weird exception to this is Jughead's iconic hat, which actually <em>was</em> a fad in the early 40's, but fell out of fashion soon after. By that time, the hat had become associated with the character to the point that dropping it was out of the question. Nowadays it's a symbol of his quirky personality.</span></p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Well known for being available in news-stands and grocery store checkout magazine racks everywhere (partly due to it also being one of the only comic books that still publish digest-sized issues, perfect for stocking near the checkouts), Archie Comics come and have come in MANY titles, including <em>Archie</em>, <em>Archie Digest</em>, <em>Archie Double Digest</em>, <em>Betty</em>, <em>Veronica</em>, <em>Betty <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs">and</a></strong> Veronica</em>, <em>Jughead</em>, <em>Jughead <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs">with</a></strong> Archie</em>, <em>Archie's Pals and Gals</em>, <em>Tales from Riverdale High</em>... It's still meant for kids, but (as this article proves) there's a large number of adults who still read and enjoy them out there.</p><p>In 2015, the original <em>Archie</em> series (which had been running since 1942) ended at issue #666, giving way for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics2015">modern reboot</a> spearheaded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkWaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkWaid">Mark Waid</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Saga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Saga">Fiona Staples</a>, and sporting a more realistic art style (not the first time they've tried it).

Mr. Weatherbee compliments Archie on his speech, but tells him, "There's only one problem, Archie. You have the entire class looking forward to further devaluation."

Midge kisses Jughead and runs off in ultimate excitement. Turns out the jeweller had since placed a diamond engagement ring in the birthstone's spot. Since Moose was normally so jealous that he was known to hospitalize other guys for merely talking to Midge, Jughead was now seriously in deep doo-doo.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">Adaptation Expansion</a>: A story where the gang gets the local woods slated to be logged declared a national park was expanded into a multi-issue story where the logging company counter-protests because the employees won't have any work if they can't cut the trees.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddictionDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddictionDisplacement">Addiction Displacement</a>: In an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">eighties</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">story</a> on the dangers of smoking, three teenagers unintentionally create a false fire alarm by chain-smoking in the boys' washroom at school.

Long before that, this style of hat was popular among adult factory workers and mechanics. Nowadays, it has mutated into a form unique in itself, no longer much resembling the real-life version, and just makes Jughead look like a <a class="urllink" href="http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/12/18/comic-book-legends-revealed-186/">kook.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Jughead's use of the hat as his age was meant to make him seem immature.

His blatant misogyny was altered by 1989 into being conflicted problems over women, as he had many romantic liaisons during the '90s: Joani Jummp, Debbie, January [McAndrews], Anita the disabled girl, etc. He also has a magical hatpin at one point that attracts girls.

By the 1960s, the Women's Lib movement had converted her to the more familiar tomboyish/girly-girl mix, and boosted her intelligence by a great deal.</li><li> Jughead has also gone through a transformation, from a one-note girl-hater (often blatantly misogynistic to the point of "hating dames") into a character sometimes conflicted (the Joani Jumpp years, the recent "New Style" arc, dating a handicapped girl, etc.) about love for women, ultimately returning to the less complicated world of food.</li><li> In the <em>Archie's Marriage</em> Omakes, Moose realizes that he's being abusive and possessive towards Midge, and breaks up with her.

A comic with a fairly large base cast that constantly introduced new recurring characters in nearly every year, this happens a <em>lot</em>. Ask old-school fans about "Adam the Alien", Jinx Malloy, January McAndrews or Cricket O'Dell. Even Cheryl Blossom got this in the 80s. A few characters are actually shown moving away (Cheryl in the late 1990s), but most are just casually ignored with no mentions after a few years of appearances. We'll see where the new pair of Asian girls, Wendy Weatherbee, and others end up.</li><li> Many characters (Jinx, Cricket) simply got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a>, while others, like Frankie Valdez, were shown having moved back to Riverdale.

He appears to be a slow-and-overweight gym teacher and coach, and indeed, he can't run well and would kill himself if he slid into a base.

Similarly, <em>Archie at Riverdale High</em> typically had a dramatic feature story for its issues, while <em>Betty and Me</em> in the 1970s had an adventure story series within called "Betty Cooper, Betty Cooper," which had the feature character having bizarre adventures of her own. For instance, one story has Betty seeing Archie knocked on unconscious in a head-on collision in his car, then pursued by a half-crazed man and sheltered by a quiet shopkeeper who hides in a magic mirror.</li><li> <em>The Married Life</em>, which follows up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf">What If?</a> storyline "Archie Marries Veronica/Archie Marries Betty", which was itself a revival of the "Life with Archie" series. Both story lines feature a dramatic soap opera-stlye depiction of the issues of married life.

Various character traits are up for grabs as well &#150; Archie is either the best or the worst athlete on any given sports team, Jughead is either a poor or very good student, and Betty's siblings tend to disappear depending on what the current writer knows about her past. Even Betty and Veronica's status as best friend, while usually fairly consistent, has fluctuated in the past, with at least one story showing them outright hating each other.

It is excusable when one considers that Ronnie dresses much better, often showing more skin, and Betty can compete on an even keel whenever she dresses in skimpy gowns/bikinis. One story even makes fun of this, when Archie thinks that he is talking to Veronica, only to find out that it is Betty trying out a black wig. Another story has Betty spending the night at the Lodge mansion and wearing one of Veronica's robes.

Jughead, Reggie and Big Moose wind up serving detention, with Archie delivering a final needle ("I sure wish I could give you a <em>hand!</em>") As Archie laughs outside, three arms from the detention room reach out towards him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicJackpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicJackpot">Karmic Jackpot</a>: This trope is used often, for example with either Archie or Betty encountering a poor-looking man who they help out, while Reggie mocks them for it.

She dresses and acts much less provocatively and flirtatiously than Veronica, but is often rewarded for her virtue by attracting boys anyway. Veronica uses blatant sex appeal to try to attract boys and doesn't have a true love (many stories imply she doesn't really love Archie) but instead is interested in several different boys. Not surprisingly, she's also written in about half the stories as selfish, snobby, spoiled, stupid, and often downright evil.

Betty and Veronica later borrow Archie's jacket and find the lipstick. They think that Archie is seeing another girl because the lipstick isn't either of their brands, and angrily confront the baffled Archie. Betty and Veronica both dump Archie, but then they realize that this will just make him go after the girl they think he's seeing now. They both come back and smooch Archie to show that they're better than the competition. The story ends with Archie's mother realizing what she did and apologizing if she caused him any trouble, but a love-dizzy Archie just tells her to cause as much of it as she wants.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForRacist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForRacist">Mistaken for Racist</a>: In a comic where Veronica has a party. She tells Archie that she doesn't want certain friends of his there. Since he's hanging out with Chuck and Jughead at the time, he thinks she means Chuck (who's black) and becomes angry.

An example is the answering machine in the 1980s, which was the focus of a Veronica story which ends with her throwing it out and vowing to take all future calls personally, while now, that device is just a standard appliance all the characters have.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!</a>: When a presidential candidate once visited Riverdale High (he's an alumnus there), Archie, with his camera, snaps a picture of him catching a tripping Miss Grundy (an old friend of his). A sleazy tabloid reporter cons Archie into selling that camera (film included), and proceeds to use his paper to spin tales regarding the two surrounding the picture, ruining the reputations of both Grundy and the candidate.

Archie, believing it to be an irreplaceable staple of Jughead's personality, goes to great lengths to retrieve it. When he returns it to Jughead at home, Jughead thanks him, but shows him that he has a cupboard full of them since they tend to get lost or damaged over the years.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a>: Archie, Reggie, Moose and Jughead once proposed having an RC race after school, but then they had their toys confiscated by the faculty.

At one point she hires a homeless man to ask Archie for the directions to Main Street. Archie tells him, "You're on Main Street."

Lampshaded in one issue where Betty wearing a simple brunette wig is enough for Archie (presumably the man <em>who loves her</em>) to mistake her for her rival Veronica. It should be noted that Archie thought he was going crazy at the time because everything he'd been seeing that day wasn't what it looked like (a soda can that was really a radio, an old bus that was really a snack bar, a banana phone, etc.) and just wanted to meet someone "normal".

In fact, the 2003 Free Comic Books Day comic revolved around hanging a lampshade on it.

Even newly introduced characters are 99% likely to be doomed to the C-List and Trivia questions within a few years (Cricket O'Dell, Ginger Lopez, Marie &amp; Frankie, etc.). The only exceptions seem to be Cheryl Blossom's re-introduction in the 1990s, and successful newcomers Chuck &amp; Nancy in the 1970s, alongside a few gradual shifts in characterization between the 1950s and now. For instance, Betty changed in the 1970s from a stereotypical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde">Dumb Blonde</a>, to a self-confident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tomboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tomboy">Tomboy</a> who could easily run rings around Veronica in terms of physical skills like athletics and auto mechanics.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightGay">Straight Gay</a>: Kevin Keller, introduced in the comic as a normal, positive gay character for kids to read.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangelySpecificHoroscope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangelySpecificHoroscope">Strangely Specific Horoscope</a>:<ul><li> Big Ethel is on the beach when she reads her horoscope that says she'll meet a pair of stars today.

He's certainly willing to tolerate her presence when food is forthcoming, but it never gets her any closer to a date (unless you count the time it takes him to eat, and considering it's Jughead that can't be very long).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravelersAreSpies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravelersAreSpies">Time-Travelers Are Spies</a>: In one comic, Jughead accidentally travels back in time to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a> and is mistaken for a Confederate spy (one of the suggestions being that the S on his shirt stands for "Spy" or "South").</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMinority">Token Minority</a>:<ul><li> Valerie, arguably one of the first in all of comics, debuting in 1969, followed by Chuck and his girlfriend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMinorityCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMinorityCouple">Nancy</a> in the 1970s, and Frankie &amp; Maria, a latino pairing also debuting then, but not catching on as well.</li><li> Other black and Hispanic characters have shown up with lower degrees of success, like Ginger Lopez (who was later made into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Ascended Extra</a> in <em>Afterlife with Archie</em>), and in the early 1990s, very short-lived characters with disabilities (Anita and Jeff).</li><li> It took a little longer for the Asian characters to catch on. But instead of one character to represent all of Asia, they've had a number of Asian girls (Tomoko, Kim, Kumi?). To say nothing of the Indian boy Raj.</li><li> They introduced a gay character in 2010. This caused <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> to flip out and <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScapegoatCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScapegoatCreator">somehow relate it to President Obama or the Democrats' then-majority in Congress</a>, and resulted in backlash against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a>. It was also a <em>major</em> game-changer in American culture as a whole. Archie Comics has a decades-long reputation as a bastion of "traditional values" due to its rather chaste world and lack of violence or cursing (plus everything Al Hartley did back in the 70's, official or not). Thus, when Archie introduced Kevin Keller and refused to back down, it made national news &#150; after all, if such a conservative place as Riverdale has no problem with a gay man in their midst, then why should anyone else in America take issue?</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomboyishPonytail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomboyishPonytail">Tomboyish Ponytail</a>: Betty.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooMuchAlike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooMuchAlike">Too Much Alike</a>: In one <em>Betty And Veronica</em> story, the titular girls bumped into two cute guys in the mall, Jon and Benny, who were pretty much their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpearCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpearCounterpart">Spear Counterparts</a>. By the end of the story, Betty and Veronica decided that they wouldn't make a good match because they have too much in common.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical">Totally Radical</a>:<ul><li> A notorious case. For example, one late-'80s story had a lifeguard tell a surfing Veronica, "I really dig the way you attacked those waves with your rad moves". Around the same time, an in-house ad for an <em>Archie</em> calendar featured a cartoon teenager, sporting a ridiculous multi-colored mohawk, oversized shades that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn">Elton John</a> would reject, and mismatched-color clothes, telling the reader, "I ordered mine!" Like gnarly, daddy-o, if a rad hepcat teen like him bought one, I better slap down the bread too, yo yo yo".</li><li> Played with in a story titled "Lingo Lesson". In it, Archie talks like this, as does a brownie troop that his mom leads. It drives Archie's dad nuts.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickedIntoSigning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickedIntoSigning">Tricked Into Signing</a>: In one comic story, Reggie decides to write up a petition protesting litter on the beach. Archie is eager to be the first to sign it, so Reggie has him sign it with a nice and large signature before he's even drawn up the petition content. Evil-hearted Reggie then writes up a love note to an anonymous girl. With Archie's signature below it, the note is sure to unleash Betty and Veronica's wrath.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoTeacherSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoTeacherSchool">Two-Teacher School</a>: Averted. Sure, Miss Grundy and Mr. Weatherbee are usually the only teachers to take a major role in a story, but the school's custodian (Mr. Svenson), cafeteria worker (Miss Beazly), science teacher (Prof. Flutesnoot), another elderly teacher (Miss Haggly), two coaches (Kleats and Clayton), and even the Bee's secretary (Miss Philips) have shown up repeatedly over the years, and many have even received major roles in stories.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoTimerDate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoTimerDate">Two-Timer Date</a>: Archie often dates both Betty and Veronica at the same time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnclePennybags" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnclePennybags">Uncle Pennybags</a>: Mr. Lodge is actually a really nice guy &#150; it's just that being one of the main victims of Archie's clumsiness has a tendency to drive him crazy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnlimitedWardrobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnlimitedWardrobe">Unlimited Wardrobe</a>: Betty and Veronica are classic examples of this trope. It's also one of the rare instances when is justified for both girls. Veronica obviously has the money to buy whatever clothes she wants...and as for Betty, in some stories she's developed an impressive wardrobe of her own because Veronica just hands off any clothes she gets tired of to Betty. Not that Betty necessarily minds, since Veronica's generosity allows her to keep up with Ronnie in fashion despite her much more limited finances.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrequitedLoveSwitcheroo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrequitedLoveSwitcheroo">Unrequited Love Switcheroo</a>: In the first issue of <em>Archie Comics</em>, <em>Pep Comics</em> #28, Archie had just moved into the neighborhood, albeit a couple years younger than he was in later issues and with the nickname "Chick", and tries in his first issue to impress his neighbor Betty Cooper to try to get her to date him through dangerous stunts which she believes make him look arrogant. After Veronica moves in during "Archie Comics 1", the whole dynamic was changed to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BettyAndVeronica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BettyAndVeronica">Betty and Veronica</a> format where Betty has a really big and sometimes obsessive crush on Archie.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsoundEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsoundEffect">Unsound Effect</a>: In one episode, <strong>Slamdunk!</strong></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UptownGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UptownGirl">Uptown Girl</a>: Veronica and Archie.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VandalismBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VandalismBackfire">Vandalism Backfire</a>: Jughead boards a passenger train. The conductor yells at Jug to move his suitcase out of the aisle, but refuses. After another passenger trips on the suitcase, Jughead still refuses to move it, so the conductor throws the valise off the in-motion train. Jughead then says he learned his lesson, and will never leave things where people can stumble over them. After the conductor expresses a little remorse for acting so ruthlessly, Jug calmly adds "...it wasn't even my suitcase."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoPhone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoPhone">Video Phone</a>: Veronica of the future once got one installed, only to switch back to normal phones because her friends called while she was doing face masks or when she'd just gotten up.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualCelebrity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualCelebrity">Virtual Celebrity</a>: With the onslaught of manufactured bands like <em>The Chipmunks</em> and <em>The Banana Splits</em> in the era, the creators tried out this trope, using <em>The Archie Show</em> as their vehicle. <em>Sugar, Sugar</em> was the band's only number one hit. Not to say that their music was bad as records generally sold well and were actually catchy and well written, but as with other manufactured bands, they were a fad and mostly catered to a niche once the fad died.</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder5');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; W-Z&nbsp;</div><div id="folder5" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyRacing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyRacing">Wacky Racing</a>: <em>Archie's RC Racers</em></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WardrobeMalfunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WardrobeMalfunction">Wardrobe Malfunction</a>:<ul><li> A story in <em>Veronica</em> volume 201 had the girls discover a collection of old-style bathing suits and try them out in the water. The boys didn't really appreciate the cover-everything styles... until it became clear that the old fabric couldn't stand up to water anymore and disintegrated, leaving Betty, Veronica and the rest <em>naked</em> in the ocean. Heck, this even happened to <em>Mrs. Lodge</em> who tried out one of the suits at a pool party.</li><li> In another <em>Archie</em> comic, Cheryl stole a dress that Veronica designed and wore it to a party just to laugh in her face - only to find out at that point what a bad seamstress Veronica was. The whole dress ripped apart in front of everyone. (Of course, as humiliating as that was for Cheryl, the story didn't quite end on a high note for Ronnie either...)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WealthsInAName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WealthsInAName">Wealth's in a Name</a>: The comics liked to play with this by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed">taking an already-famous name</a> and making it into this trope. Examples: Hetty Greenstuff (a play on Hetty Green, the richest woman in America around the turn of the century), and Mr. Vanderbuck (play on Vanderbilt). They also played it straight at least once, with the "Van Gelt" family ("gelt" being the Yiddish word for money).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf">What If?</a>: Several. The most famous are the "Archie Marries Veronica/Betty" storylines and the ideal sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LifeWithArchieTheMarriedLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LifeWithArchieTheMarriedLife">Life with Archie: The Married Life</a></em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield">Where the Hell Is Springfield?</a>: Either that or "Riverdale" would have been perfectly accurate; they're the two most famous examples of this trope ever. We know that it's in a formerly-Confederate state near the ocean, but not a desert or farming state. According to Word of God, it's literally "Anytown, USA."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinHerAPrize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinHerAPrize">Win Her a Prize</a>: Betty or Veronica have occasionally asked this of Archie.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity">Wolverine Publicity</a>: Cheryl Blossom <em>exploded</em> onto the Archie scene on her 1990s return, quickly getting one limited series after another. Finally, she got her own series and was a constant feature. Eventually, backlash set in, and she was actually written out of the books again before the decade was over, was almost outright retconned out<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8rh0e');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note8rh0e" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8rh0e');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><em>Archie</em> created Ginger Lopez to replace Cheryl in reissues</span>, and became a mere extra. Cheryl eventually returned to being a major character after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AfterlifeWithArchie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AfterlifeWithArchie">Afterlife with Archie</a></em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenDrivers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenDrivers">Women Drivers</a>: Played straight before the '60s, usually subverted any time after that.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench">Wrench Wench</a>: Betty is absurdly talented with auto repair and other forms of masculine expertise. This makes her either more or less attractive to the boys, depending on the story.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard">Writer on Board</a>: In the '70s, Al Hartley occasionally infused his conservative Christian beliefs into the comics until the publishers (who were, are, and have always been Jewish) told him to knock it off. Later in the decade he convinced Archie to license the characters for the explicitly evangelical Spire Christian Comics.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YeGoodeOldeDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YeGoodeOldeDays">Ye Goode Olde Days</a>: Al Hartley's rose-colored view of the 1890s as a time free from the ills of modern society&#133; and apparently free from the ills of the 1890s as well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeddlingKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeddlingKids">You Meddling Kids</a>: There is an issue where Archie and Jughead solve a crime and the crooks are being led away in restraints by the police. One crook complains about being stopped by a bunch of dumb kids and Jughead fires back "This 'dumb kid' is not the one wearing handcuffs!"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourApprovalFillsMeWithShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourApprovalFillsMeWithShame">Your Approval Fills Me with Shame</a>: This is a recurring punchline:<ul><li> In one comic, Principal Weatherbee hires Jughead to write jokes for his assembly speech when a particular kind of joke is really popular. Then Weatherbee hears two girls complaining about the jokes. When he asks Jughead what happened, Jughead tells him that the jokes are completely lame now. When did they become uncool? "Oh, yeah. When word got around that [Weatherbee] was telling them."</li><li> In another comic, Archie worries that his band's latest song may not be well-receved&#133;because Mr. Lodge loves it.</li><li> In one memorable story, a reporter decides to write a story on Archie's popularity. After the article comes out, all of Archie's friends ostracize him. And when the reporter writes about Archie's fall from grace, the gang become incensed at the reporter for saying such things about Archie. Mr. Weatherbee sums this up thusly, "You see, Archie was popular until I said he was popular. Then, when you wrote abut him being unpopular, he became popular again!"</li><li> In another story, Veronica shows off her skills as a trendsetter by making Jughead's hat the next big thing. After the entire school is wearing hats like Jug's, Veronica (Fed up with seeing that hat everywhere) puts an end to the fad by having the teachers wear the hats.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourCheatingHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourCheatingHeart">Your Cheating Heart</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BettyAndVeronica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BettyAndVeronica">Betty and Veronica</a> dilemma is this, though usually it's written as neither being Archie's steady girlfriend or Archie breaking up with one for the the other.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourTelevisionHatesYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourTelevisionHatesYou">Your Television Hates You</a>: One story had Archie and the gang trying to find some way to escape the heat on a scorching summer day.
