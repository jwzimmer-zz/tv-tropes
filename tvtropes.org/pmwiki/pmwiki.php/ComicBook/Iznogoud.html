The title character is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor">scheming, ambitious and power-hungry Grand Vizier</a> of the fictional Caliph Haroun El-Poussah (Haroun El-Plassid in English). His obsession is to depose the Caliph by hook or by crook, and to set himself up as the new Caliph in his stead.</p><p>In order to achieve this goal, he tries every dirty trick, but fails every single time due to either uncommonly bad luck or his own greed and incompetence. He is "assisted" by his long-suffering henchman, Dilat Laraht (Wa'at Alahf in the English translations of the comics, Adulahf Alot in the translation of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Adaptation</a>).</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The comic was given a 52 episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Adaptation</a> in 1995, and a live-action film in 2005, entitled <em>Iznogoud</em> and starring Micha&euml;l Youn and Jacques Villeret.</p><p>Now has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/Iznogoud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/Iznogoud">Recap page</a>.</p><hr><h2><em>Iznogoud</em> provides examples of the following tropes:</h2><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating">0% Approval Rating</a>:<ul><li> In "Chop and Change", Iznogoud actually manages to become the Caliph by changing bodies with him. However, due to his tyranny, he's overthrown by the people of Baghdad, who think that "everything's been worse since he threw the Grand Vizier in jail". After overthrowing him, the "Grand Vizier" (really the imprisoned Caliph in Iznogoud's body) becomes the new Caliph, thus restoring everything to normal (except the two now have swapped bodies and Iznogoud is in jail, together with Wa'at Alahf, who now has the body of the Caliph's food taster).</li><li> In <em>Caliph at Last</em>, a conspiracy is formed by the inhabitants of Baghdad to get rid of him. When asked who is in this conspiracy, Wa'at replies to Iznogoud that everyone in Baghdad is, since except for the Caliph, they all hate him. Later in the same album, he sends Wa'at to do a poll around Baghdad about what he could do to please them. The answers turn out to be almost entirely to ask him to either commit suicide or let them kill him.</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> In "Mirror Image", the vizier travels to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse">Mirror Universe</a> (literally on the other side of a mirror where everything is reversed) and is delighted that every single citizen wants the Caliph's head... except that in the Mirror Universe <em>he</em> is the Caliph.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation">Adaptation Distillation</a>: Some of the longer stories from the Goscinny era had subplots cut in the interest of time for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Adaptation</a>. For example, the printed version of "The Jigsaw Turk" includes a strike by Baghdad's binmen (who, when they see Iznogoud carrying one of the palace dustbins in his search for the missing piece of his magic jigsaw, beat him up for being a scab) and Iznogoud accidentally giving an entrepreneur the idea to start a seaside resort in the middle of the desert for people who like the beach but hate the water, resulting in him being surrounded by hundreds of holidaymakers while trying to work on his jigsaw. Neither subplot features in the animated version, "The Magic Puzzle"; instead, Iznogoud's attempt to finish the jigsaw in the desert is briefly disrupted when he accidentally sets up camp in the middle of a caravan route.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationNameChange">Adaptation Name Change</a>:<ul><li> Although the French version of the 1995 cartoon kept the original names from the comics, the English translation changed several of them.<ul><li> Among the regular cast, Iznogoud's henchman Wa'at Alahf was re-named Adulahf Alot (still an ironic name for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a>), while the neighbouring sultan was called Streetcar instead of Pullmankar (Pullman cars being less familiar to younger viewers thanks to the decline of long-distance rail travel).</li><li> Many of the one-shot characters had their names changed, generally from one play on words to another. For example, the Midas touch-afflicted recluse from "The Golden Handshake" was called Ghoudas Gho'ld in the comics and Karat in the cartoon, while the purveyor of the title object in "The Magic Catalogue" goes from introducing himself as "Uatsdadha, mage" ("What's the damage?") to "the wizard Avahz" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWizardOfOz">The Wizard of Oz</a>).</li></ul></li><li> The Finnish translation uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal">Ahmed Ahne</a> as the name of the main protagonist (Ahmed being a stereotypically recognisable Oriental name, while his last name/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagnificent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagnificent">sobriquet</a> means "avaricious" or "greedy"). His henchman is named Saunabad (sauna-bath, if you take the "bath" from Swedish) while the caliph is Harun El Pullah ("pulla" means a kind of bun and has connotations of a fat, lazy person).</li><li> In the Polish version of the cartoon Iznogoud's name is changed to Nicponim ("Nic Po Nim" being meaning more or less "Good for nothing").</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdiposeRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdiposeRex">Adipose Rex</a>: Caliph Haroun El-Plassid, the jovial and benign ruler, is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Big Eater</a> and spends most of his days sleeping, making him quite obese.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">Anachronism Stew</a>:<ul><li> The stories are nominally set in the 9th century, but feature all sorts of 20th century technology whenever the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a> requires it - "Iznogoud Rockets to Stardom" focuses on a space rocket, "The Box of Souvenirs" revolves around a camera, "The Mysterious Ointment" includes modern toothpaste and deodorant, "Tiger Hunt" has a throwaway gag about a tigerskin rug being 100% polyester, and so on.</li><li> The story "Calculated Risk" features a magical computer invented by a character named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IBM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IBM">I-Bee'Em</a>.<div class="indent"><strong>Iznogoud:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">If there's a pun there somewhere, I don't get it.</a></div></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndImTheQueenOfSheba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndImTheQueenOfSheba">And I'm the Queen of Sheba</a>:<ul><li> In the animated version of the story "Incognito", Iznogoud persuades the sultan to go out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito">dressed as a beggar</a> to satisfy his desire to see what his subjects think of him, then orders the palace guards to arrest any beggars who arrive at the gates, whoever they say they are. However, the sultan gets lost on the way back, and Iznogoud and his henchman Adulahf disguise themselves as beggars to go out and look for him. The sultan ends up returning while the guard is changing and so slips past them unnoticed, while when Iznogoud returns and insists he's the grand vizier, the guard on duty chuckles, "And I'm the Queen of Sheba!"</li><li> "Nuts' Day", the animated version of the comic "The Day of Misrule", sees servants become masters and masters become servants for a day; Iznogoud, in a bid to make his temporary promotion to sultan permanent, tries to rouse the people into making Nuts' Day a year-round event, but they insist he is too rich to lead a people's revolt. So he gives his fortune to Adulahf and sells himself into slavery for free, only to discover that midnight has struck and Nuts' Day is over, whereupon he is arrested as a runaway slave. He protests that he is really the grand vizier, and the two guards transporting him fire back, "And we're Solomon and the Queen of Sheba!"</li><li> In the animated version of "The Labyrinth", when the sultan keeps getting distracted by games and activities during Iznogoud's attempts to trap him in a magic maze, while other people enter the maze and get trapped instead, he decides to paint a sign over the entrance declaring that only the sultan may enter the maze. A policeman promptly walks up and fines him for vandalism. Iznogoud tries to explain that he is the grand vizier, and so outranks the policeman; the unimpressed policeman retorts, "And I'm the Queen of Sheba!"</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Adaptation</a>: In 1995, fifty-two of the Goscinny-penned stories from 1962-77 were turned into 11-minute shorts for a TV cartoon series that ran for one season.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArabianNightsDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArabianNightsDays">"Arabian Nights" Days</a>: The Baghdad in which the series is set owes more to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody">Affectionate Parody</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArabianNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArabianNights">Arabian Nights</a></em> than to historical accuracy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitrarySkepticism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitrarySkepticism">Arbitrary Skepticism</a>: Played for laughs with Wa'at, who outright says in "My Hat!" that while flying carpets and magicians are perfectly acceptable facts to him, a hat that causes its wearer to instantly go completely insane is ridiculous.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Artifact of Doom</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode">Once per Episode</a>, Iznogoud acquires a bizarre magical artifact which the vendor assures will arrange a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a> for a victim of his choice. No points for guessing ahead of time that it will backfire horribly on Iznogoud himself. Just to name a few examples:<ul><li> In "Dark Designs", Inzogoud acquires a magic pencil; when he draws a picture of someone or something and then tears the paper in half, the subject of the picture is banished to an alternate dimension. He can't get the spell to work until he takes art classes, and during an idle moment, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCameo">his teacher</a> sketches Iznogoud. When Iznogoud's art skills have finally improved, he sketches the Caliph and tears the page in half... unaware his teacher's sketch of him is on the other side of the page, so that they are both banished, and the Caliph ends up as sovereign of the island to which they were sent.</li><li> "The Box of Souvenirs" sees the title object, a camera, sold to Iznogoud by Japanese tourist Judoka Karate; when he takes a picture of someone or something with the camera, that someone or something is trapped forever in the photograph that results. Every time Iznogoud tries to take the Caliph's picture, someone or something gets in the way and disappears instead, and when he finally gets the Caliph alone, he is standing in front of a mirror and bends down at the crucial moment, causing Iznogoud to take a picture of his own reflection and disappear.</li><li> The title character in "The Merchant of Forgetfulness", Mumbaijumbo, sells Iznogoud a perfume which, when sniffed, causes instant and total amnesia in the victim. Iznogoud sprinkles it on the Caliph's flowers and food and finally puts it in an atomiser, but they are all sniffed by other people (or, in one case, a bumblebee) before the Caliph can get to them, and inevitably, the final victim is Iznogoud himself, who is left an empty shell.</li><li> In "The Jigsaw Turk", Iznogoud buys a 10,000 piece jigsaw from joke shop merchant Dokodah Bey; when the last piece is put in, the person of whom the puzzler is thinking will disintegrate into 10,000 pieces. There's one problem: there's a piece missing, which Iznogoud and Wa'at Alahf have to retrieve from the factory, several days' journey away. After several further failed attempts to finish the puzzle, Iznogoud is forced to retrieve the missing piece from the palace bins; meanwhile, Dokodah Bey has found the missing piece in his shop, but the Caliph is the one who takes delivery of it, and Iznogoud returns with his own copy of the missing piece... just in time to see the Caliph put the last piece in, beaming that he's always thinking of Iznogoud.

Of course, it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyMacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyMacGuffin">Clingy MacGuffin</a>, and things only get worse.</li><li> In <em>The Nightmarish Birthday of Iznogoud</em>, he buys a lucky charm medal from a vendor who has suffered horribly mutilating bad luck streaks, claiming "only his medal could save him!"

Invariably, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTransformation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTransformation">the spell will backfire and transform him instead</a>. Just to give a few examples:<ul><li> "Likhwid's Bottle, or the Bottle of Likhwid" has Iznogoud buying an elixir, one drop of which will turn the drinker into a louse. What he doesn't learn until the sale is complete is that it's the <em>last</em> drop in a gigantic jug, and the disgusting elixir itself must be consumed undiluted. The vizier finds various ways to trick/force the Caliph into drinking endless bowls of the stuff, but when there is one drop left, inevitably it is Iznogoud who drinks it and turns into a woodlouse after he faints and the well-meaning Caliph tries to revive him with it.</li><li> "Kissmet" features one of the classic examples of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph">Baleful Polymorph</a>: a frog curse that can only be reversed by a kiss which turns the kisser into a frog. Iznogoud is surprised when it takes no subterfuge whatever to get the Caliph to kiss the frog suffering from the curse, whereupon the Caliph turns into a frog and the frog turns into a prince... who decides to claim the throne for himself and have the vizier executed. But the spell has a wrinkle: if a cursed frog kisses a human, both will turn into frogs. By the end of the story, Iznogoud has had to get himself a stay of execution by kissing the frog Caliph, leaving himself and Wa'at Alahf stuck as frogs, while the prince - the son of the Caliph's good friend Fattih al Midrif - exchanges greetings with his father's friend, and says he has a hankering for frog's legs...</li><li> The title character in "The Genie" grants one wish to the person who polishes the slippers in which he resides; although he then returns to the slippers, he can be summoned repeatedly to grant new wishes. Most of the wishes he grants over the course of the story involve turning people into inanimate objects; Iznogoud first instructs him to turn the merchant who sells him the slippers into a hammer, then to turn a crowd of people into footstools, then to turn a palace guard into a wardrobe. Carelessly worded instructions lead him to accidentally transform Iznogoud into a worm; while Wa'at Alahf is able to get the genie to reverse the spell, he loses track of the slippers, which lead to a slave getting himself turned into a pumpkin and, on the final page, to the Caliph accidentally getting Iznogoud turned into a nail.</li><li> "The Doggy Flute" sees the title object used by a Chinese wizard to turn rude people into dogs, so Iznogoud buys it to use on the Caliph. He first transforms the wizard into a dog as practice, then returns to the palace, playing the melody all the while so he doesn't forget it and turning everyone he passes into a dog. But when he tries to perform in front of the Caliph, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepeatedRehearsalFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepeatedRehearsalFailure">a competing flautist causes him to forget the melody</a>, so he rounds up all the dogs he has transformed and plays the melody that undoes the transformation, one dog at a time (in each case, getting beaten up by the irate victims of his spell), until he finds the wizard - who delivers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Laser-Guided Karma</a> to Iznogoud by grabbing the flute and turning him into a dog.</li><li> In "Fairy Tale", Iznogoud contracts apprentice fairy Blunderbell to turn him into the Caliph, but she gets it wrong and turns the Caliph into Iznogoud instead, then both Iznogouds into Caliphs, and finally she ends up turning Iznogoud and his (accidentally created) clone into clothes irons.</li><li> <em>Caliph at Last</em> reveals in a flashback that he did manage to make it work in his favor once in a really weird way: back when he was being bullied by the Caliph's brother Dheround, he once met an attractive fairy who had been turned into a hideous hunchback hag after mocking her own hunchback boss; the curse was so whoever mocked her hunch would inherit the curse, reverting her back to normal, but should she mock that person herself, she would get it back immediately - and since she couldn't stop herself from mocking any hunchback she met, she always ended up getting it back. Iznogoud solved the issue by tricking Dheround into mocking her; due to Dheround being already so much like a Camel that all he was lacking was a hunch, the curse turned him into a camel instead of a hunchback, and the fairy, seeing a camel with a hunch as perfectly normal, didn't feel the usual urge to mock.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarelyMissedCushion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarelyMissedCushion">Barely Missed Cushion</a>: In "Good Sports in the Caliphate", Iznogoud and the Caliph both wind up on a sled, descending a slope at high speed towards a building.<div class="indent"><strong>Narrator:</strong> Fortunately... there's a door... an open door! <br><em>[next panel: sled crashes to the right of the door, Iznogoud cushioning for the Caliph]</em> <br><strong>Narrator:</strong> Unfortunately... this door is too far to the left...</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeardOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeardOfEvil">Beard of Evil</a>: Iznogoud is the only one of the three primary characters to have a beard (Wa'at Alahf has a moustache and stubble, the Caliph is clean shaven), and is by far the most evil of the three.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">Be Careful What You Wish For</a>: In "The Caliph's Cruise", Iznogoud gets dragged along on with the Caliph and Wa'at Alahf on the <em>Catastrophe XXVIII</em>, captained by disaster magnet Simp'l the Sailor, after the gangplank snaps in half while he is trying to disembark, the only available rope to pull him to safety is the mooring, the wind and tide carry them out to sea, and the rudder breaks off when Simp'l tries to steer.

The first panel is set in the 20th century, the last in Iznogoud's Baghdad (with Wa'at Alahf among the children playing hopscotch, Iznogoud sulking on the right-hand edge of the picture, and the Caliph as the only adult in the panel).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">Breaking the Fourth Wall</a>: The characters, Iznogoud and Wa'at Alahf especially, regularly turn to address the reader directly or have conversations with the narration or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness">otherwise acknowledge that they are comic book characters</a>.

At the end of the story, Dokodah Bey, the merchant who sold him the puzzle, shows up at the palace with the missing piece; he tells the Caliph, who takes delivery of the piece, that his wife had been using it to prop up a wobbly table in their house.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote">Brown Note</a>: In "Iznogoud on Thin Ice", drinks seller Gehtorehd is so hideous that one look at her face causes people to freeze solid. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility">She simply stacks the frozen victims in a room in her shop that serves as a freezer.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainOblivious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainOblivious">Captain Oblivious</a>: The Caliph.

Being jailed at the end of <em>Iznogoud's Birthday</em> didn't help as well (although Iznogoud had good reasons to do that, to be fair). In some of the longer stories, the Chamberlain is involved in conspiracies to depose, execute, or otherwise assassinate Iznogoud. And he seems to have a similar cruel streak to Iznogoud himself.</li><li> Wa'at Alahf was initially a rather humble servant with no agendas of his own. Later stories (like <em>The Nighmarish Birthday of Iznogoud</em>) reveal that he has his own wicked schemes, including taking his own cut from everything that goes in or out of the palace, and making corrupt deals. One episode has Iznogood finding out that Wa'at Alahf is actually equally wealthy (or even wealthier) than Iznogoud himself.</li><li> The Caliph was initially depicted as incompetent, but good-natured and rather harmless. Later episodes reveal him to have a cruel streak of his own. He had three younger brothers who could pose threats to the throne in <em>Caliph at Last</em>, so he eliminated them from the order of succession (and seemingly allowed Iznogoud to exile them). Despite his friendliness to Iznogoud, he has threatened to execute him several times. In <em>Who Killed the Caliph?</em>, he has the bad idea to hire a starving man as a food taster. When the Taster ends up eating all of the Caliph's food, the Caliph has him imprisoned (and, it is implied, tortured).</li><li> Sultan Pullmankar, a recurring character, often plays the role of a military threat to Baghdad. He is aggressive, short-tempered, warlike, and reportedly undefeated in every war he has fought. <em>Who Killed the Caliph?</em>, depicting a war between the Caliph and the Sultan, reveals that he does not rely on his army alone to win battles. He has actually established an espionage network in foreign countries, and Pullmankar's spies were serving in Baghdad's palace for years, without Iznogoud noticing them. Iznogoud is even disturbed to learn that one of the spies had been impersonating Iznogoud himself, and had access to Iznogoud's private quarters.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy">The Chew Toy</a>: Iznogoud's scheming makes him a magnet for comic disaster, usually thanks to his schemes backfiring on him.

Iznogoud invariably either ignores him or tells him to shut up. For example, in "The Giants' Island", Iznogoud buys a map to an island which, he is told, is populated by cannibalistic giants, and ignores Wa'at Alahf's doubts that the plan will work. Sure enough, the giants are vegetarians, but they decide to keep Iznogoud and Wa'at Alahf to complete their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanChess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanChess">Human Chess</a> set and send the Caliph back home.

He catches the Executioner trying to get Wa'at to pay him for mercy, and angrily states that mercy should not be bought. He then notices a tortured prisoner and orders the Executioner to release him, causing Wa'at to wonder if he's having pity after all... then he appoints the prisoner new Executioner, and orders him to torture the former one.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJinx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJinx">The Jinx</a>: Simp'l from "The Caliph's Cruise" is a chronically unlucky sailor whose every voyage ends in catastrophe - which is apt, since this is the name he has given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyVesselNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyVesselNaming">every ship he has captained</a>.

This comes back to bite him (in several senses) when he cannot remember the correct melody once he is in front of the Caliph; he eventually finds the transformed magician and plays the melody that reverses the spell, whereupon the magician grabs the flute and turns Iznogoud into a dog.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch">Kick the Son of a Bitch</a>:<ul><li> The three Caliph's brothers that Iznogoud made disappear in <em>Caliph at Last</em>.

Katround was even worse, being a crazy man obsessed with making people disappear and attempting to literally erase Baghdad (including his well-intentioned older brother).</li><li> A more obvious example in <em>Who Killed the Caliph?</em>, where he has the Executioner (a greedy, sadistic man asking his childhood friend Wa'at Alahf a bribe for his mercy) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">tortured by his own previous victim</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito">King Incognito</a>: This is the premise of "Incognito"; Iznogoud has been taxing the citizens of Baghdad into poverty, and persuades the Caliph to go out dressed as a beggar to learn what his people think of him. While he is gone, Iznogoud orders the guards to arrest all beggars trying to enter the palace, whatever reason they give. The Caliph is horrified to learn of how much his people are suffering from the excessive taxes and decides to make immediate reforms when he returns to the palace, but he gets lost trying to return. The impatient Iznogoud disguises himself and Wa'at Alahf as beggars to go looking for the Caliph... who gets the idea to ask passers-by to direct him to the palace and returns while the guard is changing, thus escaping detection. The Caliph resumes his position as ruler and makes good on his promise of immediate reforms, while Iznogoud and Wa'at Alahf are arrested trying to re-enter the palace <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">thanks to Iznogoud's own decree</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlatchianCoffee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlatchianCoffee">Klatchian Coffee</a>: In "The Send-away Bed", the Caliph, who doesn't usually drink coffee, is forced to share a cup of Turkish coffee with the new ambassador or face war between their countries, and ends up with a severe case of insomnia.

One particularly memorable example happens in the "Scandal in Baghdad" adaptation "Tall Tales" when he has a scandalmonger who can literally sniff out scandals plant a fake story in the papers about the Caliph having an abandoned illegitimate child. When the plan backfires, Iznogoud jails the scandalmonger... who sniffs out that Iznogoud himself has <em>three</em> secret children whom he had imprisoned so that he didn't have to deal with them - and when Iznogoud is jailed for being a deadbeat dad, the family reunion is far from happy...</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaderWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaderWannabe">Leader Wannabe</a>: Iznogoud and his "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">I want to be caliph instead of the caliph!</a>"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">Leaning on the Fourth Wall</a>: In "The Magic Calendar", when Iznogoud tears off too many pages of the title artifact and ends up in Jean Tabary's studio in the 20th century, Tabary mistakes Iznogoud for a courier sent to pick up the latest <em>Iznogoud</em> story and apologises for the delays<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note512pn');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note512pn" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note512pn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Tabary was notoriously hopeless at sticking to deadlines.</span> but says he only has ten panels left of the current story.

While the pronunciation of the words is similar enough in French that the confusion is believable, in English, "yoghurt" has an extra three letters and an extra syllable compared to "yurt". Since the confusion is visual as well as verbal, the translators had no choice but to make the dialogue fit the confusion of "yurt" and "yoghurt" as best they could.</li></ul></li><li> One of the wax statues Iznogoud brings to life in "The Wax Museum" is real life <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBluebeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBluebeard">Bluebeard</a> Henri Landru; he is uninterested in bumping off the Caliph since he specialises in killing women, so he brings a waxwork of Lucrezia Borgia to life instead, and they go off together, each plotting the other's demise.

It never stops him from trying again. In a notable exception, the album <em>Les Retours d'Iznogoud</em> (<em>Iznogoud's Returns</em>) tries to explain how things returned to normal after some of the vizier's most infamous adventures.

As each escape plan fails, the Caliph keeps returning to tell Iznogoud about the strange things he has seen, and the increasingly angry Iznogoud keeps dismissing him. Eventually, the Caliph takes the hint and leaves, surprised that Iznogoud doesn't want to hear that he's found another person in the poster world: the billposter who created the magic poster to begin with, and who is now putting up a second poster of the Caliph's bedroom which he tries out on the Caliph. Sure enough, the Caliph re-appears in his own world, while Iznogoud is reduced to ordering Wa'at Alahf to shove him backwards repeatedly in the hope that he'll fall out of the poster again.</li><li> In "The Strong-Arm Men", Iznogoud hires two men to take the Caliph away but it takes a long time before they have a chance to do it without any witnesses around.

It turns out the Caliph borrowed Iznogoud's money for a fundraiser and Iznogoud can't pay the strong-arm men. In retaliation, they take <em>him</em> instead of the Caliph away.</li><li> In "The Merchant of Forgetfulness", when Iznogoud tries to spray an amnesia scent on the Caliph, he ignores the latter's complaints about the open window.

The Caliph, inevitably, won't stand still for long enough for the spell to work, and at one point, Iznogoud tries the spell while the Caliph is at his dressing table. But before he can finish, the amused Caliph holds up a mirror and says, "See how funny you look!" He thinks nothing of Iznogoud suddenly going very pale and staggering out of the room in a daze.</li><li> In "The Jigsaw Turk", joke shop owner Dokodah Bey sells Iznogoud a magic jigsaw puzzle which, when the last piece is put in, causes the object of the puzzler's thoughts to disintegrate into 10,000 pieces. However, there is a piece missing, and Iznogoud has to retrieve a new one from the factory; several further misunderstandings lead the replacement to be thrown away as rubbish. While the vizier is rooting through the palace dustbins, Dokodah Bey delivers the missing piece, which he found in his home, to the Caliph. Iznogoud finds the replacement missing piece and returns triumphant to his bedroom - where he finds the Caliph, about to put in the original missing piece and benevolently remarking that he's always thinking of Iznogoud. The vizier can only stare in panicked horror as the Caliph completes the puzzle, his fate hinted at by the words "THE END" shattering into jigsaw pieces.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7pqkt');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note7pqkt" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7pqkt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> In the animated version, "The Magic Puzzle", Iznogoud disintegrates on screen.</span></li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCameo">Creator Cameo</a> at the end of "The Box of Souvenirs" features a photograph of Jean Tabary wearing this expression after the Caliph picks up a magic camera that traps people in the photographs it takes and, not knowing what it does, points it at the fourth wall and takes a photograph.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney">Only in It for the Money</a>: Many Iznogoud stories involve him paying someone with magic powers or a special skillset who can help him get rid of the Caliph: while they might initially refuse, he will eventually persuade them to name their price.

Then there's his deadpan lackey, Dilat Laraht (a homonym of "dilate la rate", an idiom roughly meaning "burst into laughter"), or Wa'at Alahf as he's known in English. Other punny names in English include the Caliph, Haroun El-Plassid (and a more placid person is hard to imagine), inventor Ahstroh Nautikahl in "Iznogoud Rockets To Stardom" (inventor of the rocket that Iznogoud tries to use to send the Caliph into space), and elixir merchant Likhwid from "Likhwid's Bottle or the Bottle of Likhwid" (who sells Iznogoud a foul-tasting likhwid - er, liquid - one drop of which turns the drinker into a woodlouse; a pity the drop in question is the last drop in a three-gallon carboy/demijohn).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegentForLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegentForLife">Regent for Life</a>: In "The Malefic Hopscotch Grid", Iznogoud plans to use the titular grid to turn the Caliph into a kid so he can rule Baghdad as a regent.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepeatedRehearsalFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepeatedRehearsalFailure">Repeated Rehearsal Failure</a>: The title object in "The Doggy Flute", as its name suggests, transforms people into dogs when a particular melody is played on it.

But when he finally gets to the palace throne room to use the spell on the Caliph, there is another flautist there; the two begin arguing over their relative skill levels, and this causes Iznogoud to forget the tune.

Everything the vizier suggests, however, results in the Caliph getting a cheerful, happy response for somehow following some bizarre and obscure tradition of his visiting guests. Then Iznogoud says "Nuts!" in response to the last one, which results in the sultan angrily taking offense to that word and demanding the vizier's life in slavery lest war be declared on the spot.

Unfortunately, when he finally brings a carrot back to Baghdad and gives it to the palace cook to turn into soup, the cook makes soup from the <em>leaves</em> and throws the root out of the window, where it is eaten by a camel. The camel becomes the nicest creature ever to sport humps on its back, but Iznogoud remains as cruel and ambitious as ever - and the Caliph is none the wiser.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a>:<ul><li> Several stories feature Wa'at Alahf invoking the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">Catch Phrase</a> of fellow Goscinny creation <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Asterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Asterix">Obelix the Gaul</a>.<ul><li> In "The Road to Nowhere", Iznogoud and Wa'at Alahf are confused to run across a hitchhiker pointing a thumb in either direction.

He explains to Iznogoud that he is a "mosquiteer", and there are three or four of them around the palace, a reference to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThreeMusketeers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThreeMusketeers">The Three Musketeers</a></em> (or four, if one counts D'Artagnan).

When he returns to tell Iznogoud about his final discovery (the billposter, who has put up a second poster they can use to get out again), Iznogoud cuts him off while referencing the Jolly Green Giant, Tony the Tiger, and the Pillsbury Doughboy.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterSchnoz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterSchnoz">Sinister Schnoz</a>: Just look at him.

When he reports to the Martian head of state, he points his spatial-temporaliser at him and fires, sending him to the same hippie protest concert in the 1960s to which he had previously sent Wa'at Alahf (who has happily joined in the singing) and Iznogoud (who has not).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a>: Whatever happens to Iznogoud &mdash; even being blasted into orbit in "Iznogoud Rockets to Stardom" &mdash; he's back safe and sound in the next story. The album <em>The Returns of Iznogoud</em> adds epilogues via Retcon to many of the "bad endings" of past stories, explaining how Iznogoud each time manages to return to the normal status quo, with some exceptions; some of these epilogues have him trying to escape the bad situation and ending in a worse situation. For example, Iznogoud escapes the complex maze in "The Labyrinth" only to end up in the inescapable dungeons. Iznogoud has been there before (in a much older story like "The Caliph's Scepter") but doesn't remember the way out.

Close enough, thinks Iznogoud, and he tries to get the unfortunate curse victim to shake the hand of the Caliph. But all manner of other things and people are turned into gold-plated statues instead, and finally Ghoudas and Iznogoud share a farewell handshake. Wa'at Alahf can see how this will end up as soon as Iznogoud announces the plan, and has a commemorative plaque and a wreath of flowers ready for the statue as soon as the transformation happens.</li><li> In "Iznogoud on Thin Ice", Iznogoud meets drinks seller Gehtorehd, who is so ugly that unless she wears a veil, everyone who looks at her face is <em>literally</em> frozen with shock - in a block of ice. He takes her to the palace to look at the Caliph, but she explains that her powers do not work on someone with an elevated temperature, and her visit coincides with the Caliph suffering from a severe fever. Inevitably, Iznogoud gets a glimpse of Gehtorehd's face when she accidentally looks at him without replacing her veil after yet another failed attempt to freeze the Caliph, and the unfortunate vizier is encased in ice. As her face has been obscured throughout the story, on the final page, the narrator surprises Gehtorehd by declaring that she will now unveil her face, so she obliges; the last panel is blank, with an editor's note explaining the publishers were given a "cold reception" from the artist upon collecting the story, which was left unfinished.</li><li> The vizier is told in "The Wax Museum" that all of the waxworks of past and future villains he is bringing to life - from Marcus Junius Brutus to Al Capone - must be back in the museum when it closes for the day at 7pm, or he will be turned into a waxwork instead, and no spell will bring him to life. Inevitably, he fails and is turned into a statue (and once again, Wa'at Alahf can see this coming a mile away and prepares accordingly by buying a feather duster).</li><li> "The Freezing Song" sees Iznogoud encountering the siren Waharning, whose song freezes all who hear it (Crawdad, the captain of the ship that brought her back to Basra, is deaf as a post and so was unaffected). She is taken back to Baghdad in a bathtub (a strange new contraption in the caliphate), but every time Iznogoud tries to get her to sing for the Caliph, she finds new reasons why he cannot hear her song. Finally, insistent that she be returned to the sea that day, she is taken to a clifftop and the Caliph is brought before her... but when he reveals himself to be tone deaf, she refuses to perform once more, and an enraged Iznogoud kicks her bathtub over the cliff as she bursts into a song intended to freeze him. He covers his ears, and waits until she hits the water to uncover them, assuming he is safe from her song. Unfortunately, as Wa'at Alahf explains to the reader as he carries the catatonic Iznogoud back home, he happened to be standing at the top of Echo Cliff...</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatAudience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatAudience">Take That, Audience!</a>: The passworded dungeon in "The Caliph's Sceptre". Of course it ends with Iznogoud forgetting the password ("zymurgy", the last word in the dictionary), being trapped in there, desperately testing all permutations. When Wa'at Alahf says he has a feeling people are laughing at them, the furious vizier turns to the reader:<div class="indent"><strong>Iznogoud:</strong> Oh, are they? Well, I'd like to know just how many of them can become Caliph instead of the Caliph... for start, let's see how many of you can remember the magic word to let us out of this secret room! Come on, now... and no cheating!</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravelEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravelEpisode">Time-Travel Episode</a>: A number of stories have Iznogoud traveling into the past or future, and trying to return to his own time.<ul><li> "The Time Machine" sees an artist from the 20th century who looks uncannily like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCameo">Jean Tabary</a> stranded in Iznogoud's Baghdad after he enters a time cabinet to go back just far enough to meet a pending deadline and the door closes behind him. Iznogoud gets a brilliant idea to use the time machine to strand the Caliph in the Stone Age, but a series of misunderstandings leads to Iznogoud and Wa'at Alahf getting stranded in the Stone Age instead and attracting unwanted attention from a caveman, while Tabary is unable to get them back after he suddenly returns to the 20th century when the original time cabinet is opened by a representative from his publishers who chides him for trying to hide rather than admit to having missed his deadline.</li><li> The title artifact in "The Magic Calendar" allows the user to travel forward through time by tearing off pages, and back again by gluing the pages back on. Iznogoud's plan is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeWrongWhatOnceWentRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeWrongWhatOnceWentRight">Make Wrong What Once Went Right</a> by setting traps for the Caliph in the future, then going back to the past to guide him toward them. However, before he can put this plan into action, he gets sidetracked tearing pages off the calendar to move past a sudden rainstorm, or to move ahead to a day when the taverns are open (by which time the narrator has given up trying to keep track of which way Iznogoud is moving through time), and eventually starts tearing off giant handfuls of pages in a rage, ending up in the 20th century in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCameo">Jean Tabary</a>'s studio. As Iznogoud has lost the glue to put the pages back on the calendar, Tabary offers to glue them back on for him - travelling back several days in time himself and stranding Iznogoud in the timestream. Tabary shrugs off the experience and turns his attention to re-drawing the suddenly blank pages of his latest comic, "The Magic Calendar".</li><li> A memorable one was one of the subplots in <em>Caliph at Last</em>. Iznogoud is trying to retrieve one of the Caliph's brothers, who he had exiled into a different time period. The problem is that the period was the early 20th century, and the brother serves as a soldier in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>. When Iznogoud travels forward in time, he finds himself wearing a military uniform and serving in a battlefield. He has to deal with nasty officers on his own side, and incoming bullets and snipers from the other side. Unsurprisingly, Iznogoud wants to get the hell out of this era.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">Timey-Wimey Ball</a>: In <em>Iznogoud's Childhood</em>, Iznogoud experiments a type of time travel in which the present and the past happen at the same time for a while, which he tries to exploit by attempting to get rid of the Caliph's younger self. The whole thing eventually end up being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a>, in which Iznogoud's time travel is what causes his younger self (who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedToBeASweetKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedToBeASweetKid">Used to Be a Sweet Kid</a>) to transform into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> we're familiar with. However, earlier in the comic, Iznogoud stabs younger Wa'at Alahf to test the time travelling nature, and that case works on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippleEffect">Ripple Effect</a> basis, in which adult Wa'at Alahf shows up with a scar he'd never had.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a>: Iznogoud in some stories.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransferredTransformation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransferredTransformation">Transferred Transformation</a>: One story had a foreign prince cursed into a frog, and kissing the frog would transfer the curse to the kisser.

There's a Fly About", Iznogoud loses his marbles and is committed to an asylum).</li><li> At the end of "A Lookalike", the Caliph and his doppelganger, Aristides Kingsizos, have met and bonded over a game of War (the card game), and the formerly grouchy lookalike now talks and acts like the Caliph. On the palace steps, Iznogoud sobs to Wa'at Alahf that he tried to get rid of one Caliph and now he's stuck with <em>two</em>. The animated version, "The Sultan's Double", furthers Iznogoud's breakdown when Aristides' business partner comes looking for him... and he turns out to be a dead ringer for Iznogoud, who goes catatonic with shock.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8yasw');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note8yasw" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8yasw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The comic version simply ends with the man approaching the sobbing vizier to ask after Aristides; Iznogoud hasn't yet noticed the resemblance.</span></li><li> At the end of "The Wonderful Machine", the animated version of "A Calculated Risk", Iznogoud has run out of options to stall the signing of the marriage contract between the Sultan's 37th son and Sultan Streetcar's 42nd daughter until the computer he has purchased can tell him how to be Sultan instead of the Sultan, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGenieInTheMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGenieInTheMachine">The Genie in the Machine</a> finally produces an answer... to the multiplication question her "programmer" asked her during the sale.
