The comics are also commonly referred to as <em>Asterix and Obelix</em>.</p><p>The <em>Asterix</em> comics take place in the year 50 BC. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar">Julius Caesar</a> has all but conquered Gaul (pre-medieval France plus some surrounding territory), except for a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">pockets of resistance</a>. One of those pockets of resistance is a small but plucky village in Armorica (modern Brittany), which &mdash; despite the vast numerical and military superiority of the Roman legions &mdash; has held back the invaders thanks to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a>-granting magic potion brewed by their resident druid. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndefeatableLittleVillage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndefeatableLittleVillage">Undefeatable Little Village</a> happens to be the home of our hero, a small but plucky Gaul named Asterix. Along with his friend Obelix, a huge loveable lug and monolith craftsman, Obelix's tiny dog Dogmatix and the other inhabitants of the village, Asterix gets into all manner of adventures that usually involve foiling the schemes of the Romans &mdash; and, occasionally, Caesar himself.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The stories are published as "albums" (the series, which began in 1959, predates the term "graphic novel") and typically alternate between two themes. In many of the books, Asterix, Obelix and Dogmatix, sometimes accompanying or accompanied by another character, go on an adventure somewhere &mdash; these are often have titles of the format <em>Asterix in...</em>. These plots allow for the most satire of different cultures and nationalities. In the second type of plot, a new plan by the Romans or an unexpected threat from outside brings danger and excitement to the village. These plots allow character development of the various villagers and their relationships.</p><p>Occasionally, a small (but very persistent) band of pirates (a parody of another comic series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BarbeRouge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BarbeRouge">Barbe-Rouge</a></em>) makes a cameo appearance; their ship was scuttled by the potion-enhanced Gauls in an early story &mdash; since that initial appearance, they are usually seen either paddling frantically away from any Gauls they encounter, or coming across the Gaulish warriors during an incidental encounter and getting scuttled <em>again</em> (or even scuttling their ship themselves to minimize damage).</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Part of the appeal of the series is probably the variety of humor, which includes slapstick fight scenes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurricaneOfPuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurricaneOfPuns">plenty of wordplay</a>, thinly-veiled social commentary, and Iron Age and Roman antiquity versions of just about every European (and beyond) stereotype you can imagine.</p><p>The series has some of the best translations of any comic-book ever; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism">they're smart enough to keep the basic story while making new puns in the appropriate language.</a></p><p>After Goscinny's untimely passing in 1977 aged just 51, Uderzo took over the writing as well.

Eventually, a fight breaks out over it, but everyone tries to "act natural" when Asterix starts approaching. The villagers stop fighting, but stay in the same big pile, which confuses Asterix further, because the villagers are more likely to be seen fighting than they are relaxing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionInsuranceGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionInsuranceGag">Action Insurance Gag</a>: The pirates frequently run into the Gauls on their brand-new ships which they just paid for or had to leave some of their crew as hostages/sell into slavery for.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdjectiveAnimalAlehouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdjectiveAnimalAlehouse">Adjective Animal Alehouse</a>: The Jolly Boar, from <em>Asterix in Britain</em> (Or "Le Rieur Sanglier" in the original version, parodying English word order).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a>: Julius Caesar, who is more or less the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">only sane Roman</a>, tends to view the Gauls as much as potential allies as enemies, and as such holds very deep respect for them. In fact, they tend to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">join forces every time someone tries to usurp Caesar</a>, since they know that if anyone more ruthless than Julius was on the throne, it would completely upset the balance between them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody">Affectionate Parody</a>: The pirates are a parody of different pirates from another comic series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BarbeRouge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BarbeRouge">Barbe-Rouge</a></em> (or <em>Redbeard</em>).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcoholHic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcoholHic">Alcohol Hic</a>: A drunken Roman legionary in <em>Asterix in Britain</em> goes not only "hic" but also "haec" and "hoc" &mdash; hic, haec, and hoc being the Latin nominative singulars (in masculine, feminine, and neuter, respectively) for "this".&cedil;</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcoholInducedIdiocy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcoholInducedIdiocy">Alcohol-Induced Idiocy</a>:<ul><li> The whole plot of <em>Asterix and the Laurel Wreath</em> is because Vitalstatistix got drunk after a diner with his brother in-law and made a bet that he'll cook him a stew with Caesar's laurels and Obelix encouraging him.</li><li> <em>Asterix and Caesar's Gift</em> is kickstarted by a drunk soldier dissing Caesar, which made Caesar "give" him the Gauls' village as his retirement gift.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenLoveShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenLoveShoes">All Women Love Shoes</a>: Well, togas and headdresses, at least.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity">Alternate Continuity</a>: The movies.

And deliberate, most of the time.<ul><li> The Romans tend to wear segmented plate armor (called <em>lorica segmentata</em> by historians today) which was invented after Julius Caesar's time. However, the correct alternatives are also shown &mdash; chain mail for legionaries and Greek-style cuirasses or breastplates for officers.</li><li> In <em>Asterix and the Golden Sickle</em>, seeing an inn trashed by Asterix and Obelix, a Roman compares it to Pompeii... which won't be destroyed for another 125 years.</li><li> <em>Asterix and the Banquet</em> has a mail wagon with the modern logo of <a class="urllink" href="http://www.laposte.fr">La Poste<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

For example, in <em>Asterix and the Goths</em>, Valuaddedtax pulls some potatoes out of a cauldron, while in <em>Asterix in Belgium</em> we witness the invention of French (Belgian) fries.<ul><li> This is addressed in the audio book adaptation of <em>Asterix in Britain</em> read by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WillieRushton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WillieRushton">Willie Rushton</a>, which includes a brief sequence describing an occasion when Asterix and Obelix accidentally land in the New World in one of their sea voyages, discovered the tubers, and decided to bring them back to the village. This may be a reference to <em>Asterix And The Great Crossing</em>.</li></ul></li><li> During their voyage to Palestine in <em>Asterix and the Black Gold</em>, Asterix and Obelix are seen leaving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jerusalem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> by the Lions' Gate: this gate wasn't built until AD 1517.</li><li> The Flavian Amphitheatre, also known as the Colosseum, which features in <em>Asterix the Gladiator</em> and some animated adaptations (notably the one where Asterix and Obelix become gladiators), wasn't built until 70 AD.</li><li> The Gothic footsoldiers in <em>Asterix and the Goths</em> sing about Alaric leading the Visigoths to Rome, which happened 460 years later in AD 410. They also wear helmets reminiscent of pickelhaubes, but this was likely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialGermany">deliberate</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">stereotyping</a>.</li><li> There are several references to the "Roman Empire", which was not founded until after Caesar's lifetime. Caesar governed the Roman <em>Republic</em>; that said, the Roman Republic <em>did</em> call territories under their control the <em>Imperium Romanum</em>.</li><li> Egyptians are shown worshipping most of their ancient gods and using hieroglyphs, all of which was dead by 50 BC.</li><li> While the historical conquest of Gaul took place in 52 BC, it is depicted in the stories as taking place decades earlier than the main timeframe of the stories, notably when several middle-aged characters are depicted as being young at the time, and the villagers already fighting Romans when Asterix and Obelix were children.

In fact, <em>Gaul</em> and Caesar's <em>Gallia</em>, while superficially similar, are linguistically unrelated terms.</li><li> There appear to be no language barriers between the Gaulish, Iberian, Lusitanian, Brittonnic, Hibernian and Belgic tribes. This is justified to some extent, as many of these groups would have spoken related Celtic languages, but the Greeks, Romans and Vikings can also be understood by the Gauls, as can Persians and Indians. In fact, the only European group that consistently needs translation is the Goths.</li><li> It's interesting to see historical accuracy flop back and forth depending on how seriously the reader is meant to take a particular scene. For instance, most of the times we see writing in the series, the characters carve it into tablets, even for disposable things like memos or personal letters or teaching to children &mdash; mostly because it's funny to imagine a Roman bureaucrat having to carve twelve huge slabs of rock just to induct a new legionary. However, in one scene where Asterix is planning a bank robbery and makes a diagram of their plan of attack, he does it on a diptych wax tablet, which is what someone in his time period would actually have used for making notes that would have to be quickly disposed of later.</li><li> Some fudged details and dates &mdash; Pompey is still alive (although without any power) but Vercingetorix is dead (in reality, Vercingetorix was being kept in prison for several years and Pompey was assassinated during the military campaign we see take place in Asterix the Legionary, leading the English translator to assume he was dead); Cassivelaunos's troops lost to Caesar and Britain was occupied (in reality, his troops won, twice, with Caesar's successor Emperor Claudius instead finally conquering Britain); The Colosseum appears and/or gets mentioned numerous times despite the fact that it was commissioned by Emperor Vespasian more than a century after Caesar's death; Cleopatra and Caesar are husband and wife (Caesar had a different wife and Rome did not recognise marriages between Romans and non-Romans, although the upshot of this was that Cleo and Caesar's relationship was not considered adulterous)...</li><li> "Caesar" is often used by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">ambitious Roman officers</a> as if it's a title, talking about "becoming Caesar". It wasn't &mdash; it was actually Julius Caesar's <em>name.</em> Caesar (the word, not the person) did <em>eventually</em> become a title, but that didn't happen until about a hundred years after the Gallic Wars.</li><li> The series often plays on current national or regional stereotypes, ignoring the fact that the cultural and linguistic landscape of Europe was drastically changed by the "migration period" that followed the decline of the western Roman Empire.<ul><li> As an example, the Celtic Britons are given traits associated with modern-day English people. However, English identity is commonly held to have begun with the settlement of the Anglo-Saxons (a collection of Germanic tribes) in southern Britain. Those being mocked with "English" stereotypes in the series are in fact the cultural ancestors of the modern-day Welsh.</li><li> In <em>Asterix and the Banquet</em>, the characters visit Normandy, a region which derives its name, and some of its cultural heritage, from invasions by Danish and Norwegian Vikings ("Nor&eth;ma&eth;r" or "North men" = "Norman") that would occur nearly a millennium later.

This album also reveals that Cacofonix is kept around because he is very useful in sending distress signals whenever the village is in danger and the Druid is not present.

However, the Romans don't win a single medal, which leads the Greeks to realize this will hurt their tourist industry, so they create a Roman-only event. As Asterix still can't guarantee a win, the Gauls trick the Romans into drinking tongue-staining magic potion to get them disqualified. However, in the end Asterix gives his medal to the Romans, avoiding Caesar's usual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">You Have Failed Me</a> reaction of getting thrown to the lions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooUnhappyToBeHungry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooUnhappyToBeHungry">Too Unhappy to Be Hungry</a>: In <em>Asterix the Legionary</em>, Obelix <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">eats two boars instead of his normal three</a> because he has a crush on a woman.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopHeavyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopHeavyGuy">Top-Heavy Guy</a>: Roman centurions and the non-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyComicRelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyComicRelief">Plucky Comic Relief</a> legionaries have enormous hairy arms and chests, on normal-sized legs.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood">Trademark Favorite Food</a>: Obelix will often ask for wild boar in really unfitting situations.
