By 1962 when the band was auditioning for their EMI contract, there was a feeling that Best wasn't a good enough drummer; after EMI signed them, George Martin told the band that he was going to use a session drummer on their recordings. (Wikipedia has <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Best#Best_as_a_drummer">a lot more<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> about this.) And worse luck for Pete, highly regarded Liverpool drummer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr">Ringo Starr</a> was a free agent at this time, having left his previous group. So the other three canned him.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0f9ws');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0f9ws" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0f9ws');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Ironically, Martin still insisted on using a session drummer rather than Ringo for the first Beatles single, "Love Me Do".</span> Best suffered from depression, leaving show business a few years later. He eventually married and raised a family, and he received several million pounds in the 1990s when the <em>Anthology 1</em> record was released with several tracks featuring Best on drums.<ul><li> Best was eventually able to capitalize on The Beatles' fame when he released an album of original music titled <em>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">Best</a> of The Beatles</em>. The album title is not strictly a lie &mdash; it was, after all, music by Pete Best of The Beatles &mdash; even though many of its sales reportedly came from Beatles fans who misunderstood its deliberate ambiguity (despite the fact that the sleeve artwork clearly circled <em>him</em>).</li><li> The Beatles also had a minor case in Stuart Sutcliffe. He was John's classmate at the Liverpool College of Art, and in 1960 agreed to play bass, but he left in 1961 to stay in Hamburg with his girlfriend (turning them into a quartet) and progress with his dreams of being a painter; he wasn't replaced by a new member, but Paul McCartney who switched from piano and rhythm guitar (with Lennon) to take over his duties as bassist and became known for that role in the band. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog">Sadly</a>, Sutcliffe died less than a year later from a brain hemorrhage before he could become a successful painter; the rest of the Fab Four paid tribute to him by putting his face on the front cover of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SgtPeppersLonelyHeartsClubBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SgtPeppersLonelyHeartsClubBand">Sgt.

Agnetha, Bj&ouml;rn, Benny, and Anni-Frid were all the original members of the band, but just shortly after properly establishing as a band (and still going by the name "Bj&ouml;rn &amp; Benny, Agnetha &amp; Anni-Frid"), Agnetha became pregnant with her first child, and she was replaced for a short period of time by a friend of Anni-Frid, a gospel singer named Inger Brundin, on a trip to West Germany before Agnetha came back.

Pennell's replacement was Joe DeLongchamp, and then Dave "Doc" Bradbury, both of whom <em>also</em> quit after only two albums (although Bradbury sang "Grandpa Got Run Over by a Beer Truck", one of their better-known songs). What makes this unusual is that Jim Bellmore, who replaced founding member Joe Potila on lead guitar in 1995, has been both guitarist <em>and</em> bassist in the studio ever since (although they did hire Reggie Lusardi as a touring bassist before retiring from touring in 2016).</li><li> Any <strong>Dead or Alive</strong> member who played with the band before the classic line-up (Pete Burns, Steve Coy, Mike Percy and Tim Lever) was established in 1984.

However, what many non-fans don't know is that he was <em>not</em> the band's original vocalist. Back when the band was known as Mantas, Chuck was actually the bass player, while the other two founding members were guitarist Rick Rozz and vocalist/drummer Kam Lee. Kam performed the vocals on the band's early demos, and also contributed to the design of their original logo and songwriting for some of the tracks that ended up on <em>Scream Bloody Gore</em>, but due to having a falling out with the other members, he left the band in 1986 before they released any completed material. While Lee would go on to have a successful career on his own, becoming a well-known name as the frontman for Massacre and continuing to perform with numerous underground bands today, most people who aren't into death metal don't tend to remember him.</li><li> If you ask most people to name the members of <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeepPurple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeepPurple">Deep Purple</a></strong>, they'll call Ian Gillan the singer and Roger Glover the bassist, because they filled those positions during the most popular incarnation of the band. The original lead singer was Rod Evans and the bassist was Nick Simper. Evans was lucky enough to get inducted along with better remembered members into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (largely because he sang on their first big hit "Hush"). Simper? Not as much.<ul><li> In the 1980s, Rod Evans was sued for continuing to perform under the Deep Purple name.

Deleonibus, Mummert, and Beard were replaced by Dan Truman, Jimmy "J.J." Whiteside, and Jimmy Olander in short succession; Brian Prout replaced Whiteside, and Gene Johnson replaced both Deal and Gregg. While recording some demos, a producer persuaded them to let Roe sing lead instead of Davenport; as a result, Davenport quit and was hastily replaced by Dana Williams.

The band's first ever lineup was Stephen "Tin Tin" Duffy on main vocals, Simon Colley on bass and occasional clarinet, John Taylor (as Nigel John Taylor) on lead guitar, Nick Rhodes (as Nick Bates) on keyboard, and a drum machine. Then Stephen and Simon left because they wanted to be in a more rock &amp; roll band, and were replaced with Andy Wickett and then Jeff Thomas on lead vocals, John switched over to bass after Simon left and got Alan Curtis to be on lead guitar (at which point Roger Taylor joined the band), then Jeff and Alan left, they put out an ad in the <em>Melody Maker</em> (a British music magazine) for a "high wire guitarist", got Andy Taylor that way, and only after that did Le Bon (a drama student) join the band. The band even recorded a demo which included an early version of "Girls on Film" in 1979 when Andy Wickett was lead vocalist. Of all the former members, only Stephen Duffy had a notable career after leaving Duran Duran, first embarking on a short-lived but successful solo career before forming the folk rock band The Lilac Time.</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder5');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E&nbsp;</div><div id="folder5" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> Canadian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a> band <strong>Emerson Drive</strong> was originally known as 12 Gauge, and was founded in 1995 with Brad Mates (lead vocals), Pat Allingham (fiddle), Remi Barre (drums), Dan Binns (guitar), Chris Hartman (keyboards), Jeff Loberg (bass), and David Switzer (guitars). In 1998, both Switzer and Binns were replaced by just Dan Bauman, reducing the group to a sextet. Derrick Kuzemchuk took over on drums briefly before Mike Melancon replaced him, Danick Dupelle took over on guitar, and Patrick Bourque became bassist in 2002. Dale Wallace then replaced Hartman, creating the lineup that the band had on its first album as Emerson Drive in 2002. For the second album in 2004, David Pichette took over on fiddle, creating the lineup that held until Bourque committed suicide in 2007 and Pichette quit in 2013.</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Europe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Europe">Europe</a></strong> was founded as "Force" in 1979 (becoming "Europe" in 1982) with Joey Tempest (lead vocals), John Norum (guitar), Peter Olsson (bass), and Tony Reno (drums). The band went through three bassists <em>in 1981 alone</em>. First, Olsson left and was replaced by John Lev&eacute;n, who in turn left two months later for Yngwie Malmsteen's band, with Malmsteen's former bassist Marcel Jacob coming in. However, Lev&eacute;n and Malmsteen had major differences, and three months later Norum and Jacob swapped bands again. Reno was fired in 1984 and replaced by Ian Haugland. In that same year, the band added Mic Michaeli on keyboards. This lineup saw the band make their international breakthrough with the 1986 release of <em>The Final Countdown</em>, but Norum left after the tour for that album, with Kee Marcello taking his place. The band then went on hiatus in 1992, reuniting for a single concert in 1999 with both Norum and Marcello on guitars. However, the <em>Final Countdown</em> lineup reunited in 2003 and has been together ever since.</li><li> David Hodges, former keyboardist for <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Evanescence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Evanescence">Evanescence</a></strong>, left the band four months before <em>Fallen</em>, the album that brought it into the mainstream, was released.

Taken in reverse order, the completion of their first "real" album, <em>Trespass</em>, saw the departure of drummer John Mayhew, so they put an ad in <em>Melody Maker</em> and Phil Collins responded. Co-founding guitarist Anthony Phillips also left at this juncture to pursue a prolific but obscure solo career, and was replaced by Mick Barnard (with whom no albums were recorded) for a couple of months, until Barnard himself was replaced by Steve Hackett.

And Silver was himself the replacement for their founding drummer, Chris Stewart, who had performed on their first two singles and all the early demos. Plus, while hardly obscure, Peter Gabriel deserves honorary mention: far more fans will have experienced the group with Phil Collins in the lead vocal spot, and many have noted how Collins <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">sounds more like Gabriel than Gabriel did</a>.</li><li> Doug Hopkins of the <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GinBlossoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GinBlossoms">Gin Blossoms</a></strong> is a rather tragic case.

The first was original drummer Elissa Bello, who left in 1979 so she could commit to her regular job. She was promptly replaced by Gina Schock, who brought a more professional culture to the group that would help ignite their rise to stardom. The second and more extreme case was bassist Margot Olavarria, who the band fired mere months before the release of their breakout debut album <em>Beauty and the Beat</em>. She had already toured with them in the UK, where they opened for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madness">Madness</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSpecials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSpecials">The Specials</a> and almost got signed to Stiff Records, but by the time they were signed to I.R.S.

Oakey and Wright replaced Ware and Marsh with singers Joanne Catherall and Susan Ann Sulley and went on to have major international success.

Chad Channing, who played drums on Nirvana's first album, <em>Bleach</em>, is probably the most well-known of these, although the book <em>Come As You Are: The Story of Nirvana</em> actually uses the phrase "The Pete Best of Nirvana" in reference to Aaron Burckhard, their very first drummer.<ul><li> Guitarist Jason Everman was only a member of Nirvana for six months in 1989; He's credited and appears on the cover of <em>Bleach</em>, but does not play on it; He was only credited as a gesture of gratitude from Kurt Cobain because he forked over the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBudget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBudget">$600</a> to record the album. After leaving Nirvana, Everman played bass for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Soundgarden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Soundgarden">Soundgarden</a> for about a year before being kicked out. Having washed out of two of the fastest rising bands in Seattle - in the words of <em>The New York Times</em>, he was "Pete Best twice" - Everman decided to focus his attention on something else: He joined the Army, and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/02/magazine/evermans-war.html">became a decorated member of the U.S. Special Forces<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</li></ul></li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NoDoubt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NoDoubt">No Doubt</a></strong> was founded in 1986 by lead vocalist John Spence and keyboardist Eric Stefani, who filled out their lineup with Eric's younger sister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GwenStefani" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GwenStefani">Gwen</a> (backing vocals), Jerry McMahon (guitar), Chris Leal (bass), Gabe Gonzalez (trumpet), Chris Webb (drums), Kevin Wells (trombone), and Alan and Tony Meade (backing vocals/trumpet and saxophone, respectively). By the time they made their first album, Spence had killed himself, Gwen was the lead singer and the familiar lineup of bassist Tony Kanal, guitarist Tom Dumont, and drummer Adrian Young were already in place...as were Eric Stefani, saxophonist Eric Carpenter, trumpeter Don Hammerstedt, and trombonist Alex Henderson (actually the <em>third</em> trombonist, with Paul Caseley bridging the gap between Wells and Henderson). If none of these guys sounds familiar to you, it's because their first album was considered a flop by the record company, and their <em>second</em> album had current touring members Gabrial McNair and Stephen Bradley replacing Hammerstedt and Henderson; Eric Stefani was still a member at the time but left shortly after the group made it big &mdash; he's on the cover of <em>Tragic Kingdom</em> at the behest of his sister (he's the one facing away from the camera).</li><li> Early on in the group's history, <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NSYNC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NSYNC">*NSYNC</a></strong>'s bass vocalist was a guy named Jason Galasso.

The latter two were finally replaced by Sterban and Bonsall in 1972 and 1973, respectively.</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OKGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OKGo">OK Go</a></strong>'s original lead guitarist, Andy Duncan, left the band in 2005.

He was "let go" from the band in May of that year, and one month later, the band released their breakout album, Niche Syndrome, putting them in the top 4 of the Oricon chart for nine days, with the album's lead single, Kanzen Kankaku Dreamer becoming the band's signature song in Japan. Since then, the band, with only four remaining members, has gone on to become recognized internationally, even signing a deal with Fueled By Ramen in the U.S., releasing three international albums, and collaborating with famous Western musicians like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AvrilLavigne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AvrilLavigne">Avril Lavigne</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EdSheeran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EdSheeran">Ed Sheeran</a>.</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Opeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Opeth">Opeth</a></strong> was originally a straight-up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathMetal">Death Metal</a> band founded by vocalist David Isberg. Isberg quit the band in 1992&mdash;two years before the debut album, <em>Orchid</em>, was released. Mikael Akerfeldt, who was the bassist at the time, took over Isberg's vocal duties and moved the band in a more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveMetal">prog-oriented</a> direction.</li><li> The initial line-up of <strong>O-Zone</strong> consisted of Dan Balan and Petru Jelihovschi, both former members of a band called Inferialis. After their first album hit it big in home Moldova, Jelihovschi decided to leave the project since music was a hobby for him, and he did not plan to perform professionally. Balan ended up bringing in Arsenie Todira&#351; and Radu S&icirc;rbu, and the band recorded their biggest hit, "Dragostea din tei", as a trio.</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder16');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P&nbsp;</div><div id="folder16" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PanicAtTheDisco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PanicAtTheDisco">Panic! at the Disco</a></strong> went from four teenagers in a garage to touring without playing a single live show.

Well, not many people know about their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a> as a glam metal band in the 1980s. Terry Glaze was originally on lead vocals and rhythm guitar during this glam era, fronting the band's first three albums (Metal Magic, Projects in the Jungle, and I Am the Night). <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1775fc');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1775fc" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1775fc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> To take it a step further, none of these albums were even officially released on CD, since they were disowned and abandoned as soon as the 90s kicked in. Any downloads of them on the Internet are either vinyl or cassette rips, and any CDs being sold of them are bootlegs. </span> In a Washington Post article, he even described himself as "The Pete Best of Pantera" in his own words. Similarly, it's been made clear that Terry is at peace with that status, being very content to stick to his smaller musical projects and being a family man as well.<ul><li> Early on in 2004, Vinnie Paul attended one of Terry's shows with Lord Tracy, and they briefly tossed around the idea of a one-off reunion show where the glam-era Pantera songs could be played live again. Had it worked out, Terry might've actually made a bit of a comeback from being a Pete Best anymore. Of course, later that year, the idea was scrapped <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">for obvious reasons</a>...</li><li> Terry and Rex Brown eventually did briefly regroup in 2010, with Rex's new band called Arms of the Sun. For one show, they played two 80s Pantera songs (All Over Tonite and Come-On Eyes) live again.</li><li> Tommy Bradford (original bassist) and Donnie Hart (the very first singer) both left very early in the band's life.</li><li> If you want to get to the REAL obscure Pete Bests of the group, Matt Amour, David Peacock, and Rick Mythaisin were Pantera's temporary replacement singers after Terry Glaze left, and before Phil Anselmo joined. They're almost completely unknown, although Mythaisin has since been in the power metal act Steel Prophet. He was also a live vocalist for Agent Steel; while nowhere near as big as Pantera, isn't exactly an unknown.</li></ul></li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Perfume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Perfume">Perfume</a></strong> was originally founded by Ayaka Nishiwaki (A~chan), Yuka Kashino (Kashiyuka), and Yuka Kawashima (Kawayuka). In fact, their namesake was based on the fact that the "ka" in their first names was written with the character for "perfume." Before they were recorded their first single, Kawashima dropped out to focus on school, and Nishiwaki recruited Ayano Oomoto (Nocchi) as her replacement.</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Petra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Petra">Petra</a></strong> was always something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolvingDoorBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolvingDoorBand">Revolving Door Band</a>, but their most well-known eras were between 1980 and 1985 (when Greg X. Volz was the lead singer and everyone else save founding member Bob Hartman left) and 1986 to 1993 (when <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HeadEast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HeadEast">Head East</a> vet John Schlitt took over). Everyone who left in 1980 could be considered a Pete Best. Special mention, however, goes to keyboardist John Slick, who performed on three of the four studio albums recorded during the Volz era but has been largely forgotten in favor of his replacement John Lawry. To the point where, when Hartman reunited the "classic Petra" lineup for a 2010 tour, the lineup featured Lawry rather than Slick.</li><li> When <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Phish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Phish">Phish</a></strong> formed in 1983, keyboardist Page McConnell was not part of the lineup, but second guitarist Jeff Holdsworth was. Holdsworth quit three years later, about six months after McConnell joined the band, and well before they released their debut album or became a hugely successful touring act.</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd">Pink Floyd</a></strong> has some shining examples, often unfamiliar even to ardent fans of their early work:<ul><li> Accomplished guitarist Bob Klose was pressured into leaving by his father and college tutors less than a year before they got their record deal.</li><li> Vocalists Keith Noble and Clive Metcalfe left to form their own band two years before that.

He even joined the band onstage at one show during their reunion tour.</li><li> It is also entirely possible Andy's more experimental (trademark use of effects) and jazz-inspired guitar playing was inspiring Sting and Stewart a lot, and they simply did not need two guitarists (one had to go).</li></ul></li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder17');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q&nbsp;</div><div id="folder17" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a></strong> had many bassists before settling with John Deacon:<ul><li> Back when was originally called Smile, bassist Tim Staffell was the singer before he left to join the band Humpy Bong.

He actually performed onstage with Brian and Roger before Freddie finally joined in June 1970, and was part of the same social circle as the rest of the band. Mike played three gigs with Queen before leaving in July 1970, amicably as the band would hire his haulage company when they got bigger touring gigs.</li><li> Barry Mitchell was next, playing 12 gigs with Queen (more than the other two combined) starting in August 1970 and leaving in January 1971. Allegedly, John Deacon was in attendance at one of the gigs Mitchell played as bassist.</li><li> 17-year-old Doug Bogie lasted all of two gigs over two days, February 19-20, 1971. According to him, the band had a bit of a falling out after that second gig and wouldn't play live again for four more months, and so Bogie moved on. At that next gig, on July 2, 1971, John Deacon became Queen's fourth and final bassist.</li></ul></li><li> Randy Rhoads was one of the founding members of <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/QuietRiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/QuietRiot">Quiet Riot</a></strong>, but grew frustrated with their early lack of success (their first two albums were only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRunInPeru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRunInPeru">released in Japan</a>), and jumped at the offer to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OzzyOsbourne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OzzyOsbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a>'s guitarist.<ul><li> Rhoads' replacement Greg Leon arguably has three cases of this, with that band (he was gone when they broke out with <em>Metal Health</em>), along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MotleyCrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MotleyCrue">M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e</a> (he played with Tommy Lee, and rehearsed with him and Nikki Six), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Dokken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Dokken">Dokken</a> (he toured Europe with Don Dokken before the band started recording).

When the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989, the members successfully lobbied for Stewart to be inducted too.

It was only after Bunton joined the group that member Geri Halliwell coined the name Spice Girls.</li><li> Early lineups of what would later became <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheStatlerBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheStatlerBrothers">The Statler Brothers</a></strong> included Joe McDorman, who was replaced by Lew DeWitt by the time the group got going.</li><li> When <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StatusQuo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StatusQuo">Status Quo</a></strong> began in the middle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a>, they had a moderate amount of success and two or three chart hits in a swirly, keyboards-driven, psychedelic manner. When the band's direction changed from ''Pictures of Matchstick Men" to the more guitar-driven sound they are far more famous for, there wasn't so much call for a permanent keyboards player, and Roy Lynes left the band, which did not take another full-time keyboardist member until 1977, nearly ten years later. If people are asked "who played keyboards with Status Quo?", the answer is invariably going to be Alan Bown. Thus Lynes remains an obscure footnote to the group's history.</li><li> The drummer for the proto-<strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteelyDan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteelyDan">Steely Dan</a></strong> band The Leather Canary was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChevyChase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChevyChase">Chevy Chase</a>.

(If they're particularly big fans they'll know that Timo Kotipelto didn't join until four albums in). Virtually no one will say Tuomo Lassila, Staffan Str&aring;hlman and John Viherv&auml;, who were the founding members of Black Water, the original name for the band. Additionally, you'd be hard pressed to find someone who remembers Jyrki Lentonen (second bass guitarist, replaced John Viherv&auml; in 1984), Jari Behm (third bass guitarist, replaced Jyrki Lentonen in 1989), Antti Ikonen (original keyboardist, joined in 1988) or Sami Kuoppam&auml;ki (replaced Tuomo Lassila on drums and played for one year before being replaced by J&ouml;rg Michael).<ul><li> Katriina "Miss K" Wiiala (temporary vocalist, replaced Timo Kotipelto in 2004 before being replaced by Kotipelto again) and Anders Johansson (replaced J&ouml;rg Michael on drums in 2004 before being replaced by J&ouml;rg again) are usually not remembered for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">quite</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">different reasons</a>.</li></ul></li><li> John Curulewski was the lead guitarist on the first several <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Styx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Styx">Styx</a></strong> albums, which were moderately successful.

Hall quit after the first album, leaving the two-person lineup of Nettles and Bush, with which Sugarland had its greatest commercial success.

Then the two songwriters relocated to Los Angeles, formed a new band under the Supertramp name, and met with huge success in the late 1970s. One of their abandoned British former members later resurfaced as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KingCrimson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KingCrimson">King Crimson</a>'s lyricist in their <em>Larks' Tongues in Aspic</em> era.</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Swans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Swans">Swans</a></strong>, a band notorious for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolvingDoorBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolvingDoorBand">its line-up changes</a>, generally held over at least a few members from the previous incarnation, with older ones popping in perennially. Now look at their first release... No, not <em>Filth</em>. The self-titled EP they released in 1982. Now ask yourself: Who is Daniel Galliduani, the one on the sax? Or Bob Pezzola, the guitarist? Answers have slowly surfaced: Galliduani played with drummer Jonathan Kane as Transmission in the 1970s, later becoming a respected photographer; Pezzola was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagalongKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagalongKid">a teenage tagalong</a>, recruited from an obscure NYC outfit called Phosphorus. And he wasn't the first; Glenn Branca acolyte Sue Hanel was.

After getting a manager, who renamed them <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TLC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TLC">TLC</a></strong>, they had an audition to get a record deal. They passed on the condition of replacing Jones - and with Rozonda Thomas (nicknamed "Chili" so the acronym would still work) they sold millions worldwide. Jones's dismissal was because she refused to sign Reid's major label contract - a suspiciousness that wound up prescient: following the success of their hit album <em>CrazySexyCool</em>, TLC declared bankruptcy because they made almost no money off of album sales.</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TNT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TNT">TNT</a></strong> had their first singer and rhythm guitarist Dag Ingebrigstein, who was fired from the band in the middle of recording demos for the second album.

U2, of course, would later achieve superstardom.</li><li> In a rare example of this happening within a band that had already been signed and released several albums, cofounder John Foxx left <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ultravox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ultravox">Ultravox</a></strong> after three albums to start a solo career, having helped steer the band from its punk roots to early synthpop pioneers.

Despite feeling more at home behind the mixing desk, Horn managed a convincing imitation of Anderson's countertenor vocal style. Nonetheless when the band toured the album audiences were confused by the new line-up. Eventually Horn found that his voice couldn't take the rigours of constant live performance - he had a deeper vocal tone than Anderson, but the group was unwilling to pitch their instruments to suit him - and he retired from the band, with Anderson coming back. Horn remained as the band's producer, in which capacity he was far more successful. He's an odd example of a Pete Best who overshadowed <em>himself</em> - although <em>Drama</em> is mostly written-off as a weak attempt to copy New Wave, Horn's production work helped <em>90125</em> become one of the band's most popular albums, and its hit single "Owner of a Lonely Heart" has Horn's signature sound all over it.</li></ul></li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder26');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Z&nbsp;</div><div id="folder26" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> Very early in <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ZacBrownBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ZacBrownBand">Zac Brown Band</a></strong>'s history, Marcus Petruska and Tim Ussery were the drummer and lead guitarist, with Joel Williams later replacing Ussery. Petruska and Williams are credited on their major-label debut <em>The Foundation</em>, but promotional material around the release of their major-label debut single "Chicken Fried" was already crediting Chris Fryar and Coy Bowles in those respective roles. They are also an inverse example, as <em>three</em> other members were added to the lineup without anyone else leaving: Clay Cook (keyboards) joined shortly after the release of "Chicken Fried", Daniel de los Reyes (percussion) just before their third major-label album <em>Uncaged</em> in 2012, and Matt Mangano took over on bass guitar after said album so that existing bassist John Driskell Hopkins could switch to guitar and banjo.</li><li> In the 1960s, Billy Gibbons was part of The Moving Sidewalks, along with three other guys. Once two of them were drafted for the US Army, he brought a different bassist to a new project, which he called <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ZZTop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ZZTop">ZZ Top</a></strong> and recorded a single in 1970, "Salt Lick". The bassist was replaced, and then in 1971 both the bassist (Bill Ethridge) and the drummer (Dan Mitchell) were replaced by Dusty Hill and Frank Beard, who have been in the band ever since.</li></ul></div><hr>
