But his implementation had a fatal flaw: the connector on the interface cable that connected the drive to the controller card in the computer was not polarized or keyed - it could easily be connected backwards or misaligned, which would fry the drive's electronics when the equipment was powered up. (Shugart used a different connector which could not be inserted misaligned, and if it were connected backward it wouldn't damage anything; it just wouldn't work.) Apple "solved" this problem by adding a buffer chip between the cable and the rest of the circuit, whose purpose was to act as a multi-circuit fuse which would blow if the cable were misconnected, protecting the rest of the chips in the drive.</li><li> The power switch on the Apple II power supply was under-rated and had a tendency to burn out after repeated use. Unlike the "fuse" chip in the disk drives (which was socketed), the power switch was not user-replaceable. The recommended "fix": leave the power switch "on" all the time and use an external power switch to turn the computer off. Fine if annoying in the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries where most, if not all, wall sockets are switched; not so fine in mainland Europe or North America, where switched wall sockets were rare at the time. At least one vendor offered an external power switch module shaped to fit nicely behind the Apple II, but most users simply plugged their computer into a standard power strip and used its on/off switch to turn their equipment off.</li></ul></li><li> The old Apple III was three parts stupid and one part hubris; the case was completely unventilated and the CPU didn't even have a heat sink. Apple reckoned that the entire case was aluminum, which would work just fine as a heat sink, no need to put holes in our lovely machine! This led to the overheating chips actually becoming unseated from their sockets; tech support would advise customers to lift the machine a few inches off the desktop and drop it, the idea being that the shock would re-seat the chips. It subsequently turned out that the case wasn't the only problem, since a lot of the early Apple IIIs shipped with defective power circuity that ran hotter than it was supposed to, but it helped turn what would have otherwise been an issue that affected a tiny fraction of Apple IIIs into a widespread problem. Well, at least it gave <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked">Cracked</a> something to joke about.<ul><li> A lesser, but still serious design problem existed with the Power Mac G4 Cube. Like the iMacs of that era, it had no cooling fan and relied on a top-mounted cooling vent to let heat out of the chassis. The problem was that the Cube had more powerful hardware crammed into a smaller space than the classic iMacs, meaning that the entirely passive cooling setup was <em>barely</em> enough to keep the system cool. If the vent was even slightly blocked, however, then the system would rapidly overheat. Add to that the problem of the Cube's design being perfect for putting sheets of paper (or worse still, books) on top of the cooling vent, and it gets worse. Granted, this situation relied on foolishness by the user for it to occur, but it was still a silly decision to leave out a cooling fan (and one that thankfully wasn't repeated when Apple tried the same concept again with the Mac Mini).</li><li> Another issue related to heat is that Apple has a serious track record of not applying thermal grease appropriately in their systems. Most DIY computer builders know that a rice grain-sized glob of thermal grease is enough. Apple consistently <em>cakes</em> chips that needed it with thermal grease.</li><li> Heat issues are also bad for MacBook Pros. Not so much for casual users, but very much so for heavy processor load applications. Since the MBP is pretty much <em>de rigeur</em> for musicians (and almost as much for graphic designers and moviemakers), this is a rather annoying problem since Photoshop with a lot of images or layers or any music software with a large number of tracks <em>will</em> drive your temperature through the roof. Those who choose to game with a MBP have it even worse - <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> will start to cook your MBP within 30 minutes of playing, especially if you have a high room temperature. The solution? Get the free software programs Temperature Monitor and SMCFanControl, then keep an eye on your temps and be very liberal with upping the fans. The only downsides to doing so are more noise, a drop in battery time, and possible fan wear, but that's <strong>far</strong> better than your main system components being fried or worn down early.</li></ul></li><li> The very first iPhone had its headphone jack in a recession on the top of the phone. While this worked fine with the stock Apple earbuds, headphones with larger plugs wouldn't fit without an adapter.</li><li> Apple made a big mistake with one of their generations of the iPhone. Depending on how you held it, it could not <em>receive signals</em>. The iPhone 4's antenna is integrated into its outside design and is a bare, unpainted aluminum strip around its edge, with a small gap somewhere along the way. To get a good signal strength it relies on this gap being open, but if you hold the phone in a certain way (which "accidentally" happens to be the most comfortable way to do so, especially if you're left-handed), your palm covers that gap and, if it's the least bit damp, <em>shorts</em> it, rendering the antenna completely useless. Lacquering the outside of antenna, or simply moving the air gap a bit so it doesn't get shorted by the user's hand, would've solved the problem in a breeze, but apparently Apple's much more concerned about its "product identity" than about its users. Apple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">suggested that users were "holding it wrong"</a>. As it turns out, Apple would soon be selling modification kits for $25 a pop, for an issue that, by all standards, should have been fixed for free, if not discovered and eliminated before it even hit the market. Apple got sued from at least three major sources for scam due to this.</li><li> MacBook disc drives are often finicky to use, sometimes not reading the disc at all and getting it stuck in the drive. The presented solutions? Restarting your computer and holding down the mouse button until it ejects. And even <em>that</em> isn't guaranteed - sometimes the disc will jut out just enough that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">the solution won't register at all</a> and pushing it in with a pair of tweezers finishes the job. To put this in perspective, technologically inferior <em>video game consoles</em> like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii">Wii</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3">PlayStation 3</a> can do a slot-loading disc drive far better than Apple apparently can.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Say what you will about the iPhone 7's merging of the headphone and charger jacks</a>, but there's no denying that upon closer inspection, this combined with the lack of wireless charging creates a whole new problem. As explained in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vYfAqEyGV0">this video<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, the charger jack is only capable of withstanding a certain amount of wear and tear (between 5,000 and 10,000 plugs, although only Apple themselves know the exact number). Because you're now using the same jack for two different things, chances are you'll wear it out twice as fast as any other iPhone. Because the phone doesn't have a wireless charging function like most other phones, this means that if this happens your phone is pretty much toast.</li><li> The Apple Magic Mouse 2 tried to improve upon the original Magic Mouse by making its battery rechargeable. Unfortunately, this choice was widely ridiculed as for some reason <a class="urllink" href="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/zqd1404.png">the charging port was located on the underside of the mouse<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>, rendering it inoperable while plugged in. One wonders why they couldn't just put the port on the front, like pretty much every other chargeable mouse. Apparently, it's to preserve the mouse's aesthetics, in yet another case of Apple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">favoring aesthetics over usability</a>.</li><li> Several users have <a class="urllink" href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8223635">reported<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that plugging a charger into their Thunderbolt 3 MacBook Pro makes the left topmost port output 20V instead of the standard 5V, effectively frying whatever is plugged in. Four ports you could plug a charger in, and they didn't test what happens if you plug the charger in anywhere else?</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;</div><div id="folder1" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> The "Prescott" core Pentium 4 has a reputation for being the worst CPU design in history. It had some design trade-offs which lessened the processor's performance-per-clock over the original Pentium 4 design, but theoretically allowed the Prescott to run at much higher clockspeeds. Unfortunately, these changes also made the Prescott vastly <em>hotter</em> than the original design, making it impossible for Intel to actually achieve the clockspeeds they wanted. Moreover, they totally bottlenecked the processor's performance, meaning that Intel's usual performance-increasing tricks (more cache and faster system buses) did nothing to help. By the time Intel came up with a new processor that put them back in the lead, the once hugely valuable Pentium brand had been rendered utterly worthless by the whole Prescott fiasco, and the new processor (based on the Pentium III microarchitecture) was instead called the Core 2. The Pentium name is still in use, but is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">applied to the mid-end processors that Intel puts out for cheap-ish computers</a>, somewhere in between the low-end Celerons and the high-end Core line.<ul><li> While the Prescott iteration of the design had some very special problems of its own, the Pentium 4 architecture in general had a rather unenviable reputation for underperforming. The design was heavily optimised in favor of being able to clock to high speeds in an attempt to win the "megahertz war" on the grounds that consumers at the time believed that higher clock speed equaled higher performance. The sacrifices made in the P4 architecture in order to achieve those high clock speeds, however, resulted in very poor performance per tick of the processor clock. For example, the processor had a very long instruction decode pipeline <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0g10k');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0g10k" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0g10k');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(a pipeline is a device that breaks the fetch/decode/execute cycle into subtasks that can be executed in an assembly line style so that while one instruction is being sent to the ALU for execution, the next in the sequence is being decoded and the one after that is being fetched, allowing 1 instruction per clock cycle instead of 1 instruction taking several cycles)</span> which was fine if the program being executed didn't do anything unexpected like jump to a new instruction, but if it did it would cause all instructions in the pipeline to be discarded, stalling the processor until the new program execution flow was loaded into the pipeline - and because the pipeline was a lot deeper than the previous Pentium III, the processor would stall for several clock cycles while the pipeline was purged and refreshed. The science of branch prediction was in its infancy at that point, so pipeline stalls were a common occurrence on Pentium 4 processors. This combined with other boneheaded design decisions like the omission of a barrel shifter <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1p67k');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1p67k" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1p67k');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(a device that can do shift operations to an arbitrary number of places in a single clock cycle, as opposed to shifting a single step per clock cycle until the desired result is achieved)</span> and providing multiple execution units but only having one be able to execute per clock cycle under most circumstances meant that the contemporary Athlon processor from AMD could eat the P4 alive at the same clock speed due to a far more efficient design (the last problem was partially solved with the concept of "hyperthreading", presenting a single core processor to the OS as a 2-core processor, and using some clever trickery in the chip itself to allow the execution units that would otherwise sit idle to execute a second instruction in parallel provided it meets certain criteria).</li></ul></li><li> The Prescott probably deserves the title of worst x86 CPU design ever (although there might be a case for the 80286), but allow us to introduce you to Intel's <em>other</em> CPU project in the same era: the Itanium. Designed for servers, using a bunch of incredibly-cutting-edge hardware design ideas. Promised to be incredibly fast. The catch? It could only hit that theoretical speed promise if the compiler generated <em>perfectly optimized</em> machine code for it. It turned out you <em>couldn't</em> optimize most of the code that runs on servers that hard, because programming languages suck,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2ne2z');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2ne2z" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2ne2z');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">every instruction typed in requires the computer to "think" about it, taking processor speed; optimization simply means the computer needs to think less overall to get the same result</span> and even if you could, the compilers of the time weren't up to it. It also turned out if you <em>didn't</em> give the thing perfectly optimized code, it ran about half as fast as the Pentium 4 and sucked down twice as much electricity doing it. Did we mention this was right about the time server farm operators started getting serious about cutting their electricity and HVAC bills?<ul><li> Making things worse, this was actually Intel's <em>third</em> attempt at implementing such a design. The failure of their first effort, the iAPX-432, was somewhat forgivable given that it wasn't really possible to achieve what Intel wanted on the manufacturing processes available in the early 1980s. What really should have taught them the folly of their ways came later in the decade with the i860, a much better implementation of what they had tried to achieve with the iAPX-432... which still happened to be both slower and vastly more expensive than not only the 80386 (bear in mind Intel released the 80<strong>4</strong>86 a few months before the i860) but also the i960, a much simpler and cheaper design which subsequently became the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a> of Intel and is still used today in certain roles.</li><li> In the relatively few situations where it gets the chance to shine, the Itanium 2 and its successors can achieve some truly awesome performance figures. The first Itanium, on the other hand, was an absolute joke. Even if you managed to get all your codepaths and data flows absolutely optimal, the chip would only perform as well as a similarly clocked Pentium <strong>III</strong>. Even Intel actually went so far as to recommend that only software developers should even think about buying systems based on the first Itanium, and that everyone else should wait for the Itanium 2, which probably ranks as one of the most humiliating moments in the company's history.<ul><li> The failure of the first Itanium was largely down to the horrible cache system that Intel designed for it. While the L1 and L2 caches were both reasonably fast (though the L2 cache was a little on the small side), the L3 cache used the same off-chip cache system designed three years previously for the original Pentium II Xeon. By the time the Itanium had hit the streets however, running external cache chips at CPU speeds just wasn't possible anymore without some compromise, so Intel decided to give them extremely high latency. This proved to be an absolutely disastrous design choice, and basically negated the effects of the cache. Moreover, Itanium instructions are four times larger than x86 ones, leaving the chip strangled between its useless L3 cache, and L1 and L2 caches that weren't big or fast enough to compensate. Most of the improvement in Itanium 2 came from Intel simply making the L1 and L2 caches similar sizes but much faster, and incorporating the L3 cache into the CPU die.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Intel Atom was not that far. The first generation (Silverthorne and Diamondville) were even slower than a Pentium III. Yeah, despite having low power consumption, the CPU performance was awful. To make it worse it only had support for Windows XP and it was still lagging. Following generations prior to Bay Trail were mere attempts to be competitive, but sadly they were even slower than a VIA processor (and that was considered a slow chip in their time).<ul><li> While the Diamondville (N270 and N280) was just barely fast enough to power a light-duty laptop, the Silverthorne (Z530 and Z540) was meant for mobile devices and had even lower performance, entirely insufficient for general-purpose computing. But the mobile market was already well in the hands of ARM chips, so Intel ended up with warehouses full of Silverthorne CPUs that nobody wanted. And so it was that they enacted license restrictions that forced manufacturers to use Silverthorne CPUs for devices with screens wider than 9 inches, scamming the public into buying laptops whose abysmal performance infuriated anyone who bought them, turning many off the concept of the netbook as a whole.</li><li> Averted wonderfully with Bay Trail, which managed to defeat VIA chips and be equal to AMD low-tier chips (which had a very awful moment with Kabini and Temash) while having decent GPU performance.</li><li> And then there's Intel SoFIA. They have success in the mobile area with Moorefield (Bay Trail chips with <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerVR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerVR">Power VR</a> GPU) and people were expecting to continue with that path, but they decided to use Mali GPU instead with constrained x86 chips in order to reduce cost. Sadly, their initial chips were as fast as the <em>slowest</em> ARM chip available at the time (which was the ARM A7) and even worse. That ARM's slowest chips were being replaced by A53/A35 chips as the new low tier, making Intel far behind. No wonder why they cancelled SoFIA.</li></ul></li><li> While Intel's CPU designers have mostly been able to avoid any crippling hardware-level bugs since the infamous <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_FDIV_bug">FDIV<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> bug in 1993 (say what you will about the Pentium 4, but at least it could divide numbers correctly), their chipset designers seem much more prone to making screw-ups:<ul><li> Firstly there was the optional Memory Translator Hub (MTH) component of the 820 chipset, which was supposed to allow the usage of more reasonably-priced SDRAM instead of the uber-expensive RDRAM that the baseline 820 was only compatible with. Unfortunately the MTH basically didn't work at all in this role (causing abysmally poor performance and system instability) and was rapidly discontinued, eventually forcing Intel to create the completely new 815 chipset to provide a more reasonable alternative for consumers.</li><li> Then there were the 915 and 925 chipsets; both had serious design flaws in their first production run, which required a respin to correct, and ultimately forced Intel to ditch the versions they had planned with Wi-Fi chips integrated into the chipset itself.</li><li> The P67 and H67 chipsets were found to have a design error that supplied too much power to the SATA 3Gbps controllers, which would cause them to burn out over time (though the 6 GBps controllers were unaffected, oddly enough).</li><li> The high-end X79 chipset was planned to have a ton of storage features available, such as up to a dozen Serial SCSI ports along with a dedicated secondary DMI link for storage functions... only for it to turn out that none of said features actually worked, meaning that it ended up being released with <em>less</em> features than its consumer counterparts.</li><li> A less severe problem afflicts the initial runs of the Z87 and H87 chipsets, in which USB 3.0 devices can fail to wake up when the system comes out of standby, and have to be physically disconnected and reconnected for the system to pick them up again.</li><li> Speaking of the 820 chipset, anyone remember <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDRAM">RDRAM<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>? It was touted by Intel and Rambus as a high-performance RAM for the Pentium III to be used in conjunction with the 820. But implementation-wise, it was not up to snuff (in fact, benchmarks revealed that applications ran slower with RDRAM than with the older SDRAM!), not to mention very expensive, and third-party chipset makers (such as SiS, who gained some fame during this era) went to cheaper DDR RAM instead (and begrudgingly, so did Intel, leaving Rambus with egg on its face), which ultimately became the de facto industry standard. RDRAM still found use in other applications, though, like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nintendo64">Nintendo 64</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a>... where it turned out to be one of the biggest performance bottlenecks on both systems &mdash; the N64 had twice the memory (and twice the bandwidth on it) of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a>, but such high latency on it (and a ridiculously small buffer for textures loaded into memory to be applied) that it negated those advantages entirely, while the PS2's memory had twice the clock speed of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox">Xbox</a>'s older SDRAM, but could only afford half as much memory, and half the bandwidth on it.<ul><li> A small explanation of what happened: Rambus RDRAM memory is more serial in nature than more-traditional memory like SDRAM (which is parallel). The idea was that RDRAM could use a high clock rate to compensate for the narrow bit width (RDRAM also used a neat innovation: dual data rate, using both halves of the clock signal to send data; however, two could play that game, and DDR SDRAM soon followed). But there was two problems. First, all this conversion required additional complex (and <em>patented</em>) hardware which raised the cost. Second, and more critically, this kind of electrical maneuvering involves conversions and so on, which adds latency...and memory is one of the areas where latency is a key metric: the lower the better. SDRAM, for all its faults, operated more on a "keep it simple stupid" principle, and it worked, and later versions of the technology introduced necessary complexities at a gradual pace (such as the DDR2/3 preference for matched pairs/trios of modules), making them more tolerable.</li></ul></li><li> Another particularly egregious chipset screw-up was with the integrated versions on the aforementioned Silvermont and Airmont/Braswell Atom chips. In late 2016, Intel revealed that the clock for the LPC bus on server models could fail, shutting down the bus and cutting off access to a host of essential and not-so-essential components. More often than not, an affected device would turn into a brick, not even able to boot. To their credit, Intel eventually managed to release a new series of server chips which corrected the problem...only to find out months later that many of their consumer-grade Silvermont chips could experience the same problem, only worse. With the consumer chips, it wasn't just the LPC bus that tended to break - the USB and SD card controllers often fried themselves as well. Once again, Intel rushed out a new "stepping" of the affected Atom products, this time alongside updated firmware that coddled the earlier, broken versions into working as long as possible. Think that's the end of this little story? <em>Think again.</em> When Intel moved to the succeeding Airmont series of Atom processors, they <em>somehow</em> managed to screw up the design even more: the USB controller was fixed, but now the real-time clock (which holds the time and date) would wear out early instead. At that point, the team at Intel just went "to Hell with it" and left Airmont as-is.</li></ul></li><li> Intel's SSDs have a particular failure mode that rubs people the wrong way: After the drive determines that it's lifespan is up from a certain amount of writes, the drive goes into read-only mode. This is great and all until you consider that the number of writes is often lower compared to other SSDs of similar technology (up to about 500 terabytes versus 5 petabytes) and that you only have <strong>one chance</strong> to read the data off the drive. If you reboot (and chances are, you would because guess what happens when the OS drive suddenly becomes read-only and the system could no longer write to it's swap file? Yep, Windows spazzes out and starts intermittently freezing and would eventually BSOD), the drive then goes to an unusable state, regardless of whether or not the data on the drive is still good. Worst of all is that Intel's head of storage division simply brushes it off, claiming that "the data on the disk is unreliable after it's life is up" and that "people should be making regular backups nightly".</li><li> In early 2018, a hardware bug across all x86-based Intel processors (except the pre-2013 Atoms) released since <em>1995</em> known as Meltdown caused speculative code (that is, machine code that the CPU predicts that it will need to run and tries while it waits for the "actual" instructions to arrive) to be run before any checks that the code was allowed to run at the required privilege level. This could cause ring-3 code (user-level) to access ring-0 (kernel-level) data. The result? Any kernel developers developing for Intel needed to scramble to patch their page tables so they would do extra babysitting on affected processors. This could cause a 7%-30% performance reduction on <em>every single Intel chip in the hands of anyone who had updated their hardware in the last decade</em>, with performance loss depending on multiple factors. Linux kernel developers considered nicknaming their fix for the bug "Forcefully Unmap Complete Kernel With Interrupt Trampolines" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms">FUCKWIT</a>), which is surely the adjective they thought would best describe Intel hardware designers at that time. It subsequently turned out that Intel's weren't the only CPUs to be vulnerable to this form of attack, but of the major manufacturers, theirs are by far the most severely affected (AMD's current Ryzen line-up is almost totally immune to the exploits, and while ARM processors are also vulnerable they tend to operate in much more locked-down environments than x86 processors, making it harder to push the exploit through). The performance penalties that the fix required ended up ensuring that when AMD released their second-generation Ryzen processors later that year, it turned what would likely have been a fairly even match-up into one where AMD was able to score some very definite victories. It also forced Intel to basically redesign their future chipsets from the ground up to incorporate the fixes into their future processor lines.<ul><li> It's worth noting that after the subsequent updates and fixes, the actual performance loss caused by the Meltdown fix is quite variable, and some people with Intel chips may not notice a difference - for example, the performance loss in gaming desktops/in-game benchmarks is negligible at best (with the modern Coffee Lake chipset in particular being virtually unaffected), while performance loss in server Intel chips is <em>much</em> more pronounced. It's still an utterly ridiculous oversight on Intel's part, though.</li><li> Meltdown later turned out to be just <em>one</em> member of a much larger family of hardware flaws called the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_execution_CPU_vulnerability">transient execution CPU vulnerabilities<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, and they of leaking secure data across multiple protection boundaries, including those which were supposed to stop Meltdown. Researchers have concluded that the only way to fix the flaws permanently without incurring colossal slowdowns is to completely redesign the offending chips to a much greater extent than was first thought to be needed.</li></ul></li><li> In the early '90s, to replace the aging 8259 programmable interrupt controller, Intel created what they called the Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller, or APIC. Configuring the APIC typically required writing to some address space and it was configurable. Since the APIC was backwards-compatible with the 8259 and the 8259 had a fixed location, older software would break if the APIC wasn't located somewhere the software was expecting. So Intel allowed the memory address window of the APIC to be moved. This wouldn't be so much of a problem until they introduced the Intel Management Engine (IME), a standalone processor designed to manage the PC such as cooling and remote access. The problem with the IME is it's basically a master system that can control the CPU so care needs to be taken that it can't be taken over. But security research in 2013 found out that in earlier systems with IME, you could slide the APIC address window over where the address space for IME is located, inject code into it, and do whatever you want with the compromised computer and <em>nothing in the computer</em> can stop this because the IME has the highest level of access of <em>anything</em> in the computer. Intel independently found this around the same time, and it has since been fixed by basically denying the APIC address window from sliding over the IME one.</li><li> The 80286 introduced "protected mode," the first memory management for x86 processors. The only problem is that it was impossible to switch back to "real mode," which many MS-DOS programs required to run. This is why Bill Gates called the chip "brain-damaged." The chip was still popular, powering the IBM PC AT and many clones, but mainly as just a fast 8088 processor. The 286 was popular for running multiuser, multitasking systems with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Unix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Unix">Unix</a> variant XENIX, where the need to switch back to real mode was not an issue. The 80386 fixed this issue, being able to switch between modes.</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AMD&nbsp;</div><div id="folder2" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> AMD's wildly successful Athlon Thunderbird ran at high speeds and for a while obliterated everything else on the market, but it was also the hottest CPU ever made up until that point. This wouldn't be so bad in and of itself - even hotter CPUs were made by both AMD and Intel in later years - but the Thunderbird was special in that it had no heat-management features whatsoever. If you ran one without the heatsink - or, more plausibly, if the heavy chunk of aluminium sitting on the processor broke the mounting clips through its sheer weight and dropped to the floor of the case - <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoXRHexGIok">the processor would insta-barbecue itself<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</li><li> In late 2006 it was obvious that Intel were determined to pay AMD back for the years of ass-kickings it had endured at the hands of the Athlon 64, by releasing the Core 2 Quad only five months after the Core 2 Duo had turned the performance tables. The Phenom was still some ways off, so AMD responded with the Quad FX, a consumer-oriented dual-processor platform that could mount two dual-core chips (branded as Athlon 64s, but actually rebadged Opteron server chips). While repurposing Opterons for desktop use was something that had worked magnificently three years prior, this time it became obvious that AMD <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough">Didn't Think This Through</a> - not only was this set-up more expensive than a Core 2 Quad (the CPUs and motherboard worked out to about the same price, but you needed twice the memory modules, a more powerful PSU, and a copy of Windows XP Professional), but it generally wasn't any faster, and in anything that didn't use all four cores actually tended to be far <em>slower</em>, as Windows XP had no idea how to deal with the two memory pools created by the dual-CPU set-up (Vista was a lot more adept in that department, but had its own set of problems).</li><li> Amazingly enough, things got worse when the Phenom eventually did arrive on the scene. In addition to being clocked far too slow to compete with the Core 2 Quad - which wasn't really due to any particular design flaw, other than its native quad-core design being a little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> - it turned out that there was a major problem with the chip's translation lookaside buffer (TLB), which could lead to crashes and/or data corruption in certain rare circumstances. Instead of either initiating a full recall or banking on the fact that 98% of users would never encounter this bug, AMD chose a somewhat odd third option and issued a BIOS patch that disabled the TLB altogether, crippling the chip's performance. They soon released Phenoms that didn't have the problem at all, but any slim hope of it succeeding went up in smoke after this fiasco.<ul><li> Things got better with Phenom II, which improved dramatically the performance, going near Intel once again and even more, their 6-core chips were good enough to get some buyers (and even defeating in some uses the first generation of Core i7), indicating that the original Phenom was an otherwise-sound design brought down by poor clock speeds, the TLB glitch, and not enough cache. Which is still more than can be said for the next major design...</li></ul></li><li> AMD's Bulldozer was something that may make people wonder why they went this route. On the surface, AMD made two integer cores share a floating point unit. This makes some sense, as most operations are integer-based. Except those cores share an instruction decoder and scheduler, effectively making a single core with two disjointed pools of execution units. Also, each integer core was weaker than the Phenom II's core. To make matters worse, they also adopted a deep pipeline and high clock frequencies. If anyone paid attention to processor history, those two reasons were the root cause in why the Pentium 4 failed. Still, it was forgivable since they used more cores (up to 8 threads in 4 modules) and higher clock speeds than Intel in order to compensate, making it at least useful in some occasions (like video editing or virtual machines).<ul><li> However, it went downhill with the Carrizo, the last major family based on the Bulldozer lineage. It cut the L2 cache which gives enough performance to not to be outmatched by Intel Haswell and they got stuck in 28 nm process, making it worse. Even worse? Builders of laptops (which the Carrizo was intended for) decided to use the worst designs for them, taking their performance to near Intel Nehalem levels, which was outdated by <em>six years</em>. One could get the impression that AMD simply didn't care about the Bulldozer family by this point anymore, and just quickly shoved Carrizo out the door so as not to waste the R&amp;D money, while also establishing the Socket AM4 infrastructure that their next family, Ryzen (which got them back on track and then some), would use.</li></ul></li></ul></div><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><hr><h2>Multiple companies:</h2><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder3');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computers and smartphones&nbsp;</div><div id="folder3" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> Some HP laptops have a feature called "Action Keys". On most laptops, doing things like adjusting volume or screen brightness would require you to hold the "fn" key and press a certain function key at the same time. Since the "fn" key is normally at the bottom of the keyboard and the function keys are normally at the top, this could get annoying or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeDexterityRequired" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeDexterityRequired">uncomfortable</a>, so HP had the idea to switch this around: pressing a function key on its own would adjust volume or brightness, and users who actually want to press the function key can do so by holding down the "fn" key. Since most computer users adjust the volume or brightness much more often than they need to press F6, this is nice, but what if you do need to use the function keys a lot (for example, when programming and using debug mode)? Hopefully HP included an option to conveniently switch Action Keys on and off, right? You wish. Disabling or re-enabling the Action Keys requires you to turn off the laptop, then switch it back on while holding F10 to open up the BIOS menu, where you can find the option. Each time you want to switch between these modes, you need to reset your laptop, which is a massive inconvenience. And even worse, screen-reading software does not work in the BIOS menu, which makes changing these options almost impossible for visually-impaired users. On the bright side, key combinations like Alt+F4 still work, but why HP didn't just make this easy to switch on and off is a mystery.</li><li> The Coleco Adam, a 1983 computer based on the fairly successful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColecoVision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColecoVision">ColecoVision</a> console, suffered from a host of problems and baffling design decisions. Among the faults were the use of a proprietary tape drive which was prone to failure, locating the whole system's power supply in the <em>printer</em> of all places (meaning the very limited daisy-wheel printer couldn't be replaced, and if it broke down or was absent, the whole computer was rendered unusable), and poor electromagnetic shielding which could lead to tapes and disks being <em>erased</em> at startup. Even after revised models ironed out the worst bugs, the system was discontinued after less than 2 years and sales of 100,000 units.</li><li> The Samsung Galaxy Note 7, released in August 2016 and discontinued just two months later. On the surface, it was a great cell phone that competed with any number of comparable phablets. The problem? <a class="urllink" href="http://gizmodo.com/how-a-boring-iphone-7-put-samsung-on-the-path-to-self-d-1786786206">It was rushed to market<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> to beat Apple's upcoming iPhone 7 (which came out the following month), and this left it with a serious problem: namely, that it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium">had a habit of spontaneously combusting</a>. Samsung hastily recalled the phone in September once it started causing dozens of fires (to the point where aviation safety authorities were telling people not to bring them onto planes), and gave buyers replacements with batteries from a different supplier. When <em>those</em> phones started catching fire as well, it became obvious that the problems had nothing to do with quality control and ran to the heart of the phone's design <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note35mlq');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note35mlq" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note35mlq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(the phone's power draw was greater than any battery that size can handle, leading them to overvolt, overheat, and experience a catastrophic chemical reaction that lithium-ion batteries are prone to)</span>.

Users would find that just installing the most widely-used apps - Whatsapp, Facebook, and Messenger - would fill up all available storage. Samsung bundled a 2GB microSD card with the phone and you could move <em>some</em> application data to it using third-party hacks, but you couldn't move all storage to it, so it was a temporary fix that might let you install an app or two more - then you'd run out again. Fixing it properly was most definitely not a newbie-friendly operation: it entailed rooting and flashing a special hack that would integrate the SD card's filesystem to the phone's, making Android think they were one and the same. This worked to make the phone usable, but at the price of speed and complete dependence on the SD card, which, if it got corrupted or lost, would render the phone unusable without further hacking. It was one of Samsung's most hated models and occasionally suffers ridicule even now.</li><li> The Dell Inspiron line was somewhat known for having <em>very</em> faulty speakers. These usually boil down to two issues:<ul><li> The ribbon cable that connects the speakers to the motherboard is very frail, and often comes loose if you move your device too much (the device in question being a <em>laptop</em> designed for portability).</li><li> The headphone jack has a physical switch that turns off the speakers. If you plug something into the jack, the speakers turn off; unplug it, and they turn on. Simple, right? Well, this switch is bound to get stuck at one point or another, and the only way to even get to it is to disassemble the damn thing, or by spraying contact cleaner in the port and hoping that the air pressure flips the switch.</li></ul><p></p></li><li> The Dell XPS line has also been known for its fair share of design failures.<p></p><ul><li> The Dell XPS 13 9350/9360 has 4 NVME lanes going to the m.2 Slot and 2 going to the Thunderbolt 3 port- which means it sacrificed Thunderbolt bandwidth for better speed on the SSD.

On the surface, it was revolutionary: a smartphone that could be folded up like the flip phones of the '90s and 2000s, allowing a pocket-sized device to have a 7.3-inch screen like a small tablet computer. Unfortunately, reviewers' $1,980 Galaxy Note phones started <a class="urllink" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/galaxy-fold-problems-bad-for-foldable-phones,news-29895.html">breaking<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> just a few days after they got them, in what was possibly the worst possible first impression for foldable smartphones. Many of the problems could be traced to people removing the protective film on the screen - a film that, in a true case of this trope, looked almost exactly like the thin plastic screen protectors that normally ship on the screens of other smartphones and tablets to keep them from getting scratched or accumulating dust during transport, leaving many to wonder just why Samsung not only made a necessary part of the phone so easy to remove, but made it look so similar to a part of other phones that is designed to be removed before use.</li><li> VIA processors of years past are <em>almost</em> worth a place on this list due solely to their absolutely abysmal performance - at the time they competed with Pentium IIIs, and routinely lost to them despite having 2-3 times as many MHz - but what truly sets the VIA C3 apart is that there is a second, completely undocumented, non-x86 core that has complete control over the security system. It has never been actually used by any known appliance and no official instructions exist on how to access it - making one wonder why exactly is it there in the first place - but in 2018 a curious hacker found out about it in VIA's patents. He investigated, managed to activate it, and thus gave the VIA C3 the dubious prize of being the first processor ever that lets any unauthorised user take complete control of the system without using any bugs or exploits, simply by utilising resources put there by the manufacturer. To compound the issue, the C3 was often used in point-of-sale terminals and ATMs, juicy targets for exactly this sort of manipulation. The only reason this didn't turn into a worldwide scandal is that the processor is so old it's been superseded everywhere that matters.</li><li> The Toshiba Satellite A205 was a mess. While it was one of the few laptops that could competently run Windows Vista, it had its own issues on the hardware side. Firstly, both its battery and AC adapter were prone to going bad after just a few months - either the battery stopped holding a charge altogether, or the AC adapter stopped working all of sudden. The other problem it had was the ISA slot for the hard drive. If you were planning on swapping it out, better hope you got one that's exactly the right size, because if it's too small, it'll just slide off if you tilt the device ever so slightly.</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder4');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer Hardware and Peripherals&nbsp;</div><div id="folder4" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> Famously, the "PC LOAD LETTER" message you'd get on early HP Laserjets has been elevated as an example of confusion in user interfaces.

Due to the quirk in how its addressing system worked <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5q9y4');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5q9y4" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5q9y4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(basically, they've skipped on the bounds check there)</span>, Intel's 8088/86 CPUs could theoretically address slightly more than their advertised 1 MB. But because they <em>physically</em> still had only 20 address pins, the resulting address just wrapped over, so the last 64K of memory actually was the same as the first. Some early programmers <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6y84a');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6y84a" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6y84a');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(among them, Microsoft; the CALL 5 entry point in MS-DOS relies on this behavior)</span> were, unsurprisingly, stupid enough to use this almost-not-a-bug <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">as a feature</a>. So, when the 24-bit 80286 rolled in, a problem arose - nothing wrapped anymore. In a truly stellar example of a "compatibility is God" thinking, IBM engineers couldn't think up anything better than to simply <em>block</em> the offending 21st pin (the aforementioned A20 line) on the motherboard side, making the 286 unable to use a solid chunk of its memory above 1 meg until this switch was turned on. This might have been an acceptable (if very clumsy) solution had IBM defaulted to having the A20 line enabled and provided an option to disable it when needed, but instead they decided to have it always turned off unless the OS specifically enables it. By the 386 times, no sane programmer used that "wrapping up" trick any more, but turning the A20 line on is <em>still</em> among the very first things any PC OS has to do. It wasn't until Intel introduced the Core i7 in 2008 that they finally decided "screw it" and locked the A20 line into being permanently enabled.</li><li> Qualcomm had their own share of failure: The Snapdragon 808 and 810 were very powerful chips at the time (2015) since they were based on the high performance ARM A57 design, but it had a very important disadvantage: it overheats to the point to make it throttle and lose performance! And three terminals got hit <em>hard</em> with this: the LG G4 (with Snapdragon 808), becoming infamous since it dies after just one year; the HTC M9 (with Snapdragon 810), which became infamous for overheating a lot; and the Sony Xperia Z5, for the same reasons as the M9. No wonder why the rest of the competition (Hisilicon and Mediatek) avoided the ARM A57 design.</li><li> The iRex Digital Reader 1000 had a truly beautiful full-A4 eInk display... but was otherwise completely useless as a digital reader. It could take more than a minute to boot up, between 5 and 30 seconds to change between pages of a PDF document, and could damage the memory card inserted into it. Also, if the battery drained all the way to nothing, starting to charge it again would cause such a current draw that it would fail to charge (and cause power faults) on any device other than a direct USB-to-mains connector, which was not supplied with the hardware.</li><li> Motorola is one of the most ubiquitous producers of commercial two-way radios, so you'd think they'd ironed out issues. Nope, there's a bunch.<ul><li> The MTX 9000 line (the "brick" radios) were generally made of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TonkaTough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TonkaTough">Nokiamantium</a>, but they had a huge flaw in the battery clips. The battery was held at the bottom by two flimsy plastic claws and the clips at the top were just slightly thicker than cellophane, meaning that the batteries quickly became impossible to hold in without buying a very tight-fitting holster or wrapping rubber bands around it.</li><li> The software to program virtually any Motorola radio, even newer ones, is absolutely ancient. You can only connect via serial port. An actual serial port - USB to serial adapter generally won't work. And the system it's running on has to be basically stone age (Pentium Is from 1993 are generally too fast), meaning that in most radio shops there's a 486 in the corner just for programming them. Even the new XPR line can't generally be programmed with a computer made after 2005 or so.<ul><li> If you can't find a 486 computer, there's a build of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DOSBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DOSBox">DOSBox</a> floating around ham circles with beefed-up code to slow down the environment even more than is possible by default. MTXs were very popular for 900MHz work because, aside from the battery issue, they were tough and cheap to get because of all the public agencies and companies that sold them off in bulk.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> VESA Local Bus. Cards were very long and hard to insert because they needed two ports: the standard ISA and an additional 32-bit bus hardwired to the 486 processor, which caused huge instability and incompatibility problems. Things could get worse if a non-graphic expansion card (usually IO ports) was installed next to a video card, which could result in crashes when games using SVGA graphics accessed the hard drive. The multiple clock frequencies involved imposed high standards on the construction of the cards in order to avoid further issues. All these problems eventually caused the 486-bus-dependent VLB to be replaced by PCI, starting from late-development 486 boards onwards into the Pentium era.<ul><li> Proving that lighning could in fact strike the same place twice, however, was the invention of <em>PCI-X (PCI Extended)</em> almost decade later. Which has the same idiot design as VLB- namely, a standard PCI 2.3 slot and an additional second slot behind it. Needless to say, PCI-X cards were bulky and huge and has it's own myriad of issues, including one that states that the bus shall run at the speed of the slowest card on the motherboard. Thankfully the competing standard, <em>PCI Express (PCIe)</em>, won.</li></ul></li><li> The Radio Shack TRS-80 (model 1) had its share of hardware defects:<ul><li> The timing loop constant in the keyboard debounce routine was too small. This caused the keys to "bounce" - one keypress would sometimes result in 2 of that character being input.</li><li> The timing loop constant in the tape input routine was wrong. This made the volume setting on the cassette player extremely critical. This problem could somewhat be alleviated by placing an AM radio next to the computer and tuning it to the RFI generated by the tape input circuit, then adjusting the volume control on the tape player for the purest tone from the radio. Radio Shack eventually offered a free hardware modification that conditioned the signal from the tape player to make the volume setting less critical.</li><li> Instead of using an off-the-shelf Character Generator chip in the video circuit, RS had a custom CG chip programmed, with arrow characters instead of 4 of the least-used ASCII characters. But they made a mistake and positioned the lowercase "a" at the top of the character cell instead of at the baseline. Instead of wasting the initial production run of chips and ordering new chips, they eliminated one of the video-memory chips, added some gates to "fold" the lowercase characters into the uppercase characters, and modified the video driver software to accommodate this. Hobbyists with electronics skills were able to add the missing video memory chip, disconnect the added gates, and patch the video driver software to properly display lowercase, albeit with "flying a's". The software patch would have to be reloaded every time the computer was booted. Radio Shack eventually came out with an "official" version of this mod which included a correctly-programmed CG chip.</li><li> The biggest flaw in the Model 1 was the lack of gold plating on the edge connector for the Expansion Interface. Two-thirds of the RAM in a fully-expanded TRS-80 was in the EI, and the bare copper contact fingers on the edge connector oxidized readily, resulting in very unreliable operation. It was often necessary to shut off the computer and clean the contacts several times per day. At least one vendor offered a "gold plug", which was a properly gold-plated edge connector which could be soldered onto the original edge connector, eliminating this problem.</li><li> In addition, the motherboard-to-EI cable was very sensitive to noise and signal degradation, which also tended to cause random crashes and reboots. RS attempted to fix this by using a "buffered cable" to connect the EI to the computer. It helped some, but not enough. They then tried separating the 3 critical memory-timing signals into a separate shielded cable (the "DIN plug" cable), but this still wasn't enough. They eventually redesigned the EI circuit board to use only 1 memory timing signal, but that caused problems for some of the unofficial "speed-up" mods that were becoming popular with hobbyists.</li><li> The Floppy Disk Controller chip used in the Model I EI could only read and write Single Density disks. Soon afterwards a new FDC chip became available which could read and write Double Density (a more efficient encoding method that packs 80% more data in the same space). The new FDC chip was <em>almost</em> pin-compatible with the old one, but not quite. One of the values written to the header of each data sector on the disk was a 2-bit value called the "Data Address Mark". 2 pins on the single-density FDC chip were used to specify this value. As there were no spare pins available on the DD FDC chip, one of these pins was reassigned as the "density select" pin. Therefore the DD FDC chip could only write the first 2 of the 4 possible DAM values. Guess which value TRS-DOS used? Several companies (starting with Percom, and eventually even Radio Shack themselves) offered "doubler" adapters - a small circuit board containing sockets for <em>both</em> FDC chips! To install the doubler, you had to remove the SD FDC chip from the EI, plug it into the empty socket on the doubler PCB, then plug the doubler into the vacated FDC socket in the EI. Logic on the doubler board would select the correct FDC chip.</li></ul></li><li> The TRS-80 model II (a "business" computer using 8-inch floppy disks) had a built-in video monitor with a truly fatal flaw: the sweep signals used to deflect the electron beam in the CRT were generated from a programmable timer chip. When the computer booted, one of the first things it would do is write the correct timer constants to the CRTC chip. However, an errant program could accidentally write any other values to the CRTC chip, which would throw the sweep frequencies way off. The horizontal sweep circuit was designed to operate properly at just one frequency and will "send up smoke signals" if operated at a frequency significantly different than what it was designed to operate at. If your screen goes blank and you hear a loud high-pitched whine from the computer, shut the power off <em>immediately</em>, as it only takes a few <em>seconds</em> to destroy some rather expensive components in the monitor.</li><li> Nvidia's early history is interesting - in the same way a train wreck is. There's a reason why their first 3D chipset, the NV1, barely gets a passing note in the official company history page. See, the NV1 was a weird chip which they put on an oddball - even for the time - hybrid card meant to let you play games ported from the Sega Saturn on the PC; this was no coincidence, as the Saturn itself had a related but earlier video adapter. The chip's weirdness came from its use of quadrilateral<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note778x7');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note778x7" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note778x7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">four-pointed</span> primitives; the rest of the 3D world used triangle primitives, which are so much easier to handle that nobody else has deviated from them to this day. Developing for the quad-supporting chip was complicated, unintuitive, and time-consuming, as was porting triangle-based games from other platforms, so the NV1 was wildly unpopular from the start. Additionally, the hybrid Nvidia cards integrated a sound card with full MIDI playback capability and a pair of gameports that converted Saturn controllers to the PC, and that increased cost and complexity. Also, the board's sound codec was no better than a SoundBlaster (the then-standard for PC audio) <em>clone</em>, and the sound portion of the card overall could not work reliably in MS-DOS... While MS-DOS games were still a thing, CD-ROMs often contained both the DOS and Windows 9x version of a game, and many people were actively booting back to DOS because if there were two versions of the game, the DOS version oftentimes just ran better than the Windows version for various reasons. When Microsoft came out with Direct3D it effectively killed the NV1, as it was all but incompatible with it. Nvidia stubbornly went on to design the NV2, still with quad mapping, intending to put it in the Dreamcast - but then Sega saw the writing on the wall, told Nvidia "thanks but no thanks" and went on to also evaluate GPUs with triangle polygons<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note82425');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note82425" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note82425');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">a SGI part and NEC PowerVR part, the latter was chosen for the final specifications</span>. Nvidia finally saw the light, dropped quads altogether and came out with the triangle-primitive-based Riva 128, which was a decent hit and propelled them back onto the scene - probably with great sighs of relief from the shareholders.</li><li> Improvements in low-power processor manufacture by Intel - namely the Bay Trail-T system-on-a-chip architecture - have now made it possible to manufacture an honest-to-goodness x86 computer running full-blown Windows 8.1 and with moderate gaming capabilities in a box the size of a book. Cue a whole lot of confounded Chinese manufacturers using the same design standards they used on ARM systems-on-a-chip to build Intel ones, sometimes using cases with nary a single air hole and often emphasizing the lack of need for bulky heatsinks and noisy fans. Problem: You <em>do</em> actually need heat sinking on Intel SoCs, especially if you're going to pump them for all the performance they're capable of (which you will, if you use them for gaming or high-res video playback). Without a finned heatsink and/or fan moving air around, they'll just throttle down to crawling speed and frustrate the users.</li><li> Back in the early days of 3D Graphics cards, when they were called 3D Accelerators and even 3Dfx hadn't found their stride, there was the S3 Virge. The card had good 2D performance, but such a weak 3D chip that at least one reviewer called it, with good reason, the world's first 3D Decelerator. That epithet is pretty much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>, as 3D games performed worse on PCs with an S3 Virge installed than they did in software mode, i.e. with no 3D acceleration at all.</li><li> The "Home Hub" series of routers provided by UK telecom giant BT are fairly capable devices for the most part, especially considering that they usually come free to new customers. Unfortunately, they suffer from a serious flaw in that they expect to be able to use Wi-Fi channels 1, 5, or 11, which are naturally very crowded considering the ubiquity of home Wi-Fi, and BT's routers in particular. And when that happens, the routers will endlessly rescan in an effort to get better speeds, knocking out your internet connection for 10-30 seconds every 20 minutes or so. Sure, you can manually force the router into using another, uncongested channel... except that it'll keep rescanning based on how congested channels 1, 5, and 11 are, even if there are <em>no devices whatsoever</em> on the channel that you set manually. Even BT's own advice is to use ethernet (and a powerline adapter if needed) for anything that you actually need a rock-solid connection on.</li><li> Wireless mice still seem to have certain design flaws nobody seems particularly willing to fix. One particular wide-spread issue is that the power switch for a wireless mouse is, without exception, on the <em>bottom</em> of the mouse body - the part that is always grinding against the surface you use the mouse on, and as such unless it is recessed far enough into the mouse will constantly jiggle the power switch, thus messing with your mouse movement; especially ironic if the mouse advertises itself as a "gaming" device, then interferes with your aim while you actually play games with it. Rechargeable ones can get even worse, as most insist on setting up the full assembly in a way that makes it impossible to use the mouse while it's charging, such as the already-mentioned Apple Magic Mouse 2. Then you get to some models, like Microsoft's Rechargeable Laser Mouse 7000, which get even worse. On top of both of the aforementioned issues, it's designed in such a way that the battery in its battery compartment has to depress a small button for the charger to actually supply power to it. As it turns out, a regular AAA battery - which you aren't supposed to recharge - fits in just fine and depresses the button, but the proprietary rechargeable battery that comes with the mouse <strong>doesn't</strong>, because it's slightly thinner in diameter than a AAA battery, thus it does not depress the button and cannot be charged until you wrap paper or something around it at the point where it's supposed to make contact with that button.</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder5');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mass-Storage Devices&nbsp;</div><div id="folder5" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> The Commodore 64, one of the most popular computers of all-time, wasn't without its share of problems. Perhaps the most widely-known is its <em>extreme</em> slowness at loading programs. This couldn't really be helped with a storage medium like tape, which remained slow even after various clever solutions to speed it up, but floppy disks really ought to have been faster. What happened was that Commodore had devised a hardware-accelerated system for transferring data that worked fairly well, but then also found a hardware bug in the input/output chip that made it not work at all. Replacing the buggy chips was economically unfeasible, so the whole thing was revised to <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_banging">work entirely in software<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. This slowed down drive access immensely and caused the birth of a cottage industry for speeder carts, replacement ROM chips, and fastloaders, most of which sped things up at least fivefold. Additionally, the drive itself had a CPU and some RAM to spare - effectively a secondary computer dedicated to the sole task of feeding data to the primary computer (hence its phenomenal cost) - so it was programmable, and people came up with their own ways to improve things further. Eventually, non-standard formats were developed that loaded programs <em>25 times faster than normal</em>.</li><li> Why, after the introduction of integrated controllers into every other storage device, does the floppy have to be controlled by the motherboard? Sure, it makes the floppy drive simpler to manufacture, but you're left with a motherboard that only knows how to operate a spinning mass of magnetic material. Try making a floppy "emulator" that actually uses flash storage, and you'll run into this nigh-impassible obstacle.<ul><li> The floppy drive interface design made sense when it was designed (the first PC hard drives also used a similar interface) and was later kept for backwards-compatibility. However, a lot of motherboards also support IDE floppy drives (there may not have been any actual IDE floppy drives, but a LS120 drive identifies itself as a floppy drive and can read regular 3.5" floppy disks), a SCSI or USB device can also identify as floppy drive. On the other hand, the floppy interface is quite simple if you want to make your own floppy drive emulator - such as the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gotekemulator.com/">Gotek Floppy Emulator<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</li></ul></li><li> Sony's HiFD "floptical" drive system. The Zip Drive and the LS-120 Superdrive had already attempted to displace the aging 1.44MB floppy, but many predicted that the HiFD would be the real deal. At least until it turned out that Sony had utterly screwed up the HiFD's write head design, which caused performance degradation, hard crashes, data corruption, and all sorts of other nasty problems. They took the drive off the market, then bought it back a year later... in a new 200MB version that was totally incompatible with disks used by the original 150MB version (and 720KB floppies as well), since the original HiFD design was so badly messed up that they couldn't maintain compatibility and make the succeeding version actually work. Sony has made a lot of weird, proprietary formats that have failed to take off for whatever reason, but the HiFD has to go down as the worst of the lot.</li><li> The IBM Deskstar 75GXP, nicknamed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Death Star</a>. While it was a large drive at the time (2000), it had a disturbing habit of suddenly failing, taking your data with it. The magnetic coating was of subpar reliability and came loose easily, causing head crashing that easily strips the magnetic layer off clean. One user with a RAID server setup reported to their RAID controller manufacturer; supposedly, this user was replacing their IBM Deskstars <a class="urllink" href="http://s3.computerhistory.org/groups/ds-ibm-75gxp-family-20121031.pdf">at a rate of 600-800 drives per day<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. There have been many hard drives that have been criticized for various reasons, but the "Death Star" was something truly spectacular for all the wrong reasons.<ul><li> There is anecdotal evidence that IBM was engaging in deception, knowingly selling faulty products, and then spewing out rhetoric about the industry-standard failure rates of hard drives. This denial strategy started a chain reaction that led to a demise in customer confidence. Class-action lawsuits helped convince IBM to sell their hard drive division to Hitachi in 2002. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.pcworld.co.nz/article/157888/25_worst_tech_products_all_time/">(See "Top 25 Worst Tech Products of All Time" for this and more.)<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></li></ul></li><li> The Iomega Zip Disk was a big success undeniably, but user confidence in the drives' reliability was terrorized by the "Click-of-death". Though tens of millions of the drives were sold, there were thousands of drives that would suffer misalignment and damage the medium injected into the drive. This would not be horrible by itself necessarily, but Iomega made a big mistake in downplaying the users who complained about drive failures and failing to be sensitive about their lost data. <br><br>The Zip's worst problem wasn't even the fact that it could fail and potentially ruin a disk, but that such a ruined disk would go on to ruin whatever drive it was then inserted into. Which would then ruin more disks, which would ruin more drives, etc. Effectively a sort of hardware virus, it turned one of the best selling points of the platform (inter-drive compatibility) into its worst point of failure. <br><br>The biggest kicker? The entire issue was due to the removal of a foam O-ring from the design by a marketer, to save a few pennies. When the head could not read the data on the disk, it would eject out of the disk to return to starting position and then attempt to read the disk again. The O-ring was to prevent the head from knocking against the edge of the mechanism and becoming malformed, thus damaging the disk the next time it tries to read once it has knocked against the edge of the track a few more times.///</li></ul>After a class-action lawsuit in 1998, Iomega issued a free replacement program , and further rebates in 2001 for future products. It was too little, too late, and CD-R disks were now more popular for mass storage and perceived as more reliable.<a class="urllink" href="http://www.pcworld.co.nz/article/157888/25_worst_tech_products_all_time/">The New Zealand site for PC World has the original article still available.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Surprisingly however, Iomega would soldier on making two more generations of ZIP disk drives before leaving the market in the late 2000s.<dl><dd><ul><li> Iomega's previous magnetic storage product, Bernoulli Box, was designed to avert this disaster by using <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli%27s_principle">a specific law of physics<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that makes it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/GeniusProgramming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/GeniusProgramming">physically impossible for the drive head to make contact with the medium</a>. Yes, Iomega already had a disk format that was designed to prevent the failures the Zip drives suffered. When they designed the Zip disk specification, the Bernoulli effect was overlooked, likely to save costs.</li><li> One more idiot move- Iomega decided that <em>if you can't beat them, join them</em> in the early 2000s and released the <em>Zip CD</em> line of CD burners. However, due to bad luck, they unknowingly sourced batches of bad drives from <em>Philips</em>. This resulted in more coasters than you could've gotten over several years worth of AOL free trial discs in your mailbox- apparently their QC department aren't doing their jobs. Another scathing lawsuit and product replacement program later, they quickly flipped distributors to <em>Plextor</em>. Except that by then, CD technology was improving and newer CD-<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RWs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RWs">R Ws</a> could store 700MB (and even later, 800MB) of data. On those Plextor drives, the extra 50MB-150MB is walled off and you can still only write 650MB of data using their drives when you could use those sweet extra space (150MB was a lot in 2007) on other drives. This eventually caused them to be bought out by EMC Corp. Which later was restructured into a JV with conglomerate Lenovo.</li></ul></dd></dl><ul><li> Maxtor, now defunct, once sold a line of external hard drives under the OneTouch label. However, the USB 2.0 interface would often malfunction and corrupt the filesystem on the drive, rendering the data hard to recover. You were better off removing the drive enclosure and installing the disk on a spare SATA connection on a motherboard. Not surprisingly, Maxtor was having financial troubles already, before Seagate acquired them.</li><li> The 3M Superdisk and its proprietary 120MB "floptical" media were intended as direct competition to the Iomega Zip, but in order to penetrate a market that Iomega owned pretty tightly, the Superdisk needed a special feature to push it ahead. That feature was the possibility to write up to 32 megabytes on a bog-standard 1.44MB floppy, using lasers for alignment of the heads. Back then 32MB was significant storage, and people really liked the idea of recycling existing floppy stock - of which everybody had large amounts - into high-capacity media. The feature might just have given the Superdisk the edge it needed; unfortunately what wasn't immediately clear, nor explicitly stated, was that the drive was only able to do random writes on its specific 120MB disks. It could indeed write 32MB on floppies, but only if you rewrote <strong>all</strong> the data every time a change, no matter how small, was made - basically like a CD-RW disk with no packet-writing system. This took a relatively long time, and transformed the feature into an annoying gimmick. Disappointment ensued, and the format didn't even dent Iomega's empire before disappearing.</li><li> The Caleb UHD-144 was an attempt to gain a foothold in the floppy-replacement market. Unfortunately, it was ill-timed, the company not taking a hint from the failures of Sony and 3M - if anything, it was an example of a "good" idea being rushed to market without checking what it was being marketed against - so there was no chance to see the product in action. Inexpensive CD-R media and the Zip-250 (itself quickly marginalized by the cost-effectiveness of CD-R discs, which were designed to be read in optical drives that were already present in numerous computers) caused the technology to be dead on arrival.</li><li> Some DVD players, especially some off-brand models, seem to occasionally decide that the disc that you have inserted is not valid. The user ejects the disc and then injects it again and hopefully the DVD player decides to cooperate. This can be a headache if the machine is finicky about disc defects due to copy protection, or can't deal with your brand of DVD -/+ recordable disc that you use for your custom films. Bonus points if you have to crack a copy-protected disc to burn it onto a blank DVD because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalPiracyIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalPiracyIsEvil">you can't watch the master copy</a>. The inverse situation is also possible, where you have a DVD player made by a "reputable" brand that won't allow you to watch the locked-down DVD you just spent money for.<ul><li> Some DVD players are overly cautious about the discs they're willing to play because of regional lockout. Live in Australia and have a legally-purchased Region 4 DVD? Turns out it was an NTSC disc, and your DVD player is only willing to play PAL discs. Oops.</li></ul></li><li> After solid-state drives started taking over from mechanical hard drives as the storage device of choice for high-end users, it quickly became obvious that the transfer speeds would soon be bottlenecked by the speed of the Serial ATA standard, and that PCI Express was the obvious solution. Using it in the form of full-sized cards wasn't exactly optimal, though, and the smaller M.2 form factor is thermally limited and can be fiddly to install cards in. The chipset industry's answer was SATA Express, a clunky solution which required manufacturers to synchronise data transfers over two lanes of PCI Express and two SATA ports, standards with <em>completely</em> different ways of working. Just to make it even worse, the cable was an ugly mess consisting of four separate wires (two SATA, one PCI-E, and a SATA power connector that hung off the end of the cable). The end result was one of the most resounding failures of an industry standard in computing history, as a grand total of <em>zero</em> storage products made use of it (albeit a couple of manufacturers jury-rigged it into a way of connecting front-panel USB3.1 ports), with SSD manufacturers instead flocking to the SFF-8639 (later renamed U.2) connector, essentially just four PCI-E lanes crammed into a simple cable.</li><li> To call the Kingston HyperX Fury RGB SSD a perfect example of form over function would be a lie by omission, as with this SSD form <em>actively affects</em> function. Kingston thought it would be a good idea to cram <em>75 LEDs</em> into a 2.5-inch enclosure without insulating the storage aspect or, apparently, adequately testing the thermals, and the result is catastrophic. The heat from the LEDs - potentially <em>over 70 degrees celsius</em> - causes extreme thermal throttling that, as shown in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnST5rA64Oc">this video<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, causes performance issues that can prevent programs from starting and even <em>cause the computer to hang on boot</em>; the uploader also speculated that it could corrupt data. The thermal throttling can get so bad that a gigantic fan is needed to cool the drive enough to be able to turn the LED array off in software, at which point you might as well buy a normal SSD and leave the gimmicky RGB lighting separate from anything where performance is important. And before you ask "Well, why can't I just unplug the LEDs?", that just causes the thermonuclear reaction happening in your primary storage device to default to red and removes any control you have over it.</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder6');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Game Consoles&nbsp;</div><div id="folder6" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> Sony's PlayStation line has had its fair share of baffling design choices:<ul><li> The Series 1000 and Series 3000 units (which converted the 1000's A/V RCA ports to a proprietary A/V port) of the original PlayStation had the laser reader array at 9 o'clock on the tray. This put it directly adjacent to the power supply, which ran exceptionally hot. Result: the reader lens would warp, causing the system to fail spectacularly and requiring a new unit. Sony admitted this design flaw existed... after all warranties on the 1000 and 3000 units were up and the Series 5000 with the reader array at 2 o'clock was on the market.</li><li> The first batch of PS2s were known for starting to produce a "Disc Read Error" after some time, eventually refusing to read any disc at all. The cause? The gear for the CD drive's laser tracking had <em>absolutely nothing</em> to prevent it from slipping, so the laser would gradually go out of alignment.</li><li> The original model of the PSP had buttons too close to the screen, so the Einsteins at Sony moved over the switch for the Square button without moving the location of the button itself. Thus every PSP had an unresponsive Square button that would also often stick. Note that the Square button is the second-most important face button on the controller, right before X; in other words, it's used constantly during the action in most games. Sony president Ken Kutaragi confirmed that <em>this was intentional</em>, conflating this basic technical flaw with the concept of artistic expression.<div class="indent"><strong>Ken Kutaragi:</strong> I believe we made the most beautiful thing in the world. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metaphorgotten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metaphorgotten">Nobody would criticize a renowned architect's blueprint that the position of a gate is wrong</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">It's the same as that.</a></div></li><li> And before you ask, yes, that's a real quote sourced by dozens of trusted publications. The man <em>actually went there</em>.</li><li> Another PSP-related issue was that if you held the original model a certain way, the disc would spontaneously eject. It was common enough to be a meme on YTMND and among the early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GarrysMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GarrysMod">Garry's Mod</a></em> community.</li><li> A common criticism of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlaystationVita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlaystationVita">PlayStation Vita</a> is that managing your games and saves is a tremendous hassle: for some reason, deleting a Vita game will also delete its save files, meaning that if you want to make room for a new game you'll have to kiss your progress goodbye. This can be circumvented by transferring the files to a PC or uploading them to the cloud, but the latter requires a PlayStation Plus subscription to use. One wonders why they don't allow you to simply keep the save file like the PS1 and PSP games do. This is made all the more annoying by the Vita's notoriously small and overpriced proprietary memory cards, which means that if you buy a lot of games in digital format, you probably won't be able to hold your whole collection at the same time, even if you shell out big money for a 32GB (the biggest widely-available format, about $60) or 64GB (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">must be imported from Japan</a>, can cost over $100, and is reported to sometimes suffer issues such as slow loading, game crashes, and data loss) card.</li><li> While the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation4">PlayStation 4</a> is mostly a well-built console, it has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel">Achilles' Heel</a> in that the heat exhaust vents on the back are too large. The heat produced by the system invites insects to crawl inside the console, which can then short-circuit the console if they step on the wrong things. If you live in an area where insects are hard to avoid or get rid of, owning a PS4 becomes a major crapshoot.</li><li> Another, more minor flaw of the PS4 (one that persists across all three variations of the console, no less) is that the USB ports on the front are in a narrow recession which makes it impossible to use larger USB drives or cables with it.</li><li> The original run of PS4 consoles used capacitive touch sensors for the power and eject buttons. Unfortunately, the eject button had a known fault where it would activate spuriously, causing the console to spit out disks in the middle of games or even to resist them being inserted. Later versions replaced the capacitive sensors with physical buttons, but nothing was done for owners of the older PS4s - especially insulting given that disks could be ejected in software, so simply offering the user an menu option to disable the button would instantly work around the problem.</li><li> The PS4's hard drive is connected to the rest of the console using an internal SATA-to-USB interface. While this isn't a problem with the stock HDD, it will bottleneck an SSD should you choose to upgrade to one, keeping the upgraded load times from being as fast as they could be.<ul><li> Another case of questionable conversions in the PS4: The HDMI output comes via a DisplayPort-to-HDMI converter chip, when the APU has a perfectly good HDMI output that goes completely unused. Not a performance problem, but just plain weird.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Microsoft's Xbox consoles aren't exempt from these, either:<ul><li> Most revisions of the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox">Xbox</a> used a very cheap clock capacitor with such a high failure rate that it's basically guaranteed to break and leak all over the motherboard after a few years of normal use, far shorter than the normal lifetime of this type of component. Making this more annoying is that the clock capacitor is not an important part: it does not save time information if the system is unplugged for more than 30 minutes and the console works fine without it. The last major revision (1.6) of the system uses a different, better brand and is exempt from this issue.</li><li> The infamous "Red Ring of Death" that occurs in some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360">Xbox 360</a> units. It was a consequence of three factors: the introduction of lead-free solder, which is toxicologically safer but harder to properly solder with; inconsistent quality of the solder itself, which got better in later years but was prone to cracking under stress in early revisions; and bad thermal design, where clearance issues with the DVD drive caused Microsoft to use a dinky little heatsink for chips that were known to run hot. Result: the chips would overheat, the defective and improperly-applied solder would crack from the heat expansion, and the connections would break.</li><li> Microsoft released official numbers stating that <em>51.4%</em> of all early 360 units were or would eventually be affected by this issue. Unfortunately, the problem got blown out of proportion by the media, so much so that people were afraid of encountering the issue on later versions that weren't affected. So afraid, in fact, that they'd often send in consoles that had a different and easily solvable issue: only "three segments of a red ring" mean "I'm broken, talk to my makers"; other red-ring codes could be as simple as "Mind pushing my cables in a bit more?", something easy to figure out if you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadTheFreakingManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadTheFreakingManual">Read the Freaking Manual</a>.</li><li> The 360 has another design flaw that makes it very easy for the console to scratch your game discs if the system is moved while the game disc is still spinning inside the tray. The problem is apparently so insignificant amongst most Xbox 360 owners (though ironically Microsoft themselves are fully aware of this problem) that when they made the Slim model of the system they fixed the Red Ring issues (somewhat) but not the disc scratching issue.<ul><li> Most mechanical drives can tolerate movement while active, at least. It's not recommended (especially for hard drives, where the head is just nanometers away from the platter), but not accounting for <em>some</em> movement is just bad. Anyone that has worked in a game-trading industry (such as Gamestop/EB Games) can tell you that not a day goes by without someone trying to get a game fixed or traded in as defective due to the evil Halo Scratch.</li><li> Microsoft recommends to not have the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/XboxOne">Xbox One</a> model in any position other than horizontal because the optical drive isn't designed for any orientation other than that. Note that <em>every</em> 360 model was rated to work in vertical orientation, even with the aforementioned scratching problem, and Microsoft quickly restored support for vertical orientation with the updated Xbox One S model.</li></ul></li><li> Most of the 360's problems stem from the inexplicable decision to use a full-sized desktop DVD drive, which even in the larger original consoles took almost a quarter of their internal volume. Early models also had four rather large chips on the motherboard, due to the 90 nm manufacturing process, which also made them run quite hot (especially the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GraphicsProcessingUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GraphicsProcessingUnit">GPU</a>-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VideoRAM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VideoRAM">VRAM</a> combo that doubled as a northbridge). But the relative positions of the GPU and the drive (and the latter's bulk) meant that there simply wasn't any room to put any practical heatsink. Microsoft tried to address this problem in two separate motherboard redesigns, the first of which finally added at least <em>some</em> heatsink, but it was only a third, when the chipset was shrunk to just two components, which allowed designers to completely reshuffle the board and even add a little fan atop the new, large heatsink, which finally did away with the problem somewhat. However, even the Slim version still uses that hugeass desktop DVD drive, which still has <em>no</em> support for the disk, perpetuating the scratching problem.</li><li> The circular D-Pad on the 360's controller (likewise for the Microsoft SideWinder Freestyle Pro gamepad), which is clearly designed to look cool first and actually function second. Anyone who's used it will tell you how hard it is to reliably hit a direction on the pad without hitting the sensors next to it. The oft-derided <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyOwnsThisTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyOwnsThisTrope">U.S. patent system</a> might be partially responsible for this, as some of the good ideas (Nintendo's + pad, Sony's cross pad) were "taken". Still, there are plenty of PC pads that don't have this issue to the same degree... at least until the 360 became successful and every third-party pad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">started ripping off its controller wholesale</a>, unusable D-Pad and all. Some even go as far as to otherwise perfectly emulate an entirely different controller's design, then replace whatever actually-usable D-Pad the original used with a 360-style one for no reason whatsoever.</li><li> Early in the life of the 360, many gamers used the console's optional VGA cable to play their games with HD graphics, as true HDTVs tended to be rare and expensive back then. PC monitors at the time usually had a 4:3 aspect ratio, which most game engines were smart enough to handle by simply sticking black bars at the top and bottom of the screen, with a few even rendering natively at the right resolution. However, some engines (including the one used for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeed">Need for Speed</a> Most Wanted</em> and <em>Carbon</em>) instead rendered the game in 480p - likely the only 4:3 resolution they supported - and upscaled the output. Needless to say, playing a 480p game stretched to a higher resolution <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note94w7s');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note94w7s" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note94w7s');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(1280&times;1024 being the most common resolution for mid-range monitors at the time - which you may notice is actually a 5:4 aspect ratio instead of 4:3, meaning that you had pixel distortion to deal with on top of other things)</span> looked awful, and arguably even worse than just playing it on an SDTV.</li><li> The original 360's Optical Audio port was built into the analog video connector. If you wanted to utilize both HDMI video and Optical audio, the hardware supported both simultaneously. The ports, however, were placed too close together and the bulky analog connector prevented inserting an HDMI cord. Removing the plastic shroud on the analog connector allows you to use both at the same time.</li></ul></li><li> Nintendo has made their fair share of blunders over the years as well:<ul><li> When Nintendo of America's engineers redesigned the Famicom into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem">Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, they removed the pins which allowed for cartridges to include add-on audio chips and rerouted them to the expansion slot on the bottom of the system in order to facilitate the western counterpart to the in-development Famicom Disk System. Unfortunately, not only was said counterpart never released, there was no real reason they couldn't have run audio expansion pins to both the cartridge slot and expansion port, other than the engineers wanting to save a few cents on the necessary IC. This meant that not only could no western NES game ever have any additional audio chips, it also disincentivised Japanese developers from using them, as it would entail reprogramming the entire soundtrack for a western release. <br><br>Additional, while the front-loader design of the original NES is well recognized and iconic, the VCR design isn't very helpful for seating cartridges firmly into the reader without causing wear and tear on the pins which leads to the connector pins being bent out of shape over time. This was not helped by the choice of brass-plated nickel connectors that are prone to oxidation and therefore require cleaning.</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VirtualBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VirtualBoy">Virtual Boy</a> was a poorly-designed console in general, but perhaps the strangest design flaw was the complete absence of a headstrap. While this was ostensibly because of fears that the weight of the device could cause neck strain for younger players, for one thing pre-teens weren't officially supposed to be playing the device anyway, and for another thing the solution they came up with was a fixed 18-inch-tall stand that attached to the underside of the system. This meant that if you didn't have a table that was the <em>exact</em> right height, you'd likely end up straining your neck and/or back anyway, in addition to the eye strain that the system was notorious for. Even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RZone">R-Zone</a>, a notoriously poor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoddyKnockOffProduct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoddyKnockOffProduct">Shoddy Knock Off Product</a> of the system, managed to make room for a headstrap in the design.</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii">Wii</a> literally has no crash handler. So if you manage to crash your system, you open it up to Arbitrary Code Execution, and a whole load of security vulnerabilities await you. Do you have an SD card inserted? Well, crash any game that reads and writes to it and even <em>more</em> vulnerabilities open up. They'll tell you that they fixed these vulnerabilities though system updates, but in reality, they never did. In fact, the only thing these updates did on that matter was simply remove anything that was installed <em>with</em> these vulnerabilities - nothing's stopping you from using these vulnerabilities again to <em>re</em>-install them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">Of course, all of this is a good thing if you like modding your console.</a></li><li> While the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU">Wii U</a> ultimately proved a failure for several reasons, poor component choices helped contribute to its near-total lack of third-party support. It'd only be a slight exaggeration to say that the system's CPU was essentially just three Wii CPUs - and by extension, three <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameCube">GameCube</a></em> CPUs - heavily overclocked and slapped together on the same die, with performance that was abysmally poor by 2012 standards. Its GPU, while not <em>as</em> slow, wasn't all that much faster than those of the PS3 and Xbox 360, <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10hfe7');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note10hfe7" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10hfe7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(in fact, on paper the Wii U's GPU was actually <em>slower</em> than the GPUs of either of those consoles, but due to advances in technology was about twice as fast in practice... unless you offloaded code to the GPU to offset the lack of CPU grunt, which would bring it back down to PS3/360 levels, if not less)</span> and used a shader model in-between those of the older consoles and their successors, meaning that ported PS3/360 games didn't take advantage of the newer hardware, while games designed for the PS4 and Xbox One wouldn't even work to begin with due to the lack of necessary feature support. The system would likely have fared much better if Nintendo had just grabbed an off-the-shelf AMD laptop APU - which had enough power even in 2012 to brute-force emulate the Wii, eliminating the main reason to keep with the PowerPC line - stuffed it into a Wii case and called it a day. Fortunately, Nintendo seems to have learned from this, basing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Nintendo Switch</a> on an existing nVidia mobile chip which thus far has proven surprisingly capable of punching above its weight.</li><li> Speaking of the Nintendo Switch, don't buy a screen protector, or else whatever adhesive that's on it will melt off due to the console's methods of cooling. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TonkaTough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TonkaTough">Not that you'd really need one anyway due to how durable it is.</a><ul><li> Another issue with the Nintendo Switch is its implementation of USB-C. When using such standards, the point is that anything designed for the standard is supposed to be able to work with any other device that uses it. However, this is the first time a Nintendo console supports a USB standard for their powering, and it shows. For whatever reason, especially after the 5.0 update, there have been reports of Switches bricking due to using third-party docks. It apparently has to do with <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/87vmud/the_switch_is_not_usbc_compliant_and_overdraws/">not following the USB-C standard properly<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. This issue has become prevalent enough to force Nintendo <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/03/nintendo_comments_on_third-party_docks_bricking_switch_systems">to respond on the situation<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Exactly <em>why</em> Nintendo felt the need to monkey around with the USB-C standard when it's capable of delivering power levels of roughly six times what the Switch uses in its docked mode remains unclear.</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/heres-why-nintendo-switch-consoles-keep-frying/">It was found<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> later the reason why certain third party docks would brick Switches was the following. Nintendo wanted to make taking the Switch in and out of the dock a smooth action. Nintendo tweaked with the mechanical design of the USB-C on the dock so that the plug was just ever so slightly smaller. Cheaper third party docks like those from Nyko would try to emulate this smooth action but did so by way of "just do something and see if it works" approach. This caused an issue where some pins made contact with others. Now this isn't necessarily a problem, but the real problem is these cheaper docks <em>also don't</em> impelment USB-C power delivery correctly. The controller chip on the dock was sending 9V to another pin on the Switch into that was expecting 5V. You can imagine that sending way more voltage than necessary is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">good thing</a>.</li><li> When homebrewers were poking at the Switch for anything they can use to effectively jailbreak the system, they found out that NVIDIA's own programming guide tells you <em>how to disable the security</em> so you can effectively run unsigned code. Which is fine, because programming guides are meant for developers and disabling the security is useful for faster iterations in testing. But what didn't happen is Nintendo disabling this feature.</li><li> Another problem with the Nintendo Switch: the Joy-Con joysticks. The contacts inside them were made out of a cheap material, causing them to be worn down really quickly by only a few months of play and "drift" (accepting more inputs than those that are currently being submitted, causing the game to move on its own and screwing you up). The situation got bad enough that a <em>class-action lawsuit</em> was filed, because in a disturbingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness">out of character</a> moment Nintendo refused to comment or release any sort of troubleshooting guide for the issue.</li><li> The Switch also has a problem with the heat it generates. Because of the way the Switch's innards were designed, the system can become quite warm. Over time, the constant heat can cause the Switch to physically bend out of shape. Nintendo would later make a revised version of the Switch as well as the Switch Lite that addressed the problem.</li></ul></li><li> The GameCube was able to play games in 480p resolution if the game supported it. However, the GameCube itself didn't output an analog 480p signal. It would only output 480p through a <em>digital</em> signal, where it would be converted back into an analog signal through system's component cables, which contained a special DAC in the plug. Nintendo quietly discontinued production of the cables since less than 1% of consumers bought them and the cables were too expensive to make without recouping costs. Because the 480p signal can't be achieved without Nintendo's component cables, it was, for a time, impossible for a consumer to simply use third-party component cables. Luckily, the component cables' internal DAC was eventually reverse-engineered and cheaper aftermarket cables began hitting the market. Not only that, it was discovered that the digital signal coming from the GameCube's Digital AV port was compatible with the HDMI standard and HDMI adapters began hitting the market as well, or you could just rip out the Digital AV port entirely and replace it with a regular HDMI port. In addition, Nintendo made the Wii (which plays GameCube discs) output the analog 480p signal directly from the console rather than processing a digital signal through the cables themselves (the component cables are still needed, however), thus making the Wii a cheaper option to play GameCube games in 480p compared to buying the GameCube cables secondhand at a premium price.</li></ul></li><li> After insulting the childishness of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">GBA</a> through PR, Nokia created the complete joke of a design that was the original N-Gage. As a phone, the only way you could speak or hear anything effectively is if the user held the thin side of the unit to his/her ear (earning it the derisive nickname "taco phone" and the infamous "sidetalking"). From a gaming point of view it was even worse, as the screen was oriented vertically instead of horizontally like most handhelds, limiting the player's ability to see the game field (very problematic with games like the N-Gage port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdvanceTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdvanceTrilogy">Sonic Advance</a></em>). Worst of all, however, is the fact that in order to change games one had to remove the casing and the battery every single time.<ul><li> During the development of the N-Gage, Nokia held a conference where they invited representatives from various game developers to test a prototype model and give feedback. After receiving numerous suggestions on how to improve the N-Gage, Nokia promptly ignored most of them on the grounds that they were making the machines through the same assembly lines as their regular phones and they were not going to alter that.</li></ul></li><li> As far as bad console (or rather, console add-on) design goes, the all-time biggest example is probably the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AtariJaguar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AtariJaguar">Atari Jaguar</a> CD. Aside from the crappy overall production quality of the add-on (the Jaguar itself wasn't too hot in this department, either) and poor aesthetics which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAngryVideoGameNerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAngryVideoGameNerd">many</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheSpoonyExperiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheSpoonyExperiment">people</a> have likened to a toilet seat, the CD sat on top of the Jaguar and often failed to connect properly to the cartridge slot, as opposed to the similar add-ons for the NES and Genesis which used the console's own weight to secure a good connection. Moreover, the disc lid was badly designed and tended to squash the CD against the bottom of the console, which in turn would cause the disc motor to break apart internally from its fruitless attempts to spin the disc. All of this was compounded by Atari's decision to ditch any form of error protection code so as to increase the disc capacity to 800 megabytes, which caused software errors aplenty, and the fact that the parts themselves tended to be defective.<ul><li> Of note, it was not rare for the device to come fresh from the box in such a state of disrepair that <em>highly trained specialists</em> couldn't get it working - for example, it could be <em>soldered directly to the cartridge port</em> and <strong>still</strong> display a connection error. This, by the way, is exactly what happened when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesRolfe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesRolfe">James Rolfe</a> tried to review the system.</li><li> As the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AngryVideoGameNerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AngryVideoGameNerd">Angry Video Game Nerd</a></em> pointed out in his review of the console, the Jaguar is a top-loading console that lacks a door to protect the pin connectors from dust and moisture. This means you have to keep a game cartridge in the console at all times to protect it from damage. The Jaguar CD fixes the problem by having a door handle, but if you have a broken one the cartridge component of the add-on won't work!</li><li> While the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atari5200" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atari5200">Atari 5200</a> wasn't that poorly-designed of a system in general - at worst, its absurdly huge size and power/RF combo switchbox could be annoying to deal with, but Atari eventually did away with the latter and were working on a smaller revision when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatVideoGameCrashOf1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatVideoGameCrashOf1983">the market crashed</a>, forcing them to discontinue the system - its controllers were a different matter entirely. In many ways they were ahead of their time, with analogue movement along with start and pause buttons. Unfortunately, Atari cheaped out and didn't bother providing them with an auto-centring mechanism, along with building them out of such cheap materials that they usually tended to fail after a few months, if not <em>weeks</em>. The poor-quality controllers subsequently played a major part in dooming the system...</li><li> ...which brings us right back to the Jaguar. The controller for that system only included three main action buttons, a configuration which was already causing issues for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis</a> at the time. In a baffling move, the controller also featured a numeric keypad, something that Atari had last done on the 5200. On that occasion the keypad was pretty superfluous and generally ignored by developers, but it was only taking up what would probably have been unused space on the controller, so it didn't do any harm by being there. The Jaguar's keypad, on the other hand, was far bigger, turning the controller into an ungodly monstrosity that has often been ranked as the absolute worst videogame controller of all-time. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11982j');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note11982j" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11982j');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(Its main competition coming ironically from the 5200 controller, though that one's more often given a pass on the grounds that it would have been decent if Atari hadn't cut so many corners, and that by 1993 the company definitely should have known better.)</span> Atari later saw sense and produced a revised controller that added in three more command buttons and shoulder buttons, but for compatibility reasons they couldn't ditch the keypad, meaning that the newer version was similarly uncomfortable. Note that the Jaguar's controller was in fact designed originally for the Atari Panther, their unreleased 32-bit console that was scheduled to come out in 1991 before it became obvious that the Genesis' 3-button configuration wasn't very future-proof. They evidently figured that the keypad gave them more than enough buttons and didn't bother creating a new controller for the Jaguar, a decision that would prove costly.</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaSaturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaSaturn">Sega Saturn</a> is, despite its admitted strong points on the player end, seen as one of the worst major consoles internally. It was originally intended to be the best 2D gaming system out there (which it was), so its design was basically just a 32X with higher clockspeeds, more memory, and CD storage. However, partway through development Sega learned of Sony's and Nintendo's upcoming systems (the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 respectively) which are both designed with 3D games in mind, and realized the market - especially in their North America stronghold - was about to shift under their feet; they wouldn't have a prayer of competing. So, in an effort to try to bring more and more power to the console, Sega added an extra CPU and GPU to the system, which sounds great at first... until you consider that there were also <em>six other processors</em> that couldn't interface too well. This also made the motherboard prohibitively complex, being the most expensive console at the time. And lastly, much like the infamous Nvidia NV1 which has its own example in this very page, the GPU worked on four-sided basic primitives while the industry standard was three sides, a significant hurdle for multiplatform games as those developed with triangular primitives would require extensive porting work to adapt them to quads. All this piled-on complication made development on the Saturn a nightmare. Ironically, consoles with multiple CPU cores would become commonplace two generations later with the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3; like a lot of Sega's various other products of that era, they had attempted to push new features before game developers were really ready to make use of them.</li><li> The Kickstarter-funded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Ouya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Ouya">Ouya</a> console has gone down in history as having a huge raft of bad ideas:<ul><li> As with many console systems, Ouya gave the user the option of funding their account by buying funding cards at retail, which provided codes the user can type in to add money to their account. Unfortunately, the Ouya will not proceed beyond boot unless a credit card number is entered, making the funding cards a pointless option.</li><li> When an app offered an in-app purchase, a dialog was displayed asking the user to confirm the purchase - but no password entry or similar was required, and the OK button was the default. This means that if you pressed buttons too quickly while an app offered a purchase, you could confirm it accidentally and be charged for an in-app purchase.</li><li> The system was touted from the beginning as open and friendly to modification and hacking. This sparked considerable interest, and it became obvious that a sizable part of the supporting community didn't really give two hoots about the Ouya's intended purpose as a gaming console; rather, they just wanted one to hack and make an Android or preferably Linux computer out of. The Ouya people - who, like every other console manufacturer, counted to make profit more from selling the games than the hardware - promptly reneged on the whole openness thing and locked the Ouya down tight. The end result was a single-purpose gadget that had a slow, unintuitive, and lag-prone interface, couldn't run most of the already-available Android software despite being an Android system, and didn't have many games that gamers actually wanted to buy.</li><li> Also, the HDMI output was perpetually DRMed with HDCP. There wasn't a switch to disable it, not even turning on developer mode. People who were expecting the openness promised during the campaign were understandably angry for being lied to, as were those hoping to livestream and record <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsPlay">Let's Play</a>s of the games.</li><li> Even in its intended use, the Ouya disappointed its users. The main complaint is that the controllers are laggy; on a console with mostly action-packed casual games, this is <em>very</em> bad. It wasn't even a fault of the console itself, as a controller which exhibits this on an Ouya will have the same input lag when paired to a computer. Apparently, not everyone's controllers have this issue, so opinions differ on whether it was just a large batch of faulty controllers or a design flaw that came out during beta testing but was knowingly ignored and quietly corrected in subsequent batches.</li><li> The fan used to prevent overheating <em>isn't pointed at either of the two vents</em>. Never mind that the console uses a mobile processor, which doesn't even need a fan. In theory, the fan would allow the processor to run at a higher sustained speed. In practice, it blows hot air and dust directly against the wall of the casing, artificially creating frequent issues due to overheating.</li></ul></li><li> Much like the Atari 5200, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Intellivision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Intellivision">Intellivision</a> wasn't a too badly-designed console in general - the only major issue was that its non-standard CPU design meant development wasn't quite as straightforward as on its contemporaries - but the controllers were a big issue. Instead of a conventional joystick, they used a flat disc that you had to press down on, which rapidly became tiring and didn't allow for very precise control. The action buttons on the side were also rather small and squat, making them difficult to push when you really needed to. However, by far the biggest issue was that Mattel for some reason decided that the controllers should be hard-wired to the console, making it impossible to swap them out for third-party alternatives or buy extension cables for players who preferred to sit further away from their TV set. The controller issues have been ascribed as one of the major issues why the Intellivision "only" managed to carve a niche out as the main alternative to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atari2600" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atari2600">Atari 2600</a> in its early years, while the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Colecovision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Colecovision">Colecovision</a> - which was more powerful, easier to develop for, and despite having a controller that was just as bad, if not worse than the Intellivision's, could actually be swapped for third-party alternatives - started thoroughly clobbering the 2600 in sales when it arrived on the scene a few years later.</li><li> While it is fully in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">What Could Have Been</a> territory Active Enterprises, the developers of the (in)famous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Action52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Action52">Action 52</a></em> had plans to develop a console, the <a class="urllink" href="https://bootleggames.fandom.com/wiki/Action_Gamemaster">Action Gamemaster<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, that besides its own cartridges would have been able to play cartridges of other consoles as well as CD-ROM games besides having a TV tuner. Now try to imagine the weight and autonomy of such a device with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> technology, not to probably mention ergonomics. And then look at the concept art and realize how bizarrely proportioned everything is, that there's no obvious place to put cartridges, CDs, or required accessories, and how vulnerable that screen is. The phrases "pipe dream" and "ahead of its time" barely even begin to describe this idea, and the fact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss">Active Enterprises head Vince Perri</a> thought it would be anything other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> just goes to show how overambitious and out of touch with not only the video game market but technology in general the man was.<div class="indent"><strong><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLpEn0wmMrk&amp;t=19m17s">miiyouandmii2<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></strong>: It doesn't even seem like it would be portable to begin with; if the screen was 3.2 inches big, overall, it was <em>15 inches wide</em>!<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0nx29');"><sup>text on screen&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0nx29" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0nx29');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">That's about the size of your laptop screen!</span> It's not really surprising, is it, that no-one tried to save Active Enterprises?</div></li></ul></div><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder7');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Video Games&nbsp;</div><div id="folder7" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">Sometimes, bad design decision can ruin a game even if it doesn't suffer from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/IdiotProgramming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/IdiotProgramming">Idiot Programming</a>.<p></p><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PowerGigRiseOfTheSixString" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PowerGigRiseOfTheSixString">Power Gig: Rise of the SixString</a></em> was an attempt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">copy the success</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero">Guitar Hero</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand">Rock Band</a></em>. However, the game's poorly-designed peripherals, among other issues, caused it to fail and be mostly forgotten. Of note is its drum kit, which attempted to solve one of the main problems with its competitors' drums: playing drums in these games is very noisy, which makes the game impractical when living with other people or in an apartment. <em>Power Gig</em>'s "AirStrike" drum kit gets around this by not having you hit anything: instead of hitting physical drum pads, you swing specially-made drumsticks above motion sensors, allowing you to drum silently. The downside is that since you're not hitting anything, it's hard to tell where you're supposed to swing, and whether that note you missed was because you didn't hit the right pad or the drum just failed to detect your movement. The lack of feedback made using these drums more frustrating than fun. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.engadget.com/2010/06/08/hands-on-power-gigs-airstrike-drum/">Engadget's hands-on preview<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> had few positives to say about it, which is particularly notable considering how such articles are meant to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun">drum up</a> hype for the game.</li><li> The drums that initially came with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand">Rock Band</a> 2</em> had a battery casing that wasn't tight enough, which would cause the batteries to come loose if it was hit too hard. Naturally, this being a drum set, of course the set was going to be hit repeatedly and harshly. The proposed solution from the developers was to stuff a folded paper towel into the battery case along with the batteries and hope that made everything stay in place. Later versions of drum sets wouldn't have such a problem, but it leaves one to wonder how this got missed in playtesting.</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockRevolution">Rock Revolution</a></em> drumkit is seen by many as a monstrosity with an overcomplicated layout that doesn't make any sense. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami">Konami</a> were so focused on making "the most realistic drum peripheral on the market" - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedRealism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedRealism">yet keeping the "cymbals" as pads</a> - that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities">they completely disregarded common sense and good design practices</a>. The result is six pads scattered around a slab of plastic in a way that doesn't line up with the on-screen notes, making it extremely difficult to play, especially with gray notes, which none of <em>Rock Revolution</em>'s competitors used and which are difficult to see on-screen. There's a reason <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero">Guitar Hero</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand">Rock Band</a></em> drumkits don't have realistic layouts, even with cymbals - realistic layouts only work when user-customised. One wonders why they didn't just use the same type of drumkit as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DrumMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DrumMania">Drum Mania</a></em>.</li><li> At Quakecon 2019, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bethesda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bethesda">Bethesda</a> revealed and released a brand new set of ports for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em>, <em>Doom II</em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom3">Doom 3</a></em> on current consoles (PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch) and, in the case of the first two, smartphones. While people initially rejoiced, the ports for the first two games quickly came under major scrutiny - both for a variety of technical shortcomings<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note122rkr');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note122rkr" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note122rkr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Namely, music that ran slower than it was supposed to, a stretched aspect ratio and broken lighting</span> that could likely be attributed to a rushed release date, and for the fact that the port inexplicably required players to sign-in to their Bethesda.net account to access the game at all, despite the fact that the port launched with no online features whatsoever, with even the multiplayer being local only. Outrage <a class="urllink" href="https://kotaku.com/1993-s-doom-requires-a-bethesda-account-to-play-on-swit-1836743713">and wide-spread mockery<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> quickly erupted across the internet due to the idea of a game originally released in 1993 requiring an any kind of account log-in. Bethesda quickly apologised, claimed it was an accident, and would make the log-in optional in a future patch, with updates for the aforementioned technical problems also coming down the road. It turned out that the purpose of the log-in was to enable an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus">Old Save Bonus</a> for the then-upcoming <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoomEternal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoomEternal">Doom Eternal</a></em> that would give the player <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retraux" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retraux">Retraux</a> costumes for the Doom Slayer - fair enough, but the fact that nobody realised that making the log-in <em>mandatory</em> would just piss people off is baffling.</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder8');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toys&nbsp;</div><div id="folder8" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> Despite being a cherished and well-loved franchise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a> has made numerous mistakes throughout the years:<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Gold_Plastic_Syndrome">Gold Plastic Syndrome.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> A number of Transformers toys made in the late 1980s and early 1990s were, in part or in whole, constructed with a kind of swirly plastic that crumbled quite quickly, especially on moving parts. Certain toys (like the reissue of Slingshot, various Pretenders, and the Japan-exclusive Black Zarak) are known to <em>shatter before they're taken out of the box</em>. GPS makes plastic so fragile, a <em>light breeze</em> would probably make it shatter like glass. There are pictures of the effects of GPS in the article linked above, and it isn't pretty. Thankfully, the issue hasn't cropped up since the Protoform Starscream toy was released in 2007, meaning Hasbro and TakaraTomy finally caught on.<ul><li> Note that GPS isn't limited to either gold-colored plastics or the <em>Transformers</em> line. Ultra Magnus' original <em>Diaclone</em> toy (Powered Convoy, specifically the chrome version) had what is termed "Blue Plastic Syndrome" (which was thankfully fixed for the Ultra Magnus release, which uses white instead of blue), and over in the <em>GI Joe</em> line the original Serpentor figure had GPS in his waist.</li></ul></li><li> Besides the GPS plastic, some translucent plastic variants are also known to break very easily. The Deluxe-class <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers">2007 movie</a> Brawl figure had its inner gear mechanics made out of such plastic, which tended to shatter right at the figure's first transformation. On top of that, the posts that held its arms in place didn't match the shape of the holes they were supposed to peg into. Thankfully, the toy was released some time later in new colors, which fixed all of these issues.</li><li> Unposeable "brick" Transformers. The Generation 1 toys <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause">can get away with it</a> (mainly because balljoints weren't widely used until <em>Beast Wars</em> a decade later - though they were used as early as 1985 on Astrotrain - and safety was more important that poseability), but in later series, like most <em>Armada</em> and some <em>Energon</em> toys (especially the Powerlinked modes), they are atrocious - <em>Energon</em> Wing Saber is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMetaphor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMetaphor">literally</a> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick">Flying Brick</a>, and not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">in the good way</a>. With today's toy technology, there just isn't an excuse for something with all the poseability of a cinderblock and whose transformation basically consists of lying the figure down, especially the larger and more expensive ones. Toylines aimed at younger audiences (such as <em>Rescue Bots</em> and <em>Robots in Disguise</em> 2015) are a little more understandable, but for the lines aimed at general audiences or older fans (such as <em>Generations</em>), it's inexcusable.</li><li> Toys over-laden with intrusive gimmicks, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">affectionately</a> nicknamed "Gimmickformers", are generally detested. While these are meant to cater to a younger crowd, when a figure has so many things going on that these detract from the transformation, articulation, and aesthetics, even they may repelled by it. Such a figure is the infamous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersArmada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersArmada">Transformers Armada</a></em> Side Swipe - featuring a boring (though passable) car-mode, a Mini-Con "catapult" that doesn't normally work, and a <a class="urllink" href="http://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/8/85/Armada_Side_Swipe_toy.jpg">hideous robot-mode<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> with excess vehicle-bits hanging off everywhere (including the aforementioned catapult on his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateCharacterDesign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateCharacterDesign">butt</a></em>), the posability of a brick, and the exciting Mini-Con activated action-feature of raising its right arm, which you can do manually. Toy-reviewer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TJOmega" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TJOmega">TJ Omega</a> once did a breakdown on the figure, coming to the conclusion that its head was the only part not to have any detracting design faults.</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked">Cracked</a></em> has an article called "<a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_15764_5-least-surprising-toy-recalls-all-time.html">The 5 Least Surprising Toy Recalls of All Time<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>", listing variously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyLittlePanzer">dangerous toys</a>.

The only way to turn it off was to remove the toy's backpack... something buried so deeply in the instructions, nobody saw it until it was announced publicly.<ul><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> took the idea and ran with it.

You had to get them wet before they would stick together, but the coating released one ingredient it shouldn't have when exposed to water - a form of the date-rape drug <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-Hydroxybutyric_acid">GHB<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

Essentially, they found out that some chemical was much less expensive than the one they were supposed to be using, but still worked. They didn't do the research that said chemical metabolizes into GHB, or else they didn't care (and also didn't tell the company that they made the swap). And yet, for all the Chinese toy manufacturer chaos that was going on in the media at the time, the blame fell squarely on the toy company for this. They still exist, though thankfully with a non-GHB formulation. They were renamed to Pixos (Beados in Australia) and marketed as "safety tested".

Its ridiculously poor design meant that even if you could assemble it, the resulting projection was faint at best, and it would screw with your focus to the point where you couldn't do a perfect trace, assuming you hadn't already ruined it by nudging the paper even slightly. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.amazon.com/Overbreak-Digi-Draw/product-reviews/B0000C9WFQ/ref=cm_cr_pr_hist_1?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=0&amp;filterBy=addOneStar">And trust us, we're not alone in this belief.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></li><li> In a similar case to the <em>Transformers</em> GPS above, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/LEGO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/LEGO">LEGO</a> also fumbled up their own plastic around 2007, which resulted in nearly all of the lime-green pieces becoming ridiculously fragile. This affected the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle">BIONICLE</a></em> sets of that era greatly, which were already prone to breaking due to the faulty sculpting of the ball-socket joints. Since that line of sets had more lime-colored pieces than usual, it is needless to say that fans were not amused with the ordeal, as it meant that they <em>couldn't take apart and rebuild their LEGO sets</em>. Reportedly, some of these lime pieces broke right at the figures' first assembly.<ul><li> In 2008, LEGO reacted to the fragile sockets by introducing a rectangular design and phasing out most of the old, rounded sockets. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">The problem only got worse.</a> Any socket joint from 2008-10 has a high risk of breakage, and the toys don't even need to be played with or taken apart for this to happen, as the plastic cracks apart on its own. Sadly, many of the smaller figures were designed with large, one-piece limbs, meaning buyers had to replace the entire limb if their socket broke. Fans are split on what Lego might have been thinking with the '08 socket-type. One group believes they intended it as a fix but messed up spectacularly. Others believe the rectangular design was to ensure that the pieces would break in a predetermined spot and still allow the parts to be used for building - however, the pieces in question developed cracks in numerous spots. Thankfully, Lego seems to have learned their lesson - in 2011, they redesigned the sockets to be much thicker and sturdier.</li><li> <em>Bionicle</em> rubber bands suffered from this too. There were two kinds: the older, less durable variants with a rectangular cross-section, and the lot more durable and higher-quality rounded rubber bands. Early sets came with the older bands, and these tended to rot away within years of the figures' assembly, rendering the action functions of the sets entirely useless. The better-quality bands were introduced in 2002. For some strange reason, the 2005 Visorak set-line got divided into two sub-lines: the regular, which had colored canisters and the better kind of rubber band, and another variant, which came in black containers and had the older band. These broke or melted off with time, thereby taking away the sets' main gimmick, the Visorak's snapping pincers.</li></ul></li><li> Marvin's Magic Drawing Board, which came along near the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>.

It ought to be made impossible." The rest of his report consists of tearing multiple aspects of the design a new one in his efforts to show why.<ul><li> Nor was it just the Botha. Blackburn in general had had a long history of producing what one aviation writer called "damned awful to fly aircraft" which were also aesthetic horrors, and to the very end of the war it continued to miss the mark, turning out aircraft which were either lemons or which would have been astoundingly good if only they'd been ready three or four years earlier. It took until the 1950s for Blackburn to finally turn out an aircraft that was a winner in every way, but the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackburn_Buccaneer">Buccaneer<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> had to wait until it was almost ready for retirement to show its mettle on the battlefield (in Iraq, 1991). Although given that its original design mission had been delivery of nuclear bombs onto Soviet naval strike groups and high-value shore targets, this is probably just as well. Sadly, it couldn't really enjoy its success even then - the company was bought out by Hawker Siddeley a few years after the Buccaneer was introduced.</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackburn_Roc">Roc<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was built as an unconventional fighter, having all of its armament on a turret. Problem: the turret could only hit targets behind the plane. Further problems: the plane was slow and unwieldy, and <em>vastly</em> inferior to then-current fighter craft fielded by the German air force. Two squadrons received Rocs; one did its best to get rid of them as quickly as possible, the other tried to carry out some missions with them but eventually gave up, stopped maintaining them, and relegated them to <em>stationary anti-air emplacements</em> - essentially glorified dollies for their turrets.

He tried to get back in, only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">to be sued for his mismanagement</a>. The company ended its days making the F4U Corsair under license.</li><li> Early fighter planes were designed with the gun right behind the propeller. The obvious problem in this design was first worked around with deflector plates on the propeller blades. This was a dangerous system in more ways than one - ricochet from deflected bullets could damage the plane or hit the pilot, the plates could be destroyed by gunfire leading to destruction of the propeller, and it negated a significant portion of the gun's firepower. Other designs sidestepped the problem by having the guns in the wings, which had its own drawbacks (primarily the requirement to harmonize their ballistics to converge at the same point due to the wider distance between them and the frequent different ammunition types, thus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryMaximumRange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryMaximumRange">completely ruining accuracy</a> past the convergence point). The problem was finally solved by linking the trigger assembly to the propeller's axle, which allowed timing the gunshots to pass between the propeller blades without damaging them, or more rarely designing them to fire through a blast tube running the length of the axle.</li><li> A frequent problem with the USAF's new "Century Series" of fighters that went to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">Vietnam</a> was that many of the early model jets had their backup systems right next to the primary system. Great for mechanical failure but these were <em>combat</em> aircraft. Many losses happened when one hit disabled both systems.</li><li> The Soviet <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakovlev_Yak-38">Yak-38<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> VTOL fighter was a deeply flawed design: unlike the successful American and British Harrier, which directs the engine's thrust through a set of nozzles that rotate to propel the jet upwards or forwards, the Yak-38 required two additional downward-pointing engines to hover, which eventually doomed the project. The lift engines, while in theory allowing for faster and less hazardous transitions from hovering to forward flight than the Harrier (since the forces involved in each part are entirely separate), were finicky to start in hot conditions, lacked redundancy such that if one failed the other would roll the plane into a crash, and they guzzled fuel with abandon. And for all that they'd become dead weight as soon as the plane transitioned to horizontal flight, severely limiting the payload and flight performance. To top it all off, the tendency of the plane to crash from lift jet failure prompted Soviet engineers to install an auto-eject safety measure that'd save the pilot in case of a sudden change in pitch - a safety measure which, in true late-Soviet tradition, failed to work properly. Cue false alarms ejecting pilots from perfectly functional planes, with predictable results.</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachem_Ba_349">Bachem Ba 349<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was basically nothing more than a wooden glider with a rocket engine, rocket boosters, and more rockets in the nose, launched off a tower and only good for a single shotgun-like salvo of unguided rockets in the general direction of an enemy bomber formation, with aiming mostly accomplished by hopes and prayers. The idea behind it was to create an aircraft that would be cheap to produce and required minimal training to fly, as by this point in WWII it was becoming clearer and clearer that the war was going badly for the Axis Powers and the Nazis were becoming increasingly desperate. The only manned flight of the Ba 349 ended disastrously when test pilot Lothar Sieber died from a combination of assembly flaws and trying to eject at near-sonic velocities. Despite the setback, the Nazis nevertheless commissioned 36 more units for use in wartime, though none were used and most survivors were scrapped after the war as no conquering party had any interest in such a patently absurd weapon.</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinkel_He_177">Heinkel He 177<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was Nazi Germany's attempt to create a heavy bomber at the height of WWII that could compete with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane">Avro Lancaster or Boeing B-17</a> in terms of range and payload while also possessing superior speed and climb performance. There was just one problem, though - the Nazi engineers lacked an engine powerful enough to propel an aircraft of that size, so they simply fitted it with two Daimler DB-601 engines, the same type used to power the well-regarded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane">Messerschmitt Bf 109</a> fighter aircraft. Since such engines are not designed to power something that size, it was not uncommon to have them run so hot that they occasionally <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto">burst into flames</a></em>, earning the He 177 such nicknames as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">"Luftwaffe's Lighter" or "Burning Coffin"</a>. As if the engine problems weren't bad enough, the Nazis later attempted to re-purpose the aircraft as a dive bomber, which put a massive amount of stress on the wing assembly and caused multiple accidents. Although more than 1,170 aircraft were manufactured, the He 177 ultimately had little impact on the course of the war, and all units were scrapped following the Nazis' defeat.</li><li> On the other side of the conflict was the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Gudkov_LaGG-3">Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Gudkov LaGG-3<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. An update of the LaGG-1 prototype, the LaGG-3 was constructed around a polished wooden frame in order to reduce its weight, though this actually did very little beyond making the aircraft extremely flammable. As such, Soviet pilots often joked that the name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms">LaGG</a> actually stood for "<em>Lakirovanny Garantirovanny Grob</em>", or "Guaranteed Varnished Coffin". Adding to the LaGG-3's problems were a rushed production and the use of surplus Klimov M-105 engines to power the aircraft due to production shortages, which ultimately proved insufficient for that purpose despite the lightweight frame. Appalled by the end result, designer Semyon Lavochkin severed his ties with co-workers Mikhail Gudkov and Vladimir Gorbunov and redesigned the aircraft himself. The result was the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavochkin_La-5">Lavochkin La-5<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavochkin_La-7">La-7<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, both of which went on to become among the Soviet Air Force's most dependable fighters in the war.</li><li> On the civilian side, there was the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupolev_Tu-144">Tu-144<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. It was the world's first supersonic airliner to fly, but beyond that it accomplished absolutely nothing notable or remarkable. The Tu-144 was developed at the insistence of the Soviet government (and, some say, with the help of stolen plans for the Concorde) for the sole purpose of giving the Soviet Union a supersonic airliner before the West had one. Because its development was so rushed to meet state deadlines, the Tu-144 was inefficient, noisy, cramped, and above all unsafe. The engines in particular were so poorly designed that the afterburners had to be kept on at all times <em>just to maintain cruising speed</em>, severely compromising the aircraft's range and making it environmentally unfriendly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">even by aircraft standards</a>. The first production model crashed at the Paris Air Show in 1976, killing 33 people, and when the Tu-144 was finally put into service it could only sustain one flight a week. It was used mostly to carry mail between Moscow and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Kazakhstan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Kazakhstan">Alma Ata</a>, and was never flown on any international routes before being retired in 1978. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPlane">Concorde</a>, by contrast, served for over three decades with Air France and British Airways, only being retired after it was rendered uneconomical by a nasty combination of redesigns that required grounding after <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France_Flight_4590">an accident caused by foreign object damage<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and a slump in air travel caused by the September 11, 2001 attacks.</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_DC-10">McDonnell Douglas DC-10<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was for the most part a good plane, but early DC-10s suffered from one serious design flaw: it was extremely difficult to close the cargo doors properly and there was no way to tell whether the door was closed and latched properly or it just <em>looked</em> okay, resulting in the doors occasionally <em>blowing out during flight</em>. This resulted in <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_96">one incident over Windsor, Ontario<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> where the plane in question barely made it back to Detroit and <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Airlines_Flight_981">a crash in Ermenonville Forest in France<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that killed everyone on board.

After 60,000-80,000 miles, users reported the transmission going bad and being left with significant repair cost estimates.

By removing the fuel injectors from behind the valves and replacing them with high-pressure injectors aimed right in the cylinders, power and efficiency was improved.

Oil may build up on the valves from the PCV system and disrupt air flow or worse, eventually break off and harm the catalytic converter. <br><br>One of the remedies to this maintenance worry is for the maker to add a set of traditional fuel injectors that are solely for cleaning duty.

The oil passages in the engine are incorrectly sized which leads to the possibility of oil sludge accumulation which can starve the engine of oil (even with correct oil change intervals).

The idea was to create a single-cab mainline diesel locomotive with good forward visibility in both directions, something which was not permitted by any of the other locomotive types in use by BR at the time. Unfortunately, the Class 17 failed to live up to expectations. The twin Paxman 6ZHXL engines that powered the train were anemic, poorly designed, and often prone to overheating. Worse, the long nose and centre cab layout meant that the crew could not see the area directly in front of them, thus negating the whole purpose of the design. Later units had their engines replaced with more reliable ones, but this was not enough to save the locomotive's reputation. This eventually left British Rail with little choice but to dispose of the type and replace them with the already proven Class 20. All units were scrapped save for a single locomotive, which is currently in the possession of the Chinnor and Princes Risborough Railway.<ul><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine">Thomas the Tank Engine</a></em> featured a character based on the Class 17 (officially named Derek, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven">but unnamed in the episode itself</a>) whose engine overheated while he was pulling a long train of China Clay trucks up a steep hill, leaving Bill and Ben to pull both him and the trucks to their intended destination.</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of British Rail diesel locomotives, the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Rail_Class_28">Class 28<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (better known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine">BoCo</a>'s basis) wasn't a hell of a lot better.

Worse, much like the Class 17, its Crossley 8-cylinder HST Vee8 two-stroke engines proved extremely unreliable, suffering frequently from vibration-induced fuel pipe and water pipe fractures, cylinder defects, and engine shutdowns caused by excessive water temperature in addition to being very noisy and producing unacceptable levels of smoky exhaust fumes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">The front windows also tended to fall out a lot while the trains were running.</a> Within two years of its introduction, the entire class was handed back to manufacturer Metropolitan-Vickers for remedial work on the engines and to cure the problems with the windows.

Unfortunately, firing such powerful projectiles wore out the barrel quickly: after around 300 shots, the barrel had worn down and was no longer usable. About 250 of these shots were fired during testing, meaning it was only fired 48 times in actual combat (granted, these few shots did prove to be as devastating as one would expect an 800-millimeter shell to be).

They were trained to go under enemy tanks, so the bombs could detonate underneath them. One version of the story goes that, since the Soviets didn't have German tanks to use for training, they simply trained the dogs on their own tanks - between that and the different engine functionality and smell of the gasoline-powered German tanks and the diesel-burning Soviet ones, the dogs in actual combat would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">seek out the Soviet tanks that looked and smelled familiar to them</a>. And that's when they weren't proving to be smarter than their trainers accounted for and, upon noticing all the gunfire and explosions, deciding anything more than simply dropping their payload right there and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">running back into the trench</a> wasn't worth it.</li><li> The British <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_bomb">No. 74 Grenade<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, also known as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StickyBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StickyBomb">Sticky Bomb</a>, was meant to be an anti-tank weapon made to compensate for Britain's lack of AT guns after many of them were left behind during the Dunkirk evacuation. It was hard to throw due to its weight, so the best ways to use it would be either to drop it onto a tank from a point of elevation, or to run right up to the tank and slapping the bomb onto it. That's right, the recommended use involves <em>running up to an enemy tank in the middle of combat</em>, which is as dangerous as it sounds, especially since the user would then have to run out of the blast radius in the next five seconds and hope that the explosion didn't launch the grenade's handle back at them like a bullet. Worse, the adhesive used on the grenade had a hard time sticking to tanks that were covered in dust or mud - which, considering the conditions of a battlefield, was nearly all of them. What it <strong>did</strong> stick to easily, however, was the uniform of the soldier trying to use the damn thing, leading to several incidents of panicked soldiers desperately trying to strip themselves of clothing while hoping that the grenade didn't arm itself.

The missile was also rendered useless if the user failed to achieve a lock the first time, as it had a very limited supply of coolant for its targeting sensor, its nitrogen bottle being smaller than the ones used for the heat-seeking AIM-9 Sidewinder. In a 20-year service history, it had only five confirmed kills. Its successor, the Sidewinder, was a significantly more effective (and easier to use) missile.</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_94_Nambu_pistol">Type 94 Nambu Pistol<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> deserves a special mention: the trigger sear which is used to fire the gun is exposed and it doesn't take much effort to trip it.

This would normally be fine, as polymer frames and receivers had already proven to be workable, even when riding against steel parts as in the case of guns like the Glock. The problem is that the specific polymers used for the G36's foregrip and receiver are the kind that soften when they get hot from, say, being right up next to a thin gun barrel as it has 750 rounds fired through it per minute. If the points of contact between the barrel and the inside of the receiver and foregrip were properly insulated, this likely wouldn't be a problem, or that big of one. But that's the thing - the points of contact wren't insulated at all. Testing by the German army determined that firing a single 30-round magazine through the weapon in under a single <em>minute</em> heats the weapon to the point that subsequent shots will deviate as much as six meters away from the point of aim when firing from its maximum effective range.</li><li> For exertion by American soldiers in the armed forces, the Chauchat machine gun <a class="urllink" href="https://www.forgottenweapons.com/the-worst-gun-ever/">was remodeled to sanction the use of .30-06 cartridges<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. However, due to a hastened production cycle, it quickly became known as one of the worst firearms ever, as it took the Chauchat with its numerous flaws (questionable ergonomics, plenty of open space for dirt and debris to get into, and flimsy magazines), and did a poor conversion to .30-06, with chambers often cut short, which would cause the cases to be stuck, and in many cases the rims would be torn off by the extractor. Many of the guns wouldn't pass factory inspection, and those that did go into front-line service were discarded almost immediately for technically inferior but infinitely more usable weapons; even automatic-riflemen squads would frequently excise the "automatic" part and go back to bolt-action Springfield rifles.</li><li> The USFA Zip-22 was so bad it killed the company.

For example, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/yu-gi-oh">the first season<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> has <em>only</em> the dub with no indication of it being that way, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SlamDunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SlamDunk">Slam Dunk</a></em>'s dub <a class="urllink" href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/slam-dunk-dub">is its own separate listing for some reason<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, while most other shows have the dub hidden away as a separate season, which isn't readily apparently in the least.<p></p></li><li> Facebook publicly displays the response time and reply rate for instant messages to business pages. A good idea in practice, if not for the fact that it will penalize you for not replying to each and <em>every</em> message that your page is sent, which includes flame mail, spam messages, people capping off exchanges with short messages to the effect of "okay, thanks!", or even just emoticons.<ul><li> Some questions to Facebook support ask why it's possible to drag and drop entries in the TV Shows and Movies categories, but not other categories like Apps and Games or Music; there is no official answer. In previous versions of the Likes pages, drag and drop was possible in all categories, but this has remained disabled for more than a year.</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyPlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyPlus">Disney+</a> does not label upcoming titles as "coming soon". Despite this, the search function still indexes them, so they'll still show up in search results. So a user could potentially see a title and plan to watch it later, only to find out that the title is not available yet.<ul><li> Early in the service's launch, pre-2009 episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a29780745/the-simpsons-episodes-disney-plus/">were zoomed in<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> instead of being pillarboxed like most other 4:3 shows on the service. Not only did many viewers find this unappealing, but there were a few instances of <a class="urllink" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/doh-disney-plus-shows-simpsons-episodes-in-the-wrong-aspect-ratio">visual gags unintentionally getting lost<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> because the zoom in cut them off. Disney later came out with <a class="urllink" href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21205990/simpsons-disney-plus-ratio-fix-49-169-visual-gags-fxx-streaming">a statement<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> saying that the issue would be rectified some time in the future by giving users the option to watch the episodes pillarboxed.</li></ul></li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder15');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miscellaneous&nbsp;</div><div id="folder15" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> The stainless steel teapots and coffee pots commonly found in British cafes and, notoriously, on British Rail trains: while they look like design classics in brushed steel, even the handles are made out of bare steel, which is very good at conducting the heat of two pints of liquid heated to boiling point. If you're lucky, the designer will have placed a thin layer of insulating foam between the pot and the handle, meaning that the handle will warm up, but not uncomfortably so; otherwise, you'll end up with a pot of tea that you cannot even lift until it cools to lukewarm. British comedian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenElton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenElton">Ben Elton</a> quoted this among other examples, and speculated that the British government has an entire department founded to butcher the designs of simple everyday tools.</li><li> Some drug awareness organizations, such as D.A.R.E., would give out pencils to students after their presentation, which had the message "Too cool to do drugs" printed on them. These pencils had a hilarious flaw: as they were sharpened, bits of the message would be shaved away, <a class="urllink" href="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/mr0aqyd.jpg">eventually leading to it reading "cool to do drugs", then simply "do drugs"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>. After a child noticed this, new pencils had the message printed the other way so "drugs" would be the first word to get shaved away.</li><li> The Fabuloso brand of cleaning products has attracted some internet infamy for its packaging, <a class="urllink" href="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/rc8b28zd8u1z.jpg">which at a glance looks almost identical to a bottle of fruit-flavored drink<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>. Imagine pouring yourself a glass of floor cleaner instead of punch...</li><li> The infamous <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Hawaii_false_missile_alert">Hawaii missile false alarm<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was caused by this; <em>apparently</em> the "real missile alert" button was right next to the "test missile alert" button, with no confirmation before sending it. There was also no easy way to send a follow-up message clarifying the false alarm, resulting in 38 panic-ridden minutes until they could arrange to send the message manually.</li><li> The Juicero, a $700 (later $400) cold-press juicing machine, had a buttload of crappy design decisions that led to it folding mere months after its launch:<ul><li> The machine itself is not actually a juicer, but a large press. It only worked with pre-approved, overpriced packets that had to be ordered from Juicero's website and had a limited shelf life. Not only were you paying more for the machine, but you had to sign up for a subscription plan that, at its absolute cheapest, came out to $1,600 per year. In the event that you couldn't (or didn't bother to) buy the packets, this expensive machine was functionally useless.</li><li> It had a needlessly-complex setup procedure. To start with, there's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsOnline">online DRM</a></em> on a juicer. Those who bought it were required to set up an account and connect to a cloud-based service in order to activate it in the first place. Don't have easy access to an internet connection? Too bad. The excuse for adding the DRM was that it would prevent you from using spoiled juice packs... but the machine would <em>brick</em> if you tried to use an expired package, and the company never bothered to fully answer questions about how the codes would function in the event of a sudden food recall.</li><li> The reason why it was so expensive is made clear by <a class="urllink" href="https://blog.bolt.io/heres-why-juicero-s-press-is-so-expensive-6add74594e50">examining the hardware<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>: the machine is filled with custom machined parts, expensive steel gears, a <em>completely custom power supply</em> (that had to have been certified, creating additional cost), expensive molded plastic for the sleek outer shell, and needlessly complicated design: it took over 23 parts just to <em>hold the door closed</em>. A lot of this is also due to the odd design choice of extracting the juice by spreading the force over the entire bag, like closing a book. Anyone with any knowledge of high school physics knows that pressure is inversely proportionate to surface area, meaning you need a lot more force and thus a much more powerful mechanism to provide the same amount of pressure, hence why the bags can be squeezed by hand. Yes, that's right - the juice bags can be squeezed <em>by hand</em>. The company wanted you to drop hundreds of dollars on an overpriced device and endure its needlessly complicated setup just to have the overengineered thing perform a task you can easily do manually.</li></ul></li><li> A water bottle shaped like a soccer ball, created to promote the 2018 World Cup, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGk2rj_T5js">made the news in Russia<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> due to its shape focusing beams of light similarly to a magnifying glass, making it a fire hazard if exposed to the sun.</li><li> The Tapplock smart lock has a lot of problems, including brittle materials and a ludicrously easy-to-hack security system, but what made it infamous was simple: <a class="urllink" href="https://mobile.twitter.com/LockPickingLwyr/status/1007613178249965569">it's held together with external screws.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Yes, this means you can disassemble it with an ordinary screwdriver. The company's initial response was "The lock is invincible to people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnedByFaintPraise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnedByFaintPraise">who do not have a screwdriver."</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Emojis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Emojis">Emojis</a> have one major flaw with them: whoever made your device has complete control over what they look like. Fortunately, they&#146;re consistent for the most part, but there&#146;s been some very odd cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInTranslation">Lost in Translation</a> for those on the receiving end...<ul><li> Apple devices initially flat-out hid the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Vulcan Salute</a> (&#128406;) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlippingTheBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlippingTheBird">Flipping the Bird</a> (&#128405;) from you. They displayed just fine, they just weren't selectable. The middle finger was at least understandable as a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerization">Bowdlerization</a>, but the Vulcan Salute couldn't be problematic by any reasonable stretch of the imagination.</li><li> Samsung devices used to display cookies (&#127850;) as a pair of saltine crackers. <a class="urllink" href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/samsung-ruins-cookie-monsters-day/">This caused some confusion<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Cookie Monster</a>'s Twitter account celebrated World Chocolate Day with some chocolate chip cookies, represented by the emoji. It wouldn't be until February 2018 when they finally fixed it (and many others, for that matter).</li><li> By 2018, Samsung and Apple devices had decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">Bowdlerise</a> the gun (&#128299;) for whatever reason. What looked like a realistic pistol on some devices (hell, it's even named that, and still has that design on the Unicode code charts) now looks like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyFriendlyFirearms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyFriendlyFirearms">a laser gun</a> or a water gun, respectively. The same happened on Windows 10 desktops. Most applications will show a font-colored laser gun, while web browsers show a green water gun with orange "magazine". As <a class="urllink" href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/apple-and-the-gun-emoji/">this article shows<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, this could go horribly wrong if, say, you were planning a water gun fight at the park, and used the emoji, making it look like you were planning a mass shooting to users of other devices. Eventually, by the end of 2018, other platforms such as Android, Windows, Twitter, and Facebook also changed their firearms into toy pistols, while the EmojiOne set put out both, with the former design being default and the latter optional.</li><li> Graphic designers seem to really like changing the context of the drooling face (&#129316;). Because it can only convey so much, apparently.</li><li> There's a character supposedly called "face with a look of triumph" which, on Windows and Android at least (plus <a class="urllink" href="https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1f624/index.htm">this character database<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>), actually represent an angry face steaming from the nose (&#128548;).</li></ul></li><li> Some Nokia dumbphones have the speaker located not above the screen as they should but in the back instead, which even if that can be fixed just turning the phone means everyone will hear your interlocutor, specially if they like to talk loudly.</li><li> Deathdapters, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/BigClive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/BigClive">Big Clive</a> calls them, allow the user to plug things in in various dangerous fashions, making them inherently unsafe, but there's <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvOTiQKkQMo">one type<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> that is particularly dangerous due to a particularly badly thought out all-in-one design. Namely, the American-style pins at the top and the British-style pins at the bottom, both spring-loaded and both <em>live</em> when they're in place, resulting in the potential for electrified pins suddenly popping out and causing a short-circuit with the wall or the user fatally shocking themselves attempting to put them back in.</li></ul></div><hr>
