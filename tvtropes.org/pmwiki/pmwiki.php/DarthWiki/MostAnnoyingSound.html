</p><p>Most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameTropes">Video Games</a> use audio cues as well as visual cues to let the player know what is going on around them. However, in some games these audio cues become an extreme annoyance to the player, either intentionally or thorough repetition. These sounds disrupt gameplay and force the player to focus on the sound instead of the game itself. Many gamers choose to disable the volume just to avoid hearing <em>that</em> sound again. And God forbid if you have misophonia over it. One execution of that sound effect can give you PTSD or nightmares for months.
</p><p>In order for one of these sounds to be a Most Annoying Sound, it <strong>must</strong> fall into one of the following categories; otherwise it's just personal dislike:

Bad stuff happening!", and in this case it causes you to perform even worse.
</li><li> Death sounds &mdash; Your character is already dead, and that stupid death music is playing <em>again</em>.
</li><li> Repetitive sounds &mdash; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenRecord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenRecord">Sounds that re- sounds that repeat-repeat-repeat themselves- sounds that repeat themselves</a> are the worst-worst-worst.
</li><li> Taunts &mdash; The "come at me!" moves/sounds in multiplayer games are often designed to create this annoyance. Any strategy to use taunts to annoy other players and possibly screw with their concentration is generally considered poor form.

<ul><li> The sound of music continuing to play after you present evidence in a cross-examination, as it means you're headed for a penalty. (To contrast, the music <em>stops</em> if you've presented the right evidence on the right line.). And of course, <em>Trials and Tribulations</em> had to play with this, in which sometimes presenting the right evidence does <em>not</em> stop the music, making you wonder whether you succeeded until you reach the end of the conversation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney</a></em>:
<ul><li> Every single time Winston Payne says "OBJECTION!" in his high-pitched, squeaky, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NailsOnAChalkboard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NailsOnAChalkboard">Nails On A Chalkboard</a> voice.
</li><li> Similarly, Manfred von Karma's demonic "OBJECTION" in case 1-4. If only because he'll yell it if you do as much as opening your mouth.
</li><li> For that matter, any OBJECTION that doesn't come from the player character. Just when you thought the case was starting to make progress...nope! OBJECTION.
</li><li> Mia's objection is a bit high-pitched as well, and while it's not as bad as Payne's, hearing them yelling "Objection!" at each other in 3-1 can get a bit grating.
</li><li> The feedback from Mike Meekins' megaphone! <strong>BWEEEEEEEE-OOOOOP!</strong> He turns that damn thing on every ten seconds or so! Thank GOODNESS they didn't give it to him in <em>Investigations</em>!
</li><li> The buzzer in case 3-2, which could have been avoided if Maya didn't press it. You can expect it the first time, but the producers felt evil enough to make it play AGAIN in court, when you're not expecting it, making a lot of people jump.
</li><li> Franziska's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhipItGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhipItGood">whip</a>. You'll come to hate it as much Phoenix does. Except at the end of case 2-4, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">the circumstances</a> turn it into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MostWonderfulSound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MostWonderfulSound">Most Wonderful Sound</a></span>, and in case 3-5 and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigationsMilesEdgeworth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigationsMilesEdgeworth">I-5</a> when she uses it on Larry for being obnoxious and unhelpful.

The song isn't so bad the first time you hear it... but by the time the case is over, the song will be permanently etched into your brain as it plays over and over and over...
<ul><li> Also in <em>Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney</em>, Noodle cart vendor Eldoon's constant and unskippable harmonica riffs.
</li><li> And then there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH</a> (for about three screens) when you first meet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass">Ema</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspectorLestrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspectorLestrade">Skye</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigations">Ace Attorney Investigations</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the first case you have to talk to Jacques Portsman, who constantly takes his jacket half off and puts it back on. Loudly. Like, every ten seconds. You will rapidly begin to hate him for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a>-ness, but even more because <em>that damn jacket sound is so annoying</em>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndingFatigue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndingFatigue">loooong</a> final chapter is punctuated by the culprit's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">frequent</a> "OHB-JECK-SHUN"s.
</li><li> In the Japan-only <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigations">Ace Attorney Investigations</a> 2</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bansai Ichinyanagi's objections are pretty bad to listen to.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyDualDestinies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyDualDestinies">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney &#150; Dual Destinies</a></em>:
<ul><li> <strong>Silence!</strong>, which replaces Simon Blackquill's <strong>Objection!</strong> when his shackles break loose.
</li><li> While we're at it, Simon's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RazorWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RazorWind">Razor Wind</a> swing, his rough equivalent of Franziska's whip.
</li><li> In the same vein as the example of Jacques Portsman above, you will scramble to get through any scene speaking with Myriam Scuttlebutt as quickly as humanly possible. When she gets angry and begins punching her cardboard box, the sound quickly gets <em>incredibly</em> annoying due to sheer repetition.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ProfessorLaytonVsPhoenixWrightAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ProfessorLaytonVsPhoenixWrightAceAttorney">Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney</a></em>, there's Lettie's "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoIndoorVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoIndoorVoice">SIIIIIIIR!</a>" It's so obnoxiously loud, they included a microphone feedback sound effect after it!
<ul><li> Also, Mary's goat, which she squeezes whenever she's upset. It wouldn't cause much problems if it didn't stop bleating until her dialog is over.
</li></ul></li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elder Scrolls&nbsp;</div><div id="folder1" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIDaggerfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIDaggerfall">Daggerfall</a></em>:
<ul><li> When the player is caught committing a crime, the game begins spawning an endless number of guards, all of them shouting <em>Halt!</em> constantly. The ratio of guards to civilian NPCs in the world goes from 1 guard for every 20 NPC to 10 guards per NPC (and the number of civilians has not decreased). If one remained in the area long enough, the game would spawn so many guards that it would crash. The chorus of so many voices screaming "HALT! HALT! HALT! HALT!" cannot be given proper justice in text. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?hl=en&amp;v=18CGW9P5Y9M">[1]<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Of course this trope is inverted when their sentence ends early with an "OOMPH" and they fall down dead, having fought you, who happened to be more fearsome than any mudcrab they had ever fought.
</li><li> The monster cries themeslves - "RAWWRRGGGH" every couple of seconds. Oh. <em>Lord</em>. This is even <em>worse</em> if you're playing it on DOSBox because they might end up clipping over each other.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind">Morrowind</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sinnammu Mirpal is almost as bad as the guards in <em>Daggerfall</em>. If you go too far ahead of her, she says "Hey wait for me!" If you go too fast, she says "Hey wait for me!" If you go too slow, she says "Hey wait for me!" And she gets stuck behind a rock in the water...prompting more "Hey wait for me!"
</li><li> The clanging metal item repair sounds are eardrum-piercing when the player is in a hurry and just mashes the repair button at high speed until the item is fixed.
</li><li> Anyone who has played <em>Morrowind</em> might probably remember the cliff racer. They're largely hated not only for its high-pitched screech it makes, but its inability to die and more than one always attacking the player. Such a pain when trying to get from point A to point B. In fact, they were so annoying that Bethseda realized the amount of cliff racers being a mistake! Thankfully there's a fanmade mod that removes them from the game and were actually taken out in <em>Oblivion</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em>:
<ul><li> "SOMEONE'S BEEN MURDERED!"/"HELP! SOMEBODY! WE'VE GOT A BURGLAR!"/"FILTHY PICKPOCKET! WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?!"/"BY THE NINE, ASSAULT! ASSAULT!!"/(<em>And finally</em>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">"STOP RIGHT THERE, CRIMINAL SCUM!"</a>
</li><li> Any time you return to the Arena District after becoming the Grand Champion, expect to be greeted with a "By Azura, by Azura, by Azura- it's the Grand Champion!" courtesy of the Adoring Fan. Even if he's been following you for several months' time in-game, he'll <em>still</em> like to remind you of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWorship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWorship">why he's following you</a>. It gets old very fast.
</li><li> Try attacking a Knight of Order. It's like smacking a screaming box of metal. Ouch.
</li><li> This conversation is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">amusing</a> the first time you hear it, but markedly less so on each subsequent occasion:

</div><div class="indent"> <em>Random villager 1:</em> "I saw some mud crabs the other day."
</div><div class="indent"> <em>Random villager 2:</em> "Filthy things. I avoid them wherever possible."
</div><div class="indent"> <em>Random villager 1:</em> "Good-BYE!"
</div><div class="indent"> <em>Random villager 2: (without missing a beat)</em> "HELLO!"
</div><div class="indent"> <em>Random villager 3:</em> "What's going on with you?"
</div><div class="indent"> <em>Random villager 2:</em> "I saw some mud crabs the other day..."
</div><ul><li> Obtaining alchemical ingredients in large quantities generally involves stopping off at many shops and taverns, wherein you will be required to individually click on each item in the list, while constantly being told "You got a great deal there", "You bought that for a song", and "You're a fine negotiator". This can be slightly amusing if you are clicking fast and constantly interrupt their lines: "Pleasuredoing...", "You got a great...", "You're a fine..."
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>:
<ul><li> The way bears roar appears to be bugged in such a way that the sound can't be stopped once it's started, and the last part of the sound is about twice as loud as it should be. Not helped by the fact that even <em>killing the bear</em> won't make it shut up for a good second or three.
</li><li> The guards are fairly annoying: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">"I used to be an adventurer like you...then I took an arrow in the knee..."</a> You'd think the entire garrison in every city is comprised of ex-adventurers with busted knees...
</li><li> Guards will also comment on every skill you've ever used. This leads to situations when you have reached 100 in One-handed weapons and 20 in two-handed but guards still say "The gods gave you two hands, and you use them both for your weapon."
</li><li> And then of course there's the children in the city of Whiterun:
</li></ul><div class="indent">"I work with my mother, to sell fruits and vegetables. It's fun most days, but hard work!"
</div><div class="indent">"What are you lookin' at? I'm not afraid of you, y'know...even if you are my elder!"
</div><div class="indent">"Another wanderer, here to lick my father's boots...good job!"
</div><ul><li> Heimskr, the <em>fervent</em> Talos priest in Whiterun. He stands in front of the statue of Talos all day long and is constantly preaching at the top of his lungs. Since the statue of Talos is right between the stairs leading to Jorrvaskr (the Companions' guild hall) and Dragonsreach (home of the Jarl and his officials, highly relevant to a number of quests, and site of the only magic shop and enchanting table) and sits next to the circle around the Gildergreen where half of the city's NPCs congregate, that means that you will be constantly assaulted by his screaming.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Nazeem.</a> There's a reason there are so many videos of people killing him. What's worse, you are almost <em>guaranteed</em> to run into him, since he spends his time right in the middle of the fucking market. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect">Even after you are the Thane of Whiterun, have joined the Companions and saved the ENTIRE PLANE OF EXISTENCE from being destroyed by Dragons</a>, hundreds of which you've likely slaughtered by then, he still has little to say to you beyond:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><em>Do you get down to the Cloud District very often? Oh, what am I saying, of course you don't.</em>
</div><ul><li> Speaking of Whiterun, players who join the Companions will soon discover how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">pleasant</a> it is to live in Jorrvaskr, which is a fairly cramped place full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPCs</a>, some of which never leave the building itself. Worse still, going to the sleeping quarters will make two or more of your fellow Companions spawn right next to you and, most of the time, the one "greeting" you will be either Athis or Njada Stone-Arm, both of whom being (respectively) a passive-agressive smartass and a plain rude <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a>. While they both tone it down after you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">become the new Harbinger</span> and Njada <em>considerably</em> mellows out should you marry her, they will both make you <em>seriously</em> consider bringing either of them along for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistreatmentInducedBetrayal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistreatmentInducedBetrayal">Boethiah's quest</a>.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Athis:</strong> <em>I never thought they would actually let me join The Companions. But now it looks like they're letting anyone in these days</em>.
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Njada:</strong> <em>I'm still trying to figure out why Skjor let you in in the first place.</em>
</div><ul><li> Cicero. He can be considered <em>Skyrim</em>'s answer to the Adoring Fan. Most of his lines are either screamed or whispered in a painfully high-pitched voice sent straight from the depths of Oblivion. Also, if you become Listener for the Dark Brotherhood, he will constantly repeat the same line to you.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><em>Oh you are the Listener! You are the Listener! I have served Mother well, I have!</em>
</div><ul><li> The tone that accompanies being informed that "Your vampire blood boils in sunlight."
</li><li> The obnoxious chewing noises that happen any time you eat anything.
</li><li> Bandits aren't terribly creative when it comes to battle cries, meaning you'll be hearing the lines "Never should've come here!" and "Well ain't this a surprise!" until you're sick to death of them. And then you'll hear them some more.
</li><li> Probably the biggest downside of the Dead Thrall spell, which permanently resurrects a corpse under your control, is that it makes every NPC greet you with "That spell looks dangerous... keep your distance." To call it obnoxious would be a severe understatement.
</li><li> If you install <em>Dawnguard</em> and don't bother starting it for a while, you'll get very tired of hearing "Heard they're reforming the Dawnguard..." For that matter, <em>anything</em> the guards say can get very tiresome after a while, since they only have so many lines to choose from.
</li><li> Speaking of <em>Dawnguard</em>, potential follower Serana is a fountain of annoying phrases. If she's accompanying you, you'd better get used to hearing "Where did you come from?" and "Done and done" <em>every single time you enter and leave combat</em>. To make matters worse, due to a bug, Serana also loves to say "Yes? What did you need?" every few seconds between the quests "Prophet" and "Chasing Echoes". Especially grating when you're forging, enchanting or brewing potions and she decides to stand right beside you and repeat it over and over again.
</li><li> Shopkeepers in general have the same problem, especially if you're borrowing their facilities (alchemy, enchanting, smithing). One of the biggest boons to getting your own alchemy lab, for instance, is probably not having to listen to Arcadia's sales pitches every three seconds while you're mixing potions. They also only have around three stock sayings every single time you want to buy or sell something, which will be often. Hearing them say "Trinkets, odds and ends, that sort of thing" for the 500th time can get pretty grating.
</li><li> Most of the in-game spouses decide to become shopkeepers to keep themselves amused while you're not home. Ask them what they have for sale, and they offer the same phrases. "Some may call this junk; me, I call them treasures" is not made any more endearing by coming out of the Dragonborn's beloved's mouth.
</li><li> Mjoll the Lioness as a follower is basically an embodiment of this. You'll be nursing a nice headache after hearing about her hunting trips to Morrowind, and her love of the cold about every 5 minutes.
</li><li> The Spectral Assassin also counts, for similar reasons as Mjoll. "Have you heard the tale of Mathieu Bellamont, and the great treachery of Cheydinhal?" Yes, we have. Five million times, thank you very much.
</li><li> The Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary contains a friendly Frostbite Spider right next to the alchemy/enchanting stations. If you plan on using your trade skills in the Sanctuary, the sound of the spider walking around in its enclosure may prompt you to stealth-kill it just to get it to shut up.
</li><li> During the Civil War questline when you go looking for the Jagged Crown, you'll end up in a part of the dungeon where you'll have to find a well-hidden lever in order to open a gate. If you can't find the lever right away, get used to Legate Rikke or Galmar Stone-Fist (depending on faction chosen) asking you every ten seconds if you've seen a lever anywhere.
</li><li> If you choose not to do Jaree-Ra's quest, be prepared to constantly hear him say "You should see me when you get bored, stranger," whenever you're in Solitude. Some good-aligned players have agreed to do the quest just so he'll <em>shut up</em>.
</li><li> Depending on one's ability to pick up higher pitched sounds, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKmEtQwJSik">Nirnroot<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> can be this. Some people find its chime actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MostWonderfulSound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MostWonderfulSound">pretty soothing</a>, while others equate the higher pitched tones as the equivalent of nails on chalkboard.

<ul><li> In Daggerfall, you will wish you'd let King Casimir die by the 4,000th time you hear the following exchange:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Random Townsperson 1:</strong> I heard some stranger saved King Casimir's life.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Random Townsperson 2:</strong> Really? I'd like to buy that hero an ALE!
</div><ul><li> Similarly, in the Aldmeri Dominion, this line gets old quickly:

</div><ul><li> Until you start the Orsinium questline, get used to hearing Stuga run up to you every time you're in one of the starter cities:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Stuga:</strong> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Do you know how LONG I've been LOOKING for you?</a>"
</div><ul><li> There was a glitch that occurred at the launch of the housing system that caused dog pets to bark continuously whenever their player moved, which quickly got on everyone's nerves.
</li><li> Some of the random encounters out in the wilderness involve a non-playable character calling for help, but some of them would just call it over and over, repeatedly. This was fixed, and was memorialized with the following patch note: <em>"The summoner requesting help in the wilderness will no longer shout endlessly about his predicament. He has advanced to the next stage of accepting his fate."</em>

It sounds like "I'M ANNOYING, HUNH?! I'M ANNOYING, HUNH?! I'M ANNOYING, HUNH?!" and is repeated <em>over and over</em> for the <em>duration of the level</em>. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheSpoonyExperiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheSpoonyExperiment">The Spoony One</a> describes the siren as saying "An annoying cunt".)

<ul><li> Also the constant CLANKCLANKCLANK whenever you have to play as Steiner. This is usually redeemed by the fact that every sequence in which you play as Steiner is <em>absolutely hilarious,</em> though.

<ul><li> The effects of the various Sambas a Dancer can produce being triggered can get grating, particularly since they're triggered <em>every time one of the three or four people meleeing the mob hits</em>.

And possibly their entire family, as well, as the sound has been known to wake babies sleeping in distant rooms. The volume of the various calls isn't adjusted with the game's volume, but rather at the maximum your speakers will allow on their own settings. &lt;call&gt; or &lt;call0&gt; is just the most infamous as it is a loud shrill whistle, but some of the others are also held in low regard.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>
<ul><li> &lt;se&gt; in this game serves the same purpose as &lt;call&gt; in XI. Some are just as shrill and painful as in XI, and players spam macros for things like interrupts which contain &lt;se&gt;s or worse think it's funny to create macros which string long lines of different &lt;se&gt;s back to back. SE tried to break those macros by limiting the number of &lt;se&gt;s allowed pre macro line, but you can just use multiple macro lines to the same effect. To make matters even worse, you can't silence an offender in the middle of a dungeon, because blacklisting is disabled in dungeons, and even disabling the offending chat channel still allows &lt;se&gt;s to reach your speakers.
</li><li> It also has many annoying sounds from several battle classes that you <em>will</em> hear over and over again; the Black Mage's Blizzard III spell sounds like glass breaking and the class need to use Blizzard spells in general to kick start their MP regeneration. Dragoons have a jump attack that can hit multiple enemies at once, but the sound effect used sounds like futuristic version of a car revving up its engine and then followed by a kickback. White Mages with their Holy spell sounds like a high pitched version of breaking glass. The worst part is some battles can only go smoothly if players spam their attacks (and you might be doing it too!).
</li><li> The "crafting action failed" noise, in addition to being frustrating for its meaning, just sounds so grating in and of itself.
</li><li> Female Miqo'te Voice 5 is infamous for having a gratingly high-pitched combat voice that <em>somehow</em> can be heard through all the combat noise that happens in a dungeon. Nevermind the Holy explosions and Blizzard III's going off, the squeaky "HAAA!" can somehow be made out through that. And twelve forbid that character is a Ranged DPS, where combat grunts go off far more frequently.

</li><li> A typical battle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em>:
<ul><li> Flanitors will heal other enemies that are damaged in battle with Rescue. And every time they use it: 'WEEEEOOOOOOO WEEOOOWEEOOOWEEOOO'. And when you get two or three on screen...
</li><li> Considering that Vanille's Death Spell has only a 1% chance to hit a target, you'll just fill your head with "You're gonna regret this!" or the ever-annoying "<em>I</em> have to see this through!"
</li><li> Don't forget Snow. Ugghhhh.... "We gotta win this!" "We gotta win this!" "We gotta win this!".
</li><li> The continuous alarm that blares while you're onboard the <em>Palamecia</em> and the only time it ceases is when you access the menu. Code Red, Code Green, Code Purple, whatever, <em><strong>fine</strong></em>, but somebody shut off that damn alarm!
</li><li> Vanille's voice for some, with some particularly hating on the English dub for her impossibly high pitch and perky mannerisms, as well as criticizing her Aussie accent for sounding fake. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">Not so much to actual Australians though</a>, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">find it a much more realistic accent than Fang's.</a>

Considering how brutally hard some of them get, you're likely to rip out your ears before you finish.
</li><li> The slot machines in Serendipity love to tease you by giving you two Microchus on the reels. Every time you get two Microchus in a row, the machine makes a very loud 'DA-DUNK'. Given how fantastically unlikely it is to get three Microchus, you'll get tired of 'DA-DUNK' very quickly.

</li><li> The sequel has added a few more, most notably with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a>'s Yuna. She calls her Aeons' names whenever she uses them for a Brave attack. And some of her Brave attacks will be used often, so you'll be hearing stuff like "Shiva! Shiva! Strike down!" or "Valefor!

</li><li> At least Ashley only screamed when you allowed enemies to take her. Sheva has a need to announce everything to the world; I need ammo! I need ammo! I NEED HEEELLLP!!
</li><li> Any co-op game of RE5 will inevitably result in both players spamming "Come on! Come on! Come on!" at every opportunity.

"What?!" "I want that." "I don't wanna die!" "Oh my God!" "What the hell?!"
</li><li> Leon's death yell is frequently likened to the sounds of a dying walrus, which only becomes more obnoxious when it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">plays over</a> unique death animations.

BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. If you ever played the first or third LOZ games, these sounds will haunt you for the rest of your life. Even if it has been ten years since you played either. You will never unhear it.
<ul><li> Downplayed in some later games. It's still there, but they made the sound softer, quieter, and less frequent.

</li><li> Any game with the ReDeads. Their scream is not only annoying, it means you're paralyzed for a few seconds while they creep towards you to kill you, making them an unholy mix of this trope plus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellIsThatNoise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellIsThatNoise">Hell Is That Noise</a>.
</li><li> Though the Guardian Acorn/Pieces of Power from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LinksAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LinksAwakening">Link's Awakening</a></em> seem like useful items at first (they double your defense/attack power until you take a certain number of hits) the entire time they're in effect they completely replace the background music with an annoying, repetitive drone that <em>does not go away</em> unless you enter a building or take three hits from an enemy so the effect can wear off. There are certain tunes that will override the powerup theme, though, most notably boss battle themes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em>:

If you weren't sick of playing it by the time you got to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">Water Temple</a>, you most certainly were after that, due to the fact that it's used to change the temple's water levels.
</li><li> Saria's Song
</li><li> The Owl's theme music, mostly by association.
</li><li> "HEY! LISTEN!"
</li><li> Zelda's shrieking will quickly get on your nerves on the final boss fight because you hear it every time you get hit.

<ul><li> When you are in the Goron Shrine, the horrible grating noise that the crying Goron child makes will drive you bat-crazy in a short amount of time. Then again, the other Gorons in the city are just as sick of it as you are. (Fortunately, the ocarina song for that region is a lullaby, which even works on <strong>all</strong> Gorons.)
</li><li> Tatl's call is a <em>bicycle bell</em>. Though, they did change it based on complaints from Navi's "Hey! Listen!", and to make it less frequent, so at least it's a step up.
</li><li> The Skull Kid's laugh.
</li><li> The Elegy of Emptiness. By the time you get to the top of the Stone Tower, it's gotten old. And then, you have to go inside. Though the sound itself isn't the problem. This one is longer and more complex than the simple "hit up-down-up twice" idea with most of the songs. It requires the most work and then you have to wait for it to repeat and for stuff to happen. Most of the puzzles in Stone Tower require playing this song six or seven times. It is incredibly, <em>insanely</em> long, boring, and tedious and it makes things like OoT's Water Temple (the returning to the equipment screen to switch boots every five seconds, the <em>former</em> standard for rage-inducing tedium in a Zelda game) seem fun by comparison. You <em>will</em> go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> at the sound of it by the end.
</li><li> Odolwa's constant chanting/shouting.
</li><li> From both <em>Majora's Mask</em> and <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, the howling of Wolfos. It's annoying even the first time you hear it.

<ul><li> The song to change the direction of the wind gets very old <em>very fast</em>. Fortunately, you'll hear it less often in the HD version if you buy the Swift Sail after it becomes available, which automatically changes the wind direction (though you'll still need the song for purposes other than sailing).
</li><li> The Command Melody gets old faster, despite learning it comparatively late in the game.
</li><li> There are enemies called Miniblins that, although small and weak, have a tendency to appear in (seemingly never-ending) swarms. They make a high-pitched noise like "da-NA! da-NA! da-NA!" AND THEY WON'T SHUT UP until every single one of those annoying, respawning things is DEAD.
</li><li> Fighting a Wizzrobe and hearing another one spawn and summon more monsters gives a solid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> feeling.
</li><li> Kargaroks make this "EYAAA" sound...over and over and over and over until you kill them simply because you don't want to hear the sound...then another one shows up.
</li><li> The strange not-quite voice acting, although tolerable, got to critical levels when trying to repeatedly buy things from Beedle: "THEEENNK YEW!! THEEENNK YEW!!"
</li><li> Pressing the A button on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a> when using the Tingle Tuner causes Tingle to scream "Heeeeeey!" while the screen zooms in on Tingle's cursor.
</li><li> The repetitive and unskippable cutscene and music note every time Link picks up an item and holds it up or opens a chest and almost falls inside it.

Thankfully, after you get <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the whip from the Ancient Cistern</span>, you can just take the horn from the Bokoblins.
</li><li> Whenever you use your sword for dowsing. BOOP. BOOP. BOOP. BOOP. BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP.
</li><li> "HEY LISTEN" combined with the heart alarm &mdash; when your hearts get low for the first time in a given gameplay session, Fi will want to tell you that your hearts are low and you should get some health. Sure, you could just ignore her, but her hails add another chime to the already annoying alarm.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Wizzrobes</a>' vocal cords appear to be developed to sound as dissonant and annoying as possible. <em>Especially</em> when laughing, which they do every time they stun Link with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">lightning bolts</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessFreezing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessFreezing">ice</a>, while dancing safely out of reach of Link's sword. HE-HE-HIEEUW! HE-HE-HIEEUW!
</li><li> The weird squealing noise that Kilton makes. It wouldn't be so bad if he didn't do it <em>every time</em> you buy or sell something in his shop, so if you're planning on unloading a lot of monster parts all at once, you're going to hear it a lot.
</li></ul></li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder6');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tales Series&nbsp;</div><div id="folder6" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Everyone calls the names of all their special attacks. If it's a magic attack, they also have some kind of chant to go along with it, usually. This gets fairly annoying as the AI controlled teammates will probably constantly be using their specials. Also, the noises that monsters make when they get hit and when they die can become really annoying, especially since multiple monsters are often assigned the exact same sounds.
<ul><li> The best effect configuration for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Genis</a> is the one that stops him from fumbling a spell if he takes damage, especially because you'll never again have to hear, "<em>Don't bother me!</em>"

Overeager AI + healers + voice cues on getting hit. "Kenka wa kore k-yabee! Kenka wa-yabee! Kenka wa kore kara da-yabee!" I know you really want to heal me, Hisui, but it's more productive if you run away from the bear mauling you first.
</li><li> And then there was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfDestiny">Tales of Destiny</a></em>s brilliant idea of having the spell voice overs <em>on the menu</em>. So, if you decide to use a healing magic like, say, First Aid, on the menu, you'll have to tolerate a <em>very</em> loud "<strong>FAASUTO EIDO!!!-a</strong>". And if you have it used multiple times, you'll have a "<strong>FAASU-FAAASU-FAA-FAASUT-FAA-FAASU-FAASUTO EIDO!!!-a</strong>". And yes, the "-a" is there. Probably a recording error... that makes the thing more annoying.
</li><li> The opening scene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia">Tales of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhantasySpelling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhantasySpelling">Phantasia</a></em> is an example of this trope taken to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">So Bad, It's Good</a> levels.

</li><li> While the Japanese <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks">battle voices</a> are usually freaking awesome, there is one in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia">Tales of Vesperia</a> that is really annoying. There are enemy soldiers who seem to shout "baka" every time they are hit; using a multi-hitting Mystic Art/Hi-Ougi on them can drive your patience.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfGraces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfGraces">Tales of Graces</a></em>: That little glass-shattering noise that means you're going into Eleth Break.

<ul><li> Hey look a shooting star!. It's an innocuous enough line for a relatively good spell from party spell-caster Magilou. The Spell even stuns almost every enemy in the game if you string multiple in a row. The issue is - She says it every single time you cast the spell, and it's basically an instant cast. But don't worry, you'll also get to constantly hear her Mystic Arte Quote ("Rise... arise... Ascending... ANGEL!") soon after. I really hope you like her voice actor.
</li><li> In general, the fact that each attack has one, and only one voice clip associated with it, and said voice clip plays every single time you use said attack means you're bound to run into this many times over the course of a playthrough.

Considering you have to use it in many puzzles, it gets annoying fast. He's also considered this in-universe by Luke.
</li><li> Arietta's glass-shatteringly high and screechy voice, especially during the beginning of the game, when she attacks the Kaitzur Naval Point. Particularly annoying during the battle-dialogue when fighting her. "Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!" How about <strong>you</strong> shut up, Arietta? (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Luke and Jade seem to agree</a>)

<ul><li> "MUTTON, FRESH MUTTON!" being yelled rather frequently in most market areas.
</li><li> Elize saying "Sharing is caring!" frequently, when she is linked up with someone.
</li><li> Of the non-vocal variety, <em>Xillia 2</em> has the rather annoying, loud PING sound whenever the cursor goes to the next Allium Orb, which makes checking them out and equipping a new one an unpleasant experience.
</li></ul></li><li> When it comes to repetitiveness, none can forget how <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfLegendia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfLegendia">Tales of Legendia</a></em> does it.

</li><li> The DS version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfInnocence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfInnocence">Tales of Innocence</a></em> had a <em>lot</em> of voice acting for a DS game. A <em>lot</em>! However, in order to make it all fit, the audio had to be compressed, resulting in some compression artifacts that sometimes make the voiced scenes sound "crackly". This may not have been as notable when played on DS hardware, but if played via an emulator or listened to through headphones, you <em>definitely</em> hear it. Emulator glitches can also aggravate this hardware, and sometimes they might even slow down the speech, utterly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">ruining dramatic scenes</a>.

<ul><li> Yes, yes, I know your bladder's about to explode/you're kinda hungry/you NEED more fun/there are many puddles in this room&mdash;I am trying to fix it&mdash;MUST you tell me every five seconds, and slow down the process of fixing it by cancelling all of your lined up commands, with your annoying simlish whining?
</li><li> Even worse is that they sometimes will stop doing the thing that will satisfy their need in order to complain if you happen to tell them to do it right as they decide to do so, also cancelling the action you had planned. This includes getting out of bed to complain about being tired, stopping eating in order to complain about being hungry, and <em>getting off the toilet in order to wet themselves.</em>
</li><li> The worst is that "music" that plays whenever a Sim gets really pissed or something. You know, the "guy screaming into a trumpet sound"...BADADADADUMBADADADADUM WAH WAH WAH WAH.
</li><li> The expansion pack that added hobbies made them worse. The constant phone spam telling your Sims to subscribe to hobby magazines is worse than cold-callers in real life, and worst of all when all your Sims are out of the house and <em>can't answer it</em>. Several fan-made mods have been created specifically to address this problem.
</li><li> The University expansion adds in the School cheer interaction for student sims. If you are planning to live alone, you won't be alone since University added Mascots and Cheerleaders... who ALWAYS do this action upon entering the lot. Fortunately there are many mods that disable them... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">or you can just use the debug tools and make them commit suicide.</a>

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MySims" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MySims">MySims</a> Kingdom</em>, a couple of characters, Poppy and Sapphire, sound like they're having panic attacks until you complete their tasks. This can be <em>very unnerving</em> while you're <em>trying to perform them</em>. Trevor, however, is in a class of his own. He overacts, says "Vadeesh" (something like "thank you"?) and a second later, the cycle starts over (though probably a different bit of acting)! Soon, you never want to hear the word "vadeesh" again...
</li><li> Sims 3 adds the absolute worst though: a loud musical jingle with an angelic choir <em>every time</em> the active Sim fulfills a promised Wish, even if it's something as mundane as doing the dishes.
</li><li> When the toddler wants to get out of the crib from TS3! 'Rah Rah Rah! Naaaah! Naaaah!'

If in the frenzy of battle you exceed recommended levels, the computer controlling the Mech attempts to shut it down. What usually follows is frantic tapping on the "override shutdown" key, which will keep the Mech active at the cost of much slower heat dissipation, or possibly destruction if you don't stop shooting. Both exceeding the recommended level and overriding the shutdown procedure have their own loud alarm sounds and a lengthy warning delivered by the computer, and every fight you do in any Mech with energy weapons will see you doing that <em>many</em> times.

Someone thought it was a good idea to give the turtles lines to say; unfortunately, each turtle only has about three. And they say them <em>every single time they attack.</em> Donatello may be the worst offender: "ANYONE FOR STICKBALL? I HAVE THE STICK&mdash;YOU BE THE BALL!" Odds are you'll be turning down the volume by halfway through the first level. Mercifully, the voice lines were significantly dialed down in the sequels.
<ul><li> One of Michelangelo's bosses, Nano Machine Ver. 3, has to be fought using aerial attacks. Which inevitably leads to an endless string of "EAT FEET EAT FEET EAT FEET EAT FEET" until the thing finally decides to go down.
</li><li> Back in the day, people reportedly complained to the developers about having to listen to Leonardo go "SLICE N' DICE!" about once per second when fighting enemies.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Hong Kong 97</em>, an unlicensed Super Famicom game, only has one sound: a five-second loop of the Chinese pop song "I Love Beijing Tianamen". It plays, without cease, even in the case of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">which is all too likely</a>) and returning to the title screen.

All characters yell while charging up their Heavy, but Ruby's sound is much louder and noticeable than the others, so hearing "Haaaaa<em>aaaa</em>!" repeated several times as a player is spamming that attack becomes extremely grating. Oh, and there's only one sound file for that attack.
</li><li> You're going to get reaaal sick of Misa's voice quotes in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MobileSuitGundam">Gundam</a> Breaker 3</em>, as she simply <em>will not stop narrating</em> every single thing that happens. Yes, getting a chunk of your Gunpla blown off is cause for alarm, but when she shrills about it every single time it happens, sometimes within seconds of losing a piece the previous time, it erases any sympathy a player might have for her. Quite a few players actually let her get taken out just so she'll shut up already.
<ul><li> On a semi-related note, the sharp, rising 'ping' sound effect that comes when someone has charged a Shining Finger type attack. Especially if it's one of those missions where the game spams dozens of Nobel/Burning/Shining Gundams at you. This is because Finger-type attacks pretty reliably knock you down as well as blow the head off your mobile suit, costing you important abilities such as weapon targeting and enemy tracking.

She's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>, so be prepared to hear that sound every time you retry the battle.
<ul><li> The shattering porcelain sound that plays when you take damage, and the "pop-WOOO" when you die. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Given the kind of game this is</a>, you'll be sick to death of those sounds eventually.

Nevertheless, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuest">Space Quest</a> 2</em> took the leap backwards and has a meltdown alarm that plays continuously.

Since you will inevitably be reduced to trying <em>every</em> item <em>everywhere</em> on several occasions, this got old really fast. It didn't help that the volume of that phrase seemed particularly loud. Thankfully, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiscworldII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiscworldII">the sequel</a> took the liberty of expanding Rincewind's verbal repertoire for the player using an item incorrectly.

Because of this, nearly the entire time you're there, an alarm perpetually goes off, accompanied by a bland voice repeating, "Warning. All personnel, contamination detected in NORAD air ducts, and ventilation systems." You can shut the alarm off in the remake, <em>Pegasus Prime</em>, but this locks you into the first room unless you start it again, otherwise a guard outside will wake up and apprehend you on sight.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiscworldNoir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiscworldNoir">Discworld Noir</a></em> averted this with a wider range of comments, including one where Lewton says dryly, "I resisted the impulse to say 'That doesn't work'."
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZackAndWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZackAndWiki">Zack &amp; Wiki</a></em>, any of Wiki's high-pitched, ear-screeching audio clips.

Now imagine picking them up that constantly, and hearing "I picked up a bonus puzzle piece!" <em>every single time you pick up one.</em> It gets grating very fast. To make matters worse, the game takes two and a half hours to beat. <em>They expected children to be able to tolerate it too.</em>
</li><li> "'Tis beyond my reach!" was an infuriatingly oft heard line in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuestMaskOfEternity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuestMaskOfEternity">King's Quest: Mask of Eternity</a></em>.

Alexander has a habit of snapping his fingers when he's agitated or thinking. His father, King Graham, <em>hates the sound</em> and eventually snaps over it. Eventually he explains that his dislike of the sound is justified because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it reminds him of the night Alexander was kidnapped as a baby, when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> immobilized Graham and his wife with a spell by snapping his fingers.</span>

<ul><li> Deliberately done with much of Max's self-consciously annoying behaviour. Examples include his constant begging to go to the bathroom ("I gotta go to the bathroom. I gotta go to the bathroom."), his complaining while in the dunk tank (which actually annoys Sam, too), and his deliberately agitating a squeaky sliding door by leaning toward and away from it.
</li><li> All audio annoyances in <em>Hit The Road</em> pale beside the horror of Sam announcing loudly and constantly, "I can't use these things together!" <em>every time</em> an inventory interaction fails. In a game that requires you to do things like stick Jesse James's severed hand on a golf ball retriever and shove it into the world's largest ball of twine, you'll be hearing this <em>a lot.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> The indie adventure series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkFall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkFall">Dark Fall</a></em> has several examples:
<ul><li> Play enough of the series, and you'll get really sick of the oft-reused "over here!" ghost-voice soundclip used in every game.

</li><li> Due to an oversight in the game engine, some sounds will often play <em>every time</em> you pass certain screens. One of the most grating examples includes a short violin tune, which plays at several points in Fetch Rock lighthouse.
</li><li> Many players will be quick to notice how repetitive the dialogue can get in the third game <em>Lost Souls</em>, especially with Matilda Fly.

The repeated sound byte of his catchphrase "Want some rye? 'Course ya do!" greatly annoyed many players.

This leads to things like hearing all of your pawns simultaneously telling you what the pawn guild is when you enter it to hire pawns... then hearing them <em>and</em> your new pawns explaining it to you <em>again</em> immediately after you finish hiring more pawns.
</li><li> Averted due to the game being canceled, but the Tohunga/Matoran noises from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bionicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bionicle">BIONICLE</a>: Legend of Mata Nui</em> beta versions are this. It's synthesized gibberish, and while the regular speech may sound fine, or even cute, it's the inappropriately random, high-pitched screeches that get on your nerves.
</li><li> Leia's damage noise in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperStarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperStarWars">Super Star Wars</a>: Return of the Jedi</em>, which sounds like "ah".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EccoTheDolphin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EccoTheDolphin">Ecco the Dolphin</a></em>:
<ul><li> The sudden loud whirring,growling noise that begins when Ecco jumps high and triggers the Vortex feeding sequence that sucks up his pod and starts the game. Can easily startle unwary players.
</li><li> The high pitched "BOKKKKK" that plays when Ecco gets hit by an enemy is a close second.
</li><li> The damage and death noises for the eponymous character. Not just annoying, but very unnerving as well when you run into a spiky shell and get stuck while you're traversing dark, scary tunnels possibly miles away from the surface of the ocean, with a limited air supply and scary-ass sharks tailing you.
</li></ul></li><li> Unlike in the first installment of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Drakengard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Drakengard">Drakengard</a></em> (for obvious reasons, as Caim lost the ability to speak), Nowe calls out, ?LEGNA!? whenever you switch to Legna during ground missions in <em>Drakengard 2</em>. This can get very irritating when there's a lot of switching involved (such as to defeat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats">archers</a> or monsters immune to Legna's attacks). Also, there's the noises that Yaha's gnomes make when you attack them in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a> battle. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiKhReHpD_E">Watch.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> Any time Hermione reminds you of something in any of the games. Sometimes Ron, and occasionally Harry, will make a particularly stupid remark. But mostly Hermione. In game 5, her constant reminders you have a task to do for another student make you want to levitate benches and hit her with them. Oddly enough, you can do that.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrisonerOfAzkaban" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrisonerOfAzkaban">Prisoner Of Azkaban</a></em>: Forget about exploring. Even after you complete a mission, every minute Ron and Hermione are going to tell you, "I'm RREEEEAALLLY tired." You'd think they'd suffer some kind of massive separation anxiety if they WENT BACK TO GRYFFINDOR ALONE.
</li><li> Lego Harry Potter can be pretty annoying as well. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPCs</a> like to greet you as you walk past, but since everyone in that game is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakingSimlish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakingSimlish">Speaking Simlish</a>, it amounts to them all waving and making a high pitched noise that sounds vaguely like "Hi". Walking past fifty of these guys in a row can be downright painful. Malfoy and his cronies are even worse. They mock Harry as his walks by, but mocking consists of making a face and shouting "BEEEEHHHHN!" Repeatedly. Until you go mad. This is also in other Lego games as well.
</li><li> The mandrakes in the Lego Harry Potter games can also be this solely because they don't stop their high pitches screaming until you put them inside a pot. This is particularly annoying if you can't actually find the pot or it's hidden because as soon as one of the characters gets near it or picks it up, they suddenly walk with all the speed of an arthritic senior citizen so you have to continue to suffer the screaming for another five minutes until you get the mandrake across the room.

And the game doesn't even have a voice chip. If you ever play this game, you'd know that this is THE most annoying sound in video game history. The music notes hurt you, and your ears, and you can't even put her out of her misery. However, you <em>can</em> pay her to shut up if you have enough money, which softens the blow a bit.

Though it might make some thugs pick a fight with you.

<div class="indent"> <strong>(CRASH!)</strong> "Are you all right?"
</div></li><li> The crew chief in <em>Daytona USA 2</em> will <em>always</em> complain whenever you drift. This means you'll hear either "You're burning out the tires!", "Careful!

<ul><li> From <em>R4: Ridge Racer Type 4</em>, two of these announcer clips will very much hammer themselves into your head very fast if you play Time Trial:
<div class="indent"> <em>(when beating a section record)</em> "Sweet! You really ripped through that section!" <br><em>(when failing to beat a section record)</em> "MY GRANDMA DRIVES FASTER THAN THAT! GET WITH THE PROGRAM!"
</div></li><li> The announcer in <em>V</em> never shuts up. He talks when you overtake an enemy. He talks when an enemy overtakes YOU. He talks when you collide with an enemy. EVEN WHEN NOTHING IS HAPPENING, HE WILL COMMENTATE ON THE WEATHER OR THE ENGINE SOUNDS.

<ul><li> Each character had one thing to say when attempting a repair, and then another thing a second later as it repairs. Anakin's were "C'mon, c'mon, c'mon Work!" and "It's working...it's working!", said in the most annoying way possible. Again, and again, and again.
</li><li> Everything Anakin said at any point in the game. Of course, he'll be the character most people chose outright, as Sebulba couldn't be unlocked until the end of the game. Even winning was painful.

</li><li> <em>Double Dash</em> has several of these when you swap driver and passenger/weapons person. Perhaps the most annoying is Princess Daisy yelling "HI! I'M DAISY!" in a <em>very</em> grating voice. We KNOW your name is Daisy!
<ul><li> Not to mention her rather loud scream when you hit her with an item. God help you if you choose to put her on your team. Thankfully this problem was fixed in future installments, but it still tends to pop up in other Mario games too, such as the <em>Mario and Sonic</em> series and other Mario sports titles.
</li><li> This can also be forced by the player - <em>constantly</em> swapping between racers. This is especially bad if it's. for example, Daisy and Peach because then you get "HI I'M DAISY-Peach! HI I'M DAISY-Peach! HI I'M DAISY-Peach!"
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Mario Kart Wii</em>:
<ul><li> Warning sirens when a homing item or a powered up driver is coming up behind you. It's irritating when either one has not passed you and the sound JUST WON'T STOP. Made even worse if there is lag in online play. But controller-snapping frustration ensues&mdash;for entirely different reasons&mdash;when you're in first, and someone fires a blue shell&mdash;<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">and just after it's fired, someone passes you</a>...
</li><li> The voices for the Mii drivers. Full stop. Compounding it is that, not only is there a different voice for each kind of trick, falling off a cliff, etc., but a different set of voices for <em>each of the three weight classes</em>. Why the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundEffectBleep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundEffectBleep">[DATA EXPUNGED]</a> did they have to do that? The Medium weight class voice sounds like an 8-bit-to-32-bit <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/YouTubePoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/YouTubePoop">YouTube Poop</a></em>-distorted voice sampling of Miyamoto on helium. The voices for Small and Larger classes are even worse.
</li><li> The larger weight classes tend to sound like a real person on valium. They barely emote at all, so it sounds almost like they're mocking you somehow. "Wahaaa. Yaaaah."
</li><li> Any and all of Funky Kong's, Daisy's, or Baby Daisy's voices. To add insult in injury, they're the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBalance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBalance">most used</a> characters in the game.
</li></ul></li><li> And then there's the Mii voices from <em>7</em>, dear God..."YEP YO! YEP YO! YEP YO! YEP YO! YEP YO! YEP YO!

</li><li> <em>Mario Kart 7</em> and <em>Mario Kart 8</em> made Rosalina this, due to her newer Peach like voice in both games being much higher pitched than her original voice used in Wii. To make matters worse, <em>8</em> introduces Baby Rosalina, resulting in maximum annoyance.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakAndDaxter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakAndDaxter">Jak and Daxter</a> X</em>, there is one race where your weapons are disabled. The first weapon pickup you gather, which you will be stuck with for the entire race since it can't be used, will nearly always be the seeker missiles, which will drive you crazy by locking on to every car to ever overtake you with a "bweep" noise. It's okay in normal racing, since that's the cue to press fire, but when you can't shoot, it just gets really irritating in moments and stays that way for the rest of the race.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiddyKongRacing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiddyKongRacing">Diddy Kong Racing</a></em>, if you wind up in the wrong way, TT will repeatedly pester you by saying <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlXSGtGEL00">"No no no! Wrong way!"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> until you adjust yourself again.
<ul><li> TT's voice in general. At least, to some.
</li></ul></li><li> The sound of your car exploding in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SanFranciscoRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SanFranciscoRush">San Francisco Rush</a></em>. Expect to hear it a lot if you attempt shortcuts.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashTeamRacing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashTeamRacing">Crash Nitro Kart</a></em>, Crash himself has an obnoxiously high pitched voice that sounds nothing like he normally does, and would you believe <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveBlum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveBlum">STEVE F**KING BLUM</a></em> of all people voiced him?! As divisive as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RadicalEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RadicalEntertainment">Radical Entertainment</a> titles could be at times, they at least gave Crash a somewhat tolerable voice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Quarantine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Quarantine">Quarantine</a></em> has the loud, shrill screams of pedestrians being mowed down by cars. Traffic in Kemo City being heavy and human life being cheap, these are heard <em>over</em> and <em>over</em> and <em>over</em> and <em>over</em>, all the time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChaseHQ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChaseHQ">Super Chase: Criminal Termination</a></em>: "This is Nancy! They're moving very fast! Over and out!" Expect to hear that every few minutes when the chase lasts too long.

</li><li> <em>Bigfoot</em> on the NES has several sounds that will get on the player's nerves: the invincibility power-up, when activated, plays a siren-like bloop every second. The other one is the buzzsaw power-up that makes a buzzing sound effect while it's active.

It was present around Real Bout Special and KOF 97, but was nowhere near as prevelant until 99 up to 2002, where SNK decided to make said grunt <em>his KO cry as well</em>. Yes, as well. Its even more aggravating in 2002 where all the damn time, hitting Andy will make him go "OOOOOOOUUUUUAAAAAAGH" and as mentioned before, he goes "OOOOOOOUUUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAGH" when you KO him. For cripes sakes man, you're getting your ass handed to you, at least show more emotion than "OOOOOOOOUUUUUUUAAAAAAAGH"!
</li></ul></dd></dl><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters">The King of Fighters</a></em>:

</li><li> "KOKO DESU KA? KOKO DESU KA? KOKO DESU KA? KOKO DESU KA? KOKO DESU KA? KOKO DESU KA? KOKO DESU KA? KOKO DESU KA?" Gee, thanks Goenitz. Thanks for adding some annoying sounds to your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Bossness</a>.
</li><li> It's better against players because they know better than to spam the move, but dammit, Whip, stop doing your air lift so much. "AAAAHHHHHHHHHH! AAAAHHHHHHHHHH!"
</li><li> Angel changed voice actresses from her first appearance, with her newer actress providing a very high-pitched performance. It's so high that the audio sometimes clips when she says certain phrases.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em>:
<ul><li> Almost all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks">called attacks</a>, resulting in infinite repetition of "piii-KA!" "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">FAL-cone PAOUNCH!</a>" and "PK Fire!", especially if the player is spamming those moves.
</li><li> No one who's played either the Japanese or European version of Brawl can leave it at this. Pit's Angel Ring (forward-B) attack is accompanied by the most annoying yipping imaginable. Its removal is easily the best change made for the American market.
<ul><li> Not that "HAIYAYAYAH!" is much better, particularly given that it accompanies one of the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpamAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpamAttack">spammable attacks</a> in the game. Good thing it's only in Brawl, since 3DS/Wii U gave Pit a slight grunting sound making it much less annoying.
</li></ul></li><li> Lucas and Ness's battle cries get annoying, especially since they're rather unintelligible.
<ul><li> In <em>Ultimate</em> it gets worse, PK Fire becomes very spammable among players to get hit and became the bane of any online player who will fight Ness. It gets <strong>SOOOOOO</strong> annoying to have a small kid spouting this while you burn and the Ness player taunts you endlessly. This became the unholy reason why players will strangle Ness in the worse ways possible.
</li><li> To a lesser extent; <strong>PK FREEZE!</strong> Not only did <em>Ultimate</em> buffs it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack">That One Attack</a> where it sends you to the side unlike previously where you get launched upward making it a very kill potent move. But it has become a very spam attack from Lucas, have fun trying to deal with Lucas.
</li></ul></li><li> In Melee's Event Match 9: Hide 'n' Sheik, the Zelda/Sheik transformation noise qualifies.
</li><li> Repeated <em><strong>endlessly</strong></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">"YOU'RE TOO SLOW!"</a> It's in Brawl only as 3DS/Wii U gives us "SONIC SPEED!"
</li><li> Then there is Ike's "Moot!" accompanying some of his smashes. Not much more than funny until you go "Against anyone" online, where every second character is Ike, and every second move is a smash.
</li><li> Kirby has many, most notably his taunt "HIIIIIIIII!" (toned down in <em>Brawl</em> and more so in <em>3DS/Wii U</em>), because he would usually try to imitate a characters voice when copying their moves.
</li><li> Yoshi has a very, very useful near-invincible-when-you-use-it Yoshi Bomb. To use it, you jump to directly above your opponent as high as you can and press down B. HUP/HARUMMMM/BOING HA!
</li><li> Here's an experiment. Get four friends and all play as Pikachu. Then try not to scream if you hear the word "Pika!"
</li><li> "WATCH THE POWER OF AURA." Sounds good, but do you have to announce it EVERYTIME?
</li><li> Lucario's grunts and "ruahs" provided by Bill Rogers are annoying in general. Though in 3DS/Wii U onward, Sean Schemmel's portrayal is a bit more manageable
</li><li> The gulp/restore noise when characters eat food. The worst part? Food usually comes in numbers, and in competitions you need to eat it quickly, resulting in an extremely annoying <strong>GULPGULPGULPGULPGULPGULP</strong>
</li><li> It's even worse when Snake does it. Apparently, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidHayter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidHayter">David Hayter</a> thought it would be a good idea to have Snake go "Mmmarrf", "Gooood", or "Taastyy" every time he ate something. Nice going&#133;
</li><li> Wario makes similar noises when he eats items in general, but none can compare to his "OMMMMMMMM! MMMM-PHMMMM!" that he makes when he eats his own motorcycle. Be prepared to hear this noise many times when playing with a friend using Wario, especially if they're the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">kind of person who enjoys doing this intentionally just to piss you off</a>.
</li><li> Captain Falcon's "Show me your moves" taunt comes out faster when his back is turned, making it more easily spammed.
</li><li> If you hang around the <em>Melee</em> tournament scene long enough, the Final Destination music becomes this <em>very quickly.</em>
</li><li> There's nothing worse than throwing a Pok&eacute; Ball&#133;and hearing either "Goldeen, Goldeen" or "MUNCHLAX!"
</li><li> Toon Link and Young Link have annoying, high-pitched voices in general, especially with their up special spin attacks.
</li><li> A player can easily spam Peach's taunt. "Sah-WEET!" in Melee, and "La-lala-lala-la&#133;" in Brawl.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2syJsFEcnXo">"OOH-WUH, OOH-WUH, PAH-PAH-PAH! OOH-WUH, OOH-WUH, PAH-PAH-PAH! OOH-WUH, OOH-WUH, PAH-PAH-PAH!<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Good thing it's gone since 3DS/Wii U.
</li><li> No four words are as likely to tick off a <em>3DS / Wii U</em> player than Shulk's "I'M REALLY FEELING IT!" Yes, it had its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HamAndCheese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HamAndCheese">deliberate</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarmCharm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarmCharm">Narm Charm</a> the first time it was heard, which brought it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a> status fairly quickly. And then after the game actually came out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedMeme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedMeme">it became widely reviled in record time</a> due to younger players <em>constantly</em> spamming that taunt. "Now it's Shulk time" is <em>also</em> generally considered annoying, but not <em>nearly</em> to the same extent.
</li><li> Rosalina's constant gasps, moans, cries and exclamations that accompany her attacks can become this, especially due to how advantageous she is against most of the cast, how frequently she vocalizes, and how frequently her attacks are repeated. Diddy Kong was in a similar boat prior to the 1.0.6 patch (and may still be), as his infamous, overpowered and spammable "hoo-hah" combo was accompanied by the most annoying chimpanzee screeching imaginable.
</li><li> Bayonetta's scream when she&#146;s launched. AAAAAAHHH!!!
</li><li> Greninja's Final Smash has the frog yelling "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokemonSpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokemonSpeak">JAHJAHJAHJAHJAHJAHJAHJAHJAHJAHJAHJAHJAH&#133; JAH!</a>" for several seconds in a high-pitched, nasally voice.
</li><li> If you come across a Mr. Game &amp; Watch player in <em>3DS / Wii U</em>, nine times out of ten that character is only chosen for his crouching sound effect. As if being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsportsmanlikeGloating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsportsmanlikeGloating">teabagged</a> wasn't bad enough, the constant "Qua-Ah-Qua-Ah-Qua-Ah-Qua-Ah" outright sounds like he's <strong>laughing</strong> at you while he pretends to rape your face.
</li><li> We also have the Assist Trophy Phosphora from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarusUprising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarusUprising">Kid Icarus: Uprising</a></em>. If you're not the one who called her, then her iconic "Yes, you called?" is not something that you want to hear.
</li><li> While the yipping of a puppy may be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MostWonderfulSound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MostWonderfulSound">Most Wonderful Sound</a> in real life, when it's coming from the Nintendog assist in either <em>Brawl</em> or <em>4</em>, it'll get on your last nerve as it means <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew">the screen is about to be covered up for a good ten seconds</a>. Bonus points if you're playing against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">the computer</a>.
</li><li> Pichu, <strong>FULL STOP.</strong> If Diddy's monkey screeches wasn't bad enough, then Pichu's high pitch squeaks and squeals can make any player rage at this annoying small rodent. Adding salt to the wound is that Pichu in Ultimate is top tier so god help you if you're sane enough to listen to <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokemonSpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokemonSpeak">PICHUPICHUPICHU!!!!</a></strong> All the freaking time. It's no wonder why players called it the new incarnation of <em>3DS/Wii U</em> Diddy Kong.
</li><li> Roy's Star KO scream in <em>Ultimate</em> is a mixture of this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a>, as it sounds so blood-curdlingly realistic that it's practically jarring when juxtaposed against the more cartoonish atsthetics of the game. The fact that Roy is frequently used online only amplifies the annoyance.
</li><li> Memetic as it is, Ganondorf in Ultimate whenever he does his Forward Smash can get really make people angry quickly due to its Noob killer potential. Not helping that anyone who'll fight him will spam the living daylights out of it.
</li><li> Facing Jigglypuff or Luigi that manages to hit you with the Rest or Super Jump Punch multiple times <strong>will</strong> make you hate the "ping" sound especially if it kills you, the CPU in particular loves to troll will these moves on 3 to 8 player matches.

</li><li> A glitch in Pauper's Drop will cause the Big Sister battle music to play throughout the whole level if the game is saved and loaded after beating the Big Sister. This gets irritating <em>very</em> quickly, but was unfortunately never patched even in the remastered version, meaning you either have to mute the music in the audio settings or just deal with it.

</li><li> Death screams were also another "popular" vocal bind people used so you could get games where people would do nothing but make their character scream for the entire game. If you had subtitles on, you would probably see nothing but [Death Scream] and [Death Rattle] a <em>lot</em>.
</li><li> Of course, spamming voice commands online, key binds or not, will quickly get everyone annoyed at you to the point where they will vote you out, or kill you THEN kick you out.
</li><li> It seems Valve has heard everyone complaining about the vocal spamming, so an update for Left 4 Dead 2 disables custom voice binds so now the spamming has been cut back a lot. Oddly, they didn't do the same for the first game.
</li><li> Regardless of the fix, most people are content with just spamming default vocal binds, most notably the "Laugh" command.
</li><li> The Special Infected can get annoying as well. Especially the Hunter and the Jockey if they're pounce crazy. <strong>"ARRAAAAAAAGH, AYAAAAGH, AYAAAAG-ARF!, ARRAAAAAAAGH."</strong> The Left 4 Dead wiki actually lists continuous Hunter pouncing as a viable distraction tactic in Versus mode to make people waste ammo on you, presumably out of desperation to shut you up.
</li><li> The Witch crying. Playing this game with anyone else in the same room is going to beg you to startle it. Plus the creepy music that plays along with it.
</li><li> The gurgling of a Boomer. For such a fat blob it does a really good job hiding and running, so you'll run into an area hearing its guttural noises and not being able to see the thing, knowing it could lumber out in front of you any second and puke all over you and your entire team. Have fun with that.
</li><li> The Jockey is even worse, as its mad laughter that signifies it's around while you try to scout where it could be hiding before it leaps on you and steers you, laughing even more.

<ul><li> The series gets a strange overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MostWonderfulSound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MostWonderfulSound">Most Wonderful Sound</a> in this trope: that distinctive humming sound the powerups make. Wonderful, because, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">they're powerups</a>; annoying, because some of the more deviously hidden ones can take seemingly forever to get, and the hum never stops. The silence after the Item Grab jingle qualifies for Wonderful on its own&#133;
</li><li> Played straight with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM">Metroid: Other M</a></em> which replaced it with an irritating techno beat. Some reviewers noted that they specifically started avoiding energy tanks because of it.

Get used to it; once it starts, it <em>never, ever stops</em> until you trigger the cutscene that leads to the finale. Woe be those who are going for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>, because they'll be spending a lot of time grabbing stuff they couldn't get to before Samus had her full ability loadout.
</li><li> In the same game, the noise Samus makes when she gets hurt. Too much of that and you'll be praying for a game over.
</li><li> The Ice Beam in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid">Super Metroid</a></em> is one of the more useful powerups, as it freezes enemies and gives a substantial damage boost. However, firing it makes an incredibly irritating chiming noise and since you'll be gimping yourself if you DON'T use it&#133;
</li><li> The sound of the various visors in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em>. As if the eye-searing Thermal Visor wasn't bad enough, activating it makes a constant 'wyut-woh-weet-weet-wah' sound. The X-Ray Visor isn't as bad, but 'broodroobroodroo' will get irritating eventually.
</li></ul></li><li> Most of the announcer's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment">announcements</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Unreal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Unreal">Unreal</a></em> series.

Even his countdowns are shouted at the top of his lungs. And that comes before the annoyingness during the character selection screen. Whereas every other game, <em>including the PS2 version of UT</em>, if they announced a character's name at all, would do so after the selection phase, UT2003 would announce them as you scrolled over them <em>during</em> selection, as a result there's a lot of names whose announcement hasn't finished grating everyone's ears, and unlike the in-game announcements, <em>those couldn't be disabled</em>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6509y');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6509y" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6509y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">That said, the way he would announce "MMMMMMMMMMISTER CROW!" became enough of a meme that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedMeme">he's the only character whose name is still announced when you select him</a> in <em>2004</em>.</span> Fortunately, there are options to make it less annoying, including a more subdued announcer, a calm female announcer, and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament2004" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament2004">UT2004</a></em> the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament">UT99</a></em> announcer... or another female announcer who is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrgasmicCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrgasmicCombat">turned on</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournamentIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournamentIII">Unreal Tournament III</a></em> sits itself on the fence here, featuring a calm female voice for announcements that affect all players and the male announcer for things that concern the player (eg. "Head shot!")
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em>, when you get the H.E.V. suit:

</li><li> Sven Co-op makes this even worse, as you can hear this up to <em>32 times at once</em>, once for every player currently connected, making it deafeningly loud and completely incomprehensible. Fortunately, changing maps in the <em>Source</em> rerelease of the game causes the clip to immediately end.
</li><li> The armed human NPCs in the sequel. "Don't forget to reload, Dr. Freeman!" is a prime offender.

<ul><li> Whenever you score a hit, the game produces a completely absurd clown nose honk. Also, whenever you shoot a teammate in teamplay, your enemy, regardless of gender, produce a weird barking sound. "BOK-BOK-B-BOK" indeed.'
</li><li> And to this day, someone always makes a mod that will add <em>all of this</em> into the current <em>Unreal Tournament</em> for some godawful reason. "Hey, this looks like a nice server, good number of people and a decent ping and... OH GOD MY EARS WHY DOES IT SOUND LIKE QUAKE."
</li></ul></li><li> You think it's bad in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament">Unreal Tournament</a></em>, for some inexplicable reason, people consistently port all of that <em>and all the UT announcer clips</em> to any shooter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ValveSoftware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ValveSoftware">Valve Software</a> makes, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CounterStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CounterStrike">Counter-Strike</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>, and most baffling of all, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a></em>. As "Reloading!" if it "Reloading!" wasn't "Reloading!" bad "BOOMER!!!" enough.
</li><li> Every single enemy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplinterCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplinterCell">Splinter Cell</a> Conviction</em>: "You can't hide forever Fisher!". Maybe they should consider battling stealth with stealth.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> Voice emotes are, unfortunately, very spammable. Prepare of lots of <em>Medic!</em> calls even if the player only lost a few hitpoints. (Fortunately, every class has at least 3 different voice clips for calling for Medic so you don't get too annoyed with the repetition).
</li><li> The default key to call for Medic is E, normally the "Use" key in Source engine games. It's probably the easiest key to press in the WASD setup, and as such, the easiest key to hit by accident, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory">especially when you think you need to press a button to use something</a>. Or were trying to reload (the R key).
</li><li> Most things the Scout says will get on your nerves, since that's part of his "charm". "BONK!" "BOINK!" One that went particularly memetic is his "Need a dispenser here!" which led to the stereotype of Scouts doing nothing but screaming at Engineers to build dispensers.
</li><li> "Spah sappin' mah {teleporter|sentry|dispenser}!" comes up a lot if the enemy have a spy who's well disguised but bad at killing Engineers.
</li><li> The Announcer gets annoying as well, especially if there's a team who's constantly making it to a capture point and being stopped. "Alert. Alert! Alert! Alert&#133;" This also happens if the intelligence is being constantly passed off, with the Announcer telling you every damn time that it hits the floor. And, for about one day, the King of the Hill maps all had the announcer calling "Overtime!" <em>during</em> overtime, <em>whenever the point was stepped on or off of.</em> How Valve managed to miss such an obvious bug is a mystery for the ages, but it's worth mentioning that they <em>added an server option to leave it broken.</em> On another note, somebody modded their game to replace the two alternating "Overtime!" lines with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">"Lisa needs braces!" and "Dental plan!"</a>, which is just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/MadeOfWin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/MadeOfWin">Made of Win</a>.
</li><li> The Buff Banner has a different bugle call for each team. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellIsThatNoise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellIsThatNoise">You'll quickly fear and hate to hear the enemy bugle</a> because it's always followed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">a barrage of crit bullets and rockets</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">"I AM ON FIRE!"</a> and its variations.
</li><li> The Frying Pan. It makes a loud, obnoxious clanging sound when used to hit an enemy. This wasn't a problem when only the Soldier and the Demoman (who have relatively slow melee attacks) could use it, but when Valve changed it so that every class could use it, it immediately became the Scout's most annoying weapon, even worse than his baseball bat.
</li><li> And now on Mann versus Machine, the sound of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb">Sentry Busters</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellIsThatNoise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellIsThatNoise">will haunt your nightmares forever</a>, especially if you are an Engineer.
<ul><li> The Announcer's, well, announcements that a Sentry Buster is on the way count too, because if one's time on the field ends in any way other than exploding and taking your Sentry with it, <em>another one will <strong>immediately</strong> spawn in to finish the job</em>. If not for all the other useful stuff Engineers build it wouldn't be worth playing as one in this mode, because you spend approximately half of every wave moving your Sentry away from or focusing its fire on Sentry Busters.
</li><li> Also from Mann versus Machine: "ANOTHER ENGINEER BOT HAS APPEARED!"
</li></ul></li><li> Another annoying spam is where you and a friend on the same team capture the enemy intel, stand next to each other, spam "l" (The default key to drop the intel) resulting in the announcer spamming "We-we-we-we-we-we-we-we-we-we-we-we" (she's trying to say "we have taken the enemy intelligence").
</li><li> When the "Raid Boss" <strong>Merasmus</strong> was first introduced, he only had one voice clip for his primary magic attack: <strong>"Mortis LongDISSSStimus!!!"</strong> And if there were enough players crowding around him (there always were) you could expect to hear this once every second. Thankfully, Valve added five more voice clips for this attack 24 hours later.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkForcesSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkForcesSaga">Dark Forces Saga</a></em>:
<ul><li> Speaking of spamming voice chat, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediKnightJediAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediKnightJediAcademy">Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy</a></em>'s multiplayer voice chat has many long, annoying commands that are easy to bind to any key. "They've got air support" gets really old, really fast. Especially when the enemy never actually <em>has</em> air support, which questions the very existence of the command.
</li><li> The standard "get over here" taunt in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediKnightIIJediOutcast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediKnightIIJediOutcast">Jedi Outcast</a></em> and <em>Jedi Academy</em> is accompanied by a sound clip that's unique for each character. And almost all of them are taken out of context from singleplayer, with no thought given to how long the animation plays. Take Luke, for example: "I'm saying that I want you to l-I'm saying that I want you to l-I'm saying that I want you to l-I'm saying that I want you to l-I'm saying that I want you to l-I'm saying that I want you to l-". When the bad guys' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh">Evil Laugh</a>, even spammed, is <em>less</em> annoying than what the good guys are saying, there's definitely something wrong.

Who constantly chant one pseudo-Chinese line, very loudly, in an incredibly annoying squeaky voice. "Yayamyow-myow! Yayamyow-myow! Yayamyow-myow!"
</li><li> The Cultists in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Blood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Blood">Blood</a></em> constantly yell chants in their evil language, forcing you to endure a chorus of things like "CRUDUX CRUO!!" and "BHUUESCO MARANA!!" in the same shrieking, high-pitched voice until you kill them. This is balanced, however, by their girlish, undignified death cries and character-breaking English screams of "IT BURNS, IT BURNS!!" when set on fire, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MostWonderfulSound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MostWonderfulSound">both of which are immensely satisfying</a>.
</li><li> <em>Blood II: The Chosen</em>:
<ul><li> The Fanatics' ridiculous sore-throated voice. "YOU WILL DIE A SLOW, SLOW DEATH! YOU WILL DIE A SLOW, SLOW DEATH! Come out, we won't hurt you! YOU WILL DIE A SLOW, SLOW DEATH!"
</li><li> That's not even getting into the innocents' two whole sound bytes for each gender, repeated endlessly from the very instant any of them are made aware of the fact that you do in fact plan to make use of the weapons you have on your person. From women alone: "No no no! Don't shoot me-No no no! Don't shoot me! Please, spare my life! Please, spare my life-No no no! Don't shoot me!" Thankfully, killing them not only shuts them up, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">but usually drops health pickups as well.</a>

<ul><li> The Bane, a cursed sub-machine gun you get at the end of a quest, is a rare example where this trope is completely intentional. It's "cursed" for a reason: not because it has horrendously high recoil that makes it almost impossible to hit anything, not because it slows your movement speed to a crawl when you're using it, but because its reload and weapon switch animations are accompanied by an obnoxious high-pitched voice shrieking things like "REEELOADIN'!" and "SWAPPIN' WEAPONS!" It also <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eF1k7I5pH-Q">has a firing sound that is a chorus of extremely incoherent rednecks laughing and shouting YEAH.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. Even the in-game subtitles label it as (annoying sound) whenever you pull the trigger. It also happens to be the only sound effect that the game's options won't let you mute.
</li><li> Invoked with the Morningstar, which is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SniperRifle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SniperRifle">Sniper Rifle</a> that parodies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard">You Bastard!</a> tropes: it tries to guilt-trip you for shooting crazed psychopaths in an incredibly whiny voice.
</li><li> Any of the NPC's inexplicably knocking on walls in Sanctuary. It gets annoying quite quickly. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">Gearbox later mocked this in Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep</a>; NPCs in Flamerock Refuge may mention that their favorite thing about the village is the lack of knocking.
</li><li> Marcus' vending machine messages are funny at first, but once they start repeating, hearing him ask "Ever feel overburdened by money?" every time you need to restock on shotgun ammo gets kinda hold.
</li><li> Any time you fail to complete a mission objective (such as killing enemies with fire damage only) on the first try, the quest giver will chime in to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingVideoGameHelper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingVideoGameHelper">remind you of what you need to do.</a> As some of these objectives can be tricky and easy to accidentally get wrong, this becomes annoying fast. Particular honour goes to Dr. Spara from <em>The Pre-Sequel!:</em> 'YOU GOTTA CRIT 'EM TO GET THE BRAIN!' 'YOU GOTTA CRIT 'EM TO GET THE BRAIN!' ' YOU GOTTA -' <em>Alright, we get it!</em>
</li><li> Lilith, who for most of the game has the perfectly lovely voice of Coleen Clinkenbeard, suddenly becomes a shrieking harpy with a voice like nails on a chalkboard for the final battle. Made worse that she only has <em>two</em> lines that she repeats every 30 seconds: "LOOK OUT! THE LAVA'S RISIIIIINNGGGGG!" and "THE LAVA'S RISING, GET TO HIGH GROUND!"
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mercenaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mercenaries">Mercenaries</a></em> has "They saw you that's not good Buford doesn't want anyone to see who's freeing his spies" or any stealth variation since it's hard as hell to sneak onto anywhere with no radar to tell you where your enemies are.
</li><li> If laser tag systems count, the packs of the popular European system <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lasermaxx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lasermaxx">Lasermaxx</a></em> constantly say "Don't give up" when a player is deactivated.

Go get it!" line comes to mind. Others include the "Awesome! It's printing away <em>niiice</em> and steady again!" line from the Counterfeit heist (plays when the counterfeiting operation gets restarted) and "Get da fuck up!", said by Houston, Chains, and others when trying to revive someone via Inspire. Not to mention the annoying beeping all drills makes after inevitably breaking down. There have actually been mods dedicated to toning down Bane's incessant yammering, and the devs themselves have poked fun at it as well, such as Hoxton sometimes stating during his breakout that one thing he <em>doesn't</em> miss is Bain's constant "yapping like a needy dog".

Even a great song becomes insufferable if you've heard it a hundred times already.
</li><li> The last level of <em>Rambo: The Video Game</em> has "Captain" enemies who, until you kill them, will increase the fire rate and damage levels of any other enemies that happen to be nearby. Their presence is indicated by having the sound clip "Fight harder comrades! He's a man, not a god!" repeated every couple of seconds until you kill them. It's certainly an incentive to kill the Captains quicker... if not for the fact that emerging from cover for even slightly too long will result in Rambo getting totally slaughtered.

<ul><li> That shrill, constant <strong>BEEP-BEEP</strong> when a unit is under attack gets <em>really</em> annoying, especially if the source of damage is from an enemy pilot that had been ejected. The second game isn't as bad as it's less ear grating and has a bigger delay between the beeps. There is a workshop mod that makes it quieter though.
</li><li> Having to build multiple ammo/health/weapon power-ups from the armory to assist you outside the base or in general results in some serious radio spam of "Ready to build. Building supplies. Ammo/Repair/Weapon deployed.". Over and over.
<ul><li> Radio chatter stacking in general, especially if you give multiple orders to multiple units. The loud static each time the channel opens and closes does not help matters. Fortunately, the best way to fix these instances where it would otherwise a few minutes to clear out is to simply save then reload from that save and it resets the audio.
</li></ul></li><li> The thundering noises of a walker feel way too loud (ironic, considering Activision got it right with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MechWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MechWarrior">MechWarrior</a> 2</em>'s step sounds).

<ul><li> Users can create their own "gestures" for their avatars that can be accompanied by an audio clip. Some of these audio clips become extremely common and overused. Ones is a child saying "lol" (triggered, of course, whenever the user types "lol"&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;which for some people has apparently become a form of punctuation used to indicate the end of a sentence), a sort of frantic chipmunk laughter, and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJqYc0Q6uOM">"let's do the fork in the garbage disposal!

</li><li> Of course the gesture/audio spamming falls flat since users can easily mute (block) people so they don't have to hear their spamming. Depending on what region you're in, admins can be so anal when it comes to gesture spamming that they will kick or ban people.

This sound is often a good 2-dozen decibels higher than your volume setting. and it keeps happening over and over every ten seconds until you cater to their every whim.

</li><li> The first games of the <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlecruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlecruiser">Battlecruiser</a></em> series had you as captain of the titular ship. Any command you'd give, all the crewmembers who had anything to do with it would report immediately and <em>speaking over each other</em>, which resulted in an uncomprehensible mess of voices. The worst of these would happen during high-speed jumps. As you had to jump <em>very often</em> in the game, that very quickly became old.

Some of what this latter voice says are warnings/advice ("Beware, falling objects", "Look out!", "You've got to move faster", and even "You've got to duck" despite the fact that your character can't duck) which may fall into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingVideoGameHelper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingVideoGameHelper">Annoying Video-Game Helper</a> territory, and the rest of what it says is outright mockery of your mistakes ("Did you mean to do that?", "Walked right into that one", "Harder than it looks, isn't it?", and "Great move, sport!").

<ul><li> Daisy. Every time you selected her in <em>8</em> and every time she got anything, she would yell "NEATO!" louder than any of the other characters' catchphrases.
<ul><li> Even more annoying is her catchphrase after she wins a minigame: "I'm a WINner!" Especially if she is one of your opponents, and you are losing.
</li></ul></li><li> Peach's victory quote from <em>5</em>: "Oh, did I <em>winnn?</em> [giggle]"
</li><li> Daisy will yell "THAT'S RIGHT!" after nearly everything she does in <em>DS</em>, including getting <em>three coins</em> from a common Blue Space.
<ul><li> Worse, after EACH mini-game win, EVERYONE but Yoshi will exclaim, "I'm the Superstar!" &mdash; despite the fact that you only become the "Superstar" when you win the whole main game, not when you win a single mini-game.

</li><li> The taunts.
<ul><li> <em>3</em> gave us Daisy's not very enthusiastic but somehow still annoying "Yahoo.", Waluigi's flat "Wa-ha-ha-ha." and Luigi's smarmy "Hahaha!"
</li><li> As the series progresses, the taunts become more and more annoying, evolving from the above to Mario's "Hey, stinky!" and Toadette's "MUSHROOM!" (from #7), just to name a few. Some are amusing when done once or twice, but they don't stay funny for long.
</li><li> <em>Mario Party 8</em>'s taunts are thankfully optional. However, if you bought the "heckling voices" from the shop, you would find that you cannot turn them off- and they are activated by shaking the Wii Remote. Unless you've got a <em>really</em> steady hand, making a new file might just be less stressful.

</li><li> Hunter pet's 'claw' sound "KCHSHSHSHSH" every few seconds... or constantly if there's multiple hunters with clawing pets. Makes you seriously consider never playing a melee again.
</li><li> Hunters (see the pattern here?) with guns, before <em>Warlords of Draenor</em>, which finally made the gunshot sounds much quieter. Before that, it was constant and distracting "BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!"

</li><li> The shouts of Suramar guards when you enter their detection radius("Who goes there?" "Something's not quite right." "An illusion! What are you hiding?"). Not helped by their obnoxious voice and limited repertoire of comments.
</li><li> In the "Beachhead" minigame, your goal is to shoot seagulls and crabs with a magical shell to allow the turtles to walk across the beach and reach the water. Once a turtle reaches the water, the questgiver will likely say "A turtle made it to the water!", and while it doesn't happen <em>every</em> time, you'll likely hear it a few times per game, enough to get tired of it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokOnline">Ragnarok Online</a></em>:
<ul><li> As in most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPG">RPGs</a>, it involves lots of killing the same monsters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">over</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops">over</a>, so the sounds of their attacks and death throes get to be <em>very</em> familiar.

</li><li> In Rachel Sanctuary are scores of Isillas, murderous cultists/undead clones of a woman who...something something, RO's never been big on plot. Despite this, when you kill one, the lingering rueful laughter isn't precisely annoying, but in fact very well done and affecting. Killing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyBearAsses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyBearAsses">thousands of them</a></em>, though, becomes completely unbearable, either through annoyance or sheer sadness.
</li><li> In addition, the creaking noise made by Greatest Generals when they're idle (they never move) gets really insufferable really fast. By the point they're not worth killing, you may start anyway just to shut them up. Another example, recognized in game, are Mukas.

In addition, these targets face inwards towards each other, so the ball will often bounce between each other repeatedly.

<ul><li> The titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MascotWithAttitude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MascotWithAttitude">Mascot with Attitude</a> had a <em>really bad habit</em> of saying very annoying, high-pitched, screechy, cheesy one-liners about 75% of the time when he killed an enemy, and <em>especially</em> when he took damage. Definitely one of the reasons why some people dislike the game. If there's any consolation, the voice acting can be turned off, so that the player wouldn't have to hear any of those hair-tearning quotes above.

<ul><li> Possibly justified: When Baby Mario is knocked off your back, the sounds he makes will make you want to tear your ears out, but this is incentive to get him back all the sooner, as he's your life bar. In an interview a few years later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShigeruMiyamoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShigeruMiyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> revealed that early testing had shown players leaving Baby Mario to cry while they did other stuff; apparently, the original crying sound <em>wasn't annoying enough</em>. It's worth noting that humans are hardwired to hate the sound of babies crying &mdash; it basically made sure prehistoric parents didn't do exactly what players did during testing and and let the baby starve to death (they might kill it themselves, if they were shitty parents, but for the most part, the genes that led to that tended to be self-culling). It's actually kind of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">Epic Fail</a> if they managed to find a "baby crying" sound humans could live with.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a> version replaces Baby Mario's stock crying sound with a more bearable one recorded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesMartinet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesMartinet">Charles Martinet</a>, but the original crying is still heard from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressedDude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressedDude">Baby Luigi</a> on the map screen.

</li><li> Back on the topic of Partners in Time, Mario's cry of "WHOA-AAAAHH!!" It occurs in <em>every cutscene</em>, even over the slightest catastrophe.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan">Mega Man</a></em> series has a few of these.
<ul><li> Most notably Wily UFO (and the UFO mook in Mega Man 9) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan1">Mega Man</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan2">Mega Man 2</a></em>, <em>9</em> and <em>10</em>.
</li><li> Or the life/ammo bar refilling "EEIEEIEEI" sound in NES Mega Man games, whether the bar belongs to you or the boss. The worst is in at least one of the earlier games where a W-Tank fills up all of your weapons <em>individually</em> instead of all at once, meaning the sound plays continuously for about ten seconds.
<ul><li> Nathaniel Hoover gave special mention to this very annoyance at the start of the <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCDL-6jflGg">Mega Man 5 - Bloopers, Awesome, and Fun Stuff<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>. 35 seconds of pure annoyance.
</li></ul></li><li> The sound of Mega Man charging his Mega Buster is a repeat offender.
<ul><li> The original Mega Buster charging sound constantly engulfed the whole sound channel which could be used for music instead.
</li><li> <em>Mega Man 7</em> replaced the classic sound with a high-pitched whistle that lingered for as long as you held the button.
</li><li> Thankfully, <em>Mega Man 8</em> gave us a break by giving the Mega Buster a lower-pitched droning sound...
</li><li> ...and then <em>Powered Up</em> gave it the most obnoxious charging sound EVER.
</li></ul></li><li> His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX">brother</a> started out with a tolerable charging sound on the SNES, but then the PS1 games replaced it with a high-pitched ringing sound. This became the <em>de facto</em> X-Buster charging sound for the rest of the <em>X</em> series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZero">Mega Man Zero</a></em>'s replacement sound was a welcome change at first, but it got old quick, too. YMMV on whether the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZX">Mega Man ZX</a></em> games reusing the sound counts as a blessing or not, given the track record so far...
</li><li> Anytime Mega Man says "Power Shot!" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan8">Mega Man 8</a></em>.

</li><li> <em>X4</em> has a few particularly annoying sounds. Zero constantly yelling out "YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, HUNH, YEAH, HUNH!" While wall climbing or jumping, and whatever X says while doing the same, something along the lines of "Hoap!, HEEP, HEEP, HEEP, Hoap! HEEP!".

</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaManMaverickHunterX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaManMaverickHunterX">Mega Man Maverick Hunter X</a></em> has a few of the series&#146; regular offenders, like X calling his attacks and charging his buster, and introduces a few new things to grate on your nerves while playing. The high-range synthesizers in some tracks sometimes spike into an awful high-pitched screech. Vile&#146;s soundtrack consists mostly of a single track filled with shrill electric guitar screams repeated <em>ad nauseum</em>. Chill Penguin and Sting Chameleon&#146;s voices are the exception to the game&#146;s otherwise-good voice acting, made worse by the noises they each make while doing anything in their respective boss battles.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManXCommandMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManXCommandMission">Mega Man X: Command Mission</a></em>, no enemy has their sound effects other than the robo-rabbits and helicopter-bots. When these enemies are on the battlefield, their SFX are far louder than they need to be, only encouraging the player to eliminate them as fast as possible to stop the sound.
</li><li> In the same game, toward the beginning (where all you have is a low-level X without many abilities), you'll quickly tire of him announcing "Charge shot!" every time you use his special ability. This eventually becomes somewhat more bearable; he never stops doing it, it's just that, later in the game, you'll have more things to do and, by extension, you'll be hearing less of it.
</li><li> Every time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZX">Mega Man ZX</a>'s Vent jumps he says "dick". Every time Ashe (from the sequel) jumps, she makes a grunting noise that sounds like she's on the receiving end. As one FAQ puts it: "Annoying Voice: LURRERE'S VOICE IS ANNOYING!!! AVOID IT BY TURNING YOUR VOLUME OFF OR RISK YOUR SANITY. Thank You."
<ul><li> Even worse is Aile's combo slash from <em>Advent</em>. YAH TEY TWAAAAA! YAH TEY TWAAAAA! YAH TEY TWAAAAA!
</li></ul></li><li> How about those <em>other</em> platforms throughout the <em>Mega Man</em> series? <em>DOOOOOO DOOOOOO DOOOOOO DOOOOOO</em>...

Imagine a high pitched whistle that played every second, and you get that.
</li><li> Since the PS1 games, it's become customary for Mega Man Classic, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManLegends">Volnutt</a>, and X to make a metallic <em>twank</em> noise with every step they take. This gets old the second any of them try to run. <em>TWANK-TWANK-TWANK-TWANK-TWANK-TWANK...</em>
<ul><li> Zero, Sigma, and most larger Reploids get a heavier <em>CRUNCH</em> sound. It's just as annoying.

While this is handy from the sense you'll likely never game over again, you also get the sound effect. You'll be hearing that sound effect a lot.

</li><li> Whenever Kirby takes damage in <em>Kirby's Dream Land 3</em>, an abrupt, irritatingly high pitched squeak is emitted. Combine this with very brief <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyInvincibility">Mercy Invincibility</a> allowing Kirby to get hit rapidly, and you'll start to wish Kirby had much less than ten hit points.

The worst they can do is irritate players by death by saying "nya-nya-nya-nya-nyah" over and over again.
<ul><li> The sound Duncan makes upon getting dizzy in the Genesis and CDi versions. It plays every time it happens, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKlutz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKlutz">happens a lot</a> and leaves him entirely defenseless for a while. The warbly sound he makes in this condition underscores the character's overall uselessness.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spelunker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spelunker">Spelunker</a></em> had at least two sounds that qualify&mdash;one for annoying players with its mocking regularity and the other for sheer ear-grating obnoxiousness. The former is the infamous Spelunker <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3cX6ow0OO0">death jingle<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, while the latter is the shrill and incessant <em>screek-screek-screek</em> of the bats, which plays constantly any time they're on screen. It's very tempting to waste one of your limited flares just to keep the little buggers quiet for a few seconds longer.
</li><li> Be prepared to hear <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Franklin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Franklin">Franklin</a>'s</em> "Hup! Hup! Hup!" jump sound many, <em>many</em> times when playing the games.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlyCooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlyCooper">Sly Cooper</a></em>: The tink-tink-tink-tink noise of the clue bottles. Even worse if you just can't seem to <em>find</em> the friggin' thing... or if you can see it but can't figure out how to get to it. Levels can be very dark, meaning sometimes you can't really see the platforms you need to get on to get the clue. Have fun figuring it out.
</li><li> Some people feel that the noises in place of voice acting or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceGrunting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceGrunting">Voice Grunting</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YookaLaylee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YookaLaylee">Yooka-Laylee</a></em> fits this trope - especially a few. Yooka's sounds like he's a cat hocking up a hairball, throwing up, or is getting punched in the stomach.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoy">Game Boy</a> port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>, like the above-mentioned <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion">Metroid Fusion</a></em> example, has only one song which plays in its final areas, and it gets annoying quickly because of how repetitive it is. The noise channel glitches when it loops, with loud percussion playing instead, making it more annoying.

<ul><li> In Diesel Dreaming, Mrs. Puff will constantly say "My goodness! You're becoming one of my best pupils." for nearly every accomplishment, even something as minor as pressing a button to activate a lift. It loses its luster after a while and gets really annoying.
</li><li> The ringing phone booths in Starfishman to the Rescue. Whenever you hear them, you know you have an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingVideoGameHelper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingVideoGameHelper">annoying</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskippableCutscene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskippableCutscene">unskippable</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedTutorial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedTutorial">tutorial</a> to sit through.

</li><li> Some reviews of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Pandemonium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Pandemonium">Pandemonium!</a></em> complained about the fact that whenever a jump is made, a spring-like sound is heard. Although it pales compared to something in the sequel, the Arab-like riff that plays upon losing a life - once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">the defeats keep piling up</a>, it gets <em>very</em> grating.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndlessRunningGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndlessRunningGame">Endless Running Game</a> <em>Meme Run</em> is full of obnoxious sound effects:
<ul><li> At times, the air horn effect (that also causes the screen to shake) plays as often as once every five seconds.
</li><li> The shrill, repeated "Oh baby a triple! Oh yeah!" that appears at random.
</li><li> Picking up the common 52% power-up will trigger loud, repetitive screams of "OH! OOH!", "OH MY GOD!" and "WHERE YOU AT?!"
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SheepDogNWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SheepDogNWolf">Sheep, Dog 'n' Wolf</a></em>: You'll probably want to avoid letting the remote controlled robot stand still while you're controlling it, exactly because of this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MilonsSecretCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MilonsSecretCastle">Milon's Secret Castle</a></em>: The sound when you get hurt can be more than a little maddening, especially when it's followed immediately by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a> music.

<ul><li> The sound that Vincent makes when he picks up some coins gets downright annoying because blocks carrying coins tend to be stacked right next to one another. This gets <em>really</em> annoying when a level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">has to be tried 20 or more times in a row</a>. "Alright, I got it! Alright, I got it! Alright, I got i-" *squish*

</li><li> "Edge. Edge. Edge. Edge. Edge." Repeat ad infinitum.
</li><li> Babel Mode has a voice that yells "NEW RECORD!" every time you break your climbing record. What's so bad about that? Well, it happens <em>EVERY</em> time you go one step higher, so you get it on <em>EVERY</em> step upwards, except for when you've gone back down the wall to manoeuvre some blocks. Worse still, it's not announcing you breaking a previous personal best, but your record for <em>that game</em>, so every single time you play you will be hearing "NEW RECORD!" on every step up from the bottom of the wall to the top.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal">Portal</a></em>:
<ul><li> At the beginning of and throughout each level, GLaDOS will talk to you in her robotic voice, usually taunting you instead of helping you. If you die, you get to hear her speeches over again when you restart the level (from the checkpoint, if applicable). Later on, the turrets, which are arguably the hardest obstacles in the game to overcome, CONSTANTLY say things like "Searching..." "Target lost." "Are you still there?" while you're trying to get around them. Finally, while you're <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">battling GLaDOS, instead of only speaking at certain points, she will NEVER shut up until you kill her &mdash; and neither will the parts of her you rip out.</span>
</li><li> The radios which have been added throughout the game in a later update. They play a jolly, looping tune, a couple of seconds long, which can drive you crazy rather quickly (and jars you out of the game's spooky atmosphere).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2">Portal 2</a></em> adds the companion cubes with parts of turrets wedged to them <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(they are a part of Wheatley's test chambers)</span>, and they make <em>incredibly</em> annoying noises (they sound something like someone attempting to shout while whispering at the same time), with nothing you can do about it other than solve the puzzle quicker.
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PuzzleQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PuzzleQuest">Puzzle Quest</a></em>: "Your hero is near death." Especially annoying if your opponent is in the middle of a multi-turn spanking that you can do absolutely nothing about.
</li><li> From the Japanese version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MagicalDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MagicalDrop">Magical Drop</a> III</em>, every time Chariot gets attacked: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb">"KUSOOOOOOO!

</li><li> The "thump" sound you hear whenever you bump into something.
</li><li> In puzzle areas where you have to work with Connectors that for some reason or another get their paths blocked a lot (almost always by those electric spheres), the sound the nodes make when they lose connection is going to get old, really, really fast.
</li><li> The beeping whenever you get close to a mine, especially in puzzles that feature them heavily (such as the appropriately named "Nervewracking").
<ul><li> The original designs, seen in the prototype DLC, are even worse, as they have a wider range at which they start beeping and emit a high whine as well.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitness">The Witness</a></em>: The speaker in the jungle.

</li><li> The "POP" sound the various buttons make when pressed is played even if an enemy steps on one, and many, many levels have <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">lots</a></em> of enemies. The sound can also be heard <em>anywhere on the level</em>, even if the button being pressed is on the other side of the map. Also, since the game is grid-based and everything moves at a constant rate, there's usually a rhythmic effect to the constant button-pressing. POP! PO-POP! POP! PO-POP! POP! PO-POP!
</li><li> Many levels are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchEmAll">filled to the brim with chips everywhere</a>. Chp-Chp-Chp-Chp-Chp-Chp-Chp-Chp-Chp-Chp-Chp-Chp-Chp-Chp-Chp-Chp-Chp-Chp-Chp-Chp-Chp-Chp-Chp-Chp-Chp-Bummer!
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MrDriller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MrDriller">Mr. Driller</a></em> series has you collecting air capsules in order to stay alive. You often collect these as often as you mine ores in <em>Minecraft</em>, with them spawning every ten meters, with it increasing by two every area. Now imagine having to pick them up constantly as if you're collecting coins from Coin Heaven in <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, and then hearing "Lucky!" every single time you pick up one, and this will get obnoxious very quickly. You're gonna be hearing this in your dreams!
</li><li> In the <em>Breakout</em> clone <em>Putt-Putt and Pep's Balloon-o-Rama</em>, it plays just like any other <em>Arkanoid</em> game, where you have to keep the ball on-screen. However, Pep serves as the ball and for every time he falls, he generates a "fall whistle" that will get grating really, really fast. Good luck trying to beat all 120 levels, because you are going to be hearing this <em>a lot</em>.
</li><li> "YEE-HAW!" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DrRobotniksMeanBeanMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DrRobotniksMeanBeanMachine">Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine</a></em>, the sound that plays when the CPU opponent just scored a combo and you're about to get flooded with junk pieces. Hearing it three times in a row in increasing pitch is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsGonnaSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsGonnaSuck">the sign for you to give up because you just lost.</a> On the flip side, however, it becomes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MostWonderfulSound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MostWonderfulSound">Most Wonderful Sound</a> if you're Player 2 in a 2P match. There's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh">"Yo ho ho"</a>, which plays in the background whenever a junk piece falls on your side, which is <em>constantly</em> (sometimes even happening multiple times in a row if there's a lot.)

<ul><li> In the English dub of <em>Puyo Puyo Tetris</em>, Ess' crying during one of the cutscenes is extremely loud and obnoxious-sounding, not helped by her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint">far more arrogant personality in this particular dub</a>.
</li><li> In <em>Puyo Puyo Champions</em>: "One! One! One! One!" As if the game is reminding you that you <em>really</em> suck at making chains, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">are a basic staple of gameplay but have an intimidating skill floor</a>.

In this game, you give a troop of characters orders by playing certain beats on some drums, and this is the order to advance. Which means you have to play it a lot to get through the levels.

YOOooouuu LOOOOoooose..." This may be pretty funny the first time, but it REALLY gets tiring when you keep losing on that one level you just can't quite beat.
</li><li> The booing crowd and stereo distortion sounds when you fail a song in any <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero">Guitar Hero</a></em> game may count as this, although it can be bypassed by pausing as soon as it comes up and then restarting the song. However, this can only be done in I-III, so if you're playing World Tour or beyond, you're gonna have to either pause and restart before you fail, or face the madness like a man.

Of course, since this song only appears in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">Japanese</a> installments, none of the game's intended demographic really gives a damn.

It makes going to Megaton a double-edged sword, as the chance to talk to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManicPixieDreamGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManicPixieDreamGirl">Moira Brown</a> does somewhat make up for it. But if you think Cromwell is bad, try navigating Megaton with high karma. "I wish there were more people like you..."

</li><li> So on your new game, you nuke Megaton to shut that idiot up. Now, every time you go to Tenpenny Towers, you hear the other sound, that ear-wormy little doo-bee-doo tune that plays <strong>CONSTANTLY.</strong> Even worse, you can't shut it up.
</li><li> &#133;and then once you get inside your home: "It appears you have been wounded, sir/madame, may I suggest you seek medical attention?" No, I'm going to sleep it off as always. You be lucky you give me purified water, or I'd turn you into a pile of plasma goo.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">bad karma</a> noise that plays whenever you take anything that's not yours. If you're playing a stealth build you'll be hearing this a lot, especially in the early game when looting homes is a great way to find good guns and ammo. On that topic: if you move your crosshair over something stealable even for a nanosecond, someone nearby <em>will</em> assume you're considering taking it. And they will let you know of this every time. <em>New Vegas</em> thankfully removed this, so it's safe to actually look at things again.

<ul><li> ED-E, a robot companion whose chirping and combat music can be mildly annoying, but nothing like the <strong>constant</strong> whirring noise as it follows you around.
</li><li> ED-E's noise is constant but subtle&#133;until you upgrade the robot, after which it changes pitch and perfectly imitates the static-y death of a set of cheap speakers. Not fun.
</li><li> Every single time he <strong>sees</strong> an enemy, not even engages it, you hear the same six-second sound sample straight from a Western which for some reason none of the enemies can hear.
</li><li> Also, for those of us playing on Hardcore mode, that ears-ringing sound you get when you get a concussion. Especially if you're miles from the nearest town and don't have a doctor's bag or a Hydra.
</li><li> Any time you use the Fixer, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellIsThatNoise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellIsThatNoise">sound effect disturbingly similar to being hit by a large glob of poisonous slime</a> will periodically play at TWICE THE VOLUME OF EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE GAME.

</li><li> <em>Dead Money</em>: You will learn to dread the sound of a beeping bomb collar. And you'll loathe Dog/God and Dean for their repetitive, insulting and often threatening banter. (Christine is mute, making her <em>considerably</em> more bearable.) <em>Honest Hearts</em>: Follows-Chalk constantly remarks on civilisation. His misinformed opinions are funny... the first time. <em>Old World Blues</em>: The programmers actually assumed not every player would enjoy the fully personalised, chattering appliances in the Sink, and allows you to turn off the personality programming while retaining their functions.
</li><li> Enter the part of Freeside that contains Mick &amp; Ralph's, and prepare to be bombarded by <em>non-stop</em> ads for it from their crier out on the street. Even worse is he just so happens to be the only crier in the city who's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableInfantSurvival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableInfantSurvival">kid</a>, and therefore the only one you can't shut the hell up.

"Maybe you'd be better off with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutoDoc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutoDoc">Auto Doc</a> suit." And unlike the Sink appliances, her personality can't be turned off.
</li><li> If you are being attacked by several human opponents at once, the stream of "<em>Die</em>, damn you"s and "This is the part where you fall down and <em>bleed</em> to death"s become annoying quite quickly.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BraveStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BraveStory">Brave Story</a>: New Traveler</em> has Yuno's sort of "Piw!" sound whenever she does most of her attacks. Considering she's the only one who can steal, and some of your quests require heavy use of it, you will be getting <em>very</em> sick of it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Albion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Albion">Albion</a></em> has a particularly jarring feature, that causes the game to notify you THROUGH THE COMPUTER'S INTERNAL SPEAKER, nonetheless, if a bug is encountered. It happens quite often (at least two, completely useless spells do it, and a boss character that throws knives, while lacking the appropriate animation). The game manual specifically states: "If the encountered bug doesn't interfere with gameplay, ignore it". Thing is, if it DOES interfere with gameplay, the game crashes in a spectacular display of colors. So what exactly is the point of having it around other than tormenting your eardrums and your roommate, is beyond me.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>:
<ul><li> "Should I fetch you a ladder so you can get off my back?" Do yourself a favor and don't pick the voice-set that includes this response. And while useful, the "Trap detected" response can be really annoying in areas with a bunch of traps nearby.
</li><li> Alistair's "Alright, let's GO!" thing, which he seems to do every. Freaking. Combat.
</li><li> This should be easy enough, This should be easy enough, This should be easy enough...
</li><li> Also the sound effect accompanying the champion's Rally ability. Every. Time. Someone. Enters. The. Affected. Area. In other words, constantly.
</li><li> The Aura of Insolence sustained ability as well. Every five seconds...WOOSH....WOOSH...WOOSH....
</li><li> "Warden senses...tingling!"

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sacred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sacred">Sacred</a></em>:
<ul><li> The maddeningly annoying Sakkara priests, who come in packs and have a spell that can temporarily freeze you in place. Worse, the female ones have the shrillest, most grating voices imaginable. And unlike their male counterparts, they never. Shut. Up.
</li><li> And even when you kill them, they have the most drawn-out death wails in basically <em>the entire game</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Anyone who has ever played <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlueDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlueDragon">Blue Dragon</a></em> knows that the most annoying sound is actually the music. The 'rock' soundtrack that plays every time you enter a bigger/boss fight... Especially if a lot of fights are happening right after each other is grating to say the least. Some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IronMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IronMaiden">Bruce Dickinson</a> wannabe doing his best to sing a very repetative song gets very annoying very fast.
</li><li> In any <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a></em> game with the Press Turn system (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIIINocturne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIIINocturne">Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIV">IV</a></em>, as well as the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigitalDevilSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigitalDevilSaga">Digital Devil Saga</a></em> series), the sound of an attack missing or being blocked is this, especially because missed and blocked attacks result in losing <em>two</em> turns instead of one. Even worse is the sound of an enemy repelling or draining an attack, because in either of those situations you lose <strong>all of your turns</strong>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em>, the in-battle comments by the outside support character.
<ul><li> "The ENEMY's reTURNED to NORmal! The ENEMY's reTURNED to NORmal! The ENEMY's reTURNED to NORmal!" She has two or three things she can say when an enemy recovers from being knocked down, but when you knock down a group and they all get up in sequence, she seems to be programmed to say the same thing for each one. Her bad voice-acting doesn't help matters.
</li><li> "It seems to have <em>mult</em>iple <em>weak</em>nesses!" Fuuka's voice acting in battles was dismaying to many a <em>Persona 3</em> player. When analyzing enemy weaknesses is a vital part of your strategy, and the voice acting makes you want to not even bother, something's gone horribly wrong.
</li><li> At least it was bearable when Mitsuru was still taking the back seat.
</li><li> After a certain point in the same game, enemies will run away from you rather than attack you. Cool. They run away with an absolutely horrible screeching sound. Not cool. And if you're hunting a specific enemy (like the game's <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlimes">Metal Slimes</a>) in an area where <em>everything</em> runs away from you, <em>mute the goddamn TV</em>.
</li><li> For some odd reason, the more human Aegis becomes the more annoying her battle quotes become, especially her squeaky <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgnO_Mbmns4">"I need your help!"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
</li><li> Time to go fight Hermit, huh? Well, it's electric, so let's bring Take Mikazuchi, Akihiko and it should be easy. And then you hit it. AHHHH! AHHHH! AHHHH! AHHHH! <em>Hermit is charging!</em> "*gasp* The ENemy is CHARging an attACK!" AHHHH! AHHHH! AHHHH! AHHHH! <em>Hermit is charging!</em> <strong>GUARD FOR THE LOVE OF GOD</strong> <em>Hermit used Giga Spark!</em> Suffice it to say, just mute the fucking TV.
</li><li> The loud-ass 'BZZZT' sound Tower enemies make when they cast. Urgh
<ul><li> Also the weird "BRRBLRGR" noise the Balances make when casting. Although it's fun to try and imitate!
</li></ul></li><li> Every time Yukari makes a normal attack that doesn't crit or hit a weakness before evolving her Persona, she'll say, "Please hit!" The sound gets rather repetitive after a while.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>, the Avatar of Nyx, is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss">Marathon Boss</a> that consists of over fourteen "forms". As a result, it goes on <em>forever</em> - meaning you will get tired of hearing the same voice clips over <em>and over again</em>:
<ul><li> "The time has come."
</li><li> "All shall perish."
</li><li> "...Nothing."
</li><li> "OOOHF" when you hit it.
</li><li> "The arcana is the means by which all is revealed."
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Margaret</a> yells "No!" every time she's hit, which can be multiple times for a single attack. Compare the fourth game, in which she only says this upon being defeated.
</li></ul></li><li> It gets worse in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em>, because the annoying things Teddie says to you usually occur when you're doing <em>well</em>. GO SENSEI! YOU KNOCKED IT DOWN! Thankfully, turning off the Event Voices also mutes Teddie during battles.
<ul><li> "That was coooooooooool, Yosuke!" After two or three of those... in one battle... you start <em>pining</em> for Yosuke to fail.
</li><li> Izanagi forbid you fail to get the jump on the enemy or you'll be treated to "WAAAAAAAAH! Three enemies AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMBUSHED you!"
</li><li> Rise doesn't get off easy either. "Gee, it's like an endless stream of 'em!"
</li><li> Most of the voice acting in <em>Persona 4</em> is pretty good, but some of the battle quotes can be downright infuriating when heard over and over again. Examples that stick out are Naoto's, "Someone finish this one OFF~~~~~~~!", Kanji's strange "URARR" sound during an all-out attack, Yukiko tends to shout "There!" a bit too much and often says it multiple times during her critical attack and the sound Teddie makes while walking in a dungeon. If Teddie is in your party, bring earplugs.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em> definitely improved on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mission Control</a>, but they still only have one line for each party member if they hit a weak spot.

<ul><li> Uzume Tennouboshi in her HDD form, Orange Heart. Her collection of quotes may grow on you after fourty minutes.
</li><li> Even worse, her Japanese voice can make you cover your ears until you mute the volume.

It's debatable which is more annoying: party members asking if you've seen the Power Spot right in front of you, or demanding to investigate the one on the other side of some water that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsurmountableWaistHighFence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsurmountableWaistHighFence">you can't cross</a>.

<ul><li> Sometimes you would start hearing a chirping sound every other step. At first pretty mysterious and unnerving, because it wouldn't shut up after staying the night in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaInn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaInn">inn</a>, visiting your mom, going to the hospital, using a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealThyself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealThyself">healing spell</a> or resetting the game. The answer? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It was a chick that hatched from any egg you happened to get.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario">Paper Mario</a></em>:
<ul><li> In order to help you find the Dry Dry Ruins, Moustafa gives you a Pulse Stone. The closer you are to the rock that reveals the ruins, the more frequently the stone beeps. It's an annoying sound that indicates a good thing.
</li><li> Speaking of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario">Paper Mario</a></em> games, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalAnnoyance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalAnnoyance">Critical Annoyance</a> noise. During battles, it just keeps driving you crazy till you heal.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor">sequel</a> gives the player the Attack FX R badge, which makes every single one of your attacks sound like a cricket. For less skilled players (or those who would rather not grind), it's the only option for beating the first boss. Fortunately, you don't have any reason to use it afterwards.
</li></ul></li><li> The battle voices in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lunar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lunar">Lunar</a></em> remakes are based on the classes of moves the character uses. So every time the healer uses any healing spell, she yells, "Althena! Lend me your power!" Each time the lightening mage does the one thing he's good for: "Check THIS out!" And woe betide you if an enemy has a battle clip, it'll be "TIME! TO! DIE!" <em>twice</em> every turn.
</li><li> SNES RPG 7th Saga gave you a choice of apprentices to team up. One of the more attractive options was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechanicalLifeforms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechanicalLifeforms">ancient android LUX TIZER</a> who had high defense, high attack, high magic ability and even decent speed.

Since it was a menu-driven RPG, this meant you had to listen to it <em>every time you pressed anything</em>. As if this wasn't enough, it was <em>also</em> used as a sound effect for some of the spells. Consequently, the background music was never audible, being drowned out by an impenetrable wall of "EV-EV-EV-E-E-EVERY-EV-EVERYONE'S G-EVERYONE'S GONNA DIE!"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pokemon">Pok&eacute;mon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Low Health noise.

And what makes it even worse... THE BAR TURNS RED ANYWAY! ...

<ul><li> Fortunately, it stops after a few notes in Gen VI and the battle music doesn't change.

During the first match against him (as well as when someone uses him during multi-player games), he'll give an incredibly annoying old man-ish cackle when he does a combo.

<ul><li> The enemy krogan rasping <strong>"Watch out!"</strong> throughout the fight: irritating. <em>Three</em> enemy krogan rasping it through the whole fight: most annoying sound. Well, most annoying after female human/asari enemies constantly screaming "I WILL DESTROY YOU!" Which was promptly given to Jack in the sequel, where it's just as annoying.
</li><li> From the sequel, <strong>"One less to worry about!"</strong> Thank you, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Garrus</span>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">that was very helpful</a>.

Sounds simple right? It is, but every once in a while you'll be walking down a corridor and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare">all of a sudden the VI will rather loudly announce itself</a> with a horrific, distorted scream that can most generously be described as the scream from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Creepypasta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Creepypasta">suicidemouse.avi</a> run through a tripod from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WarOfTheWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WarOfTheWorlds">War of the Worlds</a></em>. <em>Especially</em> bad if you're using headphones and have the volume cranked up.
</li><li> Also from the sequel, <em>every single thing Harbinger says.</em> "WE ARE YOUR GENETIC DESTINY THIS HURTS YOU IF I MUST TEAR YOU APART SHEPARD I WILL YOU WILL KNOW PAIN SHEPARD," e.t.c. and so forth. And if that wasn't bad enough, on higher difficulties he does it <em>more.</em> As in, every three seconds. It's nightmarish.
</li><li> It's egregiously nightmarish when you realize that it sounds like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFetishist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFetishist">Pinhead</a> from Hellraiser.
</li><li> The excuses your allies give you when they don't have time to talk. If you're the kind of player who wants to know all about your crew, expect to hear a lot of "Can it wait for a bit? I'm in the middle of some calibrations", "There's a lot to do, Shepard", and "We are forming a consensus", among others.
</li><li> Captain Ahern from the Pinnacle Station DLC likes to provide color commentary. Oh <em>God</em>. "There's no award for <em>most times shot!</em>" "Come on, Shepard, that medi-gel ain't free!" "<em>Ooh!</em> They're gonna feel <em>that</em> one tomorrow!"
</li><li> Though it can be helpful, any variation of "Shields are down!" for you and your squadmates. Chances are, if you know what you're doing, the shields will recharge with no ill effects in time, so there's no reason to make such a fuss about it. And if you <em>don't</em> know what you're doing, then you'll probably not find the time to save yourself at this point anymore, anyway.
</li><li> When you pick up research/tech in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em>, Shepard will exclaim "This looks useful" or "I can use this!". It's usually not annoying, but when you get upgrades right after a climactic cutscene, it throws off the immersion ("Come on, Tali'Zorah vas Normandy, let's get back to the ship." "Yes... Captain." "WE CAN USE THIS!"). Also, for whatever reason, whenever FemShep says it, it's incredibly loud compared to all the other sound effects.
</li><li> When scanning star systems in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>, you need to be careful not to attract any Reapers by using it too much, because they will attack the Normandy and <strong><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZZvRHWLvjo#t=55s">HHHOOOOOOOOOONNKK!!!!!!<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></strong>

The resident VI will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingVideoGameHelper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingVideoGameHelper">oh so helpfully</a> remind you of this....over and over again until it's done. At roughly the same decibel level as a tornado siren. Gets infuriating after about the second repetition.
</li><li> The alarms on the Hammerhead in the Firewalker and Overlord <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DLC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DLC">DLCs</a> in <em>2</em>. Whenever the Hammerhead takes significant damage, it starts playing a fairly irritating alarm. Because the Hammerhead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">is armoured with old shoeboxes layered over bubble wrap</a>, you will hear it a lot, especially in the Geth-focused mission (which is thoughtfully <em>not</em> the one labelled "Geth Incursion") and the Overlord DLC.

Of course, with five main characters, each of whom goes to at least two locations where you need these potions, you'll be hearing that sound constantly for about a third of the game. Also, there's Mercedes's "Here we go!" about half the time when she reloads her magic bow. Also, "Ah ah ah, bombs away!" from random attacking dwarves.

<ul><li> The Joke's End music in the game is incredibly repetitive after even a very short period of time. Not bad music, but... it's pretty much a few notes repeating over and over, and all for the background music in an area where players will have to spend hours solving puzzles and completing mini games.
</li><li> Any character who runs away during a comical moment usually makes a Hanna-Barbera zing-out whistle that gets awfully annoying very quickly. Prepare to hear it a lot througout the whole game and twice before the last battle with Cackletta's Soul. Thankfully, the sound effect is toned down in the <em>Bowser's Minions</em> remake.

</li><li> In the German translation of <em>Baldur's Gate</em>, it's said in an incredibly smug and condescending tone. Oh, and the line is mistranslated to something akin to "you need to keep assembling your party", indicating you need to recruit more NPCs before being able to leave the area.

</li><li> More seriously, neither of those is as annoying as the noise of being in warp itself. It's gotten less bad recently, but for multiple years it was about ten times as loud as anything else on your computer.
</li><li> If you don't fire-link your weapons, you could be treated to the sound of "The module has run out of charges has run out of charges has run out of charges has run out of charges has run out of charges has run out of charges has run out of charges has run out of charges."

Whenever you obtain a vision, and the future of that vision changes, Vision Reacts immediately overrides the current battle theme for the remainder of the fight. Enemies Closing In overrides the current battle theme immediately when a party member falls in battle or their tension goes down. And unless you change the future, this song plays throughout the rest of the fight unless you revive the fallen party members and restore their tension. These two songs wouldn't be a problem when fighting regular enemies... except these two songs play in almost every boss battle and every Unique Monster battle, as well as only TWO boss fights not playing those songs whatsoever!

</li><li> Oh no, go ahead, please, <em>do</em> tell me why this exercise is popular. What's that? It's popular because of something that should be obvious? WELL WHOOP-DE-GODDAMN-DOO.
</li><li> And for anyone doing the running exercises on the Wii Fit, it can be a good way to burn calories, but the nagging voice of your trainer (via the Wiimote) doesn't help any. <em>"Hold the Wiimote for the most aerobic benefit."</em> Yes I <em>know</em>, you've told me that for the tenth time, will you just shut up and let me run already?!
</li><li> The step exercise is even worse.

It is much louder than the metronome. And <em>it can't be turned down</em>. Not that it can't be turned down compared to the metronome, it can't be turned down <em>at all</em> (and the metronome can't be turned up), which completely defeats the point of listening to music or an audiobook or watching television during the half-hour mode since you miss a big chunk of sound three or so times a minute. It gets to the point where one might bury it under a pile of cloth on the other side of the room and just accept the loss of steps from not starting immediately.

<ul><li> The series has a heartbeat that increases in rate and volume as your hero loses health (and gradually fades into silence once he's either not under attack anymore or has been healed), which can be incredibly irritating, especially in the way it gets the player's own heart beating faster either sympathetically or with panic because your hero is about to die. This can be turned off, but if you do, your hero tends to die without an inattentive player even noticing he's under attack, so it's unfortunately best to leave it on.

</li><li> Everytime a villager dies, there is a creepy voice that whispers "DEATH". It is really annoying considering that your villagers, though important to your economy, are easily replaceable. Even worse is the Dutch language pack: it was not a whisper; a female voice over would tend to SCREAM the word. Thanks to EA wanting to localize the game for the Dutch market. It was a... not so very happy situation when your town was being attacked. EA made the English voice-overs available for download after massive complaints from pretty much every country with a localization.

Every time they found something they would announce it by shouting "YIPPIEE!!". And to speed up the process, you would usually send a dozen or more of them at once and they would check every single hex in the area.

Problem is, they say this almost every single time an alien moves, regardless of whether the alien actually moves in the way that is yelled. Not only is it annoying being told that an enemy charging you is retreating, but being told in the loudest voice possible is just painful. To a lesser extend, Bradford's pre-mission dialogue is very repetitive and unskippable, due to taking place in the loading screen.

The good news is that you can just kill these people if their dialogue gets too much- or better still, just leave them to die to avoid negatively impacting your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">Karma Meter</a>.

Good thing they spawn 5% as often as Zombie Pigmen.
</li><li> Slimes give you the "luxury" of being a more common overworld creature and a very constant, very <em>loud</em> sandpaper-on-rubber-esque movement sound that will make your ears pray for a mercy killing. Even worse is the fact that they take much, much longer to kill than any other Overworld mob, as they split into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsteroidsMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsteroidsMonster">several smaller versions of themselves</a> <em>twice</em> when you first "kill" them, which takes at least three hits with an Iron Sword.

The base concept of the resource pack is that all the sounds are changed to the Element Animation crew typically saying the name of the blocks that they are and so forth, so the only sounds you'll hear from the game are "grass, grass, grass" (or whatever block you're walking on) and such repeatedly. This is especially grating with water and lava, which say "Water... water, there is water here," and "I am lava, stay away, I will hurt you! Lava, lava," <em>constantly</em>.

</li><li> A majority of the lines said by citizens were just the same lines said over and over again but with different voice actors. The audacity!
</li><li> Whenever a citizen tasks you with something you're not normally good at. Example: "There's a boat sinkin' in the river!"
</li><li> The captions. All of them. They're kind of fun the first few times, but in a game where spending days and days playing is a very real possibility if you want to have any hope of finishing everything, they get VERY repetitive. VERY, VERY repetitive.

It can be turned on just by moving it, and it'll exclaim "HUG ME!" and "YOU'RE MY FRIEND!" loudly until it finally screeches, "BYE BYE!". And <em>god forbid</em> if you accidentally set one off in a store. Also the power switch is not accessible unless you take the toy out of the packaging. To be fair tho, the toy arrives in stores in demo mode- which means it should quickly shut itself off, unless someone has taken out the demo tab. This is why the UK packaging seals off almost the entire toy to make it harder to accidentally set it off in-store.
<ul><li> That has got nothing on the other Laugh &amp; Learn toys, some of which<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12vxqa');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note12vxqa" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12vxqa');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">notably the Happy Apple and the Light-Up Fishbowl</span> have a tilt sensor <em>and</em> accelerometer. Meaning that after accidentally setting them off, a light shake is all it takes to get them to start making noise again (the only way to make them stop is to keep them completely still for three minutes). They also do not have a demo mode. Cue parents silently cussing red-faced while carrying one to the car after buying, since the power and volume switch isn't accessible while the toy is in packaging.

It's worse because there is no power switch <em>and</em> volume control at all, and the toy does not have a demo mode- what you experience in stores are what you'll experience at home. And when set off, they'd sing and talk loudly for up to a minute after the interaction has stopped. To be fair, holding down the belly of the toy for 5 seconds shuts it off, but not before it screeches "GOODBYE!". But the packaging does not mention that, and it is quite easy to bump on another button just after turning it off.

And since he only says one thing, horrifyingly enough, <em>Peter Cullen's voice saying "I am Optimus Prime"</em> can become a Most Annoying Sound. The horror...the horror.

Put a coin in, and it says, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty">"I am your father, Luke!"</a> complete with loud, grainy breathing effect.

</li><li> Lalaloopsy's Harmony B. Sharp doll. She constantly nags you to "tickle her belly" in her nasally voice when you don't play with her.
</li><li> A line of singing and dancing terrorist dolls known as "Warfare Puppetry" were sold in Pakistan and Arab countries in the 2000s. The "singing" mentioned is actually a loop of a verse in the song "Sister Sister" by obscure Eurodance group Java. It's enough to make your ears bleed.
