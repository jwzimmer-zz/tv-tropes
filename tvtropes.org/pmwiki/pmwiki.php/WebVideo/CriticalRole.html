With a cast of talented performers playing every role in the game, you know you're in for a good time.</p><p>It began as a one-time adventure developed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewMercer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewMercer">Matthew Mercer</a> as a birthday present for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LiamOBrien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LiamOBrien">Liam O'Brien</a> in 2013. However, it was so well received by the group (most of whom had never played D&amp;D before) that it grew into a regularly-occurring game played on their own time for over a year, gathering more players along the way. Eventually, Matt was invited to livestream the game as part of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeekAndSundry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeekAndSundry">Geek &amp; Sundry</a></em> web channel, creating the show we know as <em>Critical Role</em>. While the original campaign was played using the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em> game system, <em>Critical Role</em> saw the group convert to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseRules">home-ruled</a> version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons (5th Edition)</a></em>.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p><em>Critical Role</em> launched on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeekAndSundry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeekAndSundry">Geek &amp; Sundry</a></em> in 2015 and became its biggest draw, proving to be an instant success due to the big names behind it and the charm of the show itself. The show spawned a huge fandom and inspired many to try out <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> for the first time, thanks to it showing just how fun and imaginative tabletop gaming can be. It has even been credited with playing a massive part in the resurgence of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> in the past few years.</p><p>In June 2018, Critical Role moved production into its own newly-acquired studio and launched its own <a class="urllink" href="https://critrole.com">website<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.twitch.tv/criticalrole">Twitch<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpXBGqwsBkpvcYjsJBQ7LEQ">YouTube<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> channels along with several new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spinoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spinoff">spinoff</a> shows: <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1tiwbzkOjQyr6-gqJ8r29j_rJkR49uDN">Handbooker Helper<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> (short D&amp;D tutorial videos for beginners), <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1tiwbzkOjQw3oFxaqw1EKuflm1I2dJVB">Between The Sheets<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> (in-depth, one-to-one interviews with the cast and celebrities, and hosted by Brian W.

Meanwhile, a number of individual subplots wind their way through the action, from a grand pilgrimage between the four corners of the world, to deeply personal vendettas, blossoming romances, and that time they turned into flying night cows. The first campaign spans a total of 115 episodes (that's 447 hours, excluding one-off specials) and is divided into eight chapters, which can be found on the Recap page.</p><p>In summer 2017, a Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Guide written by Matt was <a class="urllink" href="https://greenroninstore.com/collections/fifth-edition/critical-role">released<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GreenRonin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GreenRonin">Green Ronin</a>, allowing fans to craft their own journeys in the world of <em>Critical Role</em>. The guide was designed for use with <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 5th Edition. Matt hopes to release more guides in the future focusing on Exandria's other continents.</p><p>That fall, Dark Horse began publishing <em>Vox Machina Origins</em>, a six-issue miniseries written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattColville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattColville">Matthew Colville</a> along with Matthew Mercer, and drawn by Olivia Samson. It tells the story of how the members of Vox Machina first met, as they dealt with a mysterious "curse" affecting the town of Stilben.</p><p>In March 2019, Critical Role launched a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/criticalrole/critical-role-the-legend-of-vox-machina-animated-s?ref=project_link">Kickstarter<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> to produce an 22-minute animated special with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Titmouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Titmouse">Titmouse</a> titled <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em>, slated for release in fall 2020. They hit their $750,000 minimum funding in 40 minutes, hit $1 million in 56 minutes, and in a mere seven hours and 20 minutes smashed through <em>all</em> their initial stretch goals by raising $3 million. They added extra stretch goals, and finally ended with over $10 million: enough to turn the animated special into a two-episode original story, fund an adaptation of the Briarwoods arc spanning eight episodes, <em>and</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GotVolunteered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GotVolunteered">force</a> Travis to be filmed while going through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedHouse">Haunted House</a>.

Taking place <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">over twenty years after the events of the first campaign</a>, this new adventure is set on the continent of Wildemount and features a brand new set of player characters. In contrast to the blossoming frontier of Tal'dorei, Wildemount is steeped in the rust of the ancient Dwendalian Empire: a nation where security is bought with fealty, money flows to the rich and devious, and whispers of discontent lurk in the shadows of gilded walls.</p><p></p><h2>The cast for the second campaign is as follows:</h2><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewMercer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewMercer">Matthew Mercer</a> as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">Dungeon Master</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LiamOBrien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LiamOBrien">Liam O'Brien</a> as Caleb Widogast, human wizard (accompanied by his cat familiar Frumpkin).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LauraBailey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LauraBailey">Laura Bailey</a> as Jester Lavorre, tiefling cleric.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AshleyJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AshleyJohnson">Ashley Johnson</a> as Yasha Nydoorin, aasimar barbarian.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TravisWillingham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TravisWillingham">Travis Willingham</a> as Fjord, half-orc warlock.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TaliesinJaffe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TaliesinJaffe">Taliesin Jaffe</a> as Mollymauk Tealeaf, tiefling blood hunter.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarishaRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarishaRay">Marisha Ray</a> as Beauregard Lionett, human monk.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamRiegel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamRiegel">Sam Riegel</a> as Nott the Brave, goblin rogue.</li></ul><p>You can watch the show live on <a class="urllink" href="https://www.twitch.tv/criticalrole">the official Critical Role Twitch.tv channel<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> every Thursday evening (well into the morning hours of Friday for those in Europe and beyond).

However every resurrection ritual throughout the series has been a success, and the only permeant party deaths come from the fact that there was no one who could resurrect them in time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Facepalm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Facepalm">Facepalm</a>: Matt is prone to this.

While the Mighty Nein begin much rougher around the edges, they also grow into this over time. Meta-wise, the cast themselves have also stated they view each other as a second family.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullyAbsorbedFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullyAbsorbedFinale">Fully Absorbed Finale</a>: Dalen's Closet One-Shot, aka <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the wedding of Percy and Vex'alia</span> for the whole Vox Machina chapter.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGenieKnowsJackNicholson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGenieKnowsJackNicholson">The Genie Knows Jack Nicholson</a>: Occasionally a real-world pop-culture reference finds its way into the hijinks.

Many of these house rules are designed to speed along gameplay (a "Short Rest" lasts fifteen minutes instead of an hour) and in general the game leans more towards what makes a good story rather than the letter of the rule book.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn">It Will Never Catch On</a>: The cast was unsure how "nerdy-ass voice actors sitting around playing Dungeons and Dragons" would be received, and Matt said in a Q+A that he was going to give it until about Episode 6 and then go back to playing at his house. Naturally, the show became incredibly popular incredibly fast, to the cast's continued amazement and thankfulness.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAStupidAccent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAStupidAccent">Just a Stupid Accent</a>: Matt does a good job of regional accents being consistent between characters, but they are only ever accents.

This includes situations where (for example) a player intuits a lie but the character fails the relevant skill check to disbelieve. Since metagaming is against the spirit of the game at best and outright cheating at worst, it is actively discouraged (Matt deducts points for it!). More often, the cast will instead use it for hilarious or dramatic effect.</li><li> When the players ask about days of the week in the world of Exandria, for perhaps the only time, Matt relies that it's currently "the equivalent of a Thursday."</li><li> Red Nose Day 2019 has a one-shot adventure with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialGuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialGuest">Special Guest</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenColbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenColbert">Stephen Colbert</a> as Capo the half-elf bard, who's faced with the obligatory test of character in order to get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement">Sword of Plot Advancement</a>.

A brief Q&amp;A soon followed with the five of them.</li><li> Not long afterward Liam was the DM for another oneshot between episodes 65 and 66, this one set in Emon (before the current arc) but focuses on members of The Clasp &mdash; an all-Rogue session where everyone had hidden motives that could lead them to stab each other in the back at any time.</li><li> In the break between the two campaigns, the show became exclusively a string of unusual one-shots run by the players.</li><li> The Red Nose Day 2019 event is a very rare <em>one-player</em> adventure with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialGuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialGuest">Special Guest</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenColbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenColbert">Stephen Colbert</a>, and ends with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">no HDYWTDT, as Stephen finds the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">Soul Jar</a>.</span></li><li> The <em>Call of Cthulhu: Shadow of the Crystal Palace</em> is <em>several</em> levels of different - not only is it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorror">Cosmic Horror</a> tale but it's set in 1890 (of <em>our</em> universe), and the players are apparently all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expys</a> of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Cluedo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Cluedo">Cluedo</a></em> characters.</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Taliesin:</strong> Is it, uh... <em>Halloween</em> yet?</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingIsAFreeAction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingIsAFreeAction">Talking Is a Free Action</a>: Played with &mdash; players will occasionally get repercussions for spending too much time talking in tense situations.</li><li> <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry.
