The two were very different from each other. The Genesis version was considered a classic for its console, while the less-popular SNES version is thought of as one of the console's hidden gems. There was also a Japan-only game for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OtherSegaSystems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OtherSegaSystems">Sega CD</a>. Another adaptation, a team-based <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter">FPS</a> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360">Xbox 360</a> and PC, however, has been much less well-received. The primary reason you will find it referenced is the rare use of cross-platform multiplayer between the 360 and PC versions. (This game is also the <em>reason</em> for its rarity, as gameplay was unbalanced in the favor of PC players due to superior controls.)

Elves really tend to be the punching bag of everyone, but they don't get to return the racism as much as they'd like &mdash; elven-ruled racist nations have effectively imploded in 4e, to the point where T&iacute;r Tairngire is now run collectively by a Great Dragon and an ork.</li><li> Just over half the population are racist in some way in 3rd edition. Every npc gets a racism stat of 2d6-6 (0 or less means not racist at all) and around 1/6th of all racists are biased against everyone not of their own race. Mostly this is just a bias though. It would be harder to persuade a shopkeeper to sell you a reserved item for example.</li><li> This isn't changed much for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC">PCs</a> in 4th Edition. You can expect <em>nearly every group</em> to have a specific viewpoint on various races, though it's most notable in a bias for/against orcs, trolls, and assorted goblinoids. Usually, this takes the form of a penalty on social checks, though.</li><li> There are certain cultures that have no bias &mdash; or even give reverence &mdash; towards metahumans, such as menehune (Hawaiian dwarves), or African elves.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRecruitmentDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRecruitmentDrive">Fantastic Recruitment Drive</a>: People with the ability to use magic are extremely rare.

The latter has a bad rap because of Aztechnology's attempts to tie it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic">Blood Magic</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice">Human Sacrifice</a>; non-Aztlan practitioners generally don't go for either. Likewise, other pagan and neopagan religions (such as Asatru and Wicca) have surged in popularity.</li><li> Many religions adapted easily and brought magic into their practice. Hinduism and Shinto, for example, easily absorbed magic into their practices, and Shintoists are among the most accepted shamans in the Japanacorps for obvious reasons.</li><li> The Abrahamic religions have had a tougher time. Mainstream Christianity eventually accepted magic, though the Catholic Church prefers that its members practice a specifically-Christian form of theurgy. Jews largely accepted conventional magic, though there's a branch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Kabbalah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Kabbalah">Qabbalism</a> that claims undiluted descent from true holy texts (most Qabbalists are largely secular, however). Islam, on the other hand, is torn on the issue; in general, it's considered forbidden, but the Caliphate couldn't just not use it. Accordingly, there are several branches of Islamic magical practice that attempt to reconcile Islamic teaching with magical practice, and whether magic is seen as holy Sufism or blasphemous <em>sihr</em> often depends on the connections of the practitioner.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticScience">Fantastic Science</a>: As a result of scientific and technological progress over time combined with the return of magic.

After magic returned to the world in 2011, the Irish Republican Army started a series of magical terrorist attacks against British military forces in Northern Ireland.

Anyone without a SIN basically has no civil rights and no right to receive benefits normal citizens can expect, such as medical care. SINless metahumans tend to be very poor and homeless, with either a low-paying job or no job at all. They are often discriminated against and mistreated by those with <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SINs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SINs">SI Ns</a> and have little hope of survival or bettering themselves.</li><li> In general, orks and trolls receive very poor treatment in most societies. They typically get stuck with the worst-paying jobs, are looked down on by humans, elves and dwarves as primitive brutes, and tend to live in impoverished neighborhoods with few to none opportunities to improve their lot. In elf-ruled nations such as Tir Tairngire and Tir na nOg, everyone who isn't an elf is a disaffected peon with no opportunities or political voice.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticVermin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticVermin">Fantastic Vermin</a>: Awakening affected common rats same as every other animal.

In fact, they have to examine themselves or consult a biomonitor to realize how badly they're injured; the implant's effects also extend to the sense of touch. The payoff, of course, is never having a clue if the next injury is going to kill you.

Disabling over half of these would bring down the Matrix permanently and send the world back to the dark ages. The same rogue Otaku also helps assemble a virus to be implanted directly in the ECSE servers to do the most damage. On the appointed day, Deus invades the ECSE, takes over, spreads itself worldwide, takes over dozens of other servers and forces them all to work at upgrading his code. At the same time, Megaera, another AI who had been battling in Deus's "subconscious", breaks free and attacks him. Meanwhile <em>yet again</em>, Mirage, the original AI who had served as Deus and Maegera's source code, breaks into the ECSE servers to eliminate Deus. While they are battling, Winternight's Jormungand virus and a significant number of their EMP devices trigger. Between the devices destroying vital Matrix nodes, the nigh-unstoppable virus, the damage caused by three battling AIs, the damage done to the ECSE servers and dozens of others by Deus, and a Dissonance Pool created by the rogue Otaku to amplify everything else's effects, half in hopes of destroying Deus and half out of spite, the entire Matrix collapses.

Further outbreaks pretty much handed the continent to them on a silver platter, as curing them required either over a grand in medications or one healing spell.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicIsAMonsterMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicIsAMonsterMagnet">Magic Is a Monster Magnet</a>: The insect spirits in Chicago.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainliningTheMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainliningTheMonster">Mainlining the Monster</a>: One supplement's shadowtalk includes posts by a sicko who'd kept an Awakened leopard with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> captive for years, periodically skinning it alive and selling the pelts.

Rather than have limited pools of it, magicians can draw upon as much as they need, though using more mana for a spell increases the risk of fatigue or injury.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManEatingPlant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManEatingPlant">Man-Eating Plant</a>: Awakened plants don't turn carnivorous very often, but some such variants do occur and can be very dangerous.<ul><li> The Sangre del Diablo, a mutated variant of a naturally-occurring South American rainforest tree, is a dangerous carnivore that uses magical compulsion to lure its prey to it, at which point it engulfs it with corrosive sap, digests it and absorbs its liquefied remains. They're invasive in the Amazon basin, and when groves form they become entirely barren of animal life.</li><li> Yeteyeos are Central American trees that strangle victims with their snakelike branches are use their corpses as fertilizer.</li><li> South Africa's Dog Eaters use a combination of an enticing, fruity smell and thick, glue-like sap to lure and trap animals.</li><li> Malagasy elephant fruits are trees with very broad, hollow trunks tipped with a cluster of leaves that secrete a honey-like substance. Animals and metahumans trying to get at this bait climb into the tree's trunk, which is very slippery and leads to a pitcher plant-like digestive cavity.</li><li> Violet sleepers are Awakened Venus flytraps native to the Amazon rainforest, and resemble their regular kin in most respects except for being large enough to eat humans.</li><li> Gomorrah apple trees are an unusual variant &mdash; their fruit <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeForGranite">petrifies</a> any creature that eats it, after which the tree's roots grown into the resulting statue and absorb its lingering life force.</li><li> The umdhlebi is an African tree with a slender trunk and branches and a wide, umbrella-like canopy.

They're natural leaders of herds of common elk, which they guide and protect from danger.

Firstly with metavariants of the five standard metatypes; in 5th edition there are 17 metavariants. Then with Metasapients outside of metahumanity, which include centaurs, naga, pixies, Sasquatch, and shapeshifters. One could count shapeshifters as up to ten different races going by the separate stat blocks they get by species in 5th edition. The option to play characters infected with HMHVV expands the list further if one wants to count the infected as a separate race rather than playing a metahuman with a disease. 4th &amp; 5th editions include rules for playing as Artificial/Synthetic Intelligences as well as free spirits, and you also have the option to play as drakes &amp; changelings. Changelings, especially, practically exist to facilitate this trope, as various combinations of changeling qualities can be put together to create any number of fantasy or sci-fi race without the developers creating individual entries for them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMasterMakesTheirOwnTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMasterMakesTheirOwnTools">A Master Makes Their Own Tools</a>: In early editions, "real" deckers built their own cyberdecks from scratch by creating their own deck components.

Their corporate facilities are even step-pyramids, and guards dress like Aztec warriors (with better armour, of course). However, the Aztlan sourcebook makes it clear that this is so much moonshine. The Mayincatec elements of Aztlan culture are deliberate social engineering on Aztechnology's part intended to help create an Aztlan national identity. The Aztlan upper class's pretentious claims of being proud and noble Mayincatecs are pure fiction, and in reality, most of them are of nearly pure Spanish descent.

This can still result in strange cases involving toxins with non-damaging side effects: nausea gas is less likely to affect a hulking troll than a wispy human, but if it does, they both suffer the same penalties for the same duration, with no in-between to account for the troll's mass.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneNationUnderCopyright" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneNationUnderCopyright">One Nation Under Copyright</a>:<ul><li> A concept from the very first edition of the game, and a core part of the setting as per its 1980s cyberpunk roots. Corporations began gaining extra-territoriality even before the setting began getting nuts, and by the time of even the earliest editions proper, it's an established fact of life. As just a few examples, the Pueblo Corporate Council was founded openly as one, and Aztechnology's dominant position in Aztlan is actually written into <em>a classified section</em> of that nation's constitution. By the 2060s, <em>all</em> the Big Ten are this to a greater degree, though, with corporate citizens being very distinct from national ones.</li><li> One of the thrusts of the fifth and sixth editions has been to deconstruct the idea a little bit, though, in keeping with evolving thought in cyberpunk, post-cyberpunk and the general zeitgeist around the idea of "corporate power". While the PCC and Aztech remain as they were (specifically because they were meant to <em>be</em> states from their inception), am early thrust of sixth edition's metaplot in particular is the idea of Ares Macrotechnology struggling a good deal to balance its "corporatehood" and "statehood", and how, for all its appearance of independent might, it still relied and relies much more on a last-century symbiotic relationship with an American government (the UCAS for most of <em>Shadowrun</em> history, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and the CAS after the Detroit Rupture</span>) than its leadership would ever be comfortable admitting and it can't really "replace" an actual government.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnePasswordAttemptEver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnePasswordAttemptEver">One Password Attempt Ever</a>: Found in the supplement <em>The Neo-Anarchist's Guide to North America</em>.

Greater Dragons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChessMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChessMaster">pull the strings of megacorps and nations</a> and are far too powerful for humanity to harm in any meaningful way.

The great dragon cares for the clutch as it incubates, communicating telepathically with the young inside until they hatch and molding their minds before they're even born. On hatching, the newborn dragons inherit the features of the great dragon who cared for them rather than those of their parents &mdash; a western dragon's eggs cared for by a great feathered serpent, for instance, will hatch into feathered serpents. The great dragon who hatched and raised them (referred to as their sire) is thus who dragons perceive as their actual parent, and most neither know nor care about their original progenitors.</li></ul></li><li> A number of lesser draconic creatures, referred to collectively as dracoforms, also exist.<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWyvernsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWyvernsAreDifferent">Wyverns</a> are animalistic predators closely related to feathered serpents, and are found in North America and Europe.</li><li> Drakes are shapeshifters who can alternate between a metahuman form and one resembling a miniature dragon of any breed; they were created in the Fourth World to be servants of the dragons, and their lines endured through the mana-less Fifth World as seemingly normal humans. They reappeared when the mana surge that came with Halley's Comet caused hundreds of unsuspecting metahumans to suddenly turn into drakes, which were then either rounded up by the dragons or went into hiding.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurHydrasAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurHydrasAreDifferent">Hydras</a> are large, amphibious creatures resembling seven- or nine-headed dragons, and are only found in Greece.</li><li> Drakas (known as drakes in the first two edition, before the later drakes were introduced in 3rd ) are wingless, primitive dragon relatives about as smart as orangutans, and are often used by true dragons as guard animals. They come in a fire-breathing variant and an ice-breathing one, but sometimes crossbreed to create hybrids with both types of breath. They are also related to seadrakons, mosasaur-like sea reptiles the size of a whale.</li><li> Gorgons are amphibious dracoforms with gills and manes of fleshy, mobile tendrils.</li></ul></li><li> There are also dracomorphs, which resemble dragons but aren't actually related to them; examples include chimeras (Awakened iguanas with prominent horns and frills and a fiery breath) and lindworms (Awakened, sapient serpents that grow a pair of front legs as they age, and often serve dragons as messengers and go-betweens).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGargoylesRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGargoylesRock">Our Gargoyles Rock</a>:<ul><li> <em>Paranormal Animals of North America</em> describes gargoyles as humanoid creatures with a single short horn and pointed ears; they normally live on cliffs, but some have adapted to cities. The main kind has males with wings and female with arms, but one subspecies possesses both sets of limbs. Another, also six-limbed variety is described in <em>Paranormal Animals of Europe</em>, with twisting horns and skin marked by numerous complex ridges. Unlike most other paranormal animals, which Awakened from clear mundane ancestors, no one really knows where gargoyles come from.</li><li> Neogargoyles, originally mistaken for a variant of gargoyles, are once-normal bats turned blind and flightless by chemical runoff, and whose skin is heavily calcified as a result of the same. They crawl along buildings, tapping, prodding and digging at them to find food, and over a period of five to seven months completely calcify into immobile statues.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhoulsAreCreepier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhoulsAreCreepier">Our Ghouls Are Creepier</a>: They're metahumans (of any type) infected with HMHVV strain III, many go feral but there's a significant number who manage to retain their minds. They're not undead but don't look particularly healthy, are physically blind but gain astral perception, and need to eat metahuman flesh. Some establish working relationships with hospitals, organ-leggers, or shadowrunners to get food.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGiantsAreBigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGiantsAreBigger">Our Giants Are Bigger</a>: They're a troll metavariant native to Germany, Central Europe, and Scandinavia, and have varied in appearance as the editions marched on &mdash; currently they're extremely tall and very human-like as trolls go, but with skin having a leathery, almost bark-like appearance.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGoblinsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGoblinsAreDifferent">Our Goblins Are Different</a>:<ul><li> "Goblinization" is the term used for the phenomenon of adults turning into orks or trolls when the metatypes first emerged.</li><li> Actual goblins are dwarves infected with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">HMHVV Type I</a>, the virus that turns humans into vampires. Goblins are emaciated, hairless beings with only minimal intelligence, immune to fire and vulnerable to iron. They eat raw meat, often from sapient beings.</li><li> Hobgoblins are something else entirely, being a regional variant of ork native to the Middle East and Central Asia. Hobgoblins are wirier and skinnier than other orks, have greenish skin tones (orks usually just have human colorations) and solid black eyes, and have a very strong sense of personal honor that demands that they obtain payback for any slight done against them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGryphonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGryphonsAreDifferent">Our Gryphons Are Different</a>: Classic griffins, resembling the usual mix of lion and eagle with feathered ears, exist as Awakened animals of somewhat unclear origin, although they're somewhat tentatively classified as birds. They're solitary mountain-dwellers and prey chiefly on large hoofed mammals. A few additional variants are known to exist, generally created by additional magical mutation of the main griffin species.<ul><li> An Asian species exists that is distinguished by a scaly head and neck and a spiny fin running down its neck and back.</li><li> False griffins are largely identical to the normal kind, but lack wings and external ears.</li><li> The hieracosphinx resembles a griffin with a falcon-like head and vestigial wings, while the criosphinx resembles a hieracosphinx with lion ears and ram horns. They live only in the Serdarbulak Plateau in the Middle East and are believed to have diverged from regular griffins in the surge of magical transformations that came with the passing of Halley's Comet.</li><li> Heliodromus are mutant griffins with fully feline bodies and the wings and heads of vultures. They're opportunistic scavengers, waiting near freeways to glean roadkill, raiding graveyards, lurking around battlefields and sometimes picking through garbage dumps. They are also known to try to scare other creatures into dangerous situations by using their ability to induce supernatural fear, and will attack targets directly if they're especially hungry.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurHydrasAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurHydrasAreDifferent">Our Hydras Are Different</a>: Hydras are large, seven- or nine-headed dragon relatives native to Greece. They're fairly indiscriminate omnivores with a diet ranging from aquatic vegetation to cattle and humans. Of note, the different heads don't have distinct wills &mdash; the craniums only contain sensory ganglia; the real brain is at the base of the spine. There's a more aquatic species, the hydra-wyrm, which possesses gills and seal-like flippers on its hind limbs; while normally native to lakes and estuaries, it has been developing greater salt tolerance and spreading into the Aegean proper. The hydra-wyrm was the default hydra in the 2nd edition <em>Paranormal Animals of Europe</em> sourcebook that introduced hydras to <em>Shadowrun</em>, but was retconned into being a distinct aquatic variant in later material.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurManticoresAreSpinier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurManticoresAreSpinier">Our Manticores Are Spinier</a>: Martichoras are Awakened lions with vaguely-human like faces, multiple rows of teeth and tails bristling with barbed, venomous spines. They do not use their spines to hunt, though, and never eat prey they kill with them &mdash; they're immune to the venom, but apparently don't like the taste. Their prides are led by the females, unlike how regular lions operate. They prefer unspoiled and untainted environment and have a mild allergy to pollution.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurMermaidsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurMermaidsAreDifferent">Our Mermaids Are Different</a>: Merrows and mermaids are, respectively, Awakened seals and sea lions provided with arms and clawed and webbed hands (merrows have thumbs, mermaids do not), anthropoid upper bodies and long hair, although their faces are still those of pinnipeds. In mermaids, both sexes possess pronounced breasts. Merrows come in both salt- and freshwater varieties. Both species are found worldwide in warm and temperate seas, and mermaids are both highly tolerant and dependent on pollution &mdash; like several other Sixth World species, they reacted to rampant environmental degradation by becoming so well-adapted to it as to be unable to survive without it. In mermaids' case, they're entirely unable to survive without a constant intake of mercury in their diets.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurPerytonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurPerytonsAreDifferent">Our Perytons Are Different</a>': <em>Paranormal Animals of Europe</em> has peryton as winged deer as tall as a man at the shoulder, and found throughout Mediterranean and Eastern Europe. They possess enlarged incisors and claw-like hooves and both sexes have antlers, although the males' are larger. They're omnivorous and take prey as large as sheep, goats and lone humans. They don't hunt smaller animals because their favored hunting strategy, a headlong antlers-first divebomb, doesn't work too well with prey below a certain size, but they're smart enough to experiment with alternative hunting methods. Most people in their range consider them dangerous livestock thieves and potential man-eaters and go out of their way to hunt them down.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSphinxesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSphinxesAreDifferent">Our Sphinxes Are Different</a>: Hieraco- and criosphinxes are variants of griffins found only in the Serdarbulak Plateau in the Middle East, and are believed to have diverged from regular griffins in the surge of magical transformations that came with the passing of Halley's Comet. The hieracosphinx resembles a griffin with a falcon-like head and vestigial wings, while the criosphinx resembles a hieracosphinx with lion ears and ram horns.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">Our Vampires Are Different</a>: Metahumans infected with HMHVV strain I develop chronic Essence loss, an allergy to sunlight, and fast healing.

They're animals lacking the immense intelligence of true dragons, and aggressive predators. Two distinct species exist, one North American and one European, and they belong to the same genus as feathered serpents. Young dragons of any species, notably, look remarkably like wyverns &mdash; wings, no forelegs, stubby legs and stinger-tipped tails &mdash; only taking on their full draconic forms after a sort of metamorphosis, which has fueled in-universe speculation that wyverns may simply be dragons who failed to mature.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent">Our Zombies Are Different</a><ul><li> Light sensitive and something of the intelligent Romero type.

Results vary, but the cases that most resemble the zombie trope are the instances of imperfect integration that result in ragers and shamblers who's only thoughts are "kill" and "eat". In an interesting twist, headshots are the <em>worst</em> way to combat them; not only can the nanites regenerate even from a headshot, but due to the high concentration of nanites in the brain, brain splatter tends to be the most infectious part.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertOperative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertOperative">Overt Operative</a>: It is perfectly possible to play <em>Shadowrun</em> as a team of very combat-oriented runners who treat runs as protracted firefights with lots of cinematic cool stuff and explosions, with minimal legwork and pre-planning.

Most major players of the Sixth World accept losses from shadowrunners as part of the cost of doing business, and the odds they'll retaliate against you depends entirely on how big (and how public) said losses were.

One of the major magical groups, the Illuminates of the New Dawn, has a set of rules similar to the old rules for dueling with weapons. They include the challenged party being allowed to determine the terms of the duel, the dueling area being warded to prevent the spells from affecting bystanders, and the presence of seconds and a judge to keep things orderly. The opposing magicians are sworn to accept the outcome of the duel, such as resolving the dispute between them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolfMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolfMan">Wolf Man</a>: The "Loup Garou" critter is a human infected with a virus that increases hair growth and recedes his gums, making his teeth look like fangs. His murderous activities aren't linked to the full moon, but follow an even 28-day cycle.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Wretched Hive</a>: Pretty much every city, the poorer sections especially.<ul><li> The default setting, Seattle, has the Barrens.</li><li> The <em>Denver: The City of Shadows</em> boxed set describes the Warrens this way.</li><li> El Infierno (part of Los Angeles) in the <em>California Free State</em> supplement, was a massive slum where the city's poor had been walled off and left to their fate; predictably, it soon fell into chaos and gang rule; a massive radioactive spill didn't help matters. This lasted until the twin earthquakes and subsequent flood of 2069 described in 4th Edition's <em>Corporate Enclaves</em> supplement. Then it went <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">From Bad to Worse</a>: two thirds of the LA sprawl are now flooded and demon-possessed corpses often lurk in the ruins. Also, the water is extremely toxic and inhabited by all kinds of nasty fauna. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsEvenWorseWithSharks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsEvenWorseWithSharks">Including giant sharks</a>.</li><li> Feral cities &mdash; urban sprawls where order and government have completely broken down &mdash; invariably become this as crime goes on unchecked, gangs take over and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">MegaCorps</a> do as they please.<ul><li> Lagos is horribly polluted, choked with garbage and refuse, run by a coalition of the most powerful gangs and a haven for smuggling and piracy. The organ trade is also well-established there &mdash; if you're out alone at night, a mugging is the least of your worries.</li><li> The Genoa-Milan-Turin sprawl &mdash; GeMiTo for short &mdash; became this after most of Mediterranean Europe's nations went to pieces and the massive urban conglomeration was left on its own. The city governments quickly collapsed, leaving the decaying urban mass to the mercies of gangs, the Mafia and whichever neighborhood groups could defend themselves from the formers. The mega-city still isn't formally part of any nation and entirely lawless outside of corporate enclaves and a few well-defended neighborhoods, and the Mafia-run port of Genoa is one of Europe's main smuggling hotspots.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago">Chicago</a> becomes a <em>literal</em> Wretched Hive after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BugWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BugWar">particularly nasty incident with some bug spirits</a> transforms it into a field of ruins inhabited by roving gangs, survivor holdouts, nests of ghouls and surviving insect spirit hives.</li></ul></li><li> 4th Edition introduces the Kowloon Walled City of Hong Kong. It's so horrifically bad that even the <em>insect spirits</em> can't get a foothold there &mdash; the Yama Kings eat them. The only insect spirit that's gotten a chance is the Ebony Queen Vam Ly.</li><li> Ironically inverted with Detroit: unlike the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Detroit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Detroit">real life</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViceCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViceCity">version</a>, the Motor City in the <em>Shadowrun</em> universe is one of the safest and most prosperous cities in the UCAS thanks to Ares Macrotechnology and its security division Knight Errant gaining a foothold in the metroplex (it helps that their headquarters is located there, which is a major reason why Detroit is kept from degenerating into debasement). There's still some criminal activity running around, but it is far more contained compared to the rest of the cities in the UCAS.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit">Xanatos Gambit</a>: Why you should never deal with a dragon; they always win even if it looks like they've lost. A runner in the <em>Threats</em> book brags that he got one over on Lofwyr, but lost his entire team on the job. He's found dead a week later. Another runner does some digging on the details and discovers that the <em>entire run</em> was a setup: Lofwyr wanted that specific shadowrunning team to do the job (they had all worked against Saeder-Krupp in the past), S-K owned the pharmaceutical lab through a number of shell companies (which had been recently insured against theft), the paydata was bunk (Lofwyr thought he would copy it instead of destroying it as ordered, which made Shiawase waste time and money after they got it), and S-K got to field-test a device to control <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanisMajor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanisMajor">fenrir</a> against them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">Yakuza</a>: They're pretty damn successful, too. By accident, a Yakuza front company actually began making more money through legitimate business than crime, and eventually became one of the more famous Triple-A corps. And in true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Mega-Corp</a> style, Mitsuhama Computer Technologies has thanked its Yakuza progenitors by largely forgetting that they exist, except for doing them the occasional minor favor. As the <em>Corporate Shadowfiles</em> supplement put it, "Why should the directors of MCT risk a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck">multi-billion nuyen corporation</a> to help beef up a multi-<em>million</em> nuyen crime syndicate?"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AYearAndADay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AYearAndADay">A Year and a Day</a><ul><li> 3rd Edition supplement <em>Magic in the Shadows</em>. A hermetic mage can bind an elemental to guard a site for a year and a day, unless the elemental is killed in astral combat or banished.</li><li> In 2033, according to the <em>Blood in the Boardroom</em> supplement, the Great Dragon Dunkelzahn bound the Free Spirit Buttercup to the body of an ork for a year and a day to teach her a lesson in fundamental equality of all life forms.</li><li> <em>Portfolio of a Dragon: Dunkelzahn's Secrets</em>. One of Dunkelzahn's bequests was for an ally spirit to maintain a constant telepathic link with Stefan Rubloff for a year and a day. It was to assist him as needed during that time.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDirtyRat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDirtyRat">You Dirty Rat!</a>:<ul><li> Devil rats are a species of hairless Awakened rats resistant to most poisons, capable of controlling normal rats, highly aggressive and prone to attacking people, and reputedly intelligent enough to be malicious in how they hunt.</li><li> Demon rats are a further variant that mutated from devil rats during the Year of the Comet, distinguished from devil rats by possessing fur, short horns and corrosive saliva, but retaining their ancestors' vicious attitudes and immunity to poison. They also possess opposable thumbs and are smart enough to open latches and simple doors, and are chiefly predatory animals who only scavenge when all else fails. Additional variants of demon rats exist, including one that carries the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague">VITAS</a> virus and another capable of regeneration.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">You Have Outlived Your Usefulness</a>: Some runs will usually have a Mr. Johnson with an agenda who eventually turns on his employees after they fulfilled their duties to twist and complicate the deal even further.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode">Your Head Asplode</a><ul><li> Cranial bombs and manabolts.</li><li> The first two tests of spiritual neurosurgery described in <em>Stolen Souls</em> ended when the patients' heads exploded due to the intracranial pressure of having a spirit manifest inside the skull during the procedure. The last one died because the pressure crushed a cerebral artery instead.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeartsDesire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeartsDesire">Your Heart's Desire</a>: The Awakened creature ability called "Desire Reflection". It allows the creature to know the greatest desire of another being and trick that being into believing that the creature is that thing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal">Your Mind Makes It Real</a>: Justified: in the Matrix, most legitimate users use cold ASIST (Artificial Sensory Induction Systems Technology), which is exponentially better than current state-of-the-art interfaces and just as safe to use. High-end users such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCracker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCracker">deckers</a> and computer security people use hot ASIST, a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Synchronization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Synchronization">Synchronization</a> which turns them into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technopath">Technopaths</a> while making it possible to fry each other's brains with combat software.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YowiesAndBunyipsAndDropBearsOhMy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YowiesAndBunyipsAndDropBearsOhMy">Yowies and Bunyips and Drop Bears, Oh My</a>:<ul><li> Bunyips are immense marsupials with large noses and a keen sense of smell. They're bearlike omnivores, chiefly feeding on plants and small creatures but quite capable of tackling large prey should they feel like doing so. They also have envenomed claws that make their targets hypersensitive to sunlight.</li><li> Drop bears are Awakened koalas that have gained sharp claws and a taste for meat, although they still need some eucalyptus in their diets, and hunt by dropping on prey from high in the trees. They're also carriers of HMHVV-II, the virus that causes lycanthropy in humans; they're not infected themselves, but survivors of drop bear attacks often contract the condition.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zeerust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zeerust">Zeerust</a><ul><li> The First Edition came out in 1989, which the worldbuilding reflects. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryMarchesOn">History Marches On</a> has rendered the game's "near future" an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Alternate History</a>. With each new edition, the game has updated itself every few years to reflect current technological advances, which has the side effect of making the Sixth World's technological advances appear simultaneously futuristic and five years out of date. And to be fair, it's hard to notice the "five years out of date part" on your gear when it's the only thing standing between you and getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatenAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatenAlive">Eaten Alive</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BugWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BugWar">Insect Spirits</a>. Updates rarely make major alterations to established continuity, instead portraying the changes as normal technological advancement in the game world. This has the unintentional effect of portraying a future in which wireless technology will go out of popular usage for several decades, before again rising to prominence. The most current materials made for Shadowrun generally present the most "believable" future, whereas history gets less believable as you go back.</li><li> As of <em>Rigger 5.0</em>, the rigger rulebook for 5th edition, characters have, in-universe, acknowledged that electronic technology has scarcely improved in half a century. The blame is generally laid on the two global network crashes and the worldwide chaos of the Awakening, which collectively destroyed a great deal of knowledge, made everybody wary of computers that were <em>too</em> accessible, and shifted the focus of technological research. Medical science became a big winner in that department.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieAdvocate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieAdvocate">Zombie Advocate</a>: There are a few groups fighting for the rights of ghouls, but to be fair, not all ghouls are serial-killing cannibals. The exceptions are either feral or just plain evil. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VegetarianVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VegetarianVampire">ethical solution</a> is to eat the already dead or just old severed body parts, because ghouls can only survive on metahuman flesh; despite Dunkelzahn's efforts, there's still no substitute for it. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieAdvocate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieAdvocate">Zombie Advocate</a> agenda has won, enough that ghouls can be PCs now. Not <em>fun</em> PCs, but still PCs.<ul><li> Ghouls have established their own nation of Asamando in West Africa, which feeds itself by porting in the dead from combat zones in neighboring nations. Some see it as a horror show made real, others see it as a step towards progress for ghouls. That said, Asamando is actually fairly well-developed for its part of the world and quite accepting of other awakened metasapients.<ul><li> Come 5e &amp; the pendulum swings the other way; an infected-supremacist political terrorist group, Fear the Dark, has begun launching attacks all over the world, the virus has mutated to make infected hungrier, more prone to mutation &amp; going feral, the dark side of Asamando is becoming more public knowledge<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note66jl3');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note66jl3" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note66jl3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Importing the dead from other countries wasn't enough to feed their booming population, so they also began importing condemned criminals &amp; slaves to keep as their own chatteled slave population, breeding their own feedstock. When the slave prisons were discovered by U.N. inspectors, the slaves rioted(called the "Food Riots"), and the riots were quelled by the prison staff releasing the contained feral population that had been grossly under reported, killing the inspectors &amp; costing Asamando its chance for U.N. recognition &amp; torpedoing its public image.</span>, and a new wave of anti-infected legislation &amp; corporate policies are sweeping the world, with public opinion changing back towards "monster". Infected remain playable options, but "nuke Asamando" is becoming a more mainstream opinion.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><hr>
