It typically centers on the lives of Magi, powerful wizards belonging to the Order of Hermes, and the various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">mundane</a> folk in their lives. While several details about the world change, sometimes drastically, from edition to edition, the same basic premise applies: the Order is a secret society in a world that believes in magic, founded by the apprentice of a wizard who first developed a unified magic theory and a general defense against magic, the Parma Magica. There are twelve Houses (with a missing thirteenth), each focusing on a particular area of study that the House founder excelled in originally. As of 5th Edition, each of the Houses is also grouped into one of three structures: True Lineages (members must be able to trace their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterApprenticeChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterApprenticeChain">Master-Apprentice Chain</a> back to the House's founder), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteryCult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteryCult">Mystery Cults</a> (members must be initiated into the House via special rites), and Societates (anyone who shares the House's ideology may join). The Houses are as follows:</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Houses&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism">Bjornaer</a></strong> (Mystery Cult): Shapeshifting magi who can change into the form of their "Heart-Beast" (or, in the case of an inanimate, natural object, a "Heart-Shape"). They are descended from a Pomeranian Bear-witch named Birna and practice secret magical rites at their Domus Magnus Crintera every twelve years.<p></p></li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardClassic">Bonisagus</a></strong> (True Lineage): The Founder of the Order, though his apprentice Trianoma did most of the leg work. Originally wrote the Hermetic Magic Theory, which is the magic system based on the Platonic forms the book uses and that all Hermetic Magi are expected to know, if not use. Those who consider themselves Followers of Bonisagus are more interested in the study of magic; the Followers of Trianoma are more politically-minded. Either way, they have a natural prestige within the Order due to their Lineage.<p></p></li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadDreamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadDreamer">Criamon</a></strong> (Mystery Cult): Magi who pursue The Enigma as the path to true wisdom and power, often prone to prophecy and using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">unusual logic</a> to solve puzzles and riddles. Most insist that the Order is doomed on one level or another.<p></p></li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Druid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Druid">Diedne</a></strong> (Undefined): Druids who were canonically wiped out during the Schism War and and are source of fear and suspicion even now; early editions simply mention the house as existing at one point, but they provide no information beyond "You cannot play a member of House Diedne" and a Flaw that means Quaesitors suspect your predecessors of being Diedne. Later editions provide rules for Diedne Magic, and detailed history regarding the causes of the Schism War itself (suspicions of human-sacrifice and devil worship, coupled with the house's insular and secretive nature, the nominally Christian allegiance of the rest of the Order, and House Tremere pushing its own agenda against them).<p></p></li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits">Ex Miscellanea</a></strong> (Societas): Originally created as a "rival Order" to the Order of Hermes, but it didn't quite get there. Many of its mages only nominally practice Hermetic Magic, and it's home to several "converted" hedge-wizards. Most (but not all) members do practice Hermetic Magic, albeit coloured by their earlier training, but as members of the Order they are taught the Parma Magica.<p></p></li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Flambeau</a></strong> (Societas): Battle-hungry pyromaniacs who love fire and warfare; probably the most mercenary of the Houses. Later editions have down-played the pyromania and bloodlust, with mixed reaction from fans of the house. Many members of the House specialize as Hoplites (battle-magi who guard Quaesitors from harm and enforce their decisions).<p></p></li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByTheBookCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByTheBookCop">Guernicus</a></strong> (True Lineage): Also known as House Quaesitoris; Order-keepers and judges, effectively the police. In later editions Quaesitors may come from any House, but the lineage of Guernicus remains dominant due to Guernicus' vow at the First Tribunal.<p></p></li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDandy">Jerbiton</a></strong> (Societas): Socially-oriented mages who love things like high society, the arts, and the Church. Most of the House's apprentices are acquired from noble houses, and sometimes even retain their mundane lives once out of apprenticeship.<p></p></li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Mercere</a></strong> (True Lineage): Primarily messengers and the Hermetic equivalent of the Pony Express; most of the House is comprised of mundanes. The Founder Mercere lost his Gift and took up the useful position of messenger. The Gifted members of House Mercere tend to focus on the arts of Creo and Muto and frequently possess the Mercurian Magic virtue.<p></p></li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyTales">Merinita</a></strong> (Mystery Cult): Split into two camps the same way Bonisagus is, with Followers of Merinita focusing on Nature magic, and Followers of Quendalon focusing on Faerie magic. This gives them some trouble, as molesting the Faeries is against Hermetic law. In addition to giving them access to unique RDT parameters, Merinita magi are less inconvenienced by Faerie Auras than other Magi.<p></p></li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">Tremere</a></strong> (True Lineage): Rigidly hierarchical and focused strongly on various aspects of war, especially strategy, and notorious for moving sheer numbers across tribunals to gain the majority vote in order to block unfavorable laws from being passed. They operate under strict codes of dominance and submission, and often are not considered trustworthy by the rest of the Order due to their trying to take over the Order. They are usually written as the primary instigators of the Schism War.<p></p></li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly">Tytalus</a></strong> (Societas): <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster">The Trickster</a> House. Tytalus philosophy states that only conflict can inspire growth, and so they constantly test themselves (and others, whether they like it or not) in various ways, sometimes referred to as The Game. This eventually led to the House's corruption when they tried to outwit the Devil, resulting in widespread diabolism.<p></p></li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius">Verditius</a></strong> (Mystery Cult): Natural artificers who are inept with Formulaic magic, requiring casting tools where other magi of the Order need none; they produce most of the magic items in the Order and are the beating heart of its economy.</li></ul></div><p>The Order of Hermes itself is richly political, with laws governing how Magi must conduct themselves toward each other while at court (Tribunal) and just in general, with secrecy and the right to power being primary tenets of the vow taken by mages at the completion of their apprenticeship.</p><p>It was one of the first examples of a Troupe system: early editions recommended that the players collaborate to create the campaign world and story. Each player would have an opportunity to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">Story Guide</a>, and each player would have more than one character, so that if they felt their main character would not go on an adventure (for example, if they were busy with their research) a secondary character may be used. The game was developed by Jonathan Tweet and Mark Rein&middot;Hagen of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness">World of Darkness</a></em> fame and if you look, you will find traces of <em>Ars Magica</em> in the Classic WOD - particularly the Order of Hermes mages and the Tremere vampires. The magic system of <em>Ars Magica</em> is generic, based on a combination of Forms and Techniques (to create fire, you'd use the form Ignem for fire and the Technique Creo for create together) and very intuitive. It's also one of the few magic systems that allowed for spontaneous spellcasting, allowing the player to use magic off the top of their head to perform specific tasks, rather than limiting magical ability to a shopping list of immutable conditions and effects.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Had an unsuccessful <a class="urllink" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blackchickenstudios/ars-magica-video-game">Kickstarter<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> towards a computer game version.</p><p></p><hr><h2><em>Ars Magica</em> provides examples of:</h2><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a>:<ul><li> While no wizard's apprenticeship is easy (9 months of virtual slavery for 3 months of teaching) the mages of House Tytalus deliberately strive to put their apprentices through the wringer in pursuit of their house's philosophy. Of course, they consider it justified in order to teach their apprentices to question and challenge all rules and to create the kind of resentment that an apprentice needs to initiate the conflict with his master that will mark his Gauntlet (test for full wizard status), a conflict which can continue, sporadically, until the death of one or the other if the master particularly values the former apprentice.</li><li> The 4th edition supplement <em>The Wizard's Grimoire</em> includes a list of Hermetic legal trials, one of which regards a magus who tortured and murdered his last three apprentices. The court ruled that the apprentices were his to do with as he pleased, and so he had not committed a crime.</li><li> The "Tormenting Master" flaw generally results in this. Once a year, your parens takes a two-week vacation, during which they devote one hundred percent of their free time to finding some way to ruin your life. Tytalus mages might as well have it tattooed across their backsides.</li><li> Sadly, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryPunchableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryPunchableMan">negative effect</a> of the Gift can cause a Gifted child's parents to abuse or neglect them, though their love might be able to allow them to overcome it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddictiveMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddictiveMagic">Addictive Magic</a>:<ul><li> Magic Addiction is a Flaw that can force whoever has it to cast spell after spell until they exhaust themselves into unconsciousness.</li><li> Aurulentus of Jerbiton came up with an spell in order to relieve his wife's numerous aches and pains, but stopped using it after it turned out that the sensation of even minor discomforts returning after it wore off became unbearable, thus making the spell addictive.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlbinosAreFreaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlbinosAreFreaks">Albinos are Freaks</a>: Albinism is one of the options for the 5<sup>th</sup> Edition "Disfigured" flaw, which substantially penalizes dice rolls related to appearance and getting respect from people. An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingNickname">Embarrassing Nickname</a> is also suggested.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause">Alien Non-Interference Clause</a>: The Code of Hermes forbids a magus to "interfere with the affairs of mundanes and thereby bring ruin upon my sodales [fellow magi]." What this actually means gets complicated, varies from Tribunal to Tribunal (you can get away with a <em>lot</em> more in Normandy than in the Greater Alps), and is often decided based on one's reputation and political connections. This section of the Code receives more attention from the game designers than most, because any decent group of player magi are going to treat it like toilet paper (which was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> heavily in <em>Transforming Mythic Europe</em>).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue">All Myths Are True</a>: The same Divine power that protects the Christian Church from magic also protects Jews and Muslims. This, naturally, gives the Church fits.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofAlly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofAlly">Aloof Ally</a>: Guernicus the Founder was not really on board with the creation of the Order of Hermes, and only accepted his post (and by extension, that of his filii) as Quaesitor to help ensure that the Order would be used as a tool to protect magi rather than drag them into the Order's political agendas.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalsHateHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalsHateHim">Animals Hate Him</a>: The Gift,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ueb7');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0ueb7" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ueb7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The potential for magical ability.

No other tradition has anything close (except for True Faith, which can't be taught, certain divine magic feats, and an application of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArsGoetia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArsGoetia">Ars Goetia</a></em>), and any tradition that <em>could</em> would immediately face the full might of the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JoinOrDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JoinOrDie">Join or Die</a>" policy.</li><li> The Lancea Magica was a breakthrough that allowed any magus to freely penetrate the Parma with a lethal spell. For obvious reasons, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatWereYouThinking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatWereYouThinking">this was forbidden immediately</a> and the inventor burned his Lab Text. It's lost forever. Really.</li><li> Conscentia of Bonisagus was once commissioned to make an small kitchen knife that could both penetrate the Parma Magica <em>and</em> temporarily disable a mage's ability to cast it again. She <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsentMindedProfessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsentMindedProfessor">got halfway through it</a> before she realized that she'd been eagerly designing a weapon meant specifically for the purpose of assassinating mages.

Incidentally, it is <em>perfectly legal</em> to stop a prosecution under the Code of Hermes by declaring Wizard's War against the prosecutor and killing him before the Tribunal, even if that prosecutor is himself a Quaesitor. The latter is tantamount to suicide unless you're of godlike power, however.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArabianNightsDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArabianNightsDays">"Arabian Nights" Days</a>: While typically set in Mythic Europe, the game frequently includes elements of this trope either due to the influence of Islamic culture upon European scholastics and the Fourth Crusade (and Reconquista). In particular, the 4th Edition supplement "Blood and Sand" covers the Levant while the 5th Edition book "The Cradle and the Crescent" details the Arabian Peninsula, Mesopotamia, Persia, and Transoxiana.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a>: <em>Lords of Men</em> and <em>City and Guild</em> talk about marriages for nobles and merchants, respectively (the Order has no cultural position on marriage). Nobles normally marry at their parents' bidding, but a woman who inherits land on her own normally <em>immediately</em> becomes a prize for their liege to give to a younger son or supporter, as an effective means of granting land. (Forced marriages are illegal by Church law, but try telling a nobleman that.) Rich merchants also often have arranged marriages, <em>but</em> marital love is expected as part of the deal for the middle class in a way that's not the case for nobles. Furthermore, merchants often have significant trouble coming up with dowries and appropriate husbands for their marriageable daughters.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtfulDodger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtfulDodger">The Artful Dodger</a>: There are an array of sample childhoods involving being raised by thieves which may be chosen during character creation.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">Artificial Human</a>: It's mentioned in one book that doing this should be possible for Hermetic magic, sidestepping the sterility caused by the longevity ritual.

Social interactions between Gifted individuals and the mundane are especially difficult. Mundane animals are also greatly unsettled by the presence of someone with The Gift. If you don't have the Gift, then you can't learn hermetic magic. There are other types of magic that can be learned. For instance, the magi of the Order of Solomon, rather than cast spells themselves, summon djinn to do their magic for them, although the non-Gifted use their magic at a significant disadvantage. In addition, there are several possible ways to get the Gift if you're not born with it, but they're all either dangerous, come with strings attached, or otherwise generate stories.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalCurrency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalCurrency">Global Currency</a>: The mundane economy runs on Mythic Pounds, which are equal to a pound of silver (and usually take the form of such). This is an explicit abstraction; medieval currency and silver debasement are bewilderingly complex subjects that rarely generate good stories, and most places don't trade in currency directly anyway.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Gnosticism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Gnosticism">Gnosticism</a>: This period was the last hurrah for the Gnostic religions. In <em>Ars Magica</em>, they're about evenly divided between true Divine religions (such as Catharism) and Infernalist Dark Gnosticism. The latter includes Gnostic Luciferianism and those Gnostics who believe that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadIsGoodAndGoodIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadIsGoodAndGoodIsBad">Bad is Good and Good is Bad</a> and that the commission of sin is virtuous.

The Divine Aura, a.k.a. the Dominion, grows and is spread by places of worship such as churches, mosques, and synagogues, as well as sites of major miracles. However, it can also appear spontaneously in areas such as high mountains and other areas considered "holy". This is known as the Empyrean, and is active w/out human worship. Also, the monotheistic God has an unlimited Might Score, so He can do anything, and whatever He does cannot be resisted. He is not dependent upon human worship.</li><li> Creatures of magic, including gods, are defined in large part by not needing human worship or caring all that much about humans. However, magical beings (specifically Daimons) can gain power and benefits from theurgic rites dedicated to them. Some take advantage of this, others don't.</li><li> While all immortal magi have to take special measures to grow and develop (since immortality, by its nature, makes you highly resistant to any form of change), Daimonic magi are the only ones who do so by casting spells and performing other "miracles" for mortal worshipers. This gets them Daimon Points, which they can either spend on bumping their stats and learning new abilities... or trade with other Daimons in what passes for a godly economy.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatBigLibraryOfEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatBigLibraryOfEverything">Great Big Library of Everything</a>: Just about any book relating to magic or the Order of Hermes can be found at Durenmar, the original covenant of the Order.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">Green-Eyed Monster</a>: One aspect of the negative effects of the Gift makes the affected person feel about the Gifted individual as though they had some sort of greater privilege the affected person would <em>love</em>, but obtained in some underhanded way.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a>: Aurulentus of Jerbiton's wife Semira his is True Love (as in the Character Creation Virtue), have been and will be together for decades, and many of the spells and devices he's invented were specifically for the purpose of making her happy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHashshashin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHashshashin">The Hashshashin</a>: Presented largely historically, but mixed with magic as well.

What the Mongols are in this setting is unclear; they could just be a mundane horde (undoubtedly backed by shamanistic sorcerers), but it's entirely possible that they're the literal Scourge of God (either composed of demons or angels). As a third option, however, Genghis Khan could be the sworn servant of the Great Tengri, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurTitansAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurTitansAreDifferent">primal titan</a> of Steppe and Sky.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleHousing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleHousing">Horrible Housing</a>: Characters' living conditions affect their aging dice rolls.

Their True Name (the one given to them by their parents at birth), their apprentice name (used by their master during apprenticeship) and then the Hermetic Name (which they choose for themselves after their apprenticeship is complete). This is all because the True Name is an extremely powerful weapon in the hands of one's enemies, particularly non-Hermetic ones. Demons are especially susceptible to the use of their True Names, and invoking a Demon's true name against them usually doubles the effectiveness of whatever spell or command is being used. In 5th edition, knowing the True Name of a demon (or angel) counts as an ability and forms a powerful (x5) Arcane Connection to it. It should also be noted that, according to <em>Realms of Power: The Divine</em>, a character's Baptismal Name cannot be used as a Sympathetic Connection.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalProcreationClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalProcreationClause">Immortal Procreation Clause</a>: The Hermetic Longevity Ritual sterilizes the recipient, as do most other versions (the Solomonic Al-Iksir being an exception, like many things Solomonic). In addition, the Gift does not follow bloodlines, so a magus is likely to outlive any children they do have. At least one mage (Aurulentus of Jerbiton) created a Longevity Ritual which preserved the fertility of himself and his wife. This was necessary because he was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalSeventhSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalSeventhSon">Magical Seventh Son</a> who needed to sire seven sons himself to continue his Gifted lineage.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JoinOrDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JoinOrDie">Join or Die</a>: The official stance of the Order of Hermes towards rival magicians with the Gift.

They've been behind most of the conflicts with non-Hermetic magi, and enthusiastically supported the Schism War.

Other languages used based on magical tradition include Gothic for House Bjornaer and Pictish for the Gruagachan. Classic Greek, as opposed to Romaic Greek, is used by members of the Order of Hermes in the Tribunal of Thebes. In very few cases is the language itself actually magical, but when all of the Order's books and spells are written in Latin, you'd best know the language.</li><li> Pictish, for the Gruagachan, is the exception to the rule that the language isn't magical. The dead language of the Picts is a sacred liturgical tongue that's as important to the Gruagachan as Magic Theory is to the Order of Hermes.</li><li> The Ars Notoria is written in four dead languages, each of which is written in a different script. Translating the book would destroy its magic, so a would-be reader of the Key of Solomon must be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CunningLinguist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CunningLinguist">Cunning Linguist</a> before even unlocking the first of seven tiers of power.</li><li> The Futhark Runes of the Old Norse language are very much magical, being the core of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself">Norse Rune Magic</a>.</li><li> Adamic, the first language, spoken by Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden, is very powerful for magi. One of the benefits is that Anyone who is able to learn it is able to "name" things, allowing the magi to immediately form an Arcane Connection with the named, which boosts any spells used on the target. Of course, learning Adamic is very difficult since it is largely a dead language. It can only be learned in three ways: 1) you can try to study and reconstruct the language by researching ancient languages (much like how modern linguists reconstruct Proto-Indo-European by studying Indo-European languages), which requires to you to find the Tower of Babylon and study the various ancient languages, 2) Somehow sneak into the Garden of Eden and learn from the animals who speak in the Garden, or 3) Find Cain (Cain the Murderer) and convince him, somehow, to teach you.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Large Ham</a>: one of the advantages of playing a 'grog' as opposed to a major character, according to the 5th edition rulebook, is that it's acceptable to chew on the scenery a little.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LayeredWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LayeredWorld">Layered World</a>: In addition to the mundane material world, there are four other planes of existence known as Realms of Power. Each superantural power or creature is associated with one Realm. Each realm interacts with the others in unique ways. In alphabetical order:<ul><li> The Divine Realm: a.k.a. Heaven, the True Empyrean. The realm of the monotheistic, omnipotent God (in game terms, he has an unlimited Might score, meaning that He can do whatever He wants, and that a direct Miracle cannot be stopped) of Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism, as well as monotheistic cults like that of Sol Invictus. It is also the home angels and divine messengers, saints, and the righteous dead. In keeping with medieval popular cosmology, the Divine is associated with any trans-lunar celestial phenomena, such as the Sun, stars, and planets. Heaven proper lies beyond the lunar sphere, and is therefore beyond the reach of Magi. The Divine appears to encourage moral and virtuous behavior and is absolutely opposed to all things Infernal. In terms of realm interactions, the Divine is the most powerful. The Divine Aura diminishes Magical Powers, considerably diminishes Faerie Powers even more, and practically cripples Infernal powers. Divine powers are not penalized by other realms. It's Aura, known as the Dominion, is associated with holy sites such as churches and mosques, the sites of miracles, as well as naturally occurring holy grounds such as mountain tops. Since the Dominion also penalizes Hermetic magic, getting around it is a major (but not impossible) challenge for magi.</li><li> The Faerie Realm: The realm of Faerie is the realm of the subjective perception and personal journeys, a constant change that reshapes reality in the most exciting way, only to tell an inspiring story. Whereas the Magic Realm is the static realm of archetypes, the Faerie Realm is a chaotic place that revolves around the creation of stories and narratives. It is the home of Faeries, which include many of the polytheistic deities and spirits of non-monotheistic traditions. Faeries are attracted to, and are in many ways defined by, the beliefs and stories of humanity. Faerie Auras manifest in old pagan temples and sacred sites, and in areas in which stories are set: The more popular and widely known the story, the stronger the aura. Faeries themselves are creatively void, and seek to "play" with humans, often trying to mimic human behavior, all in an effort to experience something new. Realm interactions: Faerie Powers are mildly enhanced by Magic Auras, and are diminished by the Infernal, and heavily diminished by the Divine. Faerie Auras enhance Magic Powers, diminish Infernal Powers, and does not affect Divine Powers. Faeries are vulnerable to iron and obsessed with oaths. Magi are wary of doing any deals with the Fae.</li><li> The Infernal Realm: a.k.a. Hell. The embodiment of evil and entropy-of physical and moral corruption and the negative counterpart to the Divine. The realm of the Adversary (Satan to Christianity, Iblis in Islam, etc.) and the demons and devils and the damned. Hell is associated with chthonic areas, dark places, lawless regions, as well as sights of atrocities and desecrated holy places. The Infernal encourages immoral and unethical behavior, and Infernal creatures often tempt mortals with Faustian pacts. In terms of realm interactions: the Infernal Auras diminishes Magic powers, and Faerie powers to a lesser extent, whilst unaffecting Divine Powers. Infernal powers are diminished by Magical and Faerie auras, and are heavily crippled by Divine Aura. Whilst many magi may attempt to fight demons, the Order as a whole is careful not to declare all out war on the Infernal, lest Hell unite to destroy the magi.</li><li> The Magical Realm: In contrast to the Faerie Realm, which is all about personal journeys and subjective stories, the Magical Realm is the objective realm of pure Platonic archetypes, of idealized objects already in existence. Whereas the Faeries are addicted to, and dependent on, human creativity and narratives, the inhabitants of the Magical Realm are more idealized forms of already existent mundane objects and natural phenomena and mundane creatures ("beasts of virtue"), and they tend to be indifferent to humans unless directly confronted. The realm of Magic is home to elemental spirits, as well as humans that have turned into spirits that may have become deities worshiped by humans. Magical Auras often appear at random, although they may show up after the working of powerful magic or the death of a powerful creature, places acquire a magical aura, but most of the time it is unclear why a certain place is magical. Realm interactions: Magical Auras have no effect on Divine Power, slightly enhance Faerie Power, and diminish Infernal Power. Magical Powers are diminished by the Infernal, heavily diminished by the Divine, and is slightly enhanced by Faerie. All magi have a connection to the Magical Realm thanks to their Gift. Some magi are able to ascend into becoming daimons, powerful spirits that depend upon their mortal followers in order to interact with the mortal realm.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleBitBeastly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleBitBeastly">Little Bit Beastly</a>: Muto Corpus spells can allow the subject to only partially transform into an animal, such as growing a squirrel's tail.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLived" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLived">Long-Lived</a>: It's fairly common for magical traditions to have some form of life extension, including Hermetic magi. Most such rituals come with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalProcreationClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalProcreationClause">sterility</a> as a side-effect, however. Furthermore, most forms of magic have a final Warping that leads to the wizard either disappearing from reality, dying, losing all of their supernatural powers or going irrevocably insane after too much magic use, so the practical limit on lifespan is about 150 years, barring some way around this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a>:<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">Defied</a> in the optional "Silver Consensus" regulation on magically creating wealth. The rule is that only two pounds of magically-created silver (this is a lot of money) may be traded to mundanes per magus per year. Creating gold and gems for trade instead is not only still punishable, but the magi responsible will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga">mocked for being so utterly unoriginal</a>.</li><li> Hermetic magi swear not to "interfere with the affairs of mundanes and thereby bring ruin on my sodales" (i.e.: other magi), on pain of death. However, depending on the region and the specific interference, the second half of the vow tends to undermine the first &mdash; if mundanes disappear or meet unfortunate accidents in ways that don't bring the Order into disrepute, then, well, that's just a pity.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a>: <em>Ancient Magic</em> is about extinct magical traditions that might be integrated into the Hermetic system, if the PCs can find their lost items and lab texts.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientistLaboratory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientistLaboratory">Mad Scientist Laboratory</a>: Magi have laboratories that are modified over time to give the characters bonuses.

While his forebears relied on charm or love spells/mind control to sire seven sons, Aurulentus decided to specialize in fertility and making childbirth easier on his wife, as well as extending their fertile years with a variant Longevity Ritual. He also came up with a number of spells based around child care. Aurulentus is the fifth, meaning his seventh grandson would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a>, but unfortunately for Aurulentus, his own seventh son (Arbus Tutus) doesn't seem interested in having more children than his two daughters...and doesn't seem too keen on women at all, actually.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalSociety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalSociety">Magical Society</a>: The Order of Hermes is the main one in the game, including the most powerful and numerous of magic users in Mythic Europe. Within the Order itself are several more distinct magtical societies, including the houses of the Order (listed above), mystery cults (four of which are also houses), leagues, and various individual magical traditions. There are still societies of magical traditions that exist outside the Order as well, some in Mythic Europe and some without. Likely the largest of these is the Order of Suleiman in the Mythic Middle East (which is roughly five times the size of the Order of Hermes, though its individual magicians are weaker). Some magical societies have members both within and without of the Order of Hermes, but these tend to be relatively small groups.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a>:<ul><li> Given the setting, magical technology is not a part of current standard Hermetic practice, but it's probably only a matter of time. <em>Transforming Mythic Europe</em> has an entire chapter on the subject of magic as technology, and mentions self-propelled plows and wheels and suggests how they might be useful to replace wind or water power.</li><li> House Verditius' Automata are magitech <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClockPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClockPunk">Clock Punk</a> robots.

Exactly what is going on is unclear.</li><li> Several supplements go into detail about how setting up a working magocracy could be done. On a smaller scale, most covenants include magical servants, and many hold land and assets in their own right. The main problem is that doing this is likely to run afoul of the Code's provisions against interfering with mundanes.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeSomeNoise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeSomeNoise">Make Some Noise</a>: The <em>Imaginem</em> magical form manipulates the five senses, including sound. Practitioners can create, control, or suppress sound in an area or around specific targets; this can be as blatant as trapping someone's voice in a sack, or as subtle as modifying the voice to sound especially noble and authoritative.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterApprenticeChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterApprenticeChain">Master-Apprentice Chain</a>: One of the core pillars of Hermetic society is the teaching link, and second only to Code and Covenant in importance. Every magus is nominally descended, parens to fidelius, from the Founder of one of the Twelve (or Thirteen) Houses, although adoption is common from outside the Order; only four Houses (Bonisagus, Guernicus, Mercere, Tremere) require direct descent. This is part of the basis for Hermetic social structure - if your master is revealed to have betrayed his oath, you have a legal problem. Further, if you go bad, your master has already sworn to hunt you down and slay you.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalEuropeanFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalEuropeanFantasy">Medieval European Fantasy</a>: The game is literally a fantastic medieval Europe, with the typical campaign starting spring A.D. 1200, but oddly it more subverts this trope than supports it, due to the level of detail and 'reality' of the various campaign source books looking at medieval politics and society. The supplement books that don't focus on the Order and its magic are about as accurate and informative as any regular general-history book, 4th edition's <em>Ordo Nobilis</em> in particular.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis">Medieval Stasis</a>: Averted.

House Tremere is descended from a Pluto-cult and collectively feels betrayed by gods in general (the Divine is sometimes an exception), while House Criamon holds to a very esoteric philosophy that holds, among other things, that pagan deities are no different from humans and worship is fruitless.

Strong Fairy Blood gives a -3, and also allows a character to live 'til age fifty before they start aging, rather than thirty-five as usual.</li><li> There's also the Unaging virtue, which keeps you looking young and stops aging from affecting your stats, but doesn't actually extend your lifespan.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a>; In-universe.

They take anyone who can summon a spirit and teach the Suhhar's form of magic, and they don't make anyone join, but they do sometimes act as a group and require their members to contribute to the upkeep of the whole.</li><li> The Order of Odin is an order of Norse rune-wizards (vitkir) at war with the Order of Hermes. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It doesn't exist, and never did. There were some rune-wizards who fought alongside Damhan-Allaidh during the time of the early Order, and there are still plenty of vitkir running around now, but the idea of an organized group of Scandinavian runepriests out to topple the Order is a boogeyman with little basis in fact.</span></li><li> The Order of Geonim are a group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Kabbalah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Kabbalah">Kabbalists</a> mentioned in <em>Realms of Power: the Divine</em> who have a truce with the Order. It's unclear what they are; the supposed "Order of Geonim" could just mean all Kabbalists everywhere, or a specific bunch from Barcelona, but there's rumors of a secret order throughout Europe dedicated to protecting Jews from their enemies.

Aside from the Divine Realm, each Realm produces a kind of god. Magical gods are idealized beasts or natural phenomena, or the functions of the universe given physical form, and they don't necessarily care all that much about humans. Faerie gods are created and empowered by tales and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly">human worship</a>. False Gods are the mightiest demons of the Infernal, who pose as deities to lead human souls to Hell.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurMagesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurMagesAreDifferent">Our Mages Are Different</a>: Magi are lottery-winner scholars. A magus must be born with the Gift (which is completely random), but then he will spend years of his life in a Hermetic lab developing new spells or seeking out a means of rewriting the rules of magic. This paradigm applies to most non-Hermetic wizards in the setting as well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurTitansAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurTitansAreDifferent">Our Titans Are Different</a>: One interpetation is that the Titans were the primordial rulers of the universe, aligned with the Magic Realm.

Each House has its own traditions, and most have some unique magic of their own, but two members of the same House may have completely different magic, attitudes, or both.</li><li> House Bonisagus has two separate hats. Followers of Bonisagus are the archetypal lab rats of the Order, while the line of Trianoma are the Order's master politicians. This is for historical reasons; Trianoma chose to remain Bonisagus's apprentice rather than found her own House so she could work as the power behind the throne.</li><li> The hat for unGifted Merceres is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat">a red cap</a>, but Mercere with the Gift really avert this trope. There are two major subtraditions within the House, a subtradition of one of those subtraditions, and a lot of magi Mercere who don't fit into any of these. Given that there's only about thirty magi Mercere <em>at all</em>, it's safe to say that every Mercere's hat is different.</li><li> Ex Miscellanea is, as its name implies, another aversion; their hat is being "none of the above." It consists of Gifted wizards adopted from outside the Order (who may or may not practice Hermetic magic), magi who didn't fit in with their old House and didn't find any other House to join, and their descendants.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerilousPowerSource" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerilousPowerSource">Perilous Power Source</a>:<ul><li> Magic, if powerful or long lasting, warps its targets. This eventually mutates the targets or in the case of magi removes them from the world entirely. Other magical traditions have their own forms of Warping.</li><li> The only form of power that doesn't really qualify is the Divine, and that only for those who know how to use it. The Divine Ascent still changes you, but for its users, the change is seen as a <em>good</em> thing even if it comes with some drawbacks.

For the unGifted, doing this for a magic virtue <em>always</em> leaves you with some kind of flaw for each ability you Initiate, and for the Gifted, most initiations still require a price of some kind.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfCreation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfCreation">The Power of Creation</a>: The <em>Conjure from the Mist</em> spells allows a magus to transform a section of air into stone, shaped into whatever form they please.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PracticalCurrency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PracticalCurrency">Practical Currency</a>: In general, magi don't trade in silver unless they have to; it's fairly trivial for a covenant to get all the mundane wealth it needs (though being too blatant with creating precious metal has economic and legal consequences). Instead, the currencies of magi are vis and time.<ul><li> Vis covers a variety of magical substances that can boost spellcasting and empower ritual magic and the creation of magical items, among other uses. It's the standard currency of magi, coming in a variety of flavors and measured in "pawns" for historical reasons. If you can buy it somehow, you can usually get it at one pawn for ten Mythic Pounds, but selling vis for silver is highly unusual because using vis can usually generate all the money you could ever spend.</li><li> The cliche that "time is money" is well-understood by magi. The expectation of the Order of Hermes is that magi will want to spend as much time as possible in their laboratories studying new magic; hence, many covenants require that their members spend a season a year doing service to the covenant or pay scutage for the value of that season. Furthermore, many Quaesitorial fines are assessed in community service - that is, seasons of service to the Order.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">Pride</a>: Part of the Verditius flaw is that every Verditius who descends deeper into the Cult develops a degree of hubris, which is intrinsically linked to their magic, as well as adding to the vendetta culture within the House.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyGifted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyGifted">Randomly Gifted</a>: The gift appears in people more or less at random.

However, as in <em>Ars Magica</em>, magic is not a science, but an art, different individuals have different ways of working magic. The game strongly suggests that all magi characters have at least some form of Hermetic flaw, to represent imperfect understanding. Nevertheless, one of the strengths of Hermetic magic is that it is very broad in what can be learned, though the greatest heights can still be reached by specializing. In some ways, Bonisagus's theory <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">takes the Red Mage up to eleven</a>. Although certain non-Hermetic traditions can break certain rules of Hermetic Magic, they do so at the cost of extreme specialization, usually also requiring a disproportionate amount of time of study to be able to create such effects.</li><li> Magi ex Miscellanea are supposed to use both Hermetic magic and remnant magics from their old tradition, though they nearly always suffer a Hermetic Flaw to make up for it. They generally have a poor reputation because of this; there's a reason the House is referred to as "from hash."</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsMagic">Religion Is Magic</a>: The Divine Realm (alternately, the Dominion) draws its power from God, and divine power can make awe-inspiring effects (though pure divine magic doesn't match up to the power of the Hermetic Arts), and an area influenced by the Divine serves as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a> for any non-divine power. The big limitation is that it cannot be intentionally used to sin, and it's very difficult to learn without True Faith.<ul><li> Holy Magic is a form of Hermetic magic adapted to the Divine Realm. It's difficult to use, because Hermetic magic is based in pagan charms that can't be used with it, and Hermetic magi dismiss it as a joke in poor taste, but it allows for wondrous effects that can bend or break Hermetic limits, and it can also be used safely within a Divine aura.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Kabbalah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Kabbalah">Kabbalah</a> is Jewish holy magic. It's unusual in that most Kabbalists do not have True Faith, but it's still highly effective and has its own (small) order of users (the Order of Geonim) who have a peace treaty with the Order. Useful for creating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Golem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Golem">golems</a> and calling angels through the Chariot Mysteries, but also somewhat dangerous, as its practitioners often become curious about the Infernal or addicted to its power.</li><li> Christians and Muslims don't actually have a lot of divine magic. For Muslims, it's pretty much the exclusive province of Sufis, while among Christians, it's pretty much limited to small holy orders and lone saint-mystics. The big joker in the deck are the Cathars, whose Perfecti have already developed some pretty potent magic as a result of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Gnosticism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Gnosticism">Gnostic</a> theological heritage.</li><li> The most powerful divine magic of all is found in a fairly minor religion off in the East. The Mazdeans (or Zoroastrians) are a minority group in Mesopotamia and Persia, but their mobeds are descendants (theoretically or factually) of the magoi priests of ancient Persia, and they were mighty wizards well before Bonisagus was ever born. Since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">the fall of the Sassanid Empire</a>, nearly all of their greatest magics have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">been lost</a>, but what they have is still highly impressive. They are masters of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Alchemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Alchemy">Alchemy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarPower">astrology</a>, capable of calling angels and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">destroying evil with flame</a>, and their greatest priests <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLived" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLived">live much longer than even Hermetic magi</a>. A mobed in full possession of the magic of his tradition would be a match for a Hermetic magus, but mobeds of that power mostly don't exist anymore. It's also notable that there are Zoroastrian sub-traditions within the Order of Hermes and the Order of Solomon, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRedMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRedMage">wielding Hermetic or Solomonic magic and some of the Zoroastrian power-set</a>.</li><li> A particular trick common to House Jerbiton (though anyone can do it) is to invoke the patron saint of a city and ask for "the right to defend the City."

Spells are developed through scientific laboratory research, and the limits of magic are constantly tested in hopes of a Breakthrough that might amend the rules or even remove one of the Limits of Magic. Magi of House Bonisagus in particular are expected to do original research of some form, creating unique spells or chasing after Breakthroughs, and disseminate it to the other magi of the Order. Most other magical schools have some degree of this too.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic">Summon Magic</a>:<ul><li> The specialty of the Order of Suleiman, the dominant magical order of the Islamic world.

There's plenty of odd magic around Mythic Europe, and by and large the Order wants <em>nothing to do with it</em>. The current leadership of House Bonisagus (who are in charge of advancing Hermetic magic) are particularly conservative and distrustful of hedge magic, and their ally Philippus Niger is actively involved in hunting down and murdering German hedge wizards.<ul><li> The Bonisagus Seekers try to avert this, to a point. Their schtick is going out and finding ancient forms of magic or meeting non-Hermetic mages, discovering their abilities, and trying to find ways to integrate useful abilities from them into Hermetic magery. That said, this research is out of a desire to improve Hermetic magic, not foster good relations; it's just sometimes easier to steal someone else's secrets than to invent one's own breakthrough.</li><li> Even within the Order, some Houses' magic is seen as inferior to others'. Verditius gets a bad rap because they require tools to use their magic, Merinita is distrusted because their magic is linked to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a>, and having Diedne magic in your legacy is <em>still</em> grounds for having a Wizard's March called against you. Part of the reason for the Schism War was that House Diedne descended from a Celtic druidess, while nearly all of the other Houses descended from Latin traditions; unsurprisingly, the Germanic Bjornaer have been keeping a low profile ever since.</li><li> The Order of Suleiman in the Islamic world tries to avert this. To be a member, a sahir has to prove that they can summon a spirit and be willing to help out the Order. That's it; while most sahirs do use Solomonic summoning, the yatus of Persia, the Kurdish Mulhidun infernalists, and other weirder wizards all have places within the Order. They're at war with the Order of Hermes, but that's because Hermetic magi (though not the Order itself) have become involved in the Crusades.</li><li> House Bjornaer looks down upon those who shapeshift using a different method than theirs, as their heartbeasts represent an aspect of their souls/nature. Few of them ever learn other shapeshifting spells and those who do are treated with disdain by their fellows. (Mages outside the house "don't know any better".). Innate shapeshifters are regarded with superstitious horror as the Bjornaer basically believe they've stolen other souls to gain their forms, and lycanthropes are pitied. As such, calling one of them a shapeshifter is a mortal insult.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtilityMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtilityMagic">Utility Magic</a>: It&#146;s a fair sign of an old, powerful covenant (wizard community) that they have a lot of this around the place. Magic is difficult and time-consuming enough that low-end wizards tend to feel they have better things to do with their time; they can always recruit grogs (mortal servants), and flaunting too much magic invites suspicion and persecution from the mundane world. Their elders, though, can toss off spells with relative ease, and may have accumulated quite a few utility items over the years through trade or as exercises in enchantment &#151; and are generally either too powerful or too out of it to worry about persecution. So their homes tend to be full of weird and trivial wonders.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryPunchableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryPunchableMan">Very Punchable Man</a>: The Gift automatically causes others to regard mages (or those with the Magical Air Flaw), the same way they'd regard a person reputed for a lifetime of dishonesty and unreliability, with privilege obtained in the most illegitimate manner they can imagine. This jealousy and mistrust makes the <em>mage</em> a VPM in their eyes. The Blatant Gift Flaw magnifies this effect into thinking the mage is an actively dangerous person and can lead to being physically attacked. The ways around this include being unnoticed (doesn't work for the Blatant Gift), being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> every time they see you over the course of several encounters so they recognize their gut reaction is inappropriate and unwarranted and fight it down (lie down and be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">Extreme Doormat</a>, Blatant Gifters), being born with the Gentle Gift (incompatible with Blatant Gift), or the other person being protected by the Parma Magica. Since this includes other mages, the invention of the Parma Magica is what finally allowed mages to actually start and maintain a society among themselves.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">Voluntary Shapeshifting</a>: Most Hermetic magi can do this with spells, and there are other ways to change shape that those inside and outside of the Order of Hermes can use, but members of House Bjornaer have their own particular style that lets them more truly change into one animal. Unlike other shapeshifting, no form of magic can discern their human shape when in animal form. Also, if some other power changes their shape, they may continually try to change back into their own human or animal shape.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoteEarlyVoteOften" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoteEarlyVoteOften">Vote Early, Vote Often</a>: In the Rhine Tribunal, ghost voting is legal. When a magus who has given a proxy vote to another magus dies, the magus' death is not recorded and the magus who's got the sigil gets to keep it forever (and may transfer it to another magus), resulting in the Rhine's elders having a massive amount of sway and being essentially above Hermetic law. When the Quaesitors told them to cut it out, the Rhine's elder magi responded by "voting" to declare the practice legal, and followed up by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToForce">threatening Wizard's War against the Quaesitors who prosecuted them</a>.

In an example, a woman has Second Sight (the ability to see the supernatural) because she was born at midnight on All Hallows Eve, and thus stands between the worlds of tha living and the dead.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildChild">Wild Child</a>:<ul><li> "Feral Upbringing" is a Flaw you may take at character Creation. It provides a number of wilderness related skills, but among other issues, the character has no native language.</li><li> House Bjornaer used to frequently recruit those with feral upbringings, but of late they've been trying to improve their image, so it's less likely.</li><li> Abandoning a child apprentice in the wild for long periods of time so they develop an affinity for animals is an integral part of the training for the Beast Master tradition within House Ex Miscellanea.</li></ul></li><li> "Feral Childhood" is an ability package (basically a pre-set allotment of skills) which may be taken during character creation.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchHunt">Witch Hunt</a>: The reason the Order of Hermes keeps a low profile. While most people in Mythic Europe don't think too hard about the occasional wise woman who lives in the woods or weird magician in a tower, the idea of open conflict between the Church and the Order is a headache no one wants to deal with.<ul><li> The Church is cognizant of the Order and prefers to leave it alone. It's not so much a secret as it is something that isn't widely bandied about. The Church know that the mages can wipe them out if angered enough, so they ignore them. The Order know that God can wipe <em>them</em> out if angered, so they leave the Church alone. It's a beautiful balance of power.</li><li> The Order of Hermes also enforces its own "Join or Die" policy with regards to other magical traditions; though admittedly this is rarely invoked unless the other tradition has somehow learned the secret of the Parma Magica or some similar means of Magic Resistance...</li><li> Occasionally, some mundane noble or bishop gets the idea to declare a general hunt for wizards. However, this is very much a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon">Bullying a Dragon</a>, and the usual reply from the Order is the death of the noble and his entire army.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity">With Great Power Comes Great Insanity</a>:<ul><li> Some forms of Warping lead to madness.</li><li> Elementalists gradually become dominated by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourTemperamentEnsemble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourTemperamentEnsemble">humours</a> aspected to the elements they can use, until they become as uncontrollably insane as elementals themselves.</li><li> Al-Iksir, the Solomonic youth ritual, can lead to the user going very mad very quickly if misused.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardsLiveLonger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardsLiveLonger">Wizards Live Longer</a>: Thanks to the effects of spells like the Longevity Ritual and virtues like Fairy Blood, it's possible for some mages to top two centuries, although not usually too much beyond that.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordsCanBreakMyBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordsCanBreakMyBones">Words Can Break My Bones</a>: Rune Magic involves writing spells in the Futhark. Each rune embodies a concept, which can either define the target or the effect, and a spell is created by using a rune for either an effect, an effect with a target, or in a particular use, a target without an effect.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">Would Hurt a Child</a>:<ul><li> House Bjornaer's ancestral foes were/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenocideBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenocideBackfire">are?</a> a group of baby-sacrificing, shapeshifting, gothic witches.</li><li> Because of this, people with innate shapeshifting abilities horrify members of Bjornaer, and in the rare occasions shapeshifting children are taken on as apprentices, they tend to meet "unfortunate accidents" and are never seen again. Which is totally different from their old enemies, of course.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongContextMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongContextMagic">Wrong Context Magic</a>: In <em>Ars Magica</em>, all rules apply at all times, except the times that they don't. Even within Hermetic magic, the Limits of Magic and the verb/object rules only apply until someone comes up with a breakthrough or a Mystery that changes how the rules work. Outside of Hermetic magic, nearly anything goes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AYearAndADay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AYearAndADay">A Year and a Day</a>: Supplement <em>Tales of the Dark Ages</em>, adventure "The Inheritance". A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> receives an inheritance of land and a title as a knight.
