Games Workshop's core business, however, is in the sale of miniatures and other battle-game periphera, and roleplaying publishing has never been as profitable. <em>WFRP</em> was passed around various publishing subsidiaries before being mothballed in 1992.</p><p>Independent publisher Hogshead obtained the rights to publish <em>WFRP</em> in 1995, though GW retained editorial control to ensure any original material remained true to their canon. Hogshead reverted the license to GW in 2002 when they came under new ownership, and in 2005 Games Workshop published a 2nd edition of the rules developed by outside developer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GreenRonin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GreenRonin">Green Ronin</a>. In 2009, after getting the license, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FantasyFlightGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FantasyFlightGames">Fantasy Flight Games</a> &mdash; the publishers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkHeresy">Dark Heresy</a></em> and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RogueTrader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RogueTrader">Rogue Trader</a></em> RPG, which use variations in the 2nd edition rules &mdash; put out a somewhat controversial 3rd edition; support for that ended in 2014. In May 2017 it was announced that a 4th edition of the game would be released by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Cubicle7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Cubicle7">Cubicle 7</a>; the core rulebooks will be released in June (PDF) or July (hardcover) of 2018.

The game has been praised for its immersive realism, but equally criticized for forcing players to roleplay the boring periods between quests as well as the exciting adventures themselves.</p><p>Part <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>, part <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia">Paranoia</a></em>, part <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CallOfCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CallOfCthulhu">Call of Cthulhu</a></em>, <em>WFRP</em> shares in its parent setting's bleakness. A solidly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGreyMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGreyMorality">Grey vs Black setting</a>, <em>WFRP</em> is uncompromising in its grimness; instead of simply choosing a race and a class, you are advised to roll a dice for a race and a "career," which include heroic backgrounds like rat catchers, rag pickers, thugs for hire and tax collectors. After all, life isn't fair, and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em>, it's downright sadistic.</p><p>The setting itself is very cynical for a high fantasy, incorporating many low fantasy elements. The Old World is Europe in the throes of the Renaissance; new civilized cities have begun to rise, throwing up whole new criminal underworlds. Racketeers and drug lords abound, indeed the concept that things like alcohol and drugs can be addictive is yet to be thought of, new "civilized" physicians cut into patient's skulls looking for "unclean humours" that plague them.

If you don't start out as a combat- or magic-focused career, you are essentially this trope <em>by default</em> in the average campaign.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AintNoRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AintNoRule">Ain't No Rule</a>: It's stated in the 2nd edition Bretonnia sourcebook <em>Knights of the Grail</em> that the merchants of Bretonnia rely heavily on exploiting a combination of this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a> to get around the exploitative and antiquated legal system of their country. For example, by rule of law, peasants (which every merchant technically <em>is</em>, by Bretonnian definitions) are expected to pay a tithe of 9/10ths of everything they produce to their local lord... but the precise wording is "everything they <em>make</em>", as the law was drafted in a time when society consisted of warriors, craftsmen and subsistence farmers, who operated on a barter economy. As merchants don't actually <em>make</em> anything themselves, they technically don't have to pay any taxes (although in practice they pay bribes to keep the nobles following their logic; as most Bretonnian nobles <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpoverishedPatrician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpoverishedPatrician">have titles and lands, but no cash</a>, they happily see things the merchants' way). The merchants are even known to use their influence to lobby for stricter, more literal interpretations of the ancient rulings precisely to keep exploiting their loopholes.<ul><li> One prominent example of this is the importation of firearms. Whilst Bretonnian knights are forbidden the use of <em>any</em> ranged weapons, as they are considered unchivalrous, the only law on the books specifically against ranged weapons is explicitly against <em>crossbows</em>. As such, the merchants do a sporadic trade in firearms, although it's noted that some nobles find them a bit unsettling, for reasons that are obvious when you think about it. Meanwhile, the Bretonnian navy uses cannon indiscriminately, since they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">never fighting on Bretonnian soil</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllSwordsAreTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllSwordsAreTheSame">All Swords Are the Same</a>: A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggedTrope">Zigzagged Trope</a>. The majority of common one-handed weapons &mdash; regardless of whether they're swords, axes, maces or other diverse implements &mdash; are lumped together as "hand weapons" with no statistical differences whatsoever. In 2nd edition, two-handed weapons like greatswords and mauls are similarly blanketed as "great weapons". However, there are still numerous weapons that stand as their own, unique categories, such as rapiers, halberds, different types of bow and firearm, and so forth.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>: Interestingly subverted with the Norscans. While the tribes of Norsca's northern reaches (closer to the corrupting influence of the Chaos Wastes) are certainly villainous, the tribes closer to the Empire are mellow enough that honest trade with Kislev and Marienburg is frequent. In Marienburg particularly, having rugged northmen as bodyguards is said to be rather fashionable among the upper classes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenPreferStrongMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenPreferStrongMen">particularly with the noblewomen</a>.<ul><li> Played straighter by the Hung, a barbarian tribe who are said to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">stupid, savage bastards even compared to the Norscans</a>. "Word of a Hung" is a slang term for a promise that everyone knows will never be honoured. A Hung tribe might surround a village and demand all the village women be handed over to avoid the village being burned to the ground, and then the moment the women are in their arms, they'll burn the village down anyway. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">Because they can.</a></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ambadassador" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ambadassador">Ambadassador</a>: The Grey Guardians are sought as diplomats for their wisdom and tact, but their usual job is basically traveling wizard secret <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardboiledDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardboiledDetective">Hardboiled Detective</a> or spies, with the grit and cunning that implies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingArrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingArrows">Annoying Arrows</a>:<ul><li> This was a rather serious flaw in the first edition of the game. The problem was that, as the player characters advance, their melee attacks got more powerful and more accurate and their opponents got tougher. Their arrows, on the other hand, got more accurate but remained damage 3 no matter how good an archer the character was. Even worse, skilled melee fighters got multiple attacks each round, while ranged attackers could only get one tops (or even less if they used crossbows or firearms, which had longer reload times). So arrows were powerful against your average thug, goblin or newbie adventurer, but almost useless against a knight, chaos warrior or orc warlord. In addition to this, the higher your skill in either melee or shooting, the higher the chance of gaining an additional damage that with a bit of luck may still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> anything that is not immune to normal weapons. However, missile combat uses a Sudden Death Rule that is, as a rule of thumb, more deadly that normal Critical Hit rules.</li><li> In 4th Edition, bows scale in damage as your character's strength increases, while guns and crossbows do not. That said, the amount of strength needed for an average adventurer with a bow to match the most basic gun is extreme (strength bonus 6 or higher).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnomalousArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnomalousArt">Anomalous Art</a>:<ul><li> When studied, the painting "A Grim Feast" causes the viewers to slaughter his entire family.

A sidebar called "Evil vs Undead" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshades">lampshades</a> this, pointing out that he is ultimately a complex person with multiple motivations and virtues as well as vices, most of whom he would hold even if he wasn't a millennia-old Tomb King. The final encounter between Karitamen and the player characters is left up to the GM and can be solved nonviolently, with the book only pointing out that certain actions (like defacing his tomb or killing his best friend) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">will make him respond appropriately</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApothecaryAlligator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApothecaryAlligator">Apothecary Alligator</a>: In the 1st edition adventure, <em>The Dying of the Light</em>, the characters meet Dr Balthazar, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame">dwarf</a> alchemist from the University of Nuln. The cart he is travelling in is loaded with the paraphernalia of his alchemical studies including a stuffed alligator.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmourIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmourIsUseless">Armour Is Useless</a>: It most definitively is not, but fat chance you'll ever see any besides (if you're lucky) your starting leather skullcap and that rusty piece of moth-ridden chainmail you nabbed off that bandit.<ul><li> In the first edition it was. According to the rules, chainmail or plate armour give 1 Armour Point, which stacks with Toughness (natural resilience) that ranges between 2 and 4 for an average human.

For both target and caster though...<ul><li> In Second Edition, magicians get such lovely, deadly spells as instant death, removing fate points, healing all damage of all sorts done to a character (including insanity and disease) or creating a huge fire that will not stop burning until everything within range is dead.

Combat is brutal and a high-risk affair, a misroll during spell casting may consign your soul to hell.

So if you want to play a female character, you'll have to pretend to be a man. Fortunately for such women, Bretonnian culture is some combination of being so hidebound/polite that any woman pretending to be a man in Bretonnia automatically succeeds in doing so, no rolling for tests necessary.

However, he personally has no say in how things are done and is content to stay in his tower, playing an organ and with only cockroaches for company. Despite his mutation, he is a thoroughly polite and decent man &mdash; when the player characters arrive, he will welcome them and invite them for a chat about art and/or philosophy, offering them brandy and cigars.</li><li> <em>Tome of Corruption</em> points out that while many denizens of the Empire have little problem condemning mutants if they're someone they don't know (or like), attitudes change fairly quickly once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreWhatYouHate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreWhatYouHate">they or their loved ones experience mutation themselves</a>.
