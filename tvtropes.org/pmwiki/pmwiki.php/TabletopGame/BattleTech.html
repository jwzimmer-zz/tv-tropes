Your elite force of MechWarriors drives these juggernauts into battle, proudly holding your faction's flag high, intent on expanding the power and glory of your realm.

At the most basic level, a BattleTech game featured two teams of four <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">BattleMechs</a>, each with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignItYourselfEquipment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignItYourselfEquipment">own unique arsenal of weaponry, defenses, and movement capabilities</a>, which would proceed to beat each other into the ground across a terrain map. As the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BattleTechExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BattleTechExpandedUniverse">background fiction developed</a>, scenarios were written to provide specific settings and rules to "recreate" the fictional battles of the 31st century, and expansions to the rules included conventional units, space combat, and large-scale warfare, bringing the game right back to its roots.</p><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gameplay&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><em>BattleTech</em> revolves around (mostly) small battles between groups of 3-10 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> per side, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnBasedCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnBasedCombat">Turn-Based Combat</a> on (usually) <a class="urllink" href="http://i.imgur.com/f2hHT.jpg">paper<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> or <a class="urllink" href="http://i.imgur.com/HMsxC.jpg">3-dimensional hex-based<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> maps, or for more advanced players, <a class="urllink" href="http://i.imgur.com/1fjME.jpg">non-hex maps<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> where movement is calculated in inches and line-of-sight is determined by laserpointers. Players first declare their movement, then attacks (be it ranged or melee), then calculate their mech's heat buildup, then the other player does the same. Rolls for accuracy (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit">Critical Hits</a>) and precarious movement are done using two six sided dice (2D6). Damage is tallied on cards with a <a class="urllink" href="http://i.imgur.com/YEpPA.jpg">simple diagram of the mech,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> which has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubsystemDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubsystemDamage">mech's armor, internal structure, critical systems, and status of the pilot and various equipment.</a> <br><br>Two features make <em>BattleTech's</em> gameplay stand out from most other wargames. The first is that in each phase of a turn, players alternate movement or attack declarations with the winner of that turn's initiative always going <em>last</em>. Because damage is resolved after all attacks go off (nobody "shoots first"), and details of movement like facing and attack angles are key elements of gameplay, going first is almost always a disadvantage, since it requires acting with lesser knowledge of your opponent's moves than they have of yours. The second is that the game is based heavily around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubsystemDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubsystemDamage">Subsystem Damage</a> rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure">Critical Existence Failure</a>. Basic units don't simply have an "alive" and "dead" state, with perhaps a weakened state in between - rather, they have multiple sections, each with two sets of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a> and internal components that can be damaged once the outer armor is stripped away, impairing a 'Mech's fighting ability in a number of ways. A 'Mech can be effectively "destroyed" by several means other than sheer damage accumulation<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note05bp8');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note05bp8" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note05bp8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> three engine hits shuts the 'Mech's reactor down until it can be repaired out-of-combat and so "mission kills" the 'Mech, two hits to the gyro means the 'Mech falls and cannot get back up, rendering it nearly useless, sufficient leg damage can render a 'Mech immobile or impossible to keep upright, destroying all a 'Mech's weapons (or all sections containing weapons) reduces its combat effectiveness to near zero, etc.</span>, and a common optional rule forces 'Mechs to begin retreating after reaching certain internal or system damage thresholds, rather than fight to the death. This level of detail is why even a basic four-on-four skirmish can take hours to play out. <br><br>A large emphasis on the game is on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignItYourselfEquipment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignItYourselfEquipment">customization</a>. The game has literally <em>hundreds</em> of mech chassis, many with dozens of variants a piece, but players are encouraged to customize their units. A player might swap out his large engine for a smaller engine to exchange speed for more armor, or change a heavy autocannon to a particle cannon to increase range and reduce ammunition strain at the cost of overall firepower. There's also the choice of weapons, which are basically between ballistic (bullets and missiles) or energy weapons like lasers, with the pros and cons of each type affecting your playstyle - ballistics produce little heat, but you need to set aside room for ammo, as well as the fact you can run out of it; energy weapons use your power supply for "ammo" and are effectively infinite, but create large amounts of heat which your mech has to get rid of by waiting, or shortening that time with heat sinks or environmental assistance such as water (too much heat will make your mech shutdown, or even possibly explode). The basic game, with "Introductory level" tech rules, has a fairly small amount of selection in regards to equipment, but "Tournament," "Advanced," and "Experimental" tech greatly expand the equipment selection. <br><br>Unlike other wargames such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>, which require official minatures, <em>BattleTech</em> has no rules on what can be used to represent units; an index card on a stand with a stick-figure 'Mech could be used to represent your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">AS7-D Atlas</a>, or you could buy official pewter or lead miniatures.

After 2242, when Mother Terra cut her ties to all colonies over thirty light years away, the newly independent worlds began merging by force or diplomacy into interstellar states. By 2366 five such nations, each ruled by a Great House that became synonymous with its realm's name, had arisen to control most of the Inner Sphere, with the powerful Terran Hegemony at its core. <br><br>Intermittent warfare between these states became chronic from 2398 until the 2550s. Early in this Age of War, the Terran Hegemony created Battlemechs, giant mechanical bipedal titans that would soon became the dominating force on the battlefields of the Inner Sphere. <br><br>During the mid-26th century, the Terran Hegemony formed the Star League, uniting all of the Inner Sphere in a single alliance, and humanity entered a Golden Age for two centuries. Then an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor">Evil Chancellor</a> killed the ruler and took power for himself. The Star League Defense Force (SLDF) turned on the usurper and defeated him, only for the other national leaders of the Star League to start fighting each other over the right to succeed to the throne. Disgusted and hoping to limit the coming war's devastation, General Aleksandr Kerensky of the SLDF took most of his army with humanity's best weaponry into unknown space, leaving the nobles to fight out their differences in devastating wars. <br><br>For three centuries, the five self-proclaimed Successor States <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2oobr');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2oobr" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2oobr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Federated Suns (House Davion), Lyran Commonwealth (House Steiner), Draconis Combine (House Kurita), Free Worlds League (House Marik) and Capellan Confederation (House Liao)</span> fought for dominance, while the Earth-based semi-religious organization known as ComStar, formed by the remains of Star League's Department of Communications, publicly remained neutral while secretly furthering their own agenda (having a monopoly on the only means of interstellar communications helped). During these three centuries of total war, humankind lost a considerable amount of knowledge, now called Lostech, in some ways blowing itself back into the Industrial Age. Only a discovery of the Star League Field Library Memory Core in 3028 arrested this slide.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3z8w3');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3z8w3" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3z8w3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">in 3025, prior to the discovery of the Memory Core, the vast majority of planets were considered "primitive" - that is, on a technological level of late 20th century Earth, or more than <em>1000</em> years behind the times</span>. <br><br>The intensity of the conflict and the resulting technological regression had also caused a stalemate between the Successor States. This was only broken in the 3020s when Houses Steiner and Davion merged to form the Federated Commonwealth, which proceeded to nearly destroy House Liao in the Fourth Succession War, as well as seize a lot of territory from House Kurita. The newly formed House Steiner-Davion seemed poised to eventually conquer the Inner Sphere but in the year 3050 a new enemy appeared. <br><br>After three centuries of exile, the descendants of the SLDF, now calling themselves "The Clans", launched a blitzkrieg invasion of the Inner Sphere. Inspired by the doctrines of Aleksandr Kerensky's son Nicholas and armed with advanced Battlemechs, weapons, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Battle Armor</a>, their intent was to end the still-ongoing Succession Wars and reform the Star League by force. The two most prominent Clans of this invasion were <a class="urllink" href="http://www.sarna.net/wiki/Warden_Clans">Warden<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Clan Wolf, the direct successors of the Kerensky bloodline who felt that the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.sarna.net/wiki/Crusader_Clans">Crusader<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> Clans were using Kerensky's writings as an excuse to take over Inner Sphere and thus took part in the war to minimize damage, and the Crusader Clan Jade Falcon, who saw the Inner Sphere as their rightful domain torn apart by fake usurpers. The invasion was eventually halted by using the Clans' own rules against them, honor binding them from attacking Inner Sphere for 15 years, but not before the Clans carved a huge chunk of territory out of the nearest Successor States,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note45owm');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note45owm" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note45owm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">parts of the Draconis Combine, the Lyran side of the F-C, and nearly devouring the breakaway Free Rasalhague Republic,</span> and for the next several decades both the Inner Sphere and the Clans were busy dealing with the consequences. <br><br>Within the Clans, the Crusaders led by Clan Jade Falcon were pointing at the Clan Wolf as a scapegoat, accusing their Khan, Ulric Kerensky, of a deliberate sabotage of the war effort, and were calling to break the 15 years truce and immediately restart the invasion. In return, Ulric initiated a Clan-scale Trial of Refusal in order to thwart Crusader ambitions, starting the Refusal War between the Wolves and the Falcons. The Wolves lost the war with Ulric killed by treachery, but not before crippling the Falcon's might, effectively rendering all their invasion plans moot. <br><br>Meanwhile in the Inner Sphere, the Clan threat convinced the previously stubborn leaders of the five Successor States to work together, and eventually create the Second Star League in 3058. In order to show the Clans that they meant business, they launched a large-scale military operation against the most aggressive and brutal of the Crusader clans, Clan Smoke Jaguar, retaking former Combine worlds and destroying the Clan entirely. Then the new SLDF headed for Strana Mechty, the birthplace of the Clans and took part, and won, in the Great Refusal that would both practically and officially end the unified large-scale Clan Invasion. <br><br>After this the Federated Commonwealth fractured and triggered a civil war that would ravage its two member Successor States from 3062 to 3067. The conflict would also spill into the rest of the Inner Sphere and trigger more wars as the FedCom gains of the Fourth Succession War were gradually undone. When the fires finally died down the leaders of the Inner Sphere noticed that the Second Star League had effectively been powerless while its members mauled each other and the alliance was disbanded as a result in October 3067. The idea of the Star League was effectively discarded as an impractical ideal by everyone. Everyone, except one group. <br><br>Furious at the disbanding of the Second Star League, the Word of Blake, a powerful and very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">Church Militant</a> splinter faction of ComStar, started a Jihad against the Inner Sphere. Deploying the heavily modified cyborg fanatics armed with the new Star League-derived technology, using WMDs and orbital bombardments outlawed by the Ares Conventions, creating chaos and confusion to fracture the already-unstable states even further, the Blakists were posed to recreate the Star League in their own image. After enduring several years of intense fighting, the factions of Inner Sphere, including the Clans, formed an alliance to defeat the Word of Blake, in the end nuking them to oblivion. <br><br>While the Inner Sphere was busy dealing with the Word of Blake, the Clans had their own problems. The Homeworld-based Clans back in the Kerensky Cluster and Pentagon Worlds were engaged in political infighting fueled by the failure of invasion, resource shortages and accusations that the Clans that had extensive contact with Inner Sphere were being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingNative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingNative">"tainted by Inner Sphere's barbaric ways and were strayed from the true path of the Clans"</a>, which then after several proverbial sparks escalated into all-out wars and the rebellion of several Scientist Caste members of a secret cabal known as The Society. These conflicts, later known as The Wars of Reaving, ended with the complete annihilation or absorption of several Clans, many bloodname gene vaults destroyed or beyond salvage and the purging of many Clans' Scientist Castes. In the end, the Homeworld Clans and the Inner Sphere Clans abjured each other and cut off all communications. <br><br>From the ashes of Jihad, a man named Devlin Stone, one of the key figures in defeating the Word of Blake, revived the Terran Hegemony in the form of Republic of the Sphere. Stone's intent was to end the constant wars by creating a nation that threw out the old status quo by being a powerful buffer state in the middle of Inner Sphere, not unlike the Terran Hegemony during the Star League era. With the general exhaustion in the wake of Jihad that left no one who was able or interested in starting another large scale conflict (except the Capellans, but they were quickly humiliated), he succeeded. <br><br>Five decades of relative peace passed from 3081 to 3132 with a few minor wars, and then the political situation in the Republic and the relations with its neighbors reached breaking point after Stone's retirement. It was evident to all that one wrong event in the wrong time could shake the house of cards down. That event came on August 7 3132 in the form of the simultaneous shutdown (via a widespread computer virus plus a few military strikes) of the majority of hyperpulse generators in the Inner Sphere. Every faction was suddenly rendered nearly blind and deaf, without information, and swiftly rushed to either take advantage of the crisis or defend against its results. And while the older factions stayed relatively unified, the unconsolidated hotbed of different cultures that was the Republic splintered into many micro-factions. Most of these eventually either joined or were conquered by the Great Houses and the Clans, who came upon the weakened Republic like hungry vultures. Besieged from all sides, the desperate Republic activated the Fortress Republic system that prevented anyone from jumping into their core systems, often with fatal results, and abandoned the worlds outside the Wall to the conquerors. With all easy pickings taken and with dreams of empire, many Great Houses or Clans soon turned upon their neighbors. <br><br>In the current year 3150 some factions (Steiner, Davion, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComStar">Com Star</a>) are desperately staving off ruin while others (Liao, Kurita, Clans Wolf and Jade Falcon) are riding waves of conquest. All eyes are turned towards Terra, where the Republic has unleashed its hoarded might from behind the Wall, while the Wolves, Jade Falcons, and House Liao all prepare to claim humanity's ancestral homeworld.<p></p></div><p></p><h2> Expanded Universe:</h2>In many cases of the Expanded Universe, anything that does not directly contradict canon is considered canonical.

Plasma Rifles seem to operate on this too, as they fire out clouds of what used to be plastic blocks, that have been lased and converted into a superheated plasma state. Infantry can also use a Gyrojet rifle, which fires self-propelled rocket bullets rather than using gunpowder.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5oxow');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note5oxow" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5oxow');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Gyrojet rifles and pistols actually exist, dating from the sixties, and this is indeed their operating principle. Unfortunately a tiny spin-stabilized rocket, while inherently cool, is a much more complicated and expensive thing to manufacture than an ordinary powder-and-primer cartridge, which along with reliability problems doomed the Gyrojet line to languish in the prototype stage despite initial interest from the US Army. The few remaining examples are mainly of interest to collectors, especially since no one is still making Gyrojet ammunition and what remains of it almost certainly can't be fired.</span></li><li> There are missiles which deploy minefields, and artillery shells that launch radio and radar jammers. Some missiles can use Inferno rounds, which is basically napalm on crack.</li><li> Another special mention goes to the Fluid Gun, which, as the name suggests, can be adapted to spray a variety of fluids, including water, oil, coolant, Inferno gel, and acid.</li><li> BattleMech flamers vent the 'Mech's reactor plasma onto the target. Jump jets use it to propel the 'Mech through the air. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponizedExhaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponizedExhaust">A jump is one of the time-tested methods of clearing off infantry making a swarm attack, by crisping them.</a></li><li> Gauss Rifles are abnormal in the context of 'Mech weaponry: whereas missile and autocannon ammunition has a chance to explode violently (and usually lethally) if struck by an attack, Gauss Rifle ammunition, being inert ferrous slugs, will just break, with no other effects. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium">If the Gauss Rifle itself is hit, however, it will explode with enough force to destroy the armor or torso location where it is mounted.</a></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbnormalLimbRotationRange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbnormalLimbRotationRange">Abnormal Limb Rotation Range</a>: Some 'Mech designs can rotate their arms 180 degrees to aim at targets directly behind them. By the construction rules, this is enabled by designing the 'Mech without any hand and lower arm actuators at all (they formally keep their shoulders and upper arms); since on OmniMechs these same actuators happen to be merely pod-mounted and can be left off at leisure, in principle any Omni that doesn't explicitly put them back <em>on</em> can do this by default.<ul><li> The UM-R60 UrbanMech is unique in that it can turn its torso 180 degrees, allowing it to attack while moving in any direction (which is extremely helpful in the urban environments the UrbanMech is designed to fight in).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsentAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsentAliens">Absent Aliens</a>: Humanity has spread to many different planets, and there are no other sapient species out there.

Even with scores of distinct "stock" 'Mech designs rolling off the factory lines in usually a number of variants already, individual MechWarriors still show up in customized personal rides time and again. Possibly the earliest example in the novels (and certainly still one of the iconic ones) is Justin Allard's <em>Yen-Lo-Wang</em>, a <em>Centurion</em> modified to replace its autocannon and long-range missile rack with a shorter-ranged but <em>far</em> more powerful autocannon specifically for arena combat. After his son Kai inherited it, it was again customized with a gauss rifle replacing the autocannon.<ul><li> OmniMechs are specifically designed for customization with a set amount of payload mass and internal space for loadouts using special modular equipment easily interchangeable with any other OmniMech's payload, as well as a specialized gyrostabilizer design that allows for automatic recalibration within the parameters of the allocated pod mass and space. Standard BattleMech gyros take technical skill to manually recalibrate like that, and OmniMech gyros also need such manual recalibration if the base mass distribution is altered.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyFourMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyFourMooks">Actually Four Mooks</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Battlearmor</a> come in squads of four (or five, for the Clanners).

Until the reintroduction of Lostech following the Clan Invasion, most, if not all mechs in the setting were <em>centuries</em> old, maintained and kept running because they couldn't be replaced. Several advanced technologies necessary for the continuance of life on colonies (terraforming tech, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpShips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpShips">Jump Ships</a>, etc) were lost, resulting in colonies dying out, the remaining JumpShips being emphatically off-limits as targets, and so on. Mechwarriors placed (and still place) a high emphasis on salvage from their battles, sometimes even more than monetary gain, because even <em>broken</em> equipment was more valuable than other spoils of war. The only reason that the post-apocalypse genre is not more emphasized is because, from the outbreak of the First Succession War to the Jihad (c. 2786 - 3081, or a period of <em>three hundred years</em>), the apocalypse <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunctuatedForEmphasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunctuatedForEmphasis">keeps.

It included units and characters from four of the five Great Houses, all six Invader Clans, most of the major Periphery states, and a huge number of mercenary companies.

In a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultBackfire">Insult Backfire</a>, the Clan decided to embrace the Diamond Shark as their new mascot and changed their name. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Some sea foxes did apparently survive in captivity, though, and Clan Diamond Shark eventually effected a name change <em>back</em> to Sea Fox around 3100.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryMinimumRange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryMinimumRange">Arbitrary Minimum Range</a>: Many long-range weapons have minimum ranges, making it harder to hit within that minimum range. There are a variety of reasons: For missiles (most notably Inner Sphere Long Range Missiles), there is a distance arming fuse that typically doesn't kick in until they're past the minimum range. For ballistic weapons, it's typically because the barrel is long and ungainly to aim (though artwork sometimes doesn't depict this). For <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningGun">PPCs</a>, it's because there's a safety system designed to prevent the shot from damaging the firing unit with electrical interference. The lack of minimum range on extended range PPCs is partially explaned by "field inhibitors." There's an optional rule to disengage the field inhibitor on a standard PPC, removing the minimum range but risking damage to the firing unit. ERPPCs presumably have better field inhibitors that remove the minimum range and the possibility of particle feedback to the firer.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArcadeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArcadeGame">Arcade Game</a>: Back in the 1990's, there were several <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BattleTech_Centers">Battletech Centers<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> - an immersive arcade with enclosed mech combat simulators.

In fact, 'Mechs that physically hold weapons in their hands are very, very rare (and growing more so, as most of them are Unseen, i.e., based on artwork <em>BattleTech's</em> owners do not have the rights to). If a 'mech has a weapon in an arm that has a lower arm actuator but not a hand actuator, odds are that weapon is depicted as such in the artwork.

It was discontinued ten years after it was made.</li><li> To say nothing of the <em>Lucifer,</em> a medium aerospace fighter that has <em>no ejection system</em> due to a cockpit redesign. As Technical Readout: 3025 put it, "the pilot is strapped into his fighter until he lands or crashes, whichever comes first." Even worse, the fighter has problems with dead-stick atmospheric re-entry <strong>and</strong> its ammo bays have a tendency to suffer internal explosions (destroying the craft) even <em>outside</em> combat!</li><li> The four-legged Clan Hell's Horses second-line mech called the <em>Thunder Stallion</em> has been referred to as a "quad coffin" by some mechwarriors due to the fact that some of the ammo for its main weapon (a Class 20 Autocannon, one of the most powerful weapons in the game) is located in the <em>head,</em> where the pilot is also located. If that magazine gets cooked off with even one round loaded in, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadASplode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadASplode">the mech gets decapitated</a> and the pilot gets fried.</li><li> The <em>Spider</em> gets this treatment as well, at least in its earlier incarnations &mdash; due to the mech's small size, the cockpit is largely located in the torso, and the placement made putting in an ejector seat too difficult to accomplish.</li><li> A borderline case exists with the stock Succession Wars-era <em>Vindicator</em>.

Swords, bucklers, Bombast lasers, and Flails are all popular weapons.</li><li> Many of the more iconic 'Mechs are ridiculously impractical. For example, the Mad-Cat/Timberwolf (the one with two beam arms and big missile launcher shoulders - currently the page image) is, pound for pound, one of the absolute best Heavy 'Mechs that you can get, with an OmniMech design that makes it versatile, an array of weapons that makes it deadly at any potential range (in its default configuration), and a price tag that makes it completely ridiculous to afford. The Timberwolf has a cost of 24 million C-Bills. An Atlas (the <em>other</em> iconic Mech, with a skull-like face design) has a cost of less than 12 million C-Bills, and is almost as powerful as a Timberwolf (sacrificing some versatility for firepower). Meaning you can buy two Atlas 'Mechs for the price of one Timberwolf. This is emblematic of Clan 'Mechs. Of course, being the Clans, their 'Mechs and technology are not typically for sale on the open market. . . until the mid-late 3060s, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRace">Clan Diamond Shark</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun">smells money in the water</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9srg7');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note9srg7" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9srg7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though the Diamond Sharks had to step pretty lightly to avoid the other Clans taking umbrage at the selling of cutting-edge Clan military technology to what was still more-or-less the enemy</span>.<ul><li> Clan 'Mechs (especially most "Primary" OmniMech configurations) have a marked tendency to pack <strong>way</strong> more weapons onto the platform than they can reasonably ever use. The above <em>Timber Wolf</em>, with its arrays of PPCs, ER and pulse lasers, and missiles; the <em>Warhawk</em> with its four PPCs; the <em>Nova</em> with its <strong>twelve</strong> ER Medium Lasers; and most <em>Dire Wolf</em> configurations are standout examples. Firing all, or even most, of the available weapons on any of these will spike your heat into "this is bad" territory, if not push it all the way to automatic shutdown. Inner Sphere 'Mechs have this problem both less and more: Succession Wars era designs lost double heat sink technology, but also the XL engines and Endo Steel structure that let you pack more weapons into a 'Mech, with the result that many 'Mechs from that time will have either one group of weapons for one job (say, long-range fire) and one for another (say, close-in brawling) and you're simply not supposed to use both sets at the same time. Others just have a jumble of assorted guns, leaving it to pilot discretion what and how much to fire at any given time and whether or not to risk overheating. As the Inner Sphere recovered Star League technologies, it became possible to mount more equipment on 'Mechs, though many were still limited by the extra bulk of the lighter systems. The <em>Marauder II</em> is a sterling example of this, with a pants-browningly scary array of PPCs, ER Medium Lasers, and an autocannon, but so packed with goodies it has no space for Double Heat Sinks, making the heat of its weapons fire (and the possibility of that detonating its AC ammo) a very real concern.</li><li> "Zero-Heat Alpha Builds" straddle between this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a>. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>: a 'Mech build that can fire all of its weapons at once with zero heat buildup.

You're either undergunned compared to a different variant of the same 'Mech, your internals are filled with heat sinks (which can take crits and ruin your zero-heat alpha strategy) or both. That said, it's enormously satisfying (and can be quite effective) to let fly with EVERYTHING and not have to worry about the deleterious effects of heat.</li></ul></li><li> Any weapon that gets over ten damage starts to stray into this territory, due to being being exceptionally heavy, taking up several critical clots, extremely high heat, extremely low ammo-per-ton, or a combination of the above.

Comparatively, a Clan Ultra Autocannon/20 does 20 damage for 7 heat (40 for 14 if you rapid-fire it and risk it jamming and becoming useless for the rest of the game), weighs <em>twelve</em> tons, takes <em>eight</em> crit slots, and gets only 5 shots per ton of ammo (and has not quite half the range of the ERPPC). LRM-15, LRM-20, and SRM-6 launchers are comparatively forgiving in terms of weight, heat, slots, and ammo. . . but there's no guarantee every missile fired will hit, and thus that you'll get the weapon's full damage potential every time you fire it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy">Badass Army</a>: The (larger) Mercenary company armies are usually made of the best of the best MechWarriors, pilots, and crews.<ul><li> Many of the most prestigious House regiments, frontline Clan galaxies, the ComGuards and the Blakist Shadow Divisions also fall here.

When he was tried by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">Clan Council</a> after the war, it basically consisted of Ulric and his defense proving that he was just doing his job.<ul><li> He also pulled another gambit during the Refusal War with the Jade Falcons. Most of the Wolf warriors he led into battle were of the Crusader faction, while he sent most of the Warden-minded ones away to the Inner Sphere. Win or lose, he would thin out the ranks of the Crusader-oriented Wolves who were causing problems as well as deny the Falcons the pleasure of beating Wardens. However he also got hit by one where the Jade Falcons used their freeborn and low-skilled trueborn warriors as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder">Cannon Fodder</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg rushes</a>, so that by the time the Wolves got to the high-ranking and/or skilled Falcons they were worn down first.</li><li> The Battle of Tukayyid is another example.

ComStar decided, therefore, to challenge the Clans to a winner-takes-all battle on Tukayyid, inviting the Clans to bring their absolute best to the battle, with the results of victory either being that ComStar loses and doesn't stop the Clans from taking Terra, or ComStar wins and the Clans have to stop the invasion for 15 years. The Clans jumped at the chance, and ComStar committed almost all their forces to the battle. The gambit was that either ComStar <em>somehow</em> managed to eke out a victory and stop the Clans cold, <em>or</em> ComStar lost but <em>absolutely devastated</em> the Clans by mangling all of their best equipment and pilots beyond repair.

It is, succinctly, perfectly balanced: One ton, one crit slot, no ammo requirements, three heat, five damage, respectable (albeit still short) range, and cheap if you're going into more campaign-based play. You can cram a stupid amount of these on a modern medium mech design and still have enough weight left over for extra heat sinks (double type, natch) to at least allow for most of them to be fired. Offshoot variants don't manage it quite as well; either due to range and weight (pulse variant) or excess heat (extended range variant). Some crazy, fan-constructed variants have mounted upwards of 50 of them into a single mech.

The trope is also ultimately subverted &mdash; despite the big machines and a prestigious MechWarrior academy or two, the Lyran military gets just perhaps the least <em>respect</em> among those of the five major Successor States, due in large part to frequently less-than-competent leadership.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">BFG</a>: All 'Mech guns, really. But then there are Seriously Big Effin' Guns; Gauss rifles heavy and standard, any autocannon in the 20-bore size, Clan ER-PPCs, and Long Tom artillery pieces, any of which is sufficent to blow a suit of power armor to vapor or take a 'Mech's head clean off with one shot. And just as a modern tank's main gun is huge compared to a rifle but tiny compared to a battleship's turret, a Mech's guns are small compared to naval artillery as found on Dropships and Warships.<ul><li> In infantry variants, there's Gauss rifles, which can be quite large.

For instance, even the heaviest individual BattleMech-portable weapons can in a pinch be squeezed into a medium 'Mech frame; the result may not carry any other weapons beyond its signature BFG and possibly cut some corners in other areas, but it can in principle be done.

Their extra bulk meant as a counterbalance doesn't quite do the job, as every 'Mech gets ten weight-and-space free heat sinks in their engine, and heavier engines can have a number of space-but-not-weight free heat sinks built into the engine, and these become double as well. With their advent, many 'mechs just mount those free double heat sinks and none additional, especially if there aren't many energy weapons on board. Assault 'mechs are the only ones that really have problems with double heat sinks' bulk, since their typically heavy-duty weapon arrays are also quite voluminous as well and compete for space in designing. Inner Sphere 'Mechs really suffer from this, as IS Double Heat Sinks take <em>three</em> crit slots, while Clan Double Heat Sinks take only two.<ul><li> In terms of weapons, the trope is embodied first and foremost by the medium laser. Modest damage, fairly short range... lightweight, compact, heat-efficient, no ammo needs, and arguably the most ubiquitous BattleMech weapon in the entire Inner Sphere.</li><li> The Clan ER Large Laser. It's a bit heat inefficient (10 damage for 12 heat), lacking the raw punch of the ERPPC or the hit bonus of the Large Pulse Laser, and does not have those two weapons' heat efficiency (both deal equal amounts of heat and damage). But it's two tons lighter and one less crit slot than both, and is the third-longest-ranged weapon in the game (tied with the Light Gauss Rifle) in most eras. Not LRMs, not Gauss Rifles, not ERPPCs can reach out and touch someone as far as the Clan ER Large Laser can. It is exceeded only by the Inner Sphere LB 2-X and Clan Ultra Autocannons by two hexes, and the Clan LB 2-X Autocannon by five, and does between six and nine more damage. Heat problems on many Clan 'Mechs can be solved by replacing ERPPCs with ER Large Lasers, gaining two hexes of range in the process and rolling the space and weight savings into more heat sinks.</li><li> Also, all those fancy BattleMech melee weapons and cool death-from-above moves?

Step 1: Realize your 40-ton mech can't go head to head with a 80-tonner. Step 2: Flee between skycrapers. Step 3: Jump-jet onto top of building, one that's taller than your opponent. Step 4: Wait until opponent is in jump range. Step 5: Gain as much altitude as possible before letting your "light" 35 tons of steel and armament come crashing down on top of your opponent. This is usually considered a last ditch tactic, as even a successful DFA is likely to cause some damage to the attacking unit.<ul><li> Not just light mechs, either.

A formal <em>batchall</em> involves announcing your presence, announcing what units you have (in general terms; you can say you have a Star of 'Mechs, but you don't have to specifically indicate which 'Mechs, for example), announcing what your objective is, and then asking what forces the defender will commit to the battle. The <em>batchall</em> was designed by the Clans to preserve honorable combat, and also minimize losses: by declaring your attacking force, the defender could reasonably look at the correlation of forces and honorably withdraw without actually committing their forces to combat and therefore having to deal with combat losses (a serious concern in the resource-poor Kerensky Cluster the Clans call home). Needless to say, announcing your presence, forces and objectives doesn't work as well when the other side doesn't answer, like the Inner Sphere did when presented with the unknown combat rule: IS forces instead just got set up to blast their opponents, whether by surprise, ambush or otherwise, frequently replying to the <em>batchall</em> with something along the lines of "You want to know what forces I've got, come on down and find out." It speaks to the Clans superiority in combat and technological advantage that purposefully handicapping themselves didn't slow them down at all.</span></li><li> "Bargained well and done," spoken to accept the terms of a <em>batchall</em>.</li><li> And among the now-Annhilated Clan Wolverine:<div class="indent"><strong>Wolverine 1</strong>: And what are we? <br><strong>Wolverine 2</strong>: <em>(switching comms to broadcast in the clear)</em> <em><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCry">Wolverines!</a></strong></em></div></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickenWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickenWalker">Chicken Walker</a>: Quite a few 'Mechs have reverse-joint legs, including favorites like the <em>Marauder</em> or the <em>Timber Wolf.</em></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestBlaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestBlaster">Chest Blaster</a>: Seen quite a bit, from BattleMechs that just install some secondary guns in the torso to support arm-mounted main weapons to such extremes as the <em>Hollander</em> light 'Mech that is basically just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">BFG</a> on legs (it's built around a Gauss rifle that, when also counting its ammo, accounts for almost half its total weight and <em>looks</em> the part). The construction rules actually somewhat encourage this by generally making the left and right side torso locations the ones with the most <em>room</em> to install weapons and other equipment.<ul><li> Slightly less insane than the <em>Hollander</em> is the classic <em>Hunchback</em>, whose variants (with very few exceptions) mount the biggest cannon possible for their tech level into their right torso. A <em>Hunchback</em> that DOESN'T have a gargantuan cannon jammed into its torso is such a different beast that most pilots will not call it a <em>Hunchback</em> at all (they're <em>Swaybacks</em> instead)</li><li> Slightly <em>more</em> insane than the <em>Hollander</em> is the BZK-F7 variant of the <em>Hollander II</em>. Initially, the BZK-F5 <em>Hollander II</em> was built to address the original's shortcomings, increasing the 'Mech's mass by ten tons and adding extra armor and some backup weapons. Then someone had the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">bright idea</a> of stripping out all of its weapons and replacing them with a single <em>Heavy</em> Gauss Rifle.

There are three exceptions to this:<ul><li> If a mech has partial cover, then any shots that would normally hit the location behind the cover hit the cover instead. If this is because a battlemech is standing behind a low hill, this doesn't really matter. If it's because the mech is standing behind a small building, on the other hand, the building takes the hit. This can potentially destroy the building if it takes enough damage.</li><li> Weapons that strike entire hexes, like artillery, always hit *something*. If you miss the target, you roll on the scatter chart to see which direction the shell drifts off-target, then calculate the distance based on how badly you missed by. This could mean that it hits another enemy unit. This could mean that it hits one of your own units. At point-blank range, this could potentially wind up drifting so badly that it lands behind the unit that fired the shell.</li><li> There are advanced rules for calculating a missed shot to see what it's chances are of hitting something else that's on the line from the attacking unit to the target. As this adds a lot of extra work, it slows the game down considerably and is therefore not used very often.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">Colony Drop</a>: The Jihad had a few Asteroid Drops caused by Word of Blake, in one case framing the Federated Suns in the eyes of Taurian Concordat, sparking another front the Suns didn't need.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolHelmet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolHelmet">Cool Helmet</a>: The Neurohelmet.

Takashi was a staunch disciple of Bushido, which resulted in a bad showing in the Fourth Succession War. By the time the War of 3039 rolled around, his son Theodore was being groomed for succession and had already become general of all the Draconis Combine Mustered Soldiery. His more pragmatic view to warfare was a major factor in the change of fortunes compared to the Fourth Succession War. Teddy's son Hohiro Kurita in turn is more a mind like his father than his grandfather, which makes the two far more able to strategically combat the Clans than the old die-hard Bushido warriors in the DCMS.</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">hat</a> of Clan Star Adder is that, amongst the Clans, they most resemble a professional military and prize unit cohesion, military intelligence and long-term strategic thinking.

A suit of BattleArmor has a certain number of armor points (depending on how heavy the suit is, how much of that weight it devotes to armor, and how advanced its builder's armor technology is), plus one for the trooper inside. The definitive BattleArmor, the Clan basic Elemental armor, has ten armor points. Hitting a BattleArmor trooper with a weapon that does ten damage means the suit's armor is completely stripped (and so, logically, the suit itself should be all but destroyed), but the trooper in question can still run, jump, shoot all his weapons (that still have ammo), and climb up a 'Mech to try and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint">tear up its actuators with his armored hands</a>. Only when that eleventh point of damage, representing the trooper inside, is taken, is the BattleArmor out of comission.<ul><li> 'Mechs can theoretically remain active and functional with just one point of internal structure remaining on the center torso, but in reality a 'Mech is far more likely to sustain critical damage and become combat nonfunctional (or withdraw) well before that. Engines and gyros are in the center torso, three engine hits "kills" a 'Mech by forcing the engine to shut down; two gyro hits make it impossible for the 'Mech to stand (though it can prop itself up with its arms to keep shooting). Your shots aren't likely to all go to the CT, you'll scatter damage across left and right torsos, arms, legs, and head, which all have their own armor and structure and components you can damage to decrease the 'Mech's effectiveness. Killing a 'Mech by reducing its CT to zero structure is known as "coring" among the fans.<ul><li> 'Mechs can easily suffer a CEF through one thing: ammo explosions. Damage transfers through a 'Mech, you see. . . hit a left arm that has only five structure with your Autocannon/20, fifteen of your damage isn't just lost, it goes to the left torso. When an ammo bin takes a critical hit, the ammunition explodes, dealing damage equal to what the weapon does when fired once times the number of shots remaining in that ton. So if a full ton (five shots) of AC/20 ammo explodes, it does 100 damage to the location it was stored in, and if that location can't absorb 100 points of damage without being destroyed (impossible), it transfers to the next location. Damage always transfers towards the CT, so a 'Mech suffering an ammo explosion (without the benefit of CASE to mitigate it) pretty much inevitably dies immediately.</li></ul></li><li> Conventional vehicles can mount <em>way</em> more armor than a 'Mech of the same tonnage, and can put on a pretty frightening array of weapons to boot. But vehicles are <em>very</em> prone to suffering "motive system" crits, even when they have plenty of armor left, which can increase the difficulty of piloting rolls, reduce the vehicle's MP, or even render it immobile. They can also suffer "turret locked" crits, which locks the turret in the direction it was facing when the crit occurred. A good volley of fire can reduce your fearsome combat vehicle an expensive battlefield ornament.</li><li> Conventional infantry platoons are filled with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One Hit Point Wonders</a>, each point of damage kills one trooper (some weapons may be more or less efficient at this). The more soldiers are in the platoon, the more hits it can acheive and thus the more damage it can do, but the whole platoon is not destroyed until the very last soldier dies.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalFailure">Critical Failure</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp">Death from Above</a> attacks have a very high probability of dumping the attacking mech on its face, missing the target entirely. Rapid fire weapons like rotary and ultra-autocannons have a chance to jam if they're fired more than once in the same turn. It's possible to get critical failures from <em>movement</em>; roads are notoriously good at making your battlemechs stumble around like they're drunk, as players need to perform a roll when making high-speed maneuvers on smooth surfaces - fail the roll, and the mech will faceplant onto the road or the ground next to it. God forbid you have to turn on a road while in a city, as failing the rolls will make your mechs slam into buildings, taking huge amounts of damage and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDominoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDominoes">even worse depending on what you slam into you could then cause the building you slam into to collapse on top of you for more damage</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">You can also skid into other units. . . typically your own.</a><ul><li> The Experimental Hyper-Velocity Autocannon lines have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalFailure">Critical Failure</a> condition where getting a bad enough roll when using one of these Autocannons causes the gun to blow up in your face for damage to the unit using them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit">Critical Hit</a>: Any sort of combat machine, be it 'Mech, aerospace fighter, Dropship, or vehicle, can suffer critical hits to their internal components.

Under certain conditions, some weapons can bypass your armor's threshold for damage mitigation to score a Through-Armor Critical Hit.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureChopSuey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureChopSuey">Culture Chop Suey</a>: While each nation has a dominant culture, they also have hundreds of billions of inhabitants across dozens or hundreds of worlds, each with its own influences.

In addition, ComStar had studied the Clans and knew that they couldn't decline a challenge without a serious loss of honor, which the warrior culture wouldn't allow, and ComStar also knew that the Clans preferred direct combat with 'Mechs over any other form of battle. As a result, ComStar was able to utterly savage the Clans using indirect attacks (artillery, aerospace assets, ambushes, etc), asymmetric warfare, direct challenges in which a Clan unit about to break and retreat was instead goaded into continuing the attack for honor's sake, and human wave tactics. The result was that ComStar lost <em>a lot</em> of lives and equipment, utterly savaged by the Clans superior weaponry, equipment and training, but the Clans lost <em>worse</em>, including most of their equipment and some of their best Mechwarriors for an entire generation.<div class="indent"> <strong>Tex Talks Battletech</strong>: tl;dr, the Clans brought their best.

So when one faction does succeed, it must inevitably fall (Star League, Federated-Lyran union, Republic of the Sphere), and when widespread peace breaks out it must be betrayed (Clan Golden Century, Dark Age).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation">False Flag Operation</a>: Many examples crop up but the Blakists are the masters of this trope. One of the reasons the Jihad was initially successful (despite taking on all the major powers at once) was because the Word was able to trigger several brush wars, civil uprisings and succession movements to weaken their enemies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem">Fantastic Caste System</a>:<ul><li> The Clans place <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies">Designer Babies</a> at the top of their society.

A tech maintaining a mech has a higher social standing than one who maintains, say, a hydroponics unit.</li><li> Applies to Scientists as well. A Scientist working on the breeding program or weapons development (both of which support the Warriors) enjoys more prestige and standing than one working on new hybrid food crop. Even Laborers, one building a new Warrior barracks or testing ground is better than a mere farmer. And even among Warriors, the statuses of Trueborn or Freeborn, if you have a Bloodname, the pedigree of the specific Bloodname you hold, which Bloodhouse you belong to, rank, age, and personal combat record all influence a specific Warrior's standing. Basically, the Clans have a Fantastic Caste System <em>inside</em> their Fantastic Caste System.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a>: While normal racism is far more common; many Trueborns see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticSlur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticSlur">"Freebirths"</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunyEarthlings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunyEarthlings">Puny Earthlings</a> and many freeborns consider "Trashborns" to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotEvenHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotEvenHuman">Not Even Human</a>. Neither charge has much basis in reality.<ul><li> The Free Worlds League, despite being the most tolerant society in the Inner Sphere when it comes to any form of diversity, discriminates against those with cybernetic implants. Paradoxically they are also the most tech savvy of the Great Houses in many areas.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticUnderclass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticUnderclass">Fantastic Underclass</a>: Below all the official castes in the Clans' Fantastic Caste System exists the Bandit - aka "Dark" - caste. Its members are the outcasts and rejects of Clan society, often those who have failed in their assigned (or reassigned) caste but who refuse to accept demotion, or simply those who do not fit in to the rigid structure of Clan life.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Fantasy Counterpart Culture</a>: In spades.<ul><li> Each of the Inner Sphere States includes populations with roots in various Earth cultures (or rather: a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeParkVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeParkVersion">heavily fictionalized version of these Earth cultures as outsiders might imagine it</a>), usually with one being strongly dominant. However, what the nations of the BT universe have in common is that they're strongly "medievalized", so to speak - the historical circumstances of the setting being engineered in a way that it promoted feudal societies, traditional knighthood, courtly intrigue, isolationism due to poor communication and complicated methods of transport and so on.<ul><li> The Draconis Combine, based on samurai-era and World War II Japan, is the most culturally homogeneous. The only two major exceptions to this are the Muslim Azami and, prior to its secession in 3034, the Scandinavian-influenced Rasalhague Military District.</li><li> The Free Rasalhague Republic is extremely Norse, to the point of having a sea serpent for its banner and later merging with a winter-themed Clan that was co-founded by a man with strong Nordic ancestry.</li><li> The Capellan Conferedation is predominantly Chinese, but also has notable Russian and Indian populations. They're kind of a mishmash of dynastic Imperial China (how they like to be percieved) and modern Communist China (how they really are).</li><li> The St. Ives Compact started as pre-transfer Hong Kong, with elements of Taiwan being added over the years. The latter is lampshaded with the april fools e-book <em>Free Taiw...St. Ives</em>.</li><li> The Lyran Commonwealth is German, with Norse and Italian influences. And with references to the Norse pantheon all over the place.</li><li> The Free World League somewhat avoids this, being the only nation that isn't a clear-cut throwback to a specific Earth culture. While its ruling House Marik are descendants of Czech nobility, the biggest member-states of the FWL between them contain cultures from Europe, South Asia and the Middle East, and the numerous smaller regions and independent worlds are drawn from all over Earth.</li><li> The Federated Suns can be summed up as the "Western" faction, with its leaders being of Anglo-French stock; and being the ones most rooted in Western political traditions, with Arthurian elements woven into the culture.</li><li> Historically, the Terran Hegemony could be considered "the Anglo-American alliance IN SPACE!"</li></ul></li><li> The Periphery States:<ul><li> The Marian Hegemony wishes it was Rome, as per its founder's design.</li><li> The Magistracy of Canopus is like Las Vegas (tons of slot machines everywhere) and the rest of Nevada (legalized prostitution) combined.</li></ul></li><li> The Clans: Generally, the Clans are less defined by having strong roots in a specific Earth culture like the Spheroid states, and more as having themes (there's the trader clan (Diamond Sharks), the religious clan (Cloud Cobras), the over-aggressive clan (Smoke Jaguars), the mystic clan (Nova Cats)...). However, a common element of Clan society is that is is actually a mix of Maoist China, the Mongol Empire, ancient Sparta (with the importance put on martial prowess, raising their kids <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay">The Spartan Way</a>, their cruel treatment of and disdain for serfs, civilians and freebirths in general (all of whom are basically various version of helots) etc.) coupled with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraveNewWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraveNewWorld">Brave New World</a>-like mindset when it comes to eugenic matters, a very pronounced disgust for natural conception, sexual promiscuity and restricted freedom of thought.<ul><li> Clan Coyote has some Native American influences sprinkled in.</li><li> Dark Age Clan Hell Horses modeled their tactics after the Mongols, even naming this philosophy the Mongol Doctrine. Then the Jade Falcons under the leadership of Malvina Hazen took over the doctrine, only they chose to emphasize the terror warfare aspect to frighten opponents into submission. This caused a conflict between two Clans.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel">Faster-Than-Light Travel</a>: Of the "Jump" variety, using a Kearny-Fuchida (K-F) Drive. Ships that do this are called JumpShips. BattleTech has one of the <em>slowest</em> FTL systems in Science Fiction. 30 light years at a jump, but then around a week to recharge. it would take about 9 months for one ship to travel from one end of the Inner Sphere to the other.<ul><li> Travel from one end of the Sphere to the other can be done quicker via a "Command Circuit" &mdash; a series of JumpShips waiting one after the other. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropShip">Drop Ship</a> disconnects from the first Jumper to catch a ride with the next one, and so on. This is incredibly expensive to set up and is essentially reserved for military use or priority travel by the ruling class.</li><li> Though commercial space travel is commonly accomplished by riding one JumpShip for jump or two, then transferring to a different JumpShip for other jumps, in a manner not unlike picking up connecting flights in modern air travel (the HareBrained Schemes <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> video game shows this very well).</li><li> You can speed up the recharging process (and thus the travel time) in a few ways. The main way JumpShips (and their bigger, meaner cousins, WarShips) recharge is by deploying a solar sail and collecting energy from the star they've jumped to. The process is slow, but steady and safe. Many important systems have recharging stations which can recharge a K-F Drive faster than solar collection, and (almost) as safely. Beyond that, a ship may use its own conventional drives and generators to funnel energy into the K-F Drive, though at risk of actually losing charge or damaging the drive. Lithium-Fusion Batteries can store an extra jump charge, but take as long to recharge as the drive itself. You can only charge the drive or LF Battery from one source (sail, station, or onboard energy) at a time, and a source can only charge a drive or a battery, but nothing stops you using one source on the drive and another on the battery, if you're willing to risk potentially damaging the battery.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">The Federation</a>: The Federated Suns, and Lyran Commonwealth. However, while both are largely free societies, both are ruled by autocrats. The Federated Suns has a partially democratic congress, however. The Lyran Commonwealth also has a parliament with some power. Both states do have democratic governments at the planetary and local levels as well, for the most part.<ul><li> The Star League was this to the Inner Sphere; the member states handled their own internal affairs and major decisions were made via a vote by the House Lords who could and did occasionally override the First Lord.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudalFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudalFuture">Feudal Future</a>: All of the Successor states are ruled by royal families and nobles, with individual nations having different amounts of feudalism.

The former cleaves close to this trope in being intended for humanitarian purposes, the latter are more a case of pragmatism in the face of total societial collapse and boil down to "don't break <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">shit that's hard to replace</a>." This obviously means damaging the remaining faster-than-light Jumpships gets <em>everyone</em> pissed at you, but pretty much any piece of technology more advanced than a microwave oven can be ransomed &mdash; along with the guy who owns it; at any time during a battle, a Mechwarrior can offer to yield with the full expectation of his opponents ransoming him and his Battlemech to his faction, and can usually expect the offer to be accepted. Same with space fighters and dropships; no-one wants to wreck operational technology. It also protects spaceports, industrial areas and power plants. The Conventions are known and acknowledged even at the civilian level because civilian populations and agricultural areas are implied to be part and parcel of those sites as they're the local source of trained workers to <em>run and maintain</em> them &mdash; especially because a lot of the expertise is passed down through families. This means that most WMDs are also banned, because biosphere damage that kills too much of a planet's population is likely to demolish all technological civilization on the planet, rendering it all but worthless unless someone brings in megatons of hardware and people to rebuild it from scratch. However, the resulting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureFriendlyWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureFriendlyWorld">Adventure-Friendly World</a> clearly demonstrates the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardTruthAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardTruthAesop">Hard Truth Aesop</a> at the trope's heart; the Conventions <em>legalized</em> warfare, and made it so simple and cheap that nations waged war for resources and territory almost <em>constantly.</em><ul><li> As with everything to do with warfare, taken to the logical extreme by the Clans. Where the intent of the Honours was simply to outlaw weapons of mass destruction and keep civilians and irreplaceable Lostech out of the line of fire after the apocalyptic First and Second Succession Wars, The Clan Way and <em>zellbrigen</em> (which rose from the similarly apocalyptic Pentagon Wars) places such emphasis on limiting collateral damage that bidding takes place before all combat, with the intention of keeping even military units that aren't absolutely necessary to achieve victory from being destroyed. Likewise, combat is ritualized to such an extent that in many cases even ganging up 2-on-1 against an opponent was unethical. Naturally, the clash of cultures was a shock during the Clan Invasion.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlawedPrototype">Flawed Prototype</a>: Frequently, prototype 'Mechs, fighters, vehicles, etc. will have serious design flaws and bugs that the finished design may (or may not) iron out. For much of the game's history these flaws were an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">Informed Attribute</a>, only present in the fluff descriptions of the unit but not at all affecting its performance on the tabletop, though later rules for Quirks remedied this somewhat. In fact, a whole Technical Readout book (appropriately entitled "Boondoggles") was all about Flawed Prototypes that were <em>so</em> flawed they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">never made it into production at all.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors">Wolf's Dragoons</a> sourcebook openly speculates that the mercenary unit is actually a scouting party for the return of Alexander Kerensky's Star League Defense Forces.<ul><li> The novel <em>Wolves on the Border</em> features a Clan ritual conducted by members of Wolf's Dragoons.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForGreatJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForGreatJustice">For Great Justice</a>: The Brotherhood of Randis might qualify as a modest mercenary band, except they don't fight for profit, a rare thing in the pragmatic ''BattleTech'' universe.

Due to their relatively small size, they do not have enough space to equip enough weapons and enough armor to go toe-to-toe with heavier mechs without sacrificing speed, at which point it would be more cost effective to field a medium mech. Thus, the light mechs are used for scouting, hit-and-run, and general harassment, with the "fair" opponents for them being the equally light mechs or extremely slow-to-turn mechs.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseDrivenRetitling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseDrivenRetitling">Franchise-Driven Retitling</a>: When <em>MechWarrior: Dark Age</em> was introduced, the original game was retitled <em>Classic BattleTech</em> to differentiate it from the new line (<img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

With no form of marriage in place, warriors reproducing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies">through the eugenics program</a> and civilians though arranged pairs (the resulting children are raised in communal creches), sex is treated like recreation.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams">Frickin' Laser Beams</a>: The current developments of laser weapon technology (as described on that page) <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

This is encouraged in the Inner Sphere and all but mandatory in the Clans.<ul><li> For the Inner Sphere, there are several 'Mech designs, like the <em>BattleMaster</em>, <em>Cyclops</em>, and <em>Archer</em> that are "Command 'Mechs" with extra communications and control equipment to help their pilot both lead a sizeable force and personally kick ass (this is largely a fluff designation, but the Quirk rules give Command 'Mechs an initiative bonus). Someone piloting one of these is likely to be both an extremely cunning and talented leader and an exceptionally skilled MechWarrior.</li><li> In the Clans, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">Asskicking Equals Authority</a> is in full effect, their leaders are typically right there on the front ranks, even up to the Khans.

Marion Marik (about the only leader who didn't maul the Periphery during the formation of the Star League), Katrina Steiner (the political mind behind the Federated Commonwealth) and Sandra Noruff (the mother of the SLDF) are all prominent examples. Even the male dominated Draconis Combine was rebuilt after a civil war by Coordinator Siriwan McAllister. Natasha Kerensky, aka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">"The Black Widow"</a>, is considered one of the three best Mechwarriors (Kai Allard-Liao and Phelan Kell/Ward have their supporters) of the 31st century.

House Steiner's brief merger with the more military minded Davions purged their officer corps of the worst examples and while Katherine's takeover set things back a little the Lyran Alliance's military isn't the same organization as it was during the Succession Wars. After the Great Refusal many Clan officers simply began disregarding their traditional rules of engagement when fighting Spheroids and one ComStar observer noted that whenever a Clan officer was defeated due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Honor Before Reason</a> his subordinates caught on and weren't fooled the next time round. By the 3070s both the Lyrans and the Invading Clans successfully engaged the Word of Blake in large scale warfare and the ranks of Commanders, Generals, Star Colonels and Galaxy Commanders were more capably staffed; with leaders like Fredrick Steiner and Ulric Kerensky (strong strategic minds as well as capable warriors) having become the norm rather than the exception in their respective factions.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">General Ripper</a>: The Draconis Combine and Capellan Confederation are infamous for these.

The RPG rules codify this, as their intelligence has the same range as anyone else's. This is all but enforced for Elementals. . . if they want to attain high ranks and Bloodnames, especially competing against MechWarriors or AeroPilots, they need to be cunning and play to their strengths. A Trial of Bloodright randomly gives one warrior the choice of how to fight (hand-to-hand or in 'Mechs/fighters/armor), the other of where. If an Elemental wins the "how" decision against a MechWarrior or AeroPilot, they can pulp them in hand-to-hand combat. If they lose, they'll have to get creative to defeat an opponent in a vehicle that masses at least ten times what their single suit of BattleArmor does.</li><li> Hanse Davion is this as well.

Even the biggest 'Mech foot will usually only get one or two troopers out of a conventional infantry platoon, there's a significant to-hit penalty for trying to kick things in your own hex, and missing forces a roll to avoid toppling your own machine by accident.</li><li> This is a valid tactic against enemy 'Mechs that have fallen. A 50 ton 'Mech curb-stomping its downed adversary is every bit as effective as it sounds, and the tabletop game's fluff makes several mentions of cockpits being crushed under giant metal feet.</li><li> In canon, a disputed use of this caused the bitter feud between Wayne Waco and Jamie Wolf. Waco claimed that a Dragoon 'mech had deliberately crushed his son underfoot, who had ejected from his crippled 'mech. The Dragoons denied it (either denying outright that it happened or denying it was deliberate), but the incident would culminate in the Waco Rangers assaulting Outreach as part of the Word of Blake's attempt to decapitate the Dragoons early in the Jihad.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>: Many designs that sacrifice armor for firepower. Of the few standard examples there many long-range support mechs who are not expected to fight in close combat, the Hollanders who are basically light mechs built around big guns, the Hunchback IIC, the purposely underarmored Clan mech with the goal of being the last ride of the dishonored or deathseekers past their prime, and the Hellbringer (Loki), a 65-ton Clan mech well known for its significant firepower potential in a highly customizable chassis that does its job well at the expense of being comparatively thin-armored for its weight class.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalCurrency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalCurrency">Global Currency</a>: While individual states still issue their own currencies, they largely operate secondary to one currency that is accepted equally everywhere&mdash;the C-Bill (ComStar Bill). C-Bills have their value backed by the highly important resource of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubspaceAnsible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubspaceAnsible">HPG transmission time</a>, and tend to be a lot more stable in value over any given period than the House currencies as a result. Mercenaries are particularly fond of them due to this. The C-Bill wasn't originally meant to be a currency, just a certificate of purchase for HPG transmission time. As HPG transmission time became more and more a commodity, the C-Bill became a de facto currency backed by it. The different prices for purchasing in each realm's national currency became exchange rates. ComStar eventually embraced the evolution, since it helped strengthen their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NGOSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NGOSuperpower">N.G.O.

For the Federated Commonwealth, the Fourth Succession Wat was a masterful military campaign that united two great nations and promised a new age of prosperity for the Inner Sphere. To the other three Successor States, it was two huge powers teaming up to curb-stomp anyone who got in their way. If you're a Crusader, the Clan Invasion is justified as uplifting the Inner Sphere barbarians and restoring the grand dream of the Star League they so carelessly destroyed.

This is actually surprisingly practical&mdash;trees used as clubs will shatter after a single hit, and finding a good girder can be hard if you're not playing in a city map or are trying to avoid collateral damage. The club increases the 'Mech's physical combat damage and in no way inhibits weapons fire from the 'Mech carrying it, and it can't be damaged the way a traditionally carried axe or sword could.<ul><li> Historically, Hanse Davion did exactly this in the Battle for the NAIS research center on New Avalon during the 4th Succession War, using a severed <em>Marauder</em> arm as a weapon after his 'Mech's hand-carried PPC was destroyed in a physical attack.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellishHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellishHorse">Hellish Horse</a>: The iconography of Clan Hell's Horses, whose name was based on a genetically altered equine species that happened to be carnivorous.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereditaryRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereditaryRepublic">Hereditary Republic</a>: Pretty much <em>every</em> state in the Inner Sphere, to some degree or another.

Engines, gyros, sensors, and even pilots all gradually degrade from damage. For instance, the first critical hit on the engine damages the shielding, inflicting a permanent waste heat penalty. A second hit worsens the penalty. The third hit makes it so the reactor can no longer contain its heat to sustain the reaction and the mech is down for the count. Gyro damage causes piloting skill penalties for one hit and then permanently floors the mech on the second. Sensor damage causes to-hit penalties when targeting, and pilot injury causes a chance for the pilot to get KO'd and makes it gradually harder to wake back up, eventually to the point where the pilot is killed.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodGenetics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodGenetics">Hollywood Genetics</a>: Surprisingly averted with the Clan eugenics program.

The most notable is probably the Atlas, but any mech with heavy armour, no or few explosive ammo bins (Or CASE/CASE II to protect them) and a normal or compact engine can happily lose its arms and side torsos and still be capable of fighting. Such mechs are generally nicknamed 'Zombie' units since only decapitation or engine destruction can kill them quickly.<ul><li> Oddly enough, the light scout <em>Spider SDR-5V</em> 'Mech fits this description perfectly: it only has two medium lasers as weapons, and mounts 8 jump jets with no heat sinks. However, the two lasers are mounted in the center torso, with the majority of the jump jets mounted in the legs and center torso as well. Taking off the <em>Spider</em>''s arms, or even the left and right torso sections, doesn't slow down the 'Mech at all (though the pilot might be a little worse for wear): it can still dish out the exact same amount of damage and have the same impressive mobility until the head or the center torso is destroyed.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyGracefulGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyGracefulGiant">Impossibly Graceful Giant</a>: Averted. 'Mechs are basically tanks with legs. With a trained pilot and properly calibrated systems, they become agile runners, can negotiate rugged ground, and throw solid punches, but precise hand coordination is difficult. It's possible to use waldos to directly control the hands and arms on 'Mechs, but it's nearly impossible to use them for any sort of graceful action - you could not for example, use both arms to operate a giant 'Mech-sized shovel, without repeatedly jabbing the ten ton shovel into your mech.<ul><li> Which is as realistic as anything else in the game gets, but raises the question again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">why use the humanoid form at all</a>?<ul><li> The answer is that they often don't.

In terms of raw damage per ton, compactness, and ammunition independence, <em>energy</em> weapons rule the roost. . . at least, right up to where they overload their carrying platform's ability to handle their usually-copious waste heat too badly to actually use them all. This is why the vast majority of 'Mechs carry at least <em>some</em> energy armament, whether as primary weapons or just convenient backup. Ballistic and missile weapons find their niche where they either underbid the energy competition enough in the heat department (this is especially true on conventional vehicles, which can only carry single heat sinks and aren't allowed to field more energy weapons than those can handle but in exchange don't have to count ballistic/missile weapon heat at all) <em>or</em> where they offer capabilities that energy weapons just plain don't &mdash; like special-purpose munitions, indirect fire, or just the right unique combination of range and damage.<ul><li> Kinetic weapons <em>do</em> have higher potential damages than energy weapons. The Autocannon/20 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">deals 20 damage per shot</a>, the LRM-20 can deal 20 damage if all the missiles it, the SRM-6 can deal twelve (higher than most energy weapons, but edged out by some), and the Gauss Rifle deals 15, the same as the Clan ERPPC, but with 14 less heat. However, just about any weapon that gets much above ten damage starts to stray into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> territory, either through too much heat to effectively sink or prohibitively high costs in tons, crits, and ammo requirements (progressively heavier weapons have progressively fewer shots per ton allocated to ammo). Kinetic weapons also deal about half-to-a-quarter as much heat as they do damage; most energy weapons <em>at best</em> generate as much heat as they do damage. Units that can't spare the space or weight for extra heat sinks, but can spare it for ammunition, can get a lot of mileage out of ballistic and missile weapons.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonScientistsGetNoRespect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonScientistsGetNoRespect">Klingon Scientists Get No Respect</a>: Despite Clan dogma which emphasizes the virtues of all five castes, the warrior caste in most Clans only <em>very</em> grudgingly respect scientists and technicians, and have no respect for merchants and laborers. Even the most open-minded Clans see the civilians as a support system for the warriors, with the only notable exception being the Diamond Sharks (who consider their merchants to be a more subtle form of warrior), the Hell's Horses (who place more emphasis on combined arms strategies and less on politics that interfere with their own castes), and the Ghost Bears (whose emphasis on the strength of family results in higher regard for all the castes).<ul><li> Justified and also deconstructed after the Wars of Reaving. The other castes distrust the Scientists (those that weren't executed, imprisoned or sterilized anyway); because a good number of them turned out to be traitors and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDoctor">murderers</a>. However, when the current ilKhan at the time later decided to abuse his authority over who should be free from the "taint" of freeborns, it ultimately ended with the demise of both himself and his Clan's (the Steel Vipers), with the former being bludgeoned to death by the Khan of the Star Adders for violating Clan law and the latter being subjected to a Trial of Annihilation for their Khan's grievously dishonorable conduct.</li><li> Clanners hold little regard for the lives of the technicians on their JumpShips and WarShips. A captured Clanner technician on an Inner Sphere ship is surprised at the advanced life support and protection suits that all of the workers are given when working in dangerous conditions.</li><li> This trope is also Deconstructed with Clan Smoke Jaguar. Turns out that being a Clan of mostly warriors and little to no scientist, engineers, and even basic workers, means that you have to raid other people for basic supplies. This lead to them having no allies during the Clan Invasion, Mechs and weapons that could not be replaced anywhere near fast enough, and lower caste members defecting to the Inner Sphere. There is a good reason Clan Smoke Jaguar no longer exists; their over-emphasis on the Warrior caste and completely ignorant eschewal of their other castes resulted in both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">Crippling Overspecialization</a> and being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a>. This served as a begrudging lesson to be learned for the Clans as a whole and that is 'never undervalue the potential of your other castes besides your Warriors'. Even the Jade Falcons, the most ardent leaders of the Crusader philosophy of the Clans, don't ignore the value of their Scientist, Technician, and Worker castes that balefully. Interestingly, the first Khan of the Jaguars, Franklin Osis, sought to <em>avert</em> this trope during his reign while still keeping a heavy emphasis of martial prowess within his Clan. Unfortunately for him, after his reign ended, the less charismatic successors of him focused only on building the strength of the Warrior caste, and did little to nothing to improve their civilian castes to the point that they outright scorned their very existence within the Clan; thus, the Clan's self-destruction would slowly but eventually be ensured until it ultimately reached its breaking point after the Battle of Tukkayid.</li><li> As a whole the Clans are hypocrites. They consider themselves the most powerful warriors... because they have the most advanced equipment developed by the Scientist caste and maintained by the Technician caste. Clans that acknowledge the contributions of more than just the Warrior Caste (specifically the Battlemech Pilots) have the greatest stability. A point of pride is that most Clanners are genetically engineered by the Scientist caste, so they would literally not exist without them!</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand">Lady Land</a>: The Magistracy of Canopus.

Only the Wolves dissented and they could not win a Trial of Refusal as the odds were set at 4 to 1 against them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a>: 'Mechs themselves.

Sadly, due to being built as a scout 'Mech, the base variant carries almost no weapons at all.</li><li> Cavalry Heavies such as the Flashman and Kuma have this as their niche. Excellent speed and maneuverability, heavy armour and enough weapons to put the hurt on anything they encounter, but tend to require vulnerable components like XL Engines in order to function.</li><li> Clan 'Mechs tended to fit this trope better originally, due to their better technology.

Combined with its massive XXL Engine this allows it to achieve speeds of up to 100 kilometers per hour for short periods.</li><li> Many heavy and assault Aerospace fighters are quite capable of engaging in dogfights with other heavy and medium weight craft as well as assaulting larger targets.

Most of them are over 6 feet in height and very strong but they are also quite fast; having a few hundred pounds of muscle hitting you like a freight train makes them a threat outside their suits. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Clan Elementals</a> are a Clan eugenics phenotype that goes even further through breeding programs.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningGun">Lightning Gun</a>: The Particle Projection Cannon (PPC) looks like this when it fires but actually fires a supercharged stream of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">particles</a> that <em>melts</em> the extremely advanced armor on BattleMechs.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood">Light Is Not Good</a>:<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Word</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">Blake</a> uses angelic motifs and names for their exclusive aerospace fighters, omnimechs and battlearmor.

Pulse lasers, LB-X Autocannons, Gauss Rifles, Jump Ships, Warships, and Extra Light reactors were all eventually rediscovered, though some technology has never been recovered, like the Star League Defense Force's adaptive body armor. Conversely, some advancements beyond Star League tech has occurred; for example, extended range lasers now cover the whole range; Small and Medium-sized lasers, instead of just large. Ultra and LBX autocannon types now cover the whole gamut of bore sizes as well, instead of just 5 and 10, respectively. The Clans, naturally, never had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a> issues, and have more advanced tech in general as a result.<ul><li> And thanks to many worlds experiencing a combination of poor support in the early colonial days and the setbacks of war, most can't produce a full range of modern technologies on-planet, and imports can get pricey.

A couple of the more extreme examples include the <em>Salamander</em> and the <em>Yeoman</em>.</li><li> Rocket launchers rate a special mention. Yes, they're one-shot, they fire only unguided rockets with no fancy special ammo options, and their salvo sizes 'only' range from ten to twenty; but they're lightweight enough that it's easy to carry a <em>bunch</em> of them on a suitably dedicated unit, which can then potentially fire them all off <em>at once</em>.</li><li> Medium-Range Missiles can come in truly enormous launcher sizes. They're not quite as accurate as LRMs, but moreso than Rockets.</li><li> In general, carrying two or more LRM launchers in the 10, 15, or 20 rack is a great way to wreck someone's face from across the map, and carrying three or more SRM launchers in the 4 or 6 rack is great way to make them pay for getting close. Multiple designs and variants of 'Mechs focus on rack upon rack of missiles in various sizes. One of the more notable is the <em>Summoner B</em> configuration, carrying two LRM20s and two SRM4s (and a NARC missile beacon) letting it loose 48 missiles at a time at the right distance.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium">Made of Explodium</a>: Ammunition, while capable of reducing a 'Mech to scrap if a reasonably full bin is hit, arguably doesn't count because it's <em>supposed</em> to explode or burn in the right circumstances, either to project the projectile, or to damage the target. However, the game features non-ammo explosive components as well, most famously every model of the Gauss rifle.<ul><li> There are optional (as well as physically impossible in-universe) rules for the Fusion reactor that powers the 'mechs, allowing them to explode messily when damaged, which is often easier than the amount of armor would indicate.

All the "home clans", those that didn't qualify for the original Clan Invasion in the 3050s, declared that the invader clans were "tainted" by contact with the Inner Sphere. As a result, the Wars of Reaving happened, where the Invader Clans' assets still in the Kerensky Cluster were savaged. Meanwhile, the Invader Clans themselves were too busy fighting in the Jihad, dealing with a monster that made Stefan Amaris look like a mere schoolyard bully in comparison. The "Home Clans" eventually beat each other bloody and cut off from the Inner Sphere, and the Invader Clans all followed Clan Ghost Bear's example by moving wholesale to the Inner Sphere, forming their own separate Clan social structure, some of them hybridizing their societies with their new Inner Sphere neighborhood.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearOption">Nuclear Option</a>: The <em>only</em> accepted use of nuclear weapons under limited warfare is the killing of Warships, which tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a>.

The most clear examples being Clan Smoke Jaguar, who were destroyed by a reformed Star League and abandoned to their fate by their fellow Clans after the bombardment of Turtle Bay, and the Word of Blake, who were destroyed by the rest of the human species after they got too nuke happy. The Taurian Concordat (historically the most WMD happy faction in the setting) was absolutely gutted in the post-Jihad era for using nukes against the Inner Sphere while aligned with the Blakists. Part of this was caused by Spheroid retaliation but most of it was due to a large number of Taurian worlds breaking off and forming their own state to escape the insanity.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingInsanity">Obfuscating Insanity</a>: Sun-Tzu Liao was a master of this before his mother's death.

Along with reasonable restrictions (captive abuse, no detonating nuclear weapons on populated worlds, no chemical weapons, avoid urban damage) it also included things like <em>timeouts</em> for refueling and rearming and armies often surrendered simply because they were "checkmated". War was turned into such a gentleman's game that the Age of War (which lasted over a century) killed far less people than the 20 year Reunification War and the 2 year Fourth Succession War.<ul><li> The Clans' <em>Zellbrigen</em> dueling rules and the Inner Sphere's informal pact of limited warfare subvert this.

The only things they have in common are a focus on space combat and some serious issues with the Draconis Combine.

Clan Ghost Bear eventually moved the entire clan almost wholesale from the faraway Clan worlds to their Inner Sphere holdings. Due to somewhat similar cultures, the former Rashalhague citizens and the Ghost Bear citizens merged quite well, and the nation eventually became the Rashahlague Dominion. It was cemented by the elevation of the son of Haakon Magnusson (the first Elected Prince of Rashalhague) to a bloodnamed warrior in Clan Ghost Bear and creation of the Magnusson bloodname.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a>: From the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CWr3ZUQJeo">trailer for an unused version of a game<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>: "My God!"

Vehicles have these as one of their serious disadvantages; 'Mechs are more resilient and harder to destroy in one hit. 'Mechs themselves can be removed from combat in one shot through blowing off their heads; even the largest mech is limited in how much armor can go on the head (nine points, specifically, combined with three internal structure for the head, and it can take no more than twelve damage before being destroyed), which leaves the cockpit vulnerable. Weapons that can reliably focus more damage in a single hit location than the heads can absorb get the epithet "headchoppers". After all, 20 damage on an Atlas's chest is almost laughable, but 20 damage on it's head has instantly removed a terrifying opponent from combat.<ul><li> Then there's a type of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit">Critical Hit</a> commonly called the "through-armor critical", which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a> - each hit, no matter how minor, has at least a small chance of getting lucky on the hit location table and being allowed to check for critical hits to the location struck even if the latter still has plenty of armor points remaining. (Under the stock tournament rules, this can only affect torso locations on 'Mechs, but there's a popular optional "floating critical" rule that allows this kind of hit to land <em>anywhere</em> &mdash; including the head.) When you score a critical hit, either through-armor or regularly, you get to roll on a table that might let you score between zero and three critical hits, rolling for each one which slot in the location the crit hits. This <em>can</em> potentially result in an otherwise-intact BattleMech getting its first hit from a small-caliber weapon like an AC/2 (the canonical "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping">golden BB</a>" example due to its combination of low damage and long range), having it turn out to be a TAC to the center torso, and get its engine or gyro shot out before the fight has even properly started; the chance of all factors aligning just right for this to happen is very, very small, but it's there. (It should be plainly obvious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure">what happens</a> if a lucky TAC actually manages to hit a proper <em>ammo bin</em>...)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">One Steve Limit</a>: Averted.

If you get kicked out of the commission you are considered a pirate and a criminal rather than a soldier; and pirates are considered free game by everyone.</li><li> Pull too many dirty tricks (or any at all beyond the mid 3050s) and the Clans will get annoyed enough to simply throw duels and honor out the window and turn their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldiers">Super Soldiers</a> and advanced weapons on you at their full potential.

Indeed, in <em>Historical: Operation Klondike</em> (which chronicles the birth of the Clans), one interviewee (a retired Star League sergeant turned bar owner) criticized this method, referring to lower-level SLDF commanders who could shoot straight but "[C]ouldn't lead themselves out of a well-lit parking lot."

These 'Territorial States' were poorly treated, overtaxed, and systematically abused until the collapse of the League.

Clan Diamond Shark combines their love of money with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">love of combat</a>, much to the chagrin of the other Clans.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Warrior Race Guy</a>: The Clans' Warrior Caste - in a half-twist, they are the <em>enemies</em> for once. The Invading Clans who settled down in Inner Sphere are gradually changing to the Proud Soldier Race Guy sub-type, whether they want to admit it or not, at least when dealing with the Inner Sphere "barbarians". The Hell's Horses are the only Clan that provides an rather interesting mix of <em>both</em> the Warrior and Soldier sub-types because, even after the Great Exodus from Terra, they still ascribe to the centuries-old philosophy of combined arms warfare, whom the other Clans consider "hopelessly obsolete" in a field dominated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a>.<ul><li> The Clans end up being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstruction</a> of this trope, first because it turns out that behind all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalPosturing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalPosturing">Cultural Posturing</a>, they're every bit as prone to political bickering and infighting as the Inner Sphere, and second because their hidebound adherence to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsFightLikeGentlemen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsFightLikeGentlemen">a heavily ritualized form of warfare</a> makes it easy for a clever strategist to manipulate them into giving themselves crippling handicaps<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note25mt62');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note25mt62" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note25mt62');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Best exemplified in the Battle of Tukayyid, in which ComStar challenged the hitherto unstoppable Clans to a Trial of Possession for control of Terra. The Clans accepted, because the challenge was made within their rules and they believed ComStar to be a pushover, and then immediately started bidding among themselves for drop order and prestige targets, with the Smoke Jaguars winning by committing the least amount of forces, and the other Clans (except Wolf) following suit. ComStar committed twelve <em>armies</em>, and then exploited the various battlefields by using "dishonorable" tactics like ambushes, artillery, supply raids, hit-and-runs, and goading the Clans into making stupid attacks for reasons of honor. The Clan invasion was stopped because the Clans were too obsessed with honor to fight effectively</span>.</li><li> The soldiers of the heavily militaristic Federated Suns and Draconis Combine, based on Anglo-French knights and Japanese samurai respectively, tend towards this as well, in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoldierVersusWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoldierVersusWarrior">Soldier Versus Warrior</a> way (Suns being Soldiers and Combine being Warriors).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Exemplified</a> by Clan Smoke Jaguar, who represent the worst excesses of the Clan's brutality and contempt for those not born to the Warrior Caste. They're also the tragic perpetrators of a grand case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony">Dramatic Irony</a> as their founder, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">Franklin Osis</a>, had rediscovered his youthful pacifism in his twilight years and wished to temper the ruthless savagery of his Warriors with pursuits beyond the martial. Unfortunately, he was followed by a succession of short-sighted and vicious Khans that enshrined those beliefs he had come to regret, resulting in a Clan that was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards">hated and despised</a> by their ostensible allies, notorious for committing wanton slaughter and a seemingly endless list of atrocities.

The Hegemony was finally finished off by the Great Houses' land grabs and ComStar's takeover of Terra.</li><li> The Jade Falcons came out victorious over the Wolves during the Refusal War, but thanks to some strategic victories by the Wolves as well as a successful repelling of a concentrated assault on the Kell Hounds and the splinter offshoot Clan Wolf-In-Exile (comprised of the surviving original Warden members of the Clan), the Falcons were ultimately in no position to resume the invasion of the Inner Sphere, and were forced to absorb the remaining Wolves in order to re-bolster their strength. This didn't last long either, as treachery by the Falcon leadership in the battle that was Khan Ulric Kerensky's last was revealed and Clan Wolf reasserted itself as a Crusader faction thanks to newly appointed Khan Vladimir Ward, who was the sole witness of the Falcons' dishonorable acts during the war and ultimately killed their two highest ranked members responsible in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight">Trials</a> against them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagnarokProofing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagnarokProofing">Ragnar&ouml;k Proofing</a>: Properly maintained Mechs and Jumpdrives that are centuries old and still work far better than their more recently-made counterparts.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks">Ramming Always Works</a>: The game's charge mechanics can lead to some...interesting results, depending on the unit being used. The aptly titled <em>Charger</em> BattleMech can deal a frightening amount of damage, mostly as a factor of mass and distance traveled. Given that the <em>Charger</em> is 80 tons and can move 86 kph on clear ground, its ramming attacks can be devastating (64 damage points to the target, while the maximum damage it can take as a result of its attack is often just 10 points).<ul><li> Subverted in the rules for aerospace combat, though, where ramming your craft into another isn't just tricky in and of itself but is one of the few times the rules apply a sort of morale check in the form of a (<em>difficult</em>) roll to determine whether your pilot/crew is actually crazy enough to go through with it or chickens out at the last moment.<ul><li> During the Clan invasion, a mortally wounded Rasalhague aerospace pilot named Tyra Miraborg disabled the thrust safeties on her half-smashed 65-ton fighter and flew head-on into the bridge of the Clan flagship. Not only did this cripple the warship her squadron otherwise couldn't scratch, it ejected the commander of the overall invasion into space and brought the Clan advance to a screeching halt. The <em>Clans</em> were highly impressed by this, with even the victimized Clan deciding to rename a new class of assault craft in her honor. Her act was even immortalized as a verse in their poetic history, The Rememberance.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Realpolitik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Realpolitik">Realpolitik</a>: With a few notable exceptions, like the undeniably evil Amaris the Usurper and a handful of insane Capellan chancellors, there really are no good guys or bad guys among the various political leaders.

The debate over whether CGL ought to just retcon once and for all the old designs into the new designs is a cause of a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a> on the official forums. CGL, for their part is not dipping their toes into that water. Yet.<ul><li> "Yet" has kind-sorta happened. On July 24, 2015, Catalyst announced that they were going to redesign the Unseen. The already-released designs <a class="urllink" href="http://bg.battletech.com/news/news-and-announcements/drop-pod-sequence-initiatedthree-two-one/">shown here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> show that these minis are going to go as close as legally possible as they can to the Unseen to replace them wherever an Unseen would be used (mostly pre-3067/Project Phoenix instinces of the Unseen). Further, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://bg.battletech.com/forums/index.php?topic=48674.msg1101187#msg1101187">claims<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> it as a genuine retcon, as the newly-minted designs completely in-universe replace the original Macross/Dougram/Crusher Joe art that can no longer be used.</li></ul></li><li> Confusing the issue further, Catalyst has the rights to use, and does use, the artwork for the 'Mechs taken from all sources not <em>Macross</em> - specifically from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FangOfTheSunDougram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FangOfTheSunDougram">Fang of the Sun Dougram</a></em> and <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrusherJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrusherJoe">Crusher Joe</a></em>. The Thunderbolt, Shadow Hawk, Battlemaster, and others have reappeared in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>.<ul><li> Catalyst, however, has officially said they will not exercise whatever rights they do have to that artwork, out of fear that someday it might come back to bite them legally (the <em>Macross</em> situation having made everyone understandably paranoid). The official stance of CGL is that if it wasn't made "in house" by FASA, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPro">Fan Pro</a> or CGL directly (this also rules out bespoke designs like the Studio Nue redesigns for the Japanese version of BattleTech that became the IIC Clan 'mechs), they will not touch it with a ten-foot pole.</li></ul></li><li> Just to complicate matters further, rumor has it that Catalyst and Topps are trying to sidestep the issue altogether by designing new artwork and models for the Unseen designs, debuting an <a class="urllink" href="http://i.imgur.com/7AekIj8.jpg">updated Warhammer<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> design at Gencon 2015, to considerable interest from fans and a minimum of legal fuss thus far from Harmony Gold.</li><li> A more standard, narrative-based example is the situation regarding 'Mech production. Initially, in <em>Battledroids</em> and VERY early <em>BTech</em>, there was ZERO production, just spare parts to fight over which placed a higher emphasis on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">Schizo Tech</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScavengerWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScavengerWorld">Scavenger World</a> themes. A fairly early retcon created working factories which allows scrapped 'Mechs to be replaced, but without making them numerous either, preserving to a lesser degree the sense of scarcity.</li><li> Similarly, the fact that the Inner Sphere had finally started to recover some lost Star League technologies on a useful scale beginning about a decade before the Clan invasion... was only introduced to the universe <em>after</em> the first novels about said invasion had already been written. This makes several viewpoint characters from said novel sound oddly ignorant on the subject of the invaders' technology in retrospect.</li><li> There is <em>Battletech</em> animated series. However, it deviated far enough from the source material (not necessarily the mechs themselves, but rather the characterization of certain important-to-the-universe people) that it has been declared <em>propaganda</em>: it still exists in-universe, but is widely viewed as at best <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory">Very Loosely Based on a True Story</a>, and at worst as an attempt to make certain parties look better than they are.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy">Revenge by Proxy</a>: One of the many ways in which some of the more oppressive Great Houses of the Inner Sphere (such as Kurita) violated human rights.<ul><li> Pre-Schism ComStar and the Word of Blake also used this as a mean of intimidation. The latter often on a planetary scale.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges">Riddle for the Ages</a>: Jinjiro Kurita, one of more unstable Coordinators of the Draconis Combine, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToMadness">went off the deep end when he received a box that made it through layers of security</a>. The contents were a single doll dressed in a Star League uniform. After nearly killing the two guards who had been sent to check on him, Jinjiro spent the final four years of his life locked in a soundproof room screaming in terror until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">he finally hanged himself with his own clothes</a>. Centuries later, historians remain baffled by what Jinjiro saw in the doll as well as who sent it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightHandVersusLeftHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightHandVersusLeftHand">Right Hand vs. Left Hand</a>: All over the place. Be it mercenary commands getting into conflicts with their employer's regular forces, line units running into trouble with local leaders who feel threatened by their presence, rival commanders jockeying for position and influence (though certain factions, the Clans in particular, encourage this to an extent), business interests and military necessity clashing, or conflicting ideological and regional allegiances, in the 31st Century the enemy doesn't always fly a different flag.<ul><li> The Free Worlds League is the best example. The main weakness of the otherwise solid FWLM is that units from different regions distrust each other and are often taking orders from regional leaders who have goals that don't line up with the commands coming from House Marik.</li><li> The Word of Blake had no less than <em>five</em> different factions on its ruling Conclave. Furthermore, during the Jihad, Precentors Apollyon and Cameron St. Jamais (who commanded the Word's elite Manei Domini and regular WoB Militia respectively) despised each other, to the point that the Shadow Divisions attacked Militia held worlds even while Stone's Coalition was beginning to go on the offensive.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RingOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RingOut">Ring Out</a>: It is possible to knock enemy units off of the map by knocking them into an adjacent hex when they're right on the edge; game rules often treat this as "in retreat" or similar.<ul><li> In-universe, this is a perfectly legitimate way to win many Clan trials; most of these are held in a predetermined battle area called a Circle of Equals. A warrior who leaves the Circle either due to his own actions or those of his opponent automatically loses the contest.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a>: How the Absorption of Clan Widowmaker went down after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nicholas Kerensky was killed</span>. The results were...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">not pretty.</a><ul><li> The rallying cry <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Clan Smoke Jaguar must die!</span> had shades of this as well.</li><li> Early in the First Succession War, the Coordinator of the Draconis Combine was assassinated shortly after nearly conquering the Davion-held world Kentares IV. His son and successor decided the entire planet needed to die. He ordered his troops to kill every man, woman and child on the planet. This <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwakeningTheSleepingGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwakeningTheSleepingGiant">predictably caused a strong response in House Davion's troops, turning the tide in the war.</a><ul><li> It also caused another, directly aimed at House Kurita &mdash; the Eridani Light Horse were repulsed by the massacre, and declared their mercenary contract null and void due to Kurita's violations of the laws of war. The governor of the planet they were based out of responded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">killing all of the Eridani Light Horse's families and dependents</a>. This was a grave miscalculation on Kurita's part &mdash; the unit sought out every representative of the Kurita government and military on the planet and systematically killed them in revenge. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards">When Kurita reinforcements arrived in the system, they promptly learned about the massacre</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">and left</a>.</li><li> Wolf's Dragoons also got in on this during both the Marik Civil War and the events surrounding the aptly-named planet of Misery. Given both their skills and considering their eventual origins, this proved to be a <em>bad</em> thing for the parties they were seeking revenge against.</li><li> The Dragoons had another big one when Blakist sponsored mercenaries attacked Outreach and killed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jaime Wolf</span>, among other atrocities. They proceeded to enact "Condition Feral" - they give every ally <em>one</em> chance to stand down, and kill every hostile without asking or accepting surrender, in an action explicitly compared to a Clan Trial of Annihilation.</li></ul></li><li> The Clans have a socially accepted version of this, the aforementioned Trial of Annihilation. Normally a badly tainted group or personage is Abjured, exiled in other words. If they are considered truly beyond the pale, however, Annihilation is proposed. An Annihilated Clanner is killed, as are all those descended from them, and then all those killed are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson">unpersoned.</a> Like all Clan Trials it is by combat and it's in theory possible to win...but this has only occurred a handful of times in Clan history. The mere proposal of Annihilation usually means all the political bridges have been burned; the vote for the trial determines the odds on the field, and 100 to 1 <em>or worse</em> is the norm.</li><li> The Blakist nuclear and biological attacks on Clan Ghost Bear civilians made things personal. The warriors of the Bears - infamous among the Clans for being slow to act - threw out all the Clan rules of warfare and responded with an Inner-Sphere style campaign of massive bombardments and savage brutality. Even forces which would have had a mutual enmity with the Word of Blake were caught up by their fury. They eventually calmed down and sided with the growing coalition against the Blakists.</li><li> Operation REVIVAL was fully intended to be one of these, to punish the Great Houses for their petty squabbling and arrogance that had destroyed the Star League. In fact, one of the prizes the Invader Clans were bidding for was to claim the honor of getting the invasion corridor through the Draconis Combine, as Kurita had precipitated the First Succession War and thus the Clans viewed them with the same level of contempt as they viewed Stefan Amaris.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething">Royals Who Actually Do Something</a>: Like ancient and medieval kings back on Earth, royalty and other leaders are expected to inspire the people by leading their troops in combat, or at least have combat experience. Does not apply to actual heads of state, usually, but if the excrement is well and truly all over the fan, it happens. Ian Davion, Hanse's Davion's older brother and First Prince before him, died in his <em>Atlas</em>' cockpit, while Hanse and Takashi Kurita both mounted up (and scored several kills each) in defense of their capital worlds.<ul><li> You can't be appointed First Prince of the Federated Suns without spending five years on the front lines as a member of the Federated Suns military. This particular point becomes a big issue for the younger sibling of the First Prince, who stages a very artful coup but never has particularly much legitimacy because she never did any military service. Cue vicious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar">Civil War</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note27mm4b');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note27mm4b" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note27mm4b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Katherine wasn't actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpareToTheThrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpareToTheThrone">in line for leadership</a>, despite being the second-oldest of Hanse and Melissa's children. Peter Steiner-Davion was the real spare, and serving out the required military service even after Victor ended up running the Federated Commonwealth. It's not really clear why Katherine never went into the military to get into the line of succession, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledBitch">given her personality</a>, it seems likely she was just never interested in properly earning whatever power she wanted.</span></li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MechWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MechWarrior">MechWarrior</a> 4: Vengeance</em>, where the protagonist is from a ducal family, seeking to restore legal rule to his planet (and the final battle is with his cousin), and after one of his missions, a lancemate actually says "I guess you're not one of those royals who let the rest of us do the heavy lifting."</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp">Royally Screwed Up</a>: The Camerons of the Terran Hegemony, the Liaos of the Capellan Confederation, and the Mariks of the Free Worlds League to a certain extent. The other great houses also have had their examples throughout the ages, but those are the most prominent.<ul><li> The Camerons were prone to excesses, and occasional bouts of Magnificent Bastardry. This actually managed to be a boon to their nation, until Richard was betrayed by his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreacherousAdvisor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreacherousAdvisor">Treacherous Advisor</a>.</li><li> The Liaos have a serious genetic predisposition to being <em>batshit fucking insane</em>. As in "self-mutilation to show your loyalty" and "kill a few thousand people because I'm convinced a handful are traitors" and "I'm convinced I can kill you with the power of my mind" kinds of insane. The ones that aren't insane are shrewd, competant leaders. The ones that are insane are shrewd, terrifying megalomaniacs.</li><li> The Mariks are known to two major traits: Being largely ineffective on the throne, and killing each other to take the throne. The most effective Marik leader in recent memory turned out to not actually be a Marik.</li><li> While most of the Steiners are skilled, and occasionally brilliant leaders; the family does have a sporadic history of psychological instability ranging from mild irrationality to megalomania. These cases are not as common as in Houses Liao or Marik but when one of them gets on the throne the Commonwealth usually suffers for it.</li><li> Other royal families also had problems with internal strife and political wrangling at each other, but usually not to the ridiculous extent the Liaos and Mariks would display. The Davions and Kuritas generally see infighting of a political and cultural nature rather than being rooted in mental illness.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>: The setting would not exist without this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaltTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaltTheEarth">Salt the Earth</a>: The Cobalt-Laced nukes, used in early Succession Wars and late Jihad.<ul><li> Another way this occurred was through destroying or cutting off a world's access to food and especially water. Many worlds that relied upon imports or terraforming quite literally <em>died</em> because of this during the Succession Wars. Preventing this trope (along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a>) is the number one reason why nearly every faction in the setting has rejected total warfare.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryBlackMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryBlackMan">Scary Black Man</a>: Franklin Osis, the first Khan of Clan Smoke Jaguar. Lincoln Osis, the ilKhan who saw the Great Refusal end the Clan Invasion once and for all, was also one. Leo Showers, Lincoln's predecessor who oversaw the initial invasion of the Inner Sphere, was yet another example. Indeed, this seems to be Smoke Jaguar's stock in trade.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScavengerWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScavengerWorld">Scavenger World</a>: Much of the Inner Sphere.<ul><li> The same applied to the Pentagon worlds before and during Operation Klondike.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">Schizo Tech</a>: Some League technology has been retained, but much has been lost and has to be reinvented. For example, compact fusion reactors and neurointerface technology exists in the setting, but targeting computers weigh several tons and are less capable than WWII-era analog ones.<ul><li> Targeting computers weigh so much because it's not <em>just</em> a computer, but more precise servos for weapon mounts, better sensors, and the like. A Targeting Computer weighs a variable amount based on the combined weight of weapons on the unit, since it needs to tie into all of them to be effective.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem">Screw the Rules, I Make Them!</a>: Pretty much how IlKhan Andrews started up the initial Reavings that would plunge the Clan Homeworlds into all out war. He even got away with killing another Khan before he had a chance to defend himself. His taint doctrine had no precedence in Clan law and only served to allow the Homeworld based Clans to attempt to weaken their Invader rivals. Once the strongest of these allies, the Star Adders, got what they wanted they pointed out that Andrews' Steel Vipers had also been "tainted" and Annihilated them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">under their own doctrine.</a><ul><li> In general, while the ilKhan is beholden to Clan law and the will of the Grand Council, the whole point of an ilKhan is to point the Clans in the same direction in wartime, or other periods of strife affecting the Clans as a whole. As such, they have a fairly broad range to invoke this trope. ilKhan Nicholas Kerensky most of all, since he was still laying the groundwork of what would become Clan society, had no problem making up rules, laws, and Trials on the spot as needed to keep the Clans functioning.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">Screw This, I'm Outta Here!</a>: General Kerensky and the majority of the SLDF fled known space once they realized that the only other option was to fight those they had sworn to protect.<ul><li> Much earlier, after a grinding civil war with the outer systems led to a political upheaval, the 23rd century Terran Alliance completely pulled out of all systems more than a single hyperspace jump (30 light years or so) away from Earth. Not all the systems involved appreciated the maneuver.</li><li> In the leadup to the Wars of Reaving, most of the original Invader Clans saw what was coming and abandoned their homeworld holdings, fleeing to their Inner Sphere Occupation Zones or merging with Spheroid nations to survive. Of special note was Clan Ghost Bear, who covertly evacuated almost their entire civillian population to the Inner Sphere in massive <em>Leviathan</em>-class ships before any of their rival Clans noticed.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScottishTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScottishTrope">The Scottish Trope</a>: The Not-Named Clan <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Wolverine</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</a>: First Lord Jonathan Cameron was plagued by visions of "rough, coarse men from the Periphery" conquering Terra and destroying human civilization. To that end, he invested a large chunk of the Star League's budget developing automated Space Defense Systems around key Hegemony worlds, including Terra itself, to keep them safe from any hostile invaders. These same defense systems would be co-opted by Stephan Amaris and his Rim Worlds Republic forces during their takeover of the League, and turned against the SLDF during their war to liberate the Hegemony.<ul><li> ComStar's Explorer Corps was formed after the then Primus had nightmares about invading monsters from outside the Inner Sphere that bore alarming resemblance to the animals the Clans named themselves after. Said Explorer Corps were what instigated the Clan invasion of the Inner Sphere when one of their ships accidentally discovered the Smoke Jaguar homeworld.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfHealingPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfHealingPhlebotinum">Self-Healing Phlebotinum</a>: The Clans use a biological agent called HarJel in their Elemental Battle Armors. If the suit is damaged, HarJel acts like a sealing agent and also sterilizes suffered wounds and numbs the pain of the wearer. It is also used to instantly seal ruptured hulls of spaceships. 'Mechs can make use of it in similar situations, and combining it with underwater maneuvering units and functionally submersible weapons makes them capable underwater combatants. The secret behind its mass-production is closely guarded by one Clan and thus the product is highly valued throughout Clan Space and the Inner Sphere.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesMascot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesMascot">Series Mascot</a>: The Mad Cat/Timber Wolf is the series iconic design.

Long range weapons in BattleTech rarely have a maximum range that exceeds ~25 hexes, and each hex is ~30 meters long. Most weapons have much shorter maximum ranges, and their <em>effective</em> range is even shorter than that. Apparently the tech level makes giant robots practical, but it can't arm them with anything that goes farther than half a kilometer.<ul><li> This has been repeatedly called out, and repeatedly stated to exist for game balance. In real-world, all of the weapons would have ranges measuring "to the horizon", save possibly Lasers, as those would suffer diffraction. The designers have also directly said that it was for playability as well, as to model accurate ranges would force players into needing 12 or more maps end-to-end, and that it took away the "face-to-face" dueling romance of the game and instead making it a sniper contest.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunsAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunsAreJustBetter">Shotguns Are Just Better</a>: In the right hands, even lower-damage LBX autocannons can <em>tear shit up</em> with cluster munitions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShouldersOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShouldersOfDoom">Shoulders of Doom</a>: On the <em>Atlas</em>, pictured <a class="urllink" href="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/Battletech_3050_Atlas_resized_8459.jpg">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Quite appropriate given the name</a>.<ul><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://www.sarna.net/wiki/Akuma">Akuma<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, produced by the Draconis Combine, shares a similar shoulder-based design as the <em>Atlas</em>, though its shoulders are less prominent than its cousin.</li><li> For the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoulderCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoulderCannon">Shoulder Cannon</a> variant, the missile racks of the <em>Mad Cat's</em> silhouette are probably the most famous.

Afterwards, if someone so much as mentions the names of the Annihilated, that alone is grounds for censure.

Even the smaller tactical nukes, orbital strikes, radiological bombs and nerve gas weapons <em>will</em> destroy anything unfortunate enough to be caught anywhere near ground zero and will severely damage things further outside it. <em>The Wars of Reaving</em> also saw weaponized viruses with a 100% lethality rate against units at the wargame level and player characters at the RPG level.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallRoleBigImpact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallRoleBigImpact">Small Role, Big Impact</a>: Clan Wolverine more or less exists solely in background material for the setting, but their fleeing survivors suddenly appearing in and blasting their way across the Inner Sphere as the Minnesota Tribe is noted in-universe as directly leading to the Second Succession War, which was when the Sphere began its technological regression in earnest. Their appearance also led to ComStar theorizing they may have been connected to the disappeared SLDF, and organizing the project <em>Outbound Light</em>, whose own unexpected arrival on the planet Huntress spooked the Clans into rallying around Smoke Jaguar's plans to invade the Inner Sphere. And the story of The Not-Named Clan and their Annihilation is a psychological wound on the Clans that never fully heals, a societal bogeyman they fear on a primal level. The whole point of the Inner Sphere's Great Refusal was to Annihilate another Clan (Smoke Jaguar) to basically poke that wound with a big needle and say "You sure you want to keep screwing with us?"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSuper">Smug Super</a>: Trueborn Clanners are not exactly humble about their superior breeding and training; to say nothing of their tendency towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalPosturing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalPosturing">Cultural Posturing</a>. Even the friendlier ones (who respect skilled freeborns and honorable Spheroids) are usually characterized as being confident well past the point of arrogance.

While head hits will hurt a 'Mech's pilot and may knock him or her out (and the head is usually the weakest spot on the whole giant armored war machine, period), actually aiming for the head is almost impossible unless the pilot is already unconscious or the reactor has shut down. Even then it's hard enough to pull off that it's more often a finishing move executed at point-blank range than anything else.<ul><li> Any hit on a 'Mech still has a one-in-thirty six chance of landing on the head, so this trope is still in play, if unable to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invoked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invoked">Invoked</a>. The "Punch Location Table" only includes the upper sections: Right, Left, and Center Torso, Right and Left Arms, and Head, so a punch has a one-in-six chance of hitting the head. The Partial Cover rules used to apply a to-hit penalty, but roll on the Punch table if you did hit, making it far easier to headshot enemy 'Mechs standing behind Level 1 hills or buildings. This has been changed to rolling on the regular hit table, and if you hit the leg behind cover, you hit the cover instead (i.e., you miss).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinist">Social Darwinist</a>: The Clans: see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies">Designer Babies</a>. Ironically, <em>real</em> Darwinism bit them on the ass when they tried to retake the Inner Sphere. While the Clans had spent the last couple centuries honing their skills in ritualized honor-bound combat, the Inner Sphere had been fighting wars practically nonstop.<ul><li> Whilst the Clanners might have the upper hand in an organized fight, the Inner Sphere were more than able and willing to employ tactics that the haughty Clan Warriors would see as cowardly. Or to put it simply, the Inner Sphere warriors and commanders were all versed in the art of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">Combat Pragmatism</a>, quite happily exploiting the rigid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Honor Before Reason</a> of the Clans.</li><li> The Clans got wise to it eventually, though. Nowadays Clan forces are permitted to flatly refuse any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureSlang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureSlang">batchalls</a> (challenges) from Inner Sphere forces without any loss of honor, if the Sphere challenge is blatantly intended to use the system to put the Clanners at a disadvantage.</li><li> The Clans are essentially a case study in why Social Darwinism is something Charles Darwin himself detested: it doesn't work on natural selection, and instead of increasing diversity, it selects for arbitrary traits that may or may not be beneficial and <em>decreases</em> diversity.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoldierVsWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoldierVsWarrior">Soldier vs. Warrior</a>:<ul><li> MechWarriors themselves went from one side of the dichotomy to another as the game evolved. The first editions of <em>Battletech</em> (the 3025 start) was essentially set in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScavengerWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScavengerWorld">Scavenger World</a> where 'mechs were rarer than available pilots and MechWarriors equalled medieval knights; most Great Houses' MechWarriors followed chivalric codes (especially the Draconis Combine), and mercenary orders were more akin to knightly orders or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightErrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightErrant">Knights Errant</a>, with 'mech battles taking on a ritualistic, duel-like nature thanks to the Honours of War. As the game evolved more into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryScienceFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryScienceFiction">Military Science Fiction</a>, Inner Sphere MechWarriors became Soldiers; one aspect of a combined arms warfare strategy who took on military ranks and fought with a modern military hierarchy. It was at this point, of course, the Clans came along to take on the Warrior role by having followed the early MechWarrior duel codes to an n-th degree.</li><li> Post-Invasion, Inner Sphere are usually presented as Soldiers and the Clans usually as Warriors: The Clans are warriors who fight for individual glory, honor, and the right to have their genes added to the next generation, and operate on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">Asskicking Equals Authority</a>. Clanner battles are basically honor duels. But since the failure of Operation REVIVAL where their own honor was used against them they slowly started to lean towards the Soldiers, and by the Dark Ages they use <em>zelbringen</em> against Inner Sphere only when it gives them advantage.</li><li> Interestingly, the Hell's Horses are the only Clan that leans heavily on the Soldier side (though they still uphold strong Warrior traditions) because of their centuries-old philosophy of combined arms warfare which favors the effective, tried-and-true mixed deployment of infantry and armored vehicles with their BattleMechs operating as support units rather than front-line units. This is considered rather peculiar among the other Warrior-minded Clans because ever since the development of the BattleMech, they thought it would obsolete the old combined arms approach to warfare and derided the Hell's Horses as being doomed to fail with their "obsolescent" philosophy. The aforementioned failure of Operation REVIVAL proved that the Hell's Horses were smart enough to uphold their philosophy, even though the Horses themselves did not participate in that mission. Inner Sphere combined arms forces, particularly the Federated Commonwealth's Regimental Combat Teams (a regiment of BattleMechs, three regiments of combat vehicles, five of infanty, two wings of AeroSpace fighters, and a batallion of artillery, with other assets like engineers and marines assigned as needed, and all trained and drilled to work together with maximum efficiency) proved capable of wrecking the Clans when they deployed 'Mechs, <em>maybe</em> backed up with Elementals and/or fighters. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Infantry Swarm attacks</a>, artillery bombardment, and strafing runs from fighters were all great ways to curb the tech advantage the Clans enjoyed.</li><li> The Inner Sphere factions have been fighting wars for the past four hundred years, giving it all they got and employing ambushes and artillery and other "dishonorable" tactics, as well as promoting their officers for tactical, strategic, logistical, and administrative ability rather than beating the others into submission. On the other hand, the sizable portion of military elite of the two most militarized Inner Sphere factions, Federated Suns and Draconis Combine, have a rather old-fashioned ideas on how the military should fight that lean on the Warrior side, such as only allowing the noble families to own mechs in the former and the preference for melee where long range should have been preferable for the latter.</li><li> Certain Home Clans wanting to remain Warriors as certain Invader Clans learned (through harsh experience in the Inner Sphere) to be Soldiers pretty much set the stage for the Wars of Reaving, in which Clans "tainted" by the Inner Sphere were violently removed from Clan space.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceAgeStasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceAgeStasis">Space Age Stasis</a>: Over two hundred years went by during the Succession Wars, during which almost no new technology was created, and huge amounts of existing technology was destroyed, or hidden.<ul><li> Though the Clans did not experience this stasis, and thanks to the Grey Death data core and salvaged Clan tech the Inner Sphere has been moving out of it in fits and stops - though the Word of Blake <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">sure isn't helping</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFighter">Space Fighter</a>: Aerospace Fighters.<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePlane">Space Plane</a>: They are also capable of operating in atmosphere.

The first book of the <em>Legend of the Jade Phoenix</em> trilogy goes into much detail about Clan warrior training, and while Clan Jade Falcon is certainly one of the stricter Clans, it's the best look at how it works. A Trueborn sibko starts with 100 infants, who are trained towards being warriors from the moment it's possible to start doing so. By the time their in their early teens and starting what most militaries would consider boot camp, about a dozen of them remain, the others having washed out or died prior. By the time it comes to the Trial of Position, their final test to attain warrior rank, only <em>two</em> are left, and only one of those succeeds in the Trial.

It mounts the maximum possible amount of armour, but what really makes the <em>Great Turtle</em> this trope is the type of armour it mounts; Hardened Armour, which reduces all damage taken by half. On top of that is the fact that its cockpit is torso-mounted, meaning it can keep fighting even if its head gets blown off.

It basically hyperspace-jumps a radio wave to its destination up to 50 light-years away, bypassing the need for null-gravity jump points that jump ships need since radio waves have no mass. During the Succession Wars, they were deemed so crucial that they became the purview of an (ostensiblly) neutral faction called ComStar, who established a universal currency using HPG transmission time as the backing commodity (The C-Bill). A second, less-known form is the "Black Box" radios, which were backburner experiments during the Star League's time (and predate the HPG, but the latter proved more practical), but made practical by secret scientific endeavors by the Federated Suns and used to subvert an interdiction against them by ComStar during the Fourth Succession War.

The joke's on you, heretics.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualWeaponMounting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualWeaponMounting">Unusual Weapon Mounting</a>: Players are encouraged to throw weapons anywhere they want to.<ul><li> Leg mounted weapons</li><li> Cockpit mounted weapons - or in the case of the <em>Atlas</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams">Eye Beams</a>.</li><li> The <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.sarna.net/wiki/images/thumb/4/4a/3050U_Orion.jpg/647px-3050U_Orion.jpg">Orion<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small></em> and <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.sarna.net/wiki/images/a/a8/Perseus.gif">Perseus<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small></em> have a rocket launcher for a shoulder.</li><li> The original Battlemech, the <em>Mackie</em>, has a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.sarna.net/wiki/images/a/a9/Mackie.jpg">cannon mounted on the crotch<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>, which shoots lasers.</li><li> Rear-mounted weapons. Not a favorite of most players (many of whom will, if given a "canon" design that sports these, happily flip them around into the forward arc first chance they get), but at least in principle <em>any</em> weapon that can be mounted in a torso or leg can be installed in the same location to fire at targets <em>behind</em> the 'Mech instead.</li><li> Some 'Mechs move the cockpit from the head into the (comparably) better-protected torso, and then stuff the head with weaponry. One experimental <em>Quickdraw</em> turns this head-gun into a PPC turret.</li><li> Speaking of which: yes, 'Mechs can carry turrets, although not every design whose artwork suggests it should actually does so by the rules. In addition to turning a 'Mech's head into a full turret as described above, shoulder-mounted turrets and special tank-style "quad" turrets for four-legged 'Mechs also exist.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedFalseFaith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedFalseFaith">Unwanted False Faith</a>: Jerome Blake was just a bureaucrat who wanted to keep humanity's technology from being destroyed or misused; he most certainly did not want his subordinates to attempt to drive humanity into a Dark Age so they could remake the Inner Sphere in his "vision". Aleksandr Kerensky, while a career soldier, sought to lead his followers away from the eternal conflicts of the Inner Sphere and would most likely have disapproved of the warrior based Clans that came to see him as a Moses like figure. However both men were dead before their words were twisted, by Blake's successor Conrad Toyama and Kerensky's son Nicolas no less, so they couldn't exactly do much to prevent it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanWarfare">Urban Warfare</a>: Still a nightmare in 31st century.

The Inner Sphere typically throws multiple <em>regiments</em> of 3+ battalions each at a Cluster.<ul><li> Early in the invasion, the tech gap meant that most Inner Sphere forces considered that they'd require a 2-to-1 advantage over Clan forces to simply reach <em>parity</em>, and both sides would end up mauled into worthlessness during the actual battle. For any chance of a decisive victory, Inner Sphere forces needed to vastly outnumber the Clanners.<ul><li> This was a deliberate choice, a company of 12 3025-tech Inner Sphere mechs was supposed to be a match for a star of 5 Clan Mechs,</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Sourcebook</a>: <em>The Wars of Reaving,</em> full stop.
