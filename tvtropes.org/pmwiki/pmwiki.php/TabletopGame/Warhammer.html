(although the setting certainly isn&#146;t lacking in this.)</p><p><em>Warhammer</em> was the generic name of a number of tabletop battle and roleplaying games marketed by UK firm <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GamesWorkshop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GamesWorkshop">Games Workshop</a>. "Warhammer" was a tabletop battle game that began in 1983 and was previously known as <em>Warhammer Fantasy Battle</em> (WHFB), its last official edition (8th edition) was published in 2010. It was officially discontinued and replaced with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerAgeOfSigmar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerAgeOfSigmar">Warhammer: Age of Sigmar</a></em> game universe by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GamesWorkshop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GamesWorkshop">Games Workshop</a> in July 2015, and all official GW support for Warhammer Fantasy Battle was discontinued... until 2019, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2019/11/15/old-world-new-warhammer/">when it was announced that the Old World would return with new rules akin to the Horus Heresy spinoff for 40K<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</p><p>The Warhammer verse was closely based on our own, with continents laid out in a similar pattern, and the action was mostly located within "The Old World", roughly analogous to 16th century Europe. Other locations of note are Ulthuan, the island home of the High Elves, and "The New World", which has two continents, Naggaroth in the North, home to the Dark Elves, and southern Lustria, home to the Lizardmen. At the very North and South poles of the world were the Chaos Wastes, a nightmare realm from which the greatest evils of the world originated. In addition, the map of the Warhammer world included several locations not covered by the game, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IstanbulNotConstantinople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IstanbulNotConstantinople">such original names</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Nippon and Cathay</a> (Cathay is even protected by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatWall">"Great Bastion"</a>).</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Standard fantasy elements were also present &mdash; Elves used to dominate but are a shadow of their former selves; Dwarfs occupy the few mountain strongholds that have not yet fallen to Skaven, Orcs and Goblins. Chaos is present, both in the form of great warbands of mutated and corrupted warriors and as cult activity in the heart of society.</p><p>The uninitiated might think that Warhammer wasn't all that bad and was a heroic fantasy land <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWorldHalfFull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWorldHalfFull">on its way to getting better</a> &mdash; that's right. There were just a few small problems like delusional (or worse) madmen empowered by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Dark Gods</a> to increasingly frequently lead crusades reducing the world further into hellish misery and incorporate it into the REAL hell. Then there were the rampaging hordes of Green skins, both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent">Orcs</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGoblinsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGoblinsAreDifferent">goblins</a>, scarily psychopathic aliens infesting everywhere existing only to joyously, brutally and (with known exceptions) mercilessly fight, destroy, enslave, kill and in the case of goblins malevolently torture every innocent creature they could find &mdash; and the Greenskins were the comic relief in this setting. If you thought things would get better after that, that's just two of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality">usually gray forces</a> inhabiting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">the world,</a> which only survived as long as it did because of the eternal sacrifice of some Elven mages imprisoned in their own spell, maintaining it forever to keep the forces of Chaos from overwhelming the world like they almost did in ancient times and nigh-inevitably did anyway.

If you were to combine equal parts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelMoorcock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelMoorcock">Michael Moorcock</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheElricSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheElricSaga">Elric</a> stories, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrail">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a></em> or Terry Pratchett's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a> books, you would have found something similar to Warhammer.</p><p>There is also a science fiction tabletop miniatures wargame set in a universe having much in common with <em>WHFB</em>: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>, generally known simply as "40K". Think of it as <em>Warhammer</em> <span class="font-s"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace">IN SPACE</a></span>, though it has grown over the years into a distinct and very different game, and has become much more popular than <em>Warhammer</em>, at least in the United States. One fan theory holds that the Old World is actually a planet in the WH40K galaxy, but cut off by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace">warp storms</a> or otherwise isolated. Some official GW merchandise has supported this theory, though it remains non-canon.</p><p><em>Warhammer</em> was a tabletop wargame where two or more players compete against each other with "armies" of 20 mm to 50 mm heroic scale miniatures. The rules of the game were published in a series of rulebooks up to their 8th edition, which describe how to move miniatures around the game surface and simulate combat in a balanced and fair manner. Games may be played on any appropriate surface, although the standard is a 6 ft. by 4 ft. tabletop decorated with model scenery in scale with the miniatures. Any individual or group of miniatures in the game is called a "unit", whether represented by a single model or group of similar troops.</p><p>The core game rules were supplied in a single book, with supplemental Warhammer Army Books giving guidelines and background for army-specific rules. Movement about the playing surface was generally measured in inches and combat between troops or units given a random element with the use of 6-sided dice. Army supplements also assigned points values to each unit and option in the game, giving players the ability to play on even terms. An average game would have armies of 750 to 3,000 points, although smaller and larger values were quite possible. There were also different rules for games called a skirmish that consist of 500 point armies.</p><p>Gameplay followed a turn structure in which one player completed all movement for troops, then simulated casting spells (when spell-using units are available) and used all ranged or missile weapons in the army such as bows and handguns, followed by any units in contact fighting in melee or close-combat. After finishing, the second player does the same. This is repeated for a number of equal turns, generally six, although occasionally to a time limit or until no units are left on the playing surface. The winner was often determined by victory points; earning a number equal to the value of enemy units killed. Special factors, or "objectives" could add or subtract from this total based on predefined goals, usually holding parts of the battlefield or killing powerful units (such as the enemy general).</p><p>Dice rolls generally used traditional six-sided dice (d6), with a high result being desirable (in most cases). For example, an archer unit was given a statistic that allows it to hit on the roll of a four or more. Various factors can change this number, reducing or raising the number needed. Mitigation of random results is a large part of the game, as well as traditional battlefield tactics. In some cases, other types of dice were needed; this could be a d3 (simulated with a normal die, 1 and 2 counting as a result of 1 and so on), or it can be a 6-sided "scatter" die used to generate random directions, often used alongside an "artillery" die (also 6-sided), used mainly for cannons, stone-throwers, and unusual variant artillery.</p><p>The wargame also spawned a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopGames">role-playing game</a> tie-in, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasyRoleplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasyRoleplay">Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</a></em>, which is not unlike a grimdark version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>.

This campaign is a huge leap fluff-wise and game-wise. Long story short, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiChrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiChrist">Archaon</a> finally launched his invasion, but before that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Mannfred Von Carstein</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Arkhan the Black</a> set things in motion to stop him by resurrecting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Nagash</a>. Everything went to hell: Daemonic invasions all over the world, Skaven overran entire human kingdoms, Bretonnia suffered a civil war... in gameplay, (book one) a new faction arose with unique Magic lore, units and characters, other have returned (like Nagash, but not the only one) and many, MANY have died. Tropes relating to this period of the game's history should be placed on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerTheEndTimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerTheEndTimes">this page</a>. The eventual result was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">total destruction of the world</a> at the hands of Chaos, followed by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftReboot">Soft Reboot</a> in the form of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerAgeOfSigmar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerAgeOfSigmar">Warhammer: Age of Sigmar</a></em>.</p><hr><h2>Tropes for the Tropes God!:</h2><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A-B&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbnormalAmmo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbnormalAmmo">Abnormal Ammo</a>: The Doom Diver catapult <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatapultToGlory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatapultToGlory">fires a goblin in a hang glider</a>, Warplock guns fire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks">Green Rocks</a>, Screaming Skull Catapults fire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatItSaysOnTheTin">flaming, screaming skulls</a>, Thundertusks fire giant iceballs.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySharpBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySharpBlade">Absurdly Sharp Blade</a>: Many races have their own brand of blade weapon(s) that, in the game's terms, ignore the target's armor saves. The most famous being the twelve Runefangs from The Empire.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ACommanderIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ACommanderIsYou">A Commander Is You</a>:<ul><li> Empire: <em>Balanced/Generalist</em>. The Empire can field any combination of units to suit any playstyle. Whether you want magic, infantry, cavalry, artillery, powerful heroes, it doesn't matter as the Empire will have something for you. This versatility however does mean that the Empire isn't particularly strong in any one aspect. For example, Dwarfs will always outgun you, Skaven will always outnumber you, and High Elves will always out-magic you.</li><li> Bretonnia: <em>Brute/Spammer/Unit Specialist (Cavalry)</em>. Bretonnian armies are usually built around a small core of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a> elite cavalry with high mobility, tough armour and a ward save to boot, with support from hordes of very weak peasant infantry meant to soften up enemy forces with their bows before the knights go in for the killing blow. Trebuchets represent their only artillery piece, but they hit hard &mdash; use them wisely.</li><li> Dwarfs: <em>Elitist/Loyal/Unit Specialist (Artillery)</em>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a> faction. Dwarfs have solid line infantry with high toughness, armour and good leadership, making them tough to shift. Their artillery is just as superb, able to really reach out and touch the enemy from behind a sturdy dwarf battle line. However they're very slow and they have no cavalry or traditional magic to speak of (they do have magic items though).</li><li> Chaos Dwarfs: <em>Elitist/Loyal/Brute</em>: Acting almost like an ace-custom version of the Dwarfs, Chaos Dwarfs have most of the Dwarfs strengths (same toughness and morale, with even better armour and some crazy artillery) and also add in a few nasty tricks of their own (a decent, cheap tarpit in the form of Hobgoblins, some actual cavalry in the form of Bull Centaurs, and even the ability to use magic). However, Hobgoblins aside, Chaos Dwarf units are <strong>very</strong> expensive on a per-model basis and, as a result, building a balanced list can be difficult. A common way to describe a Chaos Dwarf army is, "You can make it good at anything, but you can't make it good at everything."</li><li> High Elves: <em>Elitist/Technical/Unit Specialist (Magic)</em>. High Elf armies are small and their units are expensive and don't have much armour or staying power, but they're the best army when it comes to the magic phase, and their elite infantry do well in their chosen role.</li><li> Dark Elves: <em>Guerilla/Brute</em>. Dark Elf units are cheaper than High Elf equivalents and just as fragile, but they move and strike like lightning with their high initiative and movement. They have a few hefty linebreaker-type units like the Hydra, but you won't be fielding many of those. Basically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Hammer</a> army; you'll wallop other armies but be careful not to break yourself against them, and don't get shot.</li><li> Wood Elves: <em>Guerilla/Ranger/Gimmick</em>. Guerilla warfare is the name of the game for the Wood Elves. Highly mobile, superb long-range shooting and especially adept at fighting in woodland. Be aware that the Wood Elves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">need a lot of tactical thought and skill to be effective</a>; they can't rely on heavy armour or big scary killing machines like the other armies can and getting bogged down will put them on the losing side quickly.</li><li> Lizardmen: <em>Brute/Spammer/Unit Specialist (Monstrous Creature)</em>. You pick Lizardmen because you like dinosaurs of all shapes and sizes, from tiny skinks to hulking T-Rex and Stegosaurus beasts. Temple Guard are hideous beatsticks and can bull aside any other infantry apart from the elite Warriors of Chaos. They also have pretty decent magic, all the better for making sure those heavy-hitters hit even heavier. Their main weaknesses are their issues with coordinating fast and slow units, somewhat expensive units, and vulnerability to artillery.</li><li> Vampire Counts: <em>Spammer/Technical/Gimmick</em>. These undead have no options for shooting except for magical attacks, lucky then that their magic is exceptional. Their heroes are very good in combat, and few other armies can field fodder in such numbers; they may die in droves but you're the undead, there's always more where that came from. Between that and also being immune to morale loss, the Vampires will win the battle of attrition every time.</li><li> Tomb Kings: <em>Spammer/Technical</em>, even moreso than the Vampires. Reliant on light infantry blocks with skirmishing units backed up by magic, but armour is a very rare thing in the Tomb Kings army. Their infantry are fragile but they don't rout, so make sure the enemy does first. Something of a Pariah faction as their limited power means they need a lot of good planning to be effective.</li><li> Warriors of Chaos: <em>Elitist/Brute/Unit Specialist (Melee Infantry)</em>. Welcome to the most melee-centric army in the whole game. All their units are very durable, hit like trucks and have high weapon skill. Your basic troops can often beat up the elite infantry of other armies. On the other hand they have zero ranged options and zero tactical subtlety &mdash; it's just a roving wall of spiky black metal death that advances on the enemy. Don't count on fielding many units either; those badass troops are pricey.</li><li> Chaos Daemons: <em>Elitist/Brute/Gimmick</em>. Chaos Daemons are poorly armoured and have no shooting, but with their vast tactical options, superb stats, and plethora of special rules granting fear coming out their ears and deep striking, you won't mind. The Reign of Chaos table means they can be buffed into nightmarish levels of power or crippled with a roll of the dice. They were a notorious <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> in 7th Edition.</li><li> Beastmen: <em>Spammer/Guerilla</em>. Beastman infantry can move like cavalry and are quite difficult to kill, but their very low leadership means all of their units are likely to bolt if your general isn't nearby. Thankfully many of their leader choices are good. Pariah in 8th Edition.</li><li> Greenskins: <em>Balanced/Brute/Gimmick</em>. Greenskins field a selection of very powerful- um, "right killy" infantry specialised in their close combat role, and quite cheap too. Orcs are stronger, but goblins bring sheer numbers. They do suffer from terrible leadership and initiative though, and from the Animosity special rule that causes them to fight amongst themselves. Like Beastmen, you'll want to keep a big leader near infantry to stop them panicking or fighting each other.</li><li> Skaven: <em>Spammer/Gimmick</em>. Like dirt-cheap infantry, fairly powerful shooting and silliness? Skaven are for you. Your troops will drop like flies and run the moment things start going badly, but that doesn't matter because you'll be swamping enemies with numbers which the Vampires would find excessive. Their artillery and warmachines are very dangerous, but be careful they don't blow themselves up (or accept they will and be prepared to laugh at them &mdash; Skaven life is cheap).</li><li> Ogre Kingdoms: <em><strong>Elitist/Brute</strong></em>, in a way you wouldn't believe. It's like having a small army of humanoid tanks. All of them have multiple wounds, high toughness, obscene strength, Impact Hits and Stomp. Ogres can laugh off small-arms fire and smash through enemy units like wrecking balls. Just know that magic and artillery will give them a rough time, they can easily be swarmed, and each ogre that does go down is a serious points-cost loss.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionInitiative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionInitiative">Action Initiative</a>: Models with the always strikes first rule always well, strike first, regardless of whether their initiative is higher than their opponent. If their initiative is higher, then they can re-roll failed to hit rolls.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureFriendlyWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureFriendlyWorld">Adventure-Friendly World</a>: One of the big reasons the <em>Warhammer</em> world is so insane is that every faction needs to be able, in canon, to fight every faction, including itself.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a>:<ul><li> Vlad von Carstein. He was less cruel towards his peasants than the former Count of Sylvania, von Drakhoff, who would have peasants's heads put on stakes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">for lulz</a>. Vlad even went one-on-one with a bandit king terrorizing the province. Plus, honestly, trying to take over the empire is actually a pretty common pastime for Elector Counts so that's hardly a point against him.<ul><li> Also, considering that he kicked out the Priests of Morr, who are required to pass on in that part of the world, he's allowing of his subjects to stick around after being killed, instead of risking being consumed by the gods of Chaos.</li><li> In the short story <em>The Ninth Book</em>, it is inferred that Vlad actually wants <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">to enslave the Empire, to prevent them turning to Chaos.</a> If they served him, they would be unable to serve Chaos in life or death.</li></ul></li><li> The setting paints many vampires as being like this. Apparently turning into a vampire heightens and inflames natural passions, adding a dark, predatory edge to a person, but leaves their personality mostly unchanged. The problem is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">the natural passions of humanity in this world kind of tend towards the crazy anyway,</a> so a warrior with a violent edge becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">bloodthirsty</a> or a flirtatious person becomes <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy">a seductive assassin</a> and so on, leading to conflict with each other and everyone else.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTrollsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTrollsAreDifferent">All Trolls Are Different</a>: The <em>Warhammer</em> version are pretty classic fantasy trolls &mdash; big, hulking, stupid humanoids &mdash; only adding on a ridiculously caustic stomach acid, capable of digesting rock, that they like to vomit on their foes/victims. Even then, there are several distinct kinds of trolls in the <em>Warhammer</em> universe, besides the "common" trolls commonly found tagging along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent">Greenskin</a> armies:<ul><li> Rock trolls inhabit desolate, rocky wastelands, and have taken to eating rocks for lack of anything else. They are noted to be more resistant to magic than the regular kind of troll.</li><li> River trolls have scales and live by and in bodies of water. They are revoltingly smelly and filthy even by troll standards.</li><li> Sea trolls, or <em>shugon</em>, are pale creatures with white, blind eyes, scaly skin and mouths filled with shark teeth, and live in sea caves and the depths of the ocean.</li><li> Chaos trolls are even weirder due to living so close to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie">Realm of Chaos</a>. Their regenerating powers cause them to mutate even more than other races. What makes this even worse is the existence of Throgg, the Troll King. After having his head cut off, it grew back, only this time with a mutation giving him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser">genius intellect</a>. Suffice to say, he was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItCanThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItCanThink">nasty surprise</a> to the Empire, who were used to Trolls being complete morons.</li><li> Bile trolls are a further mutation descended from trolls who had the supremely bad idea of devouring the followers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlagueMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlagueMaster">Nurgle</a>. The plagued flesh infected them with all manner of necrotic diseases, turning them into eternally rotting horrors whose perpetual decay is just barely offset by their regeneration.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees">Aluminum Christmas Trees</a>: Helblaster Volley Gun looks like a product of pure imagination, but it is based on an obscure <a class="urllink" href="http://www.feuerwaffen.ch/index_htm_files/Draw_18_Organ.pdf">Swiss organ gun<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> designed in early 17th century by Bendicht Halbysen.

They live in the depths of its thick rainforests and are viewed as noble if fickle beings by the people of Ind, who give them offerings of meat and rice and refuse to attack them even when attacked first.

The Lords of Decay sent Skaven to support Sultan Jaffar, spying on his enemies and assassinating them in exchange for the warpstone deposits across his land that's toxic to humans, but the backbone of Skaven society along with backstabbing and self-interest. They eventually convince him, by lying, that Estalia is planning to invade Araby and that he should strike first, which he does. Two-hundred years of warfare follow in which Bretonnia and the Empire get involved sending thousands of Knights to fight the Arabyans. The Skaven disappear once the tide turns against Jaffar, tens of thousands of humans are dead without one Skaven casualty, and they got all the warpstone and nobody ever found out they were involved.

To give you an idea on the level of poverty; on a good day a whole Bretonnian village could trade their entire collected wealth for half of the smallest unit of currency in the Empire. Fluff would later justify this by noting that, while Bretonnian peasants are in perpetual poverty, they're that way because the landed nobility that owns them is filthy rich. Bretonnian nobles pay for the upkeep of temporary conscript levies from the peasantry and (by way of the feudal system) fund the nation's famed knights. Bretonnia also benefits from an alliance with the elves of Athel Loren and the patronage of the Goddess of Chivalry.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Conscription" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Conscription">Conscription</a>:<ul><li> All Bretonnian infantry, with the notable exception of Grail Pilgrims, is conscripted <em>en masse</em> from the peasant population.</li><li> Skaven Clanrats are conscripts.

It's easy to believe that Sigmar, founder of the Empire, is one of the two missing Primarchs. In fact, in the earliest editions, it was all but stated that the Warhammer world is part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a> universe &mdash; or at least that the Chaos Wastes connected to the Warp. Characters of all species could run around with, among other things, bolters (machine gun rocket launchers) and lascannons, while Chaos Space Marines were an actual troop/leadership choice for mortal Chaos armies.<ul><li> The Albion <em>Dark Shadows</em> campaign included a number of magical weapons. They are identical or almost identical in function or description, and most have the exact same stats or effects as their 40k counterparts:<ul><li> Blade of Shining Death = Power Weapon.</li><li> Claw of Devastation = Lightning Claw.</li><li> Gauntlet of Power = Power Fist.</li><li> Armor of the Gods = Power Armour.</li><li> Divine Eye = Auspex.</li><li> Fusil of Conflagration = Flamer.</li><li> Mystic Shield of Light = Rosarius.</li><li> Hexstaff = Psy-staff.</li></ul></li><li> The Liber Chaotica (pub 2003) had, as example of Daemon weapons, a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainsawGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainsawGood">chainsword</a></em>.</li><li> The 7th Edition High Elves army book makes reference to the fact that occasionally their armies are put under the control of a less capable general, due to politics, but then comments that the Phoenix King keeps this from happening.

While this was nominally to choose the most capable among them to lead, this is not always the case. Since theChurch of Sigmar (which holds a total of three votes) always votes for the Reikland elector, Reikland automatically has four votes (sometimes five, since the Moot always votes for the son of the previous Emperor). Meanwhile, the Ar-Ulric (head of the cult of Ulric) always votes for the Middenland one, so the Middenland elector automatically has two; unsurprisingly, the two cults don't usually get along. Bribery and politicking are far from uncommon during an election, and the occasional military enticement isn't unheard of either.</li><li> The High Elves elect their Phoenix Kings in a similar fashion, although unlike the Empire they have a series of rules, both spoken and unspoken, regarding the process, and enough hindsight to understand certain lines they never cross (killing ones' rivals being the biggest one). There is also a hereditary Everqueen, who is required by law to marry the Phoenix King (though once that's done and the next Everqueen has been begotten, they can and will take other consorts).</li><li> Bretonnia has a system comparable to the Empire, where the Dukes elect the King (also called the Royarch) from among themselves, but there is a prerequisite that the King <em>must</em> be a Grail Knight. In the event that the previous King's son is already a Grail Knight, though, he will almost certainly be chosen. Granted, the final word is with the Fay Enchantress (the head of the Bretonnian religion), and she is fully within her right to refuse the nominee, in which case another election has to be held.</li><li> The Dwarfs are this combined with a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">Asskicking Equals Authority</a>.

Though the races draw from many, many different real world cultures and it's hard to summarize them with pin-point accuracy and keep this page from doubling in length. So the following is the short version.<ul><li> The Empire is based on the Holy Roman Empire, with their reliance on pike-and-shot tercio armies, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectiveMonarchy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectiveMonarchy">Elector Counts voting for their Emperor</a>, and the church being a dominant political force, but divided &mdash; in the Empire, religious wars between the followers of Sigmar and Ulric are common. Sigmar himself was basically a mixture of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Charlemagne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlfredTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlfredTheGreat">Alfred the Great</a> as a living man, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Jesus</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Thor</a> as a god.</li><li> Bretonnia is a combination of Age of Enlightenment ideas about Medieval England and Europe, with Arthurian myths in there to a very large extent, the whole thing set in France. Like France, it's also known for fine wine and cuisine and naming conventions that always make sure to use five vowels even if one will do. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">In early editions</a>, Bretonnia was France just before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a>, known for good duelling pistols, decadent aristocracy, and all-round rot. Most recently it seems to be Norman-occupied England, the French sensibilities mostly confined to the aristocracy.</li><li> Many of the lesser human nations. Tilea is a peninsula to the south known for its splendid leaning towers, cut-throat politics and armies composed entirely of mercenaries (Renaissance Italy). Albion is an untamed island <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishWeather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishWeather">constantly soaked by rain and mist</a>, dotted with magical waystones and populated by few people except for naked warriors and mysterious druids (pre-Roman Britain). Marienburg is an independent city-state sandwiched between Bretonnia and the Empire, surrounded by marshlands and possessing a strong maritime and mercantile tradition (the Netherlands). Estalia is politically fractured, with rival kingdoms vying for power and influence, renowned for skilled duellists and for a time occupied by the Arabians (Medieval Iberia). The Border Princes are region of vast wilderness home to a multitude of petty human kingdoms established by highly ambitious adventurers, infamous as a home for bandits and ne'er-do-wells (the Balkans). Far to the east lies Cathay, a land ruled by a dragon emperor and guarded by armies of clockwork terracotta warriors, and Nippon, a xenophobic feudal island kingdom with a complex caste system. To the south lies Araby, a desert land with djinn and flying carpets.</li><li> The Lizardmen culture is a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mayincatec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mayincatec">Mayincatec</a>, complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts">Ancient Astronauts</a>. Culturally closer to the Mayans, their jewellery is more Aztec inspired and their pantheon is based on the Aztec one.</li><li> The Ogre Kingdoms are Silk Road peoples, mainly those who guarded the Road as it passed through the mountains of Central Asia, with some Mongol influences and a dash of Byzantine flavor in the way the Ogres simply sit on the main trade routes and grow rich. Later editions have also added a prehistoric look and feel.</li><li> The Hobgoblins, ruled over by their Great Khan, are wolf-riding Mongols.</li><li> The Orcs and Goblins are British <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FootballHooligans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FootballHooligans">Football Hooligans</a> crossed with iron age Scottish Highlanders. But mostly Football Hooligans. The Savage Orcs of the Southlands are based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAfrica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAfrica">Stone Age Africa</a>.</li><li> Nehekhara is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt">Ancient Egypt</a>, with its concept of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mummy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mummy">mummies</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NephariousPharaoh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NephariousPharaoh">Nepharious Pharaohs</a> taken to their logical conclusion.</li><li> Sylvania is medieval Hungary with a big helping of Bram Stoker's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula">Dracula</a>. The name is actually a play on Transylvania, hence it is the homeland of the Vampire Counts army.</li><li> According to Gavin Thorpe, the High Elves and Dark Elves correspond to the Athens/Sparta rivalry, respectively. Byzantine influences are also present in the High Elves, as is a Varangian Guard in the White Lions of Chrace further increasing the similarity. Imperial Japan is also present in them, to some extent. The High Elves have also founded the Old World's only overseas colonial empire. Geographically-speaking, Ulthuan is Warhammer Greenland. The Dark Elves, with their habitat in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimUpNorth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimUpNorth">Grim Up North</a>, reliance on crossbow- and polearm-armed infantry and Cold One riding cavalry, have a certain post-Viking Medieval Scandinavian flavour. Again, from a geographical standpoint Naggaroth encompasses most of Warhammer's answer to North America, including Canada.<ul><li> The High Elf/Dark Elf relationship can also be interpreted as an analogue between Britain and the United States. The former were formerly globe-spanning thalassocracies that in the present day have been reduced to the home islands plus a variety of small outposts, but are still formidable players in global politics. The latter split from the former in an act of rebellion, and now reside in the northwestern continent.</li></ul></li><li> Wood Elves are Tolkien's Mirkwood elves crossed with pre-Roman Celtic Tribes.</li><li> The relationship between Bretonnia and the Wood Elves can be seen as analogous to Norman England and Wales in the Middle Ages. The former are nations of barbarian warriors with a Frankish influence who settled the Old World in the wake of a period of strife and turmoil. The latter have a Celtic influence, and are remnants of an older people who were pushed into a forested region during said time of conflict, partially to avoid the arrival of the former. The latter both wear green prominently, are proficient at the longbow, and emphasize guerrilla tactics. The latter have also influenced the military doctrine of the former (the Bretonnians derive their magical power from the Wood Elves while the Norman English ended up adopting the longbow from the Welsh). The relationship in both cases is a mix between peace and conflict.</li><li> The Dwarfs very obviously take after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings">Horny Vikings</a> aesthetically, complete with actual horned helmets. Their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishAccents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishAccents">Yorkshire accents</a> hearken to British stereotypes about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OopNorth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OopNorth">hard working, laborious Northerners.</a> Their role in the backstory makes them out to be similar to the Roman Empire: the Karaz Ankor was the greatest empire in the Old World during it's heyday and the Dwarf language, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConLang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConLang">Khazalid,</a> is implied to be the Warhammer world's equivalent of Latin, since it shares so many words in common with English, and the language of the Empire is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention">rendered as English.</a> They have some similarities to imperial China: they have a preference for crossbow and are credited with inventing gunpowder. A lot of Dwarf machines and weapons featuring dragon designs, especially the Flame Cannon, have a bit of a Chinese aesthetic. The fact that the High Elves have some parallels to Sengoku Japan helps. Lastly, just like Tolkein's Dwarves, it's hard not to see some parallels to the ancient Hebrews, especially since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalEarth">the Dwarf heartland is about where Israel should be.</a></li><li> Kislev is a combination of Muscovy, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and Ukraine, as well as medieval Russia in general. Its name, as well as that of its principle city, is derived from the Jewish calendar, however.</li><li> The Chaos Dwarfs are evil and daemonic Babylonians and Assyrians who live in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mordor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mordor">Mordor</a> who trade with equally evil and daemonic Vikings and Slavic barbarians. Their religion, centered around fire and lava with a priesthood of magic-users, recalls a twisted version of Zoroastrianism.<ul><li> Their Hobgoblin servants are mounted archers and steppe nomads that serve as Warhammer's equivalent of Mongolians, complete with Khans.</li></ul></li><li> The Warriors of Chaos are a fun one:<ul><li> Norsca is daemonic Mythic Scandinavia with vicious, daemonic Viking warriors in spiky, skull-studded Conan gear and imposing heavy plate armour wielding arms and armour not intended for lesser breeds of men and who worship and are fanatically devoted to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Gods of Chaos</a>.</li><li> The Kurgans of the Eastern Steppes are evil Mongolic and Turkic barbarians.</li><li> The Hung are the same thing as the above, but are evil <em>Hunnic</em> warriors.</li></ul></li><li> The Beastmen are based on the barbarian tribes who toppled Rome.</li><li> The Skaven share more than a few similarities with Nazi Germany, between their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist">Social Darwinism</a>, cruel experiments performed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilutionaryBiologist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilutionaryBiologist">Evilutionary Biologists</a>, and use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGas">Deadly Gas</a>, "Stormvermin", and other crazy advanced technology.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a>: If they are lucky, Elven souls are typically enslaved by the goddess Ereth Khial, the Pale Queen, and sentenced to eternal torment in Mirai, the black pit, upon death. Many Elven souls, however, are devoured by by the Chaos god of depravity after suffering soul-shredding torments. The High Elves attempt to avoid this fate by binding their souls to the Waystones that protect their homelands, while the Wood Elves allow their spirits to be claimed by the forest. The Dark Elves by contrast consider "preparing to die" as "planning to fail", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalitySeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalitySeeker">their only hope is to never die</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaunsAndSatyrs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaunsAndSatyrs">Fauns and Satyrs</a>: Beastmen, though the emphasis is much more on the beast than the man, are this in appearance.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FearlessUndead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FearlessUndead">Fearless Undead</a>: On the tabletop, otherwise the whole army would flee at the sight of itself.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FertileFeet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FertileFeet">Fertile Feet</a>: A rare evil example; the one character with this trait is a Champion of Tzeentch named Aekold Hellbrass.

He is also a <em>ridiculously</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a>, requiring healing potions just to stay alive, and having a limp uncurable by magic. By contrast, his brother Tyrion is an unpeered swordmaster.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalEarth">Fictional Earth</a>: <a class="urllink" href="http://whfb.lexicanum.com/wiki/File:WarhammerWorld.jpg">The world map is clearly based on Earth's<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>, though it has a few extra islands and geographical features Earth does not, such as North America being either frozen tundra or burning desert, Africa being split in two by a mountain range, and Antarctica being a warm wasteland populated by beastmen.

The Lizardmen will eat sentient bipeds, lobotomize them and use them as slaves, and their opinion on almost every sentient race is that of a pest exterminator finding cockroaches in their own house.

Also, there's a Chaos character called Valkia (no surprises as to which creature from viking mythology she's based on) who wields a magical spear named "Slaupnir".

While at first he deeply resented this curse and tried to rid himself of it, in time he recognized it for the blessing it was, for the series of betrayals and wild goose chases he went through in his efforts to remove the curse got him more power and fame than he could ever have dreamed of as a mere clan warrior (chief among them a flying teleporting longship that lets him track prey wherever it hides).

The majority of the dragon species is in perpetual hibernation deep beneath the mountains of Caledor, in the high elven homeland, waking only briefly when certain magical songs are sung, and even the dragons who live among other factions or on their own in the rest of the world spend most of their time asleep in their lairs.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LickingTheBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LickingTheBlade">Licking the Blade</a>: A number of the more unhinged characters, particularly vampires and followers of the Blood God Khorne, are described as liking blood from their blades in the background material and novels.

As a unit, their special rule <em>Another Takes its Place</em> allows them to randomly regenerate from damage at the start of each turn, representing a new head suddenly growing from a bloody stump.</li><li> The seas are inhabited by monsters called Kharibdyss which, while not related to hydras, have the exact same body build, except they have jawless lamprey-like heads as opposed to snake-like ones. Dark Elven beastmasters adore these beasts and often goad them into battle against their foes, and they are notoriously good at killing other monsters.</li><li> Also worth mentioning are the monstrosities called Chimaerats, which are Dark Elven war hydras with <em>Rat Ogre heads</em> created by Clan Moulder.

However, these lores are generally too much for most races to handle. The Empire therefore fields Battle Wizards who break the Winds of Magic down into their composite lores &mdash; the Lores of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeastmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeastmaster">Beasts</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil">Death</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">Fire</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarPower">Heavens</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenThumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenThumb">Life</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightEmUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightEmUp">Light</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtraOreDinary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtraOreDinary">Metal</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingAShadow">Shadows</a> &mdash; and specialise in the use of one. They were taught how to do this by some charitable-feeling High Elves. Bretonnian mages &mdash; Damsels and Prophetesses of the Cult of the Lady &mdash; follow suit with a much more limited pool. The lores used by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer">Necromancer</a> types &mdash; the Lores of Vampires and Undeath &mdash; are culled from the Lore of Dark Magic, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PredecessorVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PredecessorVillain">Nagash</a> having tortured the knowledge out of some Dark Elves he came across and wrote several books on the subject which are still in high demand today despite being illegal. The Tomb Kings use their own necromantic arts &mdash; the Lore of Nehekhara &mdash; to maintain their armies on the battlefield. The Orcs &amp; Goblins and Ogre Kingdoms also use their own lores based on their religious beliefs &mdash; the Lore of da Big/Little WAAAGH! and the Lore of the Great Maw, respectively.

It belongs to Archaon, who stole it from the Father of Dragon Ogres. It is already a horriby powerful magic blade, but unleashing the power of U'Zuhl will make it even more so.

They also have exactly 169 Grey Seers (that's 13 x 13) and exactly 13 spells (guess which one is the strongest and most terrifying?). Even their bells chime 13 times. In the last edition of the Skaven army book, they only got Irresistible Force on a casting roll of a 13, rather than the usual 2 or more 6's.

Grom the Paunch doesn't usually walk for practical reasons but rides in a chariot. On one occasion he was borne on a palanquin by goblins. According to the story, more than one of them <em>died</em> from the experience. And mimicking (or possibly as a mockery of) the Dwarf habit, some Skaven warlords have shield bearers carrying them into battle.

Why send a loyal peasant to his death when you can send a dead enemy back to kill his living friends? But the Vampires <em>do</em> tend to treat <em>themselves</em> as expendable. Mostly because even if you do manage to kill them in a way that would kill a vampire <em>and</em> they've already lost their additional magic ring that would resurrect them even then, they <em>still</em> have the capacity to come back from the dust that they were reduced to via absorbing the life-force that departs when a mortal is killed in battle.</li><li> The forces of Chaos, the Empire, and the Bretonnians also practice this as well, to varying extents.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenTreesAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenTreesAttack">When Trees Attack</a>: The Living Deadwood Staff, a creation of an eccentric necromancer known as the Daemon Harborist of Tilea, allows its holder to crate undead, mobile trees.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> Frederick Van Hal was priest of Morr who turned to necromancy and resurrected a large horde of zombies to defend his country Sylvania from the Skaven invasion.
