This is a nightmarish spirit-scape in which their minds are ripped into little bits, exposed directly to the agony and hate and rage of the Wyrm, force-fed divine revelations of its plans for destroying the world, and then more-or-less stapled back together. Not that insanity stops them from being cunning and extremely dangerous foes.</li><li> The Wyrm, according to many shapeshifters, broke and went insane when the Weaver caught him/it in her/its spirit-webs too tightly and <em>crushed</em> it. All the horror and evil cooked up by the Wyrm is both an expression of its insanity and agony, the result of its frenzied writhing around trying to escape, and its attempt to blow up the world so it can escape and/or cease to exist.</li><li> The Delirium is basically this trope, applied to humans. Any normal (non-kinfolk) mortal who sees a shapeshifter in its war-form, or witnesses a were-spider disintegrating into lots of little spiders, gets unhinged. Usually they run away in a mindless panic or turn catatonic, and afterwards they either forget what they saw or hallucinate that they saw something else entirely.</li><li> For that matter, some of the stories suggest that the Weaver went mad first, after an existential crisis brought about by the realization that it could never make a timeless, beautiful structure due to the mutations of the Wyld and the destruction of the Wyrm.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">Good Is Not Nice</a>:<ul><li> The Garou Nation, in many respects, can be summed up thusly. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well Intentioned Extremists</a> is another good description.</li><li> The totem spirits that serve as patrons to the Garou tribes qualify.

For most shapeshifters that even <em>can</em> produce babies from such unions, the resulting Metis are just as deformed. The Glass Walkers are (in)famous for keeping all their metis &mdash; even those too deformed to fight &mdash; and adopting every metis they learn of.

A worryingly large number of ancient strains &mdash; both tribes within greater breeds and entire breeds of shapeshifters &mdash; have been wiped out over history. Some were destroyed by the servants of the Wyrm, but a lot more than one would expect died out in internecine wars among each other, and a lot of the more recent cases were explicitly wiped out by the Garou over cases of mistaken identity and/or the Garou in question being entitled jerks.<ul><li> Within the Garou themselves are:<ul><li> The White Howlers, a Tribe who settled in Scotland and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisMeansWarpaint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisMeansWarpaint">chose the Picts as Kinfolk</a>.

They sacrificed their entire Tribe to prevent the Eater-of-Souls from manifesting in the Americas after European colonization.</li><li> The Bunyip, a Tribe that found their way through the Umbra to Australia and had to use unique rituals to mate with the thylacine (a.k.a. Tasmanian tiger) without a native wolf population. When European Garou made it to Australia, they unintentionally killed their own kind in a war over control over Australia's Caerns after being fooled by one of the Black Spiral Dancers.</li></ul></li><li> Amongst the Changing Breeds (although some may not be as "missing" as they seem):<ul><li> The Apis, were-aurochs who served as Gaia's matchmakers. Wiped out by the Garou, except for one who went mad and became the basis of the myth of the Minotaur.</li><li> The Camazotz, were-bats who served as Gaia's nighttime messengers (complimenting the Corax were-ravens of the day). Wiped out by the Black Spiral Dancers in most of the world and the Shadow Lords during the Spanish colonization of the New World, in the latter case because of their resemblance to Tzimisce vampires. A remnant population turned out to have hung on in Australia, but the extinction of most of their kin pushed their totem, Bat, into the clutches of the Wyrm and thus cost them their ability to procreate.</li><li> The Grondr, were-boars who served as Gaia's cleaners and purifiers and were able to destroy Wyrm-taint by literally digesting it. Wiped out by the Garou when the latter became convinced that the Grondr had fallen to the Wyrm, although some remaining Kin sought out the Wyrm and were corrupted into the Skull Pigs.</li><li> The Khara, the original Tribe of the Bastet who were were-saber-toothed-cats. Went extinct with their animal-kin, but their genetics live on in other Bastet.</li><li> The Ceilican, a Tribe of Bastet who had links to the fae and generally resembled domestic cats. They were secretive, even amongst the Bastet, and were thought to be extinct many times throughout history. The Revised Edition had their last big gathering lead to most of them being slaughtered by the Black Spiral Dancers, with the survivors forced to walk the Black Labyrinth and become the Hellcats. The 20th anniversary edition has brought them back and retconned out their prior extinction.</li><li> The Okuma, a Tribe of Gurahl who counted the moon bears, sun bears, and giant panda as Kin. Wiped out by the other Changing Breeds in Asia due to machinations by East Asian Kue-jin vampires who the Okuma reviled compared to other Changing Breeds.</li><li> The Ratkin Bards, who kept the Breed's history and society. Wiped out by the Garou in earlier editions. W20 implies the Bards simply went insane as a result of failing to cope with the oncoming apocalypse and became the Freak Aspect Munchmausen.</li><li> The Ao, a Varna of Mokole who had turtle and tortoise Kin. They simply disappeared entirely. The Mokole theorize that they used their Mnesis to predict the oncoming apocalypse and traveled deep into the Umbra to hibernate and wait out the end of the world.</li><li> The Lizard Kings, the ancestors of the Mokole who were truly were-dinosaurs (and pterosaurs and plesiosaurs). Breeding between themselves created the Drachid form, a humanoid reptile form that enabled the Lizard Kings to interbreed and was even available to other contemporary Changing Breeds. They were wiped out entirely in a supernatural event called the Wonder-Work that coincided with the extinction of the dinosaurs, and to such an extent that nothing remains of their bodies or their civilization, and not even the Mokole's Mnesis can tell them what actually happened.</li><li> An unnamed ammonite Changing Breed that was at war with the Rokea and an unnamed "bristlecreeper" (primitive mammal) Changing Breed also went extinct during the Wonder-Work, or at least long before the evolution of humanity.</li><li> The Insect Races, Changing Breeds created by the Weaver that took bees, hornets, termites, ants, and locusts as Kin. They were wiped out by the Ananasi before humanity existed. An Insect Race of moths also existed, but apparently rebelled against the Weaver and were punished.</li><li> The Corax claim were-megatheriums were wiped out in the War of Rage. The Nagah believe there was a race of were-freshwater fish that was wiped out. The Shadow Lords claim a Changing Breed of were-falcons was wiped out and the Fianna claim they were responsible for the extinction of the were-otter and the were-eagle Changing Breeds.</li><li> The Beast Courts of Asia claim that there still is a hidden Changing Breed of were-orangutans in the rainforests of Indonesia.</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> was also that the Corax would joke about were-rhinos &mdash; until Pentex actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">artificially made some evil ones</a>.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixedAncestry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixedAncestry">Mixed Ancestry</a><ul><li> Members of the Siberakh tribe are descendants of Silver Fang Garou who bred with Wendigo kinfolk.</li><li> Get of Fenris who belong to the Ymir's Sweat camp are descendants of ancient Get who had children with Inuit partners.

However, it relies on concepts that have been outdated for years. Namely, the Uktena's patron planet is Vulcan, a theoretical body on opposite end of Mercury's orbit, to explain how it revolves so fast, but it's been proven to not actually exist. The book also states the once-popular theory that the Asteroid Belt is the remnants of a destroyed planet, which we also know is not the case (Pluto gets a pass, since the Planetary Incarnae don't necessarily have to represent full-size planets).

Turns out that his true motivation was that he enjoyed staring at beautiful young women and commenting on their bodies and clothing. The whole moral superiority thing was merely an excuse that he used to trick everyone (surely including himself) that his behavior was acceptable. To make it worse, indulging his hatred of beautiful young women and his self-inflicted sexual frustration opened him up to what can be called demonic possession. Having turned into a Fomor minion of the Wyrm, he ends up attacking a young beautiful female co-ed werewolf, making himself the first kill in her new career as a slayer of wyrm-tainted monsters.<ul><li> Bizarrely averted in the case of werewolf/wolf mating.
