Created in 2011 by Christopher Badell, Paul Bender, and Adam Rebottaro, under the moniker of Greater Than Games, <em>Sentinels</em> pits three to five heroes&mdash;each represented by a unique deck of cards&mdash;against one of several varied and interesting villains, each represented by their own unique deck. One of several environments (also represented by a deck of cards) plays cards throughout the fight, hindering or helping both sides of the battle and creating a dynamic flow to the game.</p><p>The variety of the villains and environments are not simply alternate skins; each villain and environment deck has its own unique mechanics, and the villains' character and rules cards are double-sided, representing multiple phases of the fight. Each of them has a unique "flipping" mechanic (a trigger that makes them flip to the opposite side of their card) and drastically different effects based off of which side they are on. They also have an optional, advanced rule on each side that further empowers them and complicates victory for the heroes.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The game also employs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a>: Visit the (currently in progress) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/SentinelsOfTheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/SentinelsOfTheMultiverse">Character sheet</a> for more information on the cast.</p><p>A <a class="urllink" href="http://sentinelsdigital.com/">digital version of the base card game<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was released in December 2014, with each expansion being released as DLC afterwards.</p><p>A tactical combat game <em>Sentinel Tactics: The Flame of Freedom</em> was funded through <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Kickstarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Kickstarter">Kickstarter</a></em> and released in 2014. <em>Sentinel Comics: The Roleplaying Game</em> was also funded through <em>Kickstarter</em> for 2020.</p><p></p><hr><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><h2>Tropes represented in <em>Sentinels</em>:</h2><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-D&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance">Achievements in Ignorance</a>: A meta example: Santa Guise's variant is incredibly easy to unlock by accident in the digital version, but the official community game surrounding the unlocks also requires as one of the rules figuring out what the specific unlock conditions are, and it took more than six months to accomplish that part.<ul><li> As a more story oriented example, due to the nature of his powers, Setback tends to do this, as implied by the flavor text.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyFourMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyFourMooks">Actually Four Mooks</a>: Some of the minion and environment cards represent groups &mdash; the Blade Battalion and Raptor Pack, for instance, show several members of the group on the card art. Many of them deal damage (or other affects) based on how many hit points they have left to represent how many of their numbers are left. Implied in the case of Grand Warlord Voss's minions &mdash; while there's only one shown on each card, the fact that only ten are needed to overrun the world indicates they represent larger groups of his army.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">Adaptation Expansion</a>: Or clarification. With the addition of nemesis dialog and the expanded or new bios for variant heroes in the video game version, more tidbits about the universe, the relationships between the heroes and villains and their personalities came to light than had been previously available:<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Freedom Six Wraith</a>'s art caused a lot of speculation in the fandom as to why she had The Operative's weapons; her video game bio and dialog with Iron Legacy clarified that she had in fact killed The Operative and The Chairman and taken their place.</li><li> While the familial relationship between Tachyon and her nemesis The Matriarch had been known via <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry.

The game's wiki <a class="urllink" href="http://sentinelswiki.com/index.php?title=ARG_Event">has a summary of it.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysABiggerFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysABiggerFish">Always a Bigger Fish</a>: Environments often don't discriminate between hero and non-hero targets, and thus can take out villainous cards. The Raging T. Rex attacks the target with the second highest HP, which is usually a Hero target, but later in the game, or against villains like the Ennead, it will do the heroes a favor. Cards like the Kraken's Tentacle or the Raptor Pack will instead target the lowest-HP target, which is usually a minion. With Unforgiving Wasteland (exiles cards from the game) out, you can even get Baron Blade prevented from flipping because a chupacabra ate him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou">An Adventurer Is You</a>: Since the game is built around team gameplay, these archetypes come up frequently, though most characters fit into two or even three:<ul><li> Tank: Legacy, Haka, Bunker, The Scholar, and Rhino Naturalist, though anyone with an Armor or self-healing ability will do in a pinch, and Visionary and NightMist can take up the role when playing the cards that grant them invulnerability.</li><li> Healer: Legacy (1940's), Argent Adept, The Scholar, Tempest.</li><li> DPS: Ra, Haka, Fanatic, Chrono-Ranger.</li><li> Nuker: Tachyon, Bunker, Absolute Zero, Expatriette, Mr. Fixer, NightMist, and Unity (all of whom require some time to get out combinations of cards which then trigger to deal big damage.)</li><li> Buffer: Legacy, Argent Adept, Captain Cosmic.</li><li> Pet Master: Unity, Captain Cosmic, Luminary, Akash'Thriya.</li><li> Crowd Control: Tempest, Visionary.</li><li> Jack of All Trades: Wraith, Mr. Fixer, Omnitron-X, The Sentinels, Guise, Sky-Scraper, Tempest, NightMist.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion">Alien Invasion</a>: Grand Warlord Voss is leading one. Should he have 10 minions out when he starts his turn, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver">it's successful</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">Apocalypse How</a>: Multiversal and apparently Physical Annihilation. The coming of OblivAeon has been foreshadowed and referenced, particularly in <em>Sentinels Tactics</em>, which takes place after the event, as an event where the multiverse comes crashing together. In her <em>Tactics</em> bio, it's mentioned Visionary can no longer access alternate timelines, and when asked about the game titles, the game's writers have said there's a reason <em>Tactics</em> doesn't have "Multiverse" in the title. The <em>OblivAeon</em> expansion has finally explained: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the heroes must battle to prevent the destruction of all realities, but OblivAeon is responsible for any ability to travel between times and universes, so his defeat means all timelines and universes will become cut off from one another. In some cases, heroes even end up stranded in a world that's not their own.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a>: Each hero shares a symbol on their card with a specific villain that is marked as their archnemesis. This means that all damage inflicted by cards that share this symbol with their target is increased by one. In some cases this is detrimental to the hero (e.g. Legacy, who doesn't have much in the way of damage vs. Baron Blade, or Unity, whose damage is mostly minion-based, vs. Iron Legacy, whose bulk damage doesn't even let Unity keep her golems out) and in others it results in a mutual barrage of destruction (e.g. Ra and the Ennead). In still others it doesn't have much of an effect either way (e.g. Akash'Bhuta and Argent Adept, <em>neither of whom</em> has a great deal of personal damage output: Akash'Bhuta relies mostly upon her Limbs to deal damage, especially if Entomb can be dealt with, while Argent Adept's damage dealing is incredibly weak and he relies mostly upon his team).<ul><li> In Vengeance, some of the nemeses have extra effects should their hero be active. (Such as The Hippo redirecting all damage Friction would take to himself, but only if his nemesis Haka is active.)</li><li> Also, The Ennead share symbols, as do The Chairman and The Operative. This means if you can get them to attack each other, such as with one of the effects under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDeflector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDeflector">Attack Deflector</a>, they do extra damage to each other.</li><li> Averted with the villain Greazer Clutch, who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney">Only in It for the Money</a>. His archnemesis is "the hero with the highest starting HP". This can be exploited to a degree depending on team composition: for example, if the highest-HP hero target is Setback and the villain team contains both Greazer and Plague Rat (Whose nemesis is Setback), Greazer and Plague Rat will do extra damage to each other whenever they hit each other - and, since Plague Rat deals damage to all targets, including ones on his own side, and Greazer deals backlash damage whenever someone musses his hair, they deal a great deal of damage to each other.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcFatigue">Arc Fatigue</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, sort of. The <em>Letters Page</em> reveals that the OblivAeon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover">Crisis Crossover</a> comes right on the heels of the already-lengthy and complicated Skinwalker Gloomweaver event.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcNumber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcNumber">Arc Number</a>: Five comes up a lot. The main superteams all have five core members (the Freedom Five are self-explanatory, there are five Prime Wardens, and a total of five people are in the Dark Watch, although Nightmist and Harpy don't have much overlap; the big exception are the Sentinels/Void Guard, with four). The game is designed for a maximum of five hero decks, and, in team villain mode, five villain decks as well. Most actual decks have a multiple of five cards in them (40 for heroes, 25 for villains, 20 for team villains and 15 for environments). OblivAeon has ten Scions, and five of them have unique shields.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWelding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWelding">Arc Welding</a>: Invoked by the writers. In the <em>Letters Page</em> podcast, the writers describe the publishing history of the Freedom Five as being originally a series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> one-shots where they were fighting robots or aliens each week. A later reboot took all those robots and retconned them as being Omnitron's drones, and took those aliens and retooled them as Voss's Gene-Bound legions.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack">Armor-Piercing Attack</a>: Irreducible damage ignores any damage reduction effects, whether the effect is on the attacker or the target. The main sources of this damage are certain heroic or villainous Ongoing cards &mdash; like one of Mr. Fixer's stances or Progeny's ongoings; equipment cards &mdash; Chrono-Ranger and Omnitron-X each have equipment that does irreducible damage; one-shots like Parse's Between the Lines; or Advanced rules for some villains, like Iron Legacy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmyOfTheAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmyOfTheAges">Army of the Ages</a>: Not quite an army, but La Capitan's pirate crew includes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings">Viking</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ronin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ronin">Ronin</a>, an accrobat, a flying ace from either WWI or WWII, a Cavaliere from medieval spain, and French Musketeer.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtShift">Art Shift</a>:<ul><li> The Enclave of the Endlings takes its style from old sci-fi comics and the stylings of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackKirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackKirby">Jack Kirby</a>, to whom the expansion the cards come in is dedicated.</li><li> Guise has this on a few of his cards, portraying him as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobLiefeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobLiefeld">Rob Liefeld</a> style musclebound hero, and as a super-deformed anime character. In his case, it's justified because he's a shapeshifter.</li><li> The Rook City art is deliberately darker and more "realistic," even including a lot of blood on many of the characters.</li><li> Gloomweaver's Strength of the Grave card is drawn in the style of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellboy">Hellboy</a></em>.</li><li> The Operative's incapacitated art is drawn in the style of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SinCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SinCity">Sin City</a></em></li><li> The "Xtreme" Prime Wardens are drawn like over the top Antiheroes from the early 90s.</li><li> Christopher and Adam have stated they want to eventually release a "Definitive Edition," which will see <em>all</em> the card art updated. Some of these updates will have the art changing to reflect different time periods &mdash; for instance, the art on Legacy's "Danger Sense" card currently shows the current Legacy in the "modern" art style, but in the Definitive Edition will instead have the Golden Age Legacy, in Golden Age art style.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDeflector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDeflector">Attack Deflector</a>: Many of the characters have cards that let them redirect damage they would have taken to another target. Some of them only work on damage above a certain threshold, others below. Iron Legacy's Superhuman Reflection, Kismet's Inexplicable Obstruction, Mr. Fixer's Driving Mantis Style, NightMist's Amulet of the Elder Gods, The Sentinels Writhe's Caliginous Form, and Tachyon's Synaptic Interruption all have the characters redirect the damage to either a target of their choosing or an enemy target. Unity's Stealth Bot, The Scholar's Alchemical Redirection and Wraith's Smoke Bombs redirect damage from hero targets to another hero target for tanking purposes, while Sky Scraper's Thoraxian Monolith redirects damage from other hero targets to herself for the same.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a>:<ul><li> The Shattered Timelines expansion details a couple, such as the Freedom Six timeline where Young Legacy dies, turning Legacy into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a>, "Iron Legacy", who takes over the world and rules it with an iron fist. Also referenced in one of Visionary's cards, in which she has a vision of the heroes defeated and shackled by Voss's forces. This is given a subtle nod in the character art in the video game &mdash; normally, nearly all the heroes are smiling in their portraits. The Freedom 6 variants, however, are all wearing variations on the theme of scowl.</li><li> The <em>Tactics</em> or <em>Mist Storm</em> timeline is this post-OblivAeon. Rook City is absolutely trashed; the populace has become suspicious of heroes and is trying to regulate them; many villains get horrifying upgrades in power level (including some already high-level-threat villains becoming even higher-level threats); and many heroes end up dead, making self-destructive choices, becoming darker and more anti-heroic, or even full on turning into villains themselves.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatFamilyCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatFamilyCrossover">Bat Family Crossover</a>: <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry. It should be moved to the TRIVIA tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that the game represents these. For instance, the Wraith has repeatedly fought and defeated Spite in her solo adventures, but the in-game battle against him represents a larger confrontation where she needs to call in help to take him down.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a>: Singular Entities and Prime Aspects are beings with cosmic levels of power who are devoted to a single concept, such as chaos, entropy, and progress, to name a few. As such, they tend to define "good" as anything that promotes and supports their chosen concept and "evil" as anything that removes or opposes it. Sometimes these concepts overlap with what mortals would consider "good" or "evil", such as Wellspring <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">creating the Legacy line</span> in the name of Progress and OblivAeon wanting to destroy everything in the name of entropy, but it's only ever a coincidence, and even "good" entities are generally still creepy and eldritch.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossGame">Boss Game</a>: The game is always a battle between a team of heroes and a powerful villain. With few exceptions, the heroes' sole win condition is to incapacitate that one being. Many of the bosses have a substantial number of minions that they can deploy: Baron Blade, The Organization, Grand Warlord Voss, and the Matriarch are the biggest offenders.<ul><li> The two primary exceptions are The Dreamer and the Tormented Ally variation of Infinitor. Both of these are rescue missions, where your goal is to destroy enough of the manifestations while preventing the Dreamer or Infinitor from dying until you save them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">Boss Rush</a>: One challenge on the game's wiki for Spite, Agent of Gloom doesn't make him any harder &mdash; instead, it makes it so that when he's defeated, the players immediately set up a game against Skinwalker Gloomweaver without a chance to change heroes, reset or heal. That said, they do get to keep out any cards they had in play against Spite, which softens the blow of a difficult task.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser">Boisterous Bruiser</a>: On the hero side we have Haka, on the villain side we have Kaargra Warfang.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">Cast From Hit Points</a>: Comes in two flavors:<ul><li> Some hero Ongoing cards, like Solar Flare or Pushing the Limits, have maintenance costs, where the hero must do themselves damage to keep the card out and working. While the damage can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageReduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageReduction">reduced</a>, they must do at least 1 point of damage, or else the card is destroyed.</li><li> Other hero cards and abilities, like Nightmist's spells or Golem Unity's base power, have activation costs, where they take damage before the effect happens. With these, though, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageReduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageReduction">Damage Reduction</a> or immunity effects can let you avoid the damage entirely while still getting the benefit.</li><li> On the villains' side, Citizen Dawn has Channel the Eclipse, which lets her play an extra card at the start of her turn, but deals her cold damage at the end of it. Unlike the heroes' maintenance costs, it's not destroyed if she somehow avoids the damage.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatastrophicCountdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatastrophicCountdown">Catastrophic Countdown</a>: A couple villains (and two of the environments) feature this as their main threat to the heroes. Of course, each of them is a completely different mechanic to fit the theme of the fight.<ul><li> Baron Blade wins if he starts his turn with 15 cards in his trash on his front side, representing that his Terra-Lunar Impulsion Beam is fully charged and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">has pulled the moon into the Earth</a>.</li><li> Voss wins if he starts his turn with 10 minions in play, representing his forces <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion">overrunning the planet</a>.</li><li> Deadline wins if he removes all environment cards from the game, representing him damaging Earth so much it's sent back to the dark ages.</li><li> OblivAeon has a couple of these. One counts down on each of his turns, and when it hits 0, he removes an environment from play. He has another pool that when it reaches 12 tokens, he removes an environment from play. The number of environments left in the game &mdash; 5 to start &mdash; also represents a countdown; if he removes four of them from the game, he has destroyed the multiverse and the heroes lose.</li><li> On the environment side, Wagner Mars Base has a self-destruct and Silver Gulch has a card that traps the heroes in the past if the environment's trash is empty.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardboardPrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardboardPrison">Cardboard Prison</a>: Implied.

Most variants of Baron Blade have managed to escape the heroes after he was defeated. Some, on the other hand, <em>don't</em> escape. For example, Spite's base form is eventually killed, but resurrected by Gloomweaver into his Agent of Gloom variant.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentralTheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentralTheme">Central Theme</a>: Each expansion has one:<ul><li> Base Game: Comic Book super hero team</li><li> Rook City: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a></li><li> Infernal Relics: Supernatural</li><li> Shattered Timelines: Time Travel</li><li> Vengeance: Revenge</li><li> Wrath of the Cosmos: Space.</li><li> Villains of the Multiverse: Even more revenge</li><li> OblivAeon: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage">Clothing Damage</a>: In the digital version the heroes get new portraits when they go below 10HP and again when they're incapped, with them looking worse and worse for wear each time, including lots of ripped and ruined uniforms. The male characters tend to suffer more extensive clothing damage than the female ones: Chrono-Ranger actually ends up shirtless.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfNinjutsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfNinjutsu">Conservation of Ninjutsu</a>:<ul><li> Inverted, in that it's applied to the heroes by way of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelScaling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelScaling">Level Scaling</a> mentioned below. Grand Warlord Voss, for instance, starts with a number of minions equal to the number of heroes, and when he goes into combat himself, his damage output is H-1 and H-2. So a full party of heroes is facing five mooks just to start with, and taking 4 and 3 damage against the boss himself &mdash; and god help the players who go in with five. But the minimum party would only start off against three mooks, and only take 2 and 1 damage from Voss himself when those mooks go down.</li><li> Also played straight when the heroes are incapacitated &mdash; each incapacitated hero has a power that in some way helps or supports whomever's left standing, sometimes letting them play cards or powers. This means the last hero standing can effectively have multiple turns, making him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a>, able to take down mooks by the truckload.</li><li> Played straight with some villains in the Vengeance/Villains expansions. Villains like Baron Blade, Plague Rat, and Ambuscade who can be fought as a single villain are suddenly less powerful now that they're teamed up with other villains.<ul><li> That being said, each of the recurring villains has a justification for why they are suddenly a lot weaker than their solo versions. Ambuscade is actually an illusion created by Glamour. La Capitan, a time traveller, is a much younger and less experienced version than the heroes are used to fighting. Miss Information and Baron Blade are no longer hiding behind schemes and trickery, but are fighting openly, with some newly-earned powers. (Although, Baron Blade was already a pushover, and the Vengeance version is arguably more dangerous than the original.) Plague Rat was captured, restrained, and experimented on by RevoCorp, so not only has his infectious bite been toned down, but his handlers keep him from being TOO deadly.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">Continuity Snarl</a>: Unavoidable by the modular means the game is established. It is far from uncommon to see players choose the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> versions of characters fighting alongside past incarnations to fight opponents in environments they really have no business in (just try and rationalize how in the hell Spite's victim cards make sense when playing in the barren, deserted Final Wasteland, what the Chairman's thugs are doing in the Ruins of Atlantis, or how The Matriarch got all those birds to the Wagner Base on Mars, for instance). This gets even funnier with the OblivAeon expansion, which includes five former villains as heroes, so now players can have the new heroes fighting their own past selves. Of course, the players will also only have a very vague sense of what happened where, as the events referenced in the cards' quotes were never published, so the players are free to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> it however they like. <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry. It should be moved to the TRIVIA tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> eventually confirmed that every game is canon <em>within its own universe</em> - and some pieces of the Multiverse are weirder than others.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory">Cosmic Horror Story</a>: The Sentinels franchise overall is more in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovecraftLite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovecraftLite">Lovecraft Lite</a> territory, but the Tactics/Vertex universe goes straight into this, especially by the time Prime War comes along. One, everyone both hero and villain keeps being driven mad and into bad decisions by both their own powers and the lure of limitless cosmic power in the form of OblivAeon Shards. Two, the Vertex universe is threatened and eventually destroyed by the "Mist Storm" which is a mindless cloud of destructive energy formed by the aftereffects of Nightmist's interdimensional portals to gain aid during the OblivAeon fight combining with the forces in the destroyed Nexus of the Void. The heroes are sometimes seen trying to rescue people from it, but in the end they can do nothing to stop it and it just relentlessly consumes everything. Three, those few people who are rescued from the destroyed universe, are only rescued so they can serve as pawns in a war of cosmic beings known as Prime Aspects to determine which abstract concepts deserve to rule the outer realms of existence, with little care for the actual desires or morals of any mortals thus "conscripted". All in all it's pretty bleak and dripping in heaps of cosmic nihilism and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack">Counter-Attack</a>: Several cards enable this.<ul><li> Wraith's Combat Stance and Ra's Flame Barrier automatically attack the first card to damage each of them a turn...Which can lead to the hilarious situation in which one of them hurts themselves, and if that's the first damage they took that turn, the cards trigger and make them hit themselves.</li><li> One of Absolute Zero's modules makes him do cold damage whenever he takes fire damage; another lets him do a single attack whose power is based on how much fire damage he's taken since his last turn.</li><li> One of Baron Blade's cards damages the first hero to attack him in a given turn. His hero deck as Luminary has a device that punishes villains for hitting his devices.</li><li> One of the things that make The Chairman and The Matriarch such high level foes is their ability to pull this consistently. Defeating any of The Chairman's mooks results in The Operative attacking the hero with the highest HP. The Matriarch either does damage to or destroys an Ongoing or Equipment card of the hero with the highest HP whenever one of her numerous-but-fragile birds is taken down. Attacking either group without some kind of damage reduction is a quick way to take a pounding and can make automatic-damage ongoing cards (such as Visionary's Demoralization, which automatically damages every enemy at the start of her turn) into more of a liability than an asset.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">Creepy Child</a>: The Dreamer, who is an alternate timeline version of the Visionary. Unlike other villains, the goal with the Dreamer is to <em>not</em> hurt her, as she is an innocent child. Instead the goal is to defeat the psychic apparitions she unintentionally brings into the world.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover">Crisis Crossover</a>: The OblivAeon event, which not only sees villains turn hero (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">permanently</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">otherwise</a>), but includes heroes from alternate universes rushing to help fight in the grand finale.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageReduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageReduction">Damage Reduction</a>: Both hero and villain decks feature damage reduction of one kind or another. Hero damage reduction usually applies to damage to the hero whose card it was, though some support heroes, like the Argent Adept, can spread that protection around. On the villains' side, their cards much more often provide some kind of damage reduction to either the whole villain team, or a group within the villain team. The biggest is Grand Warlord Voss's innate effect, where for each of his minions in play, he reduces all damage to himself by two, making him effectively invincible if more than two or three are out.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a>:<ul><li> The Rook City expansion.

Things progressively got worse and worse. Heroes became villains (or acted villainous), people were obsessed with stockpiling OblivAeon shards, the government and public's hatred of superheroes continues to make things difficult, all in all a really bad time. Eventually people just stopped reading because things weren't getting any better, resulting in the Vertex line getting canned and the Miststorm timeline being completely destroyed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDayTheMusicLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDayTheMusicLied">The Day the Music Lied</a>: In the digital version when fighting the Challenge Mode version of Agent of Gloom Spite, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the win screen shows Donovan's grave and plays the victory music as usual... only to then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LettingTheAirOutOfTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LettingTheAirOutOfTheBand">have the music peter out</a> as the grave splits with a loud CRACK and Gloomweaver appears having taken over Donovan's warped and reanimated body.

There <em>are</em> several cases where a character "dies" in one timeline but is said to be replaced by someone from another timeline or it turns out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath">Disney Death</a>. But actual real resurrection is not only extremely rare, but outright stated to be horrible, often undesired by the person in question, and something that fundamentally changes them.<ul><li> When Fixer is brought back to life he ends up full of rage both because he wanted to be allowed to rest and because the manner of his resurrection means he's essentially a ghost inhabiting his own zombie body. It takes a long time and a god-tier magic ritual before he's anything close to his normal self again.</li><li> When Fanatic is brought back to life as a child <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it turns out that the child wasn't even actually brought back to life at all, and she's actually a strange spirit being just now permanently inhabiting that child's body</span>.</li><li> When Spite is brought back to life, it's at the behest of a demon god which turns him into a warped zombie who must kill a sufficient amount of people or become a permanent vessel for the demon god in question, and Spite is expressly a sadist.

Omnitron-X and The Wraith, for instance, have one-shot cards that let them destroy all their equipment cards to do massive damage, leaving them extremely vulnerable and limited in their actions afterward. Haka has a card that lets him discard as many cards as he wants in one turn to boost his next attack &mdash; which can make for a hell of a punch, but could also leave him with nothing in his hand. Interestingly, he has another card that applies the same kind of boost to defense, and another that lets him heal one HP for every card he discards.</li><li> Ra's final variant, Ra: Setting Sun, takes this and runs with it, fitting as it depicts his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">final, suicidal attack on OblivAeon</span>.

His incapacitated powers are similarly themed &mdash; one lets another hero do a <em>10 irreducible</em> HP attack, while another destroys every non-hero target at 4 HP or below; either one also removes Ra from the game entirely.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu">Did You Just Punch Out Cthulhu?</a>: Some of the villains include an extra-dimensional demon, an immortal nature spirit, a near omnipotent trickster, and of course, the omnicidal cosmic entity OblivAeon. It's possible to beat them with purely mundane heroes like Bunker, Expatriette, and the Wraith. Depending on the cards used, the punching can be quite literal.<ul><li> In Megalopolis, the police deal a target 1 projectile damage at the end of each environment turn. So they can - in theory - take out Spite or Gloomweaver or Apostate with a handgun, or with their bare hands if Cramped Quarters Combat is in play.</li><li> This can be inverted with powerful heroes like Haka, Legacy, or Captain Cosmic being taken out by low level thugs.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultyLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultyLevels">Difficulty Levels</a>: Comes in three varieties:<ul><li> Each hero is rated 1-3 in terms of complexity or difficulty to use them effectively. A 1-complexity hero (like Haka or Legacy) tends to have very straightforward powers and cards which each have a direct use, meaning you can do something constructive each turn. A 2-complexity (Bunker, Visionary) hero tends to require a little more set-up with powers that are more supplemental than direct action, but the set-ups are relatively simple, meaning you might need to play a card to do something constructive, but that card is still pretty straightfoward. Heroes rated at 3-complexity (like Absolute Zero or the Argent Adept) have more complicated set-ups and powers that do nothing on their own or even harm the hero themselves, meaning they need two or more different cards out before they can really contribute to the team &mdash; but once they are set up, they can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">do some serious damage</a>.</li><li> Villains are rated in difficulty on a 4-point scale. Low-level villains tend to have single-effect cards, or cards that the players can neutralize before they come into full effect; mid-level villains have more minions who do stronger attacks, and have stronger ongoing effects such as damage reduction and buffs; the highest-level villains tend to have a lot of minions, play extra cards over the course of their turns and can attack or disrupt the players when they try to take out those minions, forcing them to strategize and pick when they want to attack &mdash; or they simply do hideous amounts of damage, like Iron Legacy.</li><li> A sort of 'hidden' difficulty modifier is in the environments. Some environments are fairly neutral and hit both heroes and villains in equal measure (Damage in the Tomb of Anubis tends to hit everyone, regardless of affiliation); others tilt in favor of the heroes (Insula Primalis, for instance, whose raptors attack the lowest-HP target, which tend to be minions, and whose damage boosts tend to help the players more than the villains). Still other environments, like Rook City and Megalopolis, seriously hinder the heroes, preventing them from playing cards or using powers, and buffing villains while exacting stiff penalties to remove the effects. The videogame eventually started sorting environments by difficulty.</li></ul></li><li> <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultySpike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultySpike">Difficulty Spike</a>:<ul><li> The Rook City expansion. It includes the first two 4-difficulty villains, The Chairman and The Matriarch, its 2-difficulty villains are considered a pain in the ass and a high-speed damage race and it has one of the most punishing environments in the game in Rook City itself. These present much more challenging game scenarios compared to what was available in the base set.</li><li> Certain villains spike up or down sharply depending on how many heroes you have.<ul><li> Gloomweaver, for instance, starts with H zombies, who each do H-2 damage; against a three-hero team, this means the opening turn will see 3 HP of damage, and a high HP character with DR or healing can tank easily. Against a five-hero team, however, that's 15 damage spread to everyone just in the first round. The same applies to his Cursed Acolyte &mdash; against a three-hero team, he does two instances of 1 HP damage to every hero target &mdash; easily soaked by just about any DR effect and rendered powerless by things like Stun Bolt or Twist the Ether &mdash; but against a five-hero team, it's two instances of 3 HP, one of the heaviest mook attacks in the game.</li><li> The Dreamer is manageable with a three-hero team but, well, a nightmare for a 5 hero team because so many of her effects are based on the number of heroes. She starts with H number of projections out, and needs to have H * 2 number of projections under her on her flipped side to be defeated. In addition to that, when she flips &mdash; and you must go through her flipped side to win &mdash; first destroys H ongoing cards, then each round it plays an extra H-2 cards and deals H-2 damage to all hero targets. Her second worst card &mdash; Violent Nightmares &mdash; reveals cards until she plays H-2 Projections, and the Illusory Demon does H damage. A three-man team will only need to fight three projections at the start, lose three ongoings and defeat six projections on her flipped side to win while Dreamer plays one extra card and does 1 damage across the board per round, while a five-man team will have to fight five and defeat ten, while the Dreamer destroys five ongoings and then plays a whopping <em>three</em> extra cards per round and does 3 damage to all hero targets. And with that many card plays, it increases A. the chance of the Dreamer reshuffling her trash into her deck, putting the worst cards you thought you were done with back in rotation; B. playing Violent Nightmares and multiplying the number of damaging targets on the field; and C. playing Night Terrors, which does global damage equal to the number of Projections in play plus one. It's not uncommon for Dreamer's first round flipped to do upwards of 10 damage to all hero targets &mdash; and that's This combines for an almost guaranteed loss for the heroes unless the party is extremely well prepared to soak damage &mdash; which they may not be if they had to destroy crucial Ongoings.</li><li> By contrast, Infinitor's damage is mostly fixed, and with his inherent damage reduction, a smaller team has hard time doing enough damage to take out his constructs before the damage is simply overwhelming, while a larger team has more time and actions available to them before Infinitor's turn pops up again.</li><li> Simultaneously, Ambuscade is a fair challenge for a smaller team, since he too does mostly fixed damage, and destroying his cloaking device and gadgetry to make him vulnerable and less-deadly is more of a challenge, especially if he takes out some of the team before they get fully set up. But a five-man team of heroes is going to squash him, even if he gets lucky enough to have several cardplays in a row, especially because his is the only villain deck that contains <em>no</em> mechanisms for destroying hero Equipment or Ongoing cards.</li></ul></li><li> Villain advanced and challenge modes are also not even remotely equivalent: in particular, Iron Legacy, Progeny and the Ennead are really brutal on Advanced, even by comparison to their usual fights, while Miss Information and Cosmic Omnitron have borderline sadistic Challenge modes, and Ultimate Gloomweaver may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a> with the wrong lineup since he's immune to melee and projectile attack and has invincible relics (meanwhile, Challenge Mode Skinwalker Gloomweaver is likely <em>easier</em> than normal because you get an entire fight worth of setup first).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscardAndDraw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscardAndDraw">Discard and Draw</a>:<ul><li> Several of the decks are built with different styles, modes, or equipment that can't be played with others, evoking this trope &mdash; each of Bunker's different modes destroys the others when it enters play, Mr. Fixer can only use one style and weapon at a time, and the Naturalist switches animal forms. One environment card &mdash; Time Cataclysm's Fixed Point &mdash; lets players subvert this by making all cards indestructible, allowing for combos that are impossible otherwise, allowing for a Mr. Fixer with two styles or sets of tools out, or what has been called the Turducken Naturalist.</li><li> This is also the basic concept behind the "Variant" character cards for heroes and villains. While they use the same decks as the cards they can be used in place of, they have different hitpoints and base powers (in the case of heroes) or rules for interacting with their decks, in the case of villains. At its best, this system completely changes how some characters play: America's Newest Legacy is less of a buffing/support hero and more of a tanky damage dealer thanks to her base power (+1 to all hero damage vs. deal three energy damage to a target), while Dark Watch Mister Fixer goes from a support-oriented low damage dealer to a smashy hyper-carry that needs a team's support to operate most efficiently (Deal 1 damage vs. deal 3 damage, then destroy a hero ongoing or equipment card).</li><li> Completionist Guise lets you switch variants midgame.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonTheirFeet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonTheirFeet">Dragon Their Feet</a>: Possible with The Chairman and The Operative, since it's possible to take the Chairman down to 0 HP before The Operative, but the heroes can't win until they're both down for the count.</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E-K&nbsp;</div><div id="folder1" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo">Early-Bird Cameo</a>:<ul><li> Artwork on different cards will frequently feature characters from currently-unrelated expansions. Also, it's not uncommon for a hero or villain to share a nemesis icon with an unreleased deck.

Most are much stronger than the minions in the other decks.</li><li> To a lesser extent with Citizen Dawn's Citizens of the Sun. Each is unique and they tend to have higher HP than the nameless, interchangeable mooks in other decks, and the ones who share a naming scheme support one another, making them an extra challenge when they can team up.</li><li> The Chairman's unique underbosses in his tiered mook system. The underbosses summon their own Thugs out of the trash, have much higher HP and can be brought back with Jailbreak.

There's morality flips like Apostate taking Fanatic's place and good-aligned versions of Akash'Bhuta and Ermine, identity swaps like Setback as Legacy and Sky-Scraper as Tempest, gender flips like a female Baron Blade (who is also a good version of him to boot), power flips like a Legacy that has super-intelligence instead of super-strength, even nationality/race changes like a female Native American version of Chrono-Ranger.<ul><li> On a more mundane level there's Biomancer's demented flesh creations that impersonate/replace existing people, usually for some nefarious purpose.</li><li> One of the Dreamer's most powerful manifestations is an evil version of Legacy</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusOblivion">Evil Versus Oblivion</a>: Baron Blade, Akash'Bhuta, and Ambuscade all make a decision to put aside their vendettas against the heroes in order to fight against the Multiverse-ending threat of OblivAeon (no, we won't make the pun). Unfortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">it doesn't last</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a>: In a meta sense. Many of the common strategies rely on the exact wordings of the cards allowing for the targets of effects to be different than the creators might have originally intended. Most of these have since been made into perfectly legal tactics as of the digital version, and a few others have come to light thanks to the digital version that weren't apparent before.<ul><li> For instance, any card that allows a player to choose "a target" without specifying, including Absolute Zero's Isothermic Transducer, can be interpreted as including that character or other hero cards &mdash; meaning in AZ's case, he can target himself with the cold damage generated when he takes fire damage, and with the right equipment, heal himself to nullify the attack (with his Focused Apertures and/or Cryo Chamber in play along with his Modules, getting hit with a fire attack can lead to Zero's health actually going <em>up</em>). Similarly, Akash'Thriya's Thrashing Brambles power allows her to, after hitting the villains, trigger her seeds' on-death effects by attacking them.</li><li> Haka's Savage Mana uses its wording to become incredibly potent against minion-heavy decks. Savage Mana puts any card that Haka destroys underneath it (to charge him up for a massive attack later on), instead of the villain trash, which lets him "trap" villain cards and prevent them from being played from the trash. This makes him incredibly useful against decks where the villain can play destroyed minions from the trash, like Warlord Voss' dreaded Forced Deployment, Citizen Dawn's Return With The Dawn, or the Chairman's Prison Break. Its especially useful against Baron Blade before he flips, as it prevents Blade from dumping extra cards into his trash, which speeds up his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver">Non-Standard Game Over</a>.</li><li> Also important are the game's distinctions between "turn" and "round." A round is everyone getting a turn, starting with the villain, and ending with the environment, while a turn is any individual's turn. This distinction means that an ability that can kick in "every turn" can happen up to seven times in one round. Nightmist's Amulet of the Elder Gods, which lets her redirect the first damage she takes any turn at the cost of two cards, can be used to make her nigh untouchable. Fanatic's Divine Focus and Guise's Blatant Reference, similarly, lets them sacrifice a card every turn to do damage.</li><li> Savvy players can exploit Kaargra Warfang's Title deck thanks to this &mdash; instead of waiting for an enemy with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageReduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageReduction">Damage Reduction</a> to come out so you can grab the Seeker title, there's nothing stopping one hero from whacking another to grab it. Likewise, Deathcaller can easily go to Captain Cosmic for killing his own constructs for other effects. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">This even happened in the comics</a>; Tachyon's podcast episode mentions that she made an enemy of Tempest by turning on him in the Arena (non-lethally, of course) in order to impress the crowd and get the Colosseum to go away sooner.</li><li> Because Legacy's Take Down specifies "the end of your turn" (i.e. <em>Legacy's</em> turn), it has no downside when used out of the normal turn sequence - something like Parse's Syntactic Analysis or her Fugue State variant's power, for example, or a couple of the Argent Adept's songs. This can even be used to create an infinite loop: whenever Take Down expires, Visionary cycles it from the trash to the top of Legacy's deck with Mental Divergence, and then Omnitron-X uses its power to play the top card of Legacy's deck...</li><li> Damage a hero deals to themselves counts for effects that would trigger when a hero deals damage. This can be troublesome if you have damage buffing out (Legacy, for example) or backlash damage (Wounding Buffer, Ra's and Wraith's retributive damage cards), but can also cause some hilarious interactions:<ul><li> Captain Cosmic zapping himself with Unflagging Animation will trigger Autonomous Blade if he has one out, and anything that would cause Mr Fixer to damage himself (Infection, Miss Information, incapacitated Vengeance Baron Blade) or another hero (Friendly Fire) will trigger Jack Handle's effect, preventing the damage and turning it into a hail of blows aimed at all the bad guy targets.</li><li> Similarly, villains hitting themselves will trigger effects based on that: if you have Chrono-Ranger's "The Ultimate Target" bounty (which lets Ranger use a power once per turn when a villain deals damage) on Akash'Bhuta in normal or advanced mode, Target will trigger whenever one of Akash'Bhuta's limbs is destroyed and forces Akash'Bhuta to damage herself.</li><li> Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> when Greazer Clutch and Plague Rat are in a villain team; Greazer punches anyone who attacks his hair, and the Rat has a card that hits all targets and then forces all targets hit to damage themselves. Plague Rat plays the card and hits Greazer's hair, so Greazer decks him, then the hair hits itself, so Greazer hits it, then because he just damaged his hair, he punches <em>himself</em>, then Plague Rat hits Greazer who hits himself <em>again</em>.</li></ul></li><li> Judge Mental boosts all psychic damage. Proletariat deals psychic damage to himself for having clones out. If the two are out simultaneously Proletariat can kill himself in a few turns.</li><li> There's a handful of deck interactions that have very interesting implications with these kinds of rules.<ul><li> All three Omnitron decks &mdash; the villain Omnitron, the hero Omnitron-X, and the environment Omnitron-IV &mdash; have cards with the keyword "Component," and cards that affect other cards with that keyword. Omnitron-X, for instance, has one attack card that does damage based on how many Component cards he destroys, but doesn't specify they have to be <em>his</em>. This even extends to the character cards: Cosmic Omnitron, for example, flips from a card-playing form to a damage-dealing mode when there are no Components in play, which can be very inconvenient (or, in Challenge mode, disastrous - Challenge mode Cosmic Omnitron deals enormous amounts of damage when flipped, and can take a while to flip back because it starts out with more components in play) - but if one of the components from Omnitron-X or Omnitron-IV is present, it'll "count" and Cosmic Omnitron won't flip until such time as Omnitron-X loses the Component (which admittedly could be next turn, but small mercies...)</li><li> Because it specifies Relics are immune, Nightmist, Ra, and Apostate won't have all their cards wiped by Fanatic's End of Days or Apostate's Apocalypse. Argent Adept's instruments, however, will be destroyed because while they may be relics in the sense that they're old, they're not Relics with the keyword. La Capitan will lose most of her board, but not <em>La Paradoja Magnifica</em>, which is classed as a Relic.</li><li> Visionary's Decoy Projection has the keyword "Distortion," meaning it won't stay around long in the Realm of Discord, whose own Distortion cards all have text saying to destroy all other Distortions when they enter play.</li><li> Grand Warlord Voss wins if there are 10 or more Minion cards in play at the start of his turn, and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageReduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageReduction">Damage Reduction</a> is based on how many Minion cards are in play. Because the Mobile Defense Platform includes six Minion cards of its own, he is especially dangerous to fight there.</li></ul></li><li> Thanks to the digital version, some interactions have come to light that might not have to players of the physical game.<ul><li> Guise's "Uh, Yeah, I'm That Guy" copies all the Ongoing cards in the play area of a particular hero &mdash; what became clarified in the video game is that this includes the "When this card enters play," rider some cards have, such as the healing effect of "Inspiring Presence" or the damage on "Living Conflagration," making Guise an even better partner for the likes of Legacy or Ra. Unfortunately, it also includes damage riders and destruction riders, so copying Mr. Fixer while he has a style out will instantly destroy both cards, and stealing the Naturalist's current form destroys it from his own play area.</li></ul></li><li> For a long time, Citizen Dawn was considered incredibly hard to defeat because putting five of her Citizens in the trash flipped her to an invincible side that kept dealing damage until H-1 Citizens were out. What a lot of players didn't realize was that Citizen Dawn's card specifies that <em>she</em> is also considered a Citizen, and they forgot to include Dawn in the Citizen count before flipping her back over. As a result players would spend several unnecessary turns taking damage from multiple targets while waiting for another Citizen to come out.</li><li> Most effects that work off Devices don't specify hero or villain ones, which usually works out <em>really well</em> for Luminary. Villain cards that buff devices, such as the advanced modes of Omnitron and team play Baron Blade, also buff Luminary's (turning Heroic Luminary into a ridiculous powerhouse, since it's almost impossile to destroy her stuff); Heroic Luminary counts heroic, villainous and environmental Devices for her Power, which can make team villain games extremely brutal (any game with Baron Blade and Friction is going to <em>start</em> with three devices out, maybe four, which means Heroic Luminary's lightning bolt is likely to start on par with some of the beefiest damage-dealing innate powers and then go up); Timely Disruption can be used to take out a villainous Baron Blade's devices; using Triple Cross to force Omnitron, which is itself a Device, to damage itself will also trigger some damage to it from Backlash Generator, because it's a non-hero card dealing damage to a Device; the Device Assembly Line in Mordengrad can give you free plays, and the Mobile Alert Platform stat boosts; and any destroyed Device, regardless of side, will trigger All According To Plan.

Cards that represent more controlled use tend to flip green tokens to purple, while ones that represent letting the power off its chain or reaching beyond her limits tend to do the reverse. The clever bit is that her deck has a noticeable bias towards flipping purple, meaning that her standard character card (representing her during a period with little training) will struggle to maintain control...but her Dark Watch card, which is her after receiving some training from Nightmist, is much better at it due to having a base power that lets you choose which type of token to flip, as one would really expect now that she knows a bit more about what she's doing!</li><li> Greazer Clutch has attempted to catch both Legacy and Sky-Scraper before. His character card locks onto whoever has the highest HP, which is likely to be either Legacy or Sky-Scraper if they're part of the team (unless you've got Akash'Thriya or Haka there too).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a>: The powers and abilities of each character in their backstories vary from the way the characters work in the game.

Interestingly, in the Freedom Four comic, Legacy behaves much like he does in-game, distracting Blade and taking hits while the Wraith, Bunker, and Tachyon do the actual damage to the platform and drill. Iron Legacy, meanwhile, shows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered">what Legacy would be like if he wasn't holding back</a>; <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry.

Since only the character card is different, he retains the effects and powers that depend on or otherwise reference Legacy's impenetrable skin &mdash; a power that only the current Legacy developed, and which Greatest Legacy wouldn't have.</li><li> Both Legacy and Haka are supposed to be nearly invulnerable (Legacy has impenetrable skin and Haka is immortal) yet they are vulnerable to most attacks unless they invoke specific cards.</li><li> Completionist Guise's power allows the players to swap other hero cards out for their variants. Which...doesn't really make any sense, from a story perspective, since the variants are all either the base heroes at different points in time, alternate universe versions, or totally different people taking on the mantle as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">Legacy Character</a>.</li><li> Also with Guise, Santa Guise is able to wrap up cards and give them away, meaning that he can give out boxes containing not just things like guns and robots, but also resilient skin (Legacy), rainstorms (Tempest), explosions (Expatriette), specific combat actions (Haka), backup copies of unique weapons like Absolution (Fanatic), the <em>Hippocratic Oath</em> (Southwest Sentinels), and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> moments</em> (Stuntman).

Even given that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBiochemicalBarriers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBiochemicalBarriers">No Biochemical Barriers</a> is generally in force in comics (allowing Plague Rat to infect the likes of Tempest, Sky-Scraper and Lifeline), he canonically cannot infect robots like Omnitron-X, energy beings like Doctor Medico, or undead like Dark Watch Mister Fixer, all of whom are as vulnerable to the disease in-game as anyone else (as are both forms of Akash'Thriya, whose body is made out of either stone or Void energy).</li><li> Luminary's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat">Kill Sat</a> is a bit weird. First, he appears to have one above every location in which he's played. This makes relative sense on modern Earth, where he can presumably use the same satellites, and is perhaps understandable in the Final Wasteland (assuming it lasted centuries up there) and Dok'Thorath (which has an orbital bombardment card), but is a bit weird in places like the Block (which is an extradimensional prison without any "outside" to put an orbital cannon <em>in</em>), Silver Gulch (which takes place 74 years before Sputnik was launched), or the Realm of Discord (which is mystical and weird). Additionally, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat">Kill Sat</a> in question has <em>really good aim</em> for something being fired from miles above the battlefield, given that it can, for example, hit Apostate without harming his relics, many of which he actively holds or wears. And then Heroic Luminary enters the picture; as an unambiguous hero, the names and Doomsday subtype of any of Luminary's superweapons don't fit, and instead the cards represent things like the lunar prison she used to trap Legacy of Destruction.</li><li> Luminary is also the ruler of Mordengrad. Nobody apparently told the people in the Mordengrad environment deck about this. Either the lack of a scar is screwing with them, or someone's leading a rebellion.</li><li> Luminary is also not the Nemesis of Iron Legacy, despite the fact that Iron Legacy fell because Baron Blade killed his daughter.</li><li> A villain's HP represents the trouble the heroes have dealing with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a>, not so much their actual physical durability. Hence the reason that Citizen Dawn has a mammoth 80 health, yet went down to Fanatic in the Cosmic Contest, and the reason that Wager Master - a singular entity who mortals can barely scratch, and who could be on par with OblivAeon if he cared to start rounding up minions - only has 51 health and Baron Blade's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor">Power Armored</a> flip side has less health than his normal side.</li><li> <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry.

(To be fair, Fanatic runs off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">Cast From Hit Points</a>, so she could easily have burnt herself down to lower than Argent Adept's health).</li><li> Pervasive Red Dust in the Wagner Mars Base destroys equipment cards &mdash; but depicts Visionary, who doesn't have any equipment in her deck.</li><li> While Thorathian Monolith makes Sky-Scraper change to her Huge card and depicts her as such, it's possible for her to swap to her Normal or Tiny cards while it's still in effect, so that she's still somehow shielding her teammates while she's only a few inches tall.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>: Several heroes have good damage but non-great defence, such as the Idealist or KNYFE.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodScarsEvilScars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodScarsEvilScars">Good Scars, Evil Scars</a>: Baron Blade's scar gets worse and worse with each appearance of his.

Villains very rarely do more than 5 damage in a hit, and even that once per round. Sufficiently prepared heroes, on the other hand, will be doing that kind of damage each turn, and in the right circumstances can do upwards of 50 damage a turn.

This does not mean, however, that playing with more than that gives the players an advantage. The villains often have attacks or other effects that are dictated by the number of players (usually somewhere between -2 and +2 the number of heroes), so if you take six or more heroes into the fight, it's that much more difficult. Suddenly you're being even more swarmed by minions, and when the villains themselves attack, they're doing extra damage.

There are cosmic beings known as Singular Entities which are the closest thing the franchise has to gods who operate according to their own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a> motives with usually little care for how it affects mortals caught in the middle, there are many strange cosmic forces which can grant amazing powers to mortals who wield them but can enact terrible prices if not wielded correctly, there are eldritch locations and beings aplenty working according to <em>their</em> strange ways, and there's even one character whose backstory directly references <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ArkhamHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ArkhamHorror">Arkham Horror</a></em> and by extension the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos">Cthulhu Mythos</a></em> itself. But in the end it <em>is</em> still a superhero story and so while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeYourArmPunchingOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokeYourArmPunchingOutCthulhu">you might sometimes break your arm doing it</a>, the heroes still can in the end defeat anything that directly threatens mortal life and make the world a better place to be.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a>: To a certain extent, since decks are supposed to be randomly shuffled both before the game, and during because of certain cards. All the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou">An Adventurer Is You</a> designations work fine...provided the key cards for those aspects aren't randomly shuffled to the bottom of your deck. The same applies the other way &mdash; the difficulty of a villain can spike way up or down depending on whether their most powerful cards are on the top or bottom of the deck. For this reason, heroes who have the option to search their decks for card types (like the Wraith), who can draw lots of cards (like Tachyon, Guise, Haka, and Bunker), or who allow other heroes to draw extra cards (like Team Leader Tachyon) are considered very powerful.<ul><li> Unlocking variant cards in the digital version of the game can be this as well, especially villain cards. For example, unlocking Mad Bomber Baron Blade requires that you first defeat Baron Blade once, and then take on Citizen Dawn and defeat three specific minions in the same turn. Since those minions support one another, it gets <em>really</em> hard to bring them down all at once and is very dependent on your heroes, their powers, their cards, and praying that Citizen Dawn doesn't draw an extremely powerful card that interferes with the entire game.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckManipulationMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckManipulationMechanic">Luck Manipulation Mechanic</a>: While dice aren't involved, the cards are shuffled often to randomize the game. Several heroes have abilities that let them either look at their next card and optionally discard it, pick what card the villain will draw next, or allow another player to draw two cards and discard one outside of their normal turn order. Other decks have cards that let a player go through their deck or trash and just pick a card with a given key word on it rather than wait for it to come up on the draw.

So the art is intended to be comic panels or covers; the flavor text quotes issues of imaginary comics; and the Letters Page podcasts often talk about things like fictional writer retcons, what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgesOfSuperHeroComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgesOfSuperHeroComics">era the character was created in</a>, blow-by-blow descriptions of the fictional comic issues the characters were in, fictional reader reactions to fictional issues, fictional animated spinoffs, etc. As the creators put it: "This podcast is a series of lies, built upon a house of lies, on a foundation of lies, in Lietopia, on the continent of lies."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitariesAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitariesAreUseless">Militaries Are Useless</a>:<ul><li> Played straight in that the regular military is unable to do anything to stop the more powerful, overt villains like Baron Blade, Citizen Dawn, or Grand Warlord Voss, so it falls to the heroes to defeat them.

Why are they all packed together? Because Void Guard are the same characters as The Sentinels, who were already in the game as a quirky deck with 4 character cards for one player. There's now nothing to stop one player from playing as The Sentinels, while the rest play as the individual members of Void Guard, resulting in each character being on the table twice.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultinationalTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultinationalTeam">Multinational Team</a>: The various heroes <em>and</em> villains come from a huge range of nations.<ul><li> While many of the heroes - especially the Freedom Five - come from the United States (Legacy, Bunker, Tachyon, Absolute Zero, Argent Adept, Nightmist, Setback, Chrono-Ranger, etc) many more come from other countries. Fanatic is from Peru, Unity from Israel, Haka from New Zealand, KNYFE from Scotland, the Naturalist from Nigeria, Visionary from China, Parse from Australia and Sky-Scraper and Tempest from outside of Earth.</li><li> The villains are just as diverse. Outside of the obvious nonhuman ones, there's Baron Blade, who hails from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ruritania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ruritania">a small fictional eastern European country</a>, Ambuscade from France, the Operative from the Philippines, and La Capitan from colonial Spain.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a>: OblivAeon mode. Fitting, since it represents the biggest, deadliest, most dangerous villain ever fought in the game's universe. Each Scion has a different set of abilities it can use to screw you over, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Aeon Men</a> come in faster than you can take them out, the environment will get in your way as usual, and that's not even getting into all the ways OblivAeon himself will screw you over. For example, one of his cards does a frankly unnecessary 9999 damage.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeDifficulty">Non-Indicative Difficulty</a>:<ul><li> Played with, via the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelScaling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelScaling">Level Scaling</a> above. Many of the harder villains don't have fixed values for their attacks, or for their minions' attacks, instead doing damage that's the number of heroes minus 1 or 2. This means that using the minimum party &mdash; which logically should make things tougher &mdash; nerfs a solid chunk, if not most, of the villains' attacks. Gloomweaver in particular is hit hard by this, as most of his minions that do damage do it on this scale, making his zombie horde and cultists a formidable obstacle for a full team of five heroes, but sitting ducks for three heroes.</li><li> The listed difficulties of the villains doesn't always pan out as accurate, either. While The Matriarch, listed as one of the game's toughest villains, will often have over a dozen birds out at once, and hits the players whenever they're taken out, each bird does such little damage that even basic armor will keep the heroes from being hurt at all so they can focus on just whacking Matriarch. On the other side, the lowest-rated villains, Omnitron and Baron Blade, each have cards that <em>severely</em> punish equipment-heavy heroes and can turn a game from a solid victory to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">Total Party Kill</a> if the heroes are caught off guard.</li><li> Interestingly, the Advanced rules for the Chairman makes him more manageable, assuming you're able to handle the increased damage output.

Should enough of these occur, cards from the environment deck are removed from play. If, at this point, the environment deck is gone, Deadline has destroyed the planet and the heroes lose.</li><li> The Celestial Tribunal has Representative of Earth.

Parodied with Guise's Total Beefcake card, which depicts him in a bikini &mdash; which is worn over his normal superhero tights. Which are, in fact, part of his shapeshifted skin. Guise is <em>weird</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyVoiced" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyVoiced">Suddenly Voiced</a>:<ul><li> The digital version of the game has spoken dialogue for Guise and singing snippets for Argent Adept.</li><li> The trailers for the digital version have voices for Baron Blade, Chrono-Ranger, Kaargra Warfang, Tachyon, and Sky-Scraper.</li><li> The Sentinels of Freedom spinoff video game gives us even more voices: Absolute Zero, Bunker, a different Tachyon, Wraith, Young Legacy, Expatriette, Unity, The Adhesivist, Fright Train, Ermine, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and the members of Perestroika</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperheroSpeciation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperheroSpeciation">Superhero Speciation</a>: Each hero has unique powers, and even among the heroes who fit a similar archetype as outlined in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou">An Adventurer Is You</a> work differently in <em>how</em> they fill those roles, with further deviation among the variants. Legacy, for instance, is normally support-based, but with Young Legacy's power, the deck can pump out a lot of damage instead.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet">Taking the Bullet</a>: Several heroes have cards that do this either by mechanics or in flavor.<ul><li> Legacy's Heroic Interception depicts him catching a missile, and renders all heroes except himself immune to damage. His Lead from the Front card also lets him redirect damage meant for other heroes to himself.</li><li> Haka's Enduring Intercession redirects all damage from environment cards to Haka.</li><li> Fanatic's Divine Sacrifice forces enemies she attacks with it to focus on her exclusively until her next turn.</li><li> Unity's Stealth Bot has this as its only function, able to redirect any damage to itself, and reduce it by 1.</li><li> Sky Scraper's Thorathian Monolith basically has her stand in front of all her teammates in giant form, taking all damage directed at them and reducing it by 2. This can lead to her taking mammoth amounts of damage if, for example, she has some inconvenient titles against Kaargra Warfang and she uses her sonic clap power.</li><li> Two friendly civilian cards in the Rook City deck have provisions that at the end of their turn, the villain card damages either them or one of the heroes.</li><li> The heroes have the option to take on any environment-generated damage that would otherwise hit The Dreamer, since the heroes lose if she drops to 0 HP.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallDarkAndSnarky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallDarkAndSnarky">Tall, Dark, and Snarky</a>: Tachyon. Okay, she's blonde. But, with a great sense of humor (she memorably described her lab team as "only the top scientific badasses") and standing at a full six feet tall, she fulfills most of the name, and certainly fits the archetype.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeam">The Team</a>: Being a cooperative game, any battle comes down to a team effort among the players, who are each filling different rolls. Any game needs, at minimum, three heroes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, there are four organized superhero teams as of OblivAeon:<ul><li> The Freedom Five: Legacy, Bunker, Wraith, Tachyon and Absolute Zero with Unity as their intern; in <em>Sentinels Tactics</em>, Unity takes a spot on the team after Tachyon is killed.</li><li> The Darkwatch: Nightmist, Expatriette, Setback, Mr. Fixer, and Harpy, a reformed Matriarch</li><li> The Prime Wardens: The Argent Adept, Haka, Tempest, Fanatic, and Captain Cosmic</li><li> The Southwest Sentinels also count, being four characters, though they're a single hero deck. They later reform as the Void Guard with individual decks.</li><li> While the teams remain largely the same in <em>Tactics</em>, there are some slight differences to the teams in the RPG.</li><li> The Freedom Five disbands and forms the Sentinels of Freedom, an organization more focused on training the new generation of heroes. A new team named Daybreak forms, which includes Felicia Parsons as Legacy and Muse, a grown up Dreamer.</li><li> The Prime Wardens disband, and among the first modules in the RPG is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingTheBandBackTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingTheBandBackTogether">reforming the team</a>.</li><li> Another new team, The Paradigms, is formed by a reformed Revo-Corp and headlined by Unity and Benchmark.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethClenchedTeamwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethClenchedTeamwork">Teeth-Clenched Teamwork</a>: Implied thanks to some of the card art, <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry. It should be moved to the TRIVIA tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> and game mechanics, as any team of heroes works together even if the relationships between characters are actually strained.<ul><li> In the first case, "Hippocratic Oath" in The Sentinels' deck shows Dr. Medico separating a bruised Expatriette and Chrono Ranger, who had apparently gotten into a fight.</li><li> Most superhero teams aren't fond of working with Setback and Guise &mdash; and further, they don't like being on a team with <em>each other</em>. Expatriette is the one hero who likes inviting Setback along, being a couple.</li><li> Tempest and Sky-Scraper will work together, but they do not get along well. Sky-Scraper is a Thorathian, like Voss, although her backstory has her in the resistance against him. Tempest, after seeing her in action against her nemesis, comes around to respect and admire her and she has joined the Prime Wardens by the time of the <em>Tactics: Prime War</em> expansion.</li><li> As far as mechanics go, Setback is hit again &mdash; some of his cards are detrimental to the hero team as a whole &mdash; forcing card destruction or discards &mdash; so working alongside him can be rough.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowingYourSwordAlwaysWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowingYourSwordAlwaysWorks">Throwing Your Sword Always Works</a>:<ul><li> Ra can use the Staff of Ra's power to deal projectile damage. The staff is destroyed upon doing this, however.</li><li> Mr. Fixer also throws his Tire Iron. Instead of boosting damage, it automatically destroys targets that get hit this way and are under 2 HP after damage.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming">Theme Naming</a>: Present everywhere, but Citizen Dawn's deck takes the cake:<ul><li> Citizen Winter, Citizen Spring, Citizen Summer, and Citizen Autumn.</li><li> Citizen Anvil and Citizen Hammer.</li><li> Citizen Blood, Citizen Sweat, and Citizen Tears.</li><li> Citizen Truth and Citizen Dare.</li><li> Citizen Assault and Citizen Battery.<ul><li> In fact, the in-story reason that Expatriette named her signature twin pistols Pride and Prejudice is that, growing up among all those Citizens, it wouldn't have occurred to her <em>not</em> to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming">Theme Naming</a> with them.</li><li> Citizen Slash shows up in Vengeance, which led to the fandom speculating on his partner's identity. Citizen Hack finally made his debut in Tactics.</li><li> The Letters Page podcast reveals there used to be Citizens Pain and Gain, one of whom is Expatriette's father.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>: <span style="display:none">invoked</span>Referenced in game with a difficulty rating system. The hardest villains under this system (rated 4 out of 4) are The Chairman, Iron Legacy, The Matriarch, and Progeny.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTherapists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTherapists">There Are No Therapists</a>: Averted, in a comic strip leading up to the OblivAeon expansion. Ryan Frost, who was depressed even <em>before</em> his biochemistry mutated, sees a therapist and talks about how people stop thinking of heroes as people and see them only as their costumes, noting that no one calls "Gene" anything but Writhe anymore or knows that he's got a great vinyl collection, except maybe Frost himself.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">Thou Shalt Not Kill</a>: There seems to be some flipflop here in the backstory.<ul><li> Explicitly averted, unexpected for a relatively lighthearted superhero setting. None of the heroes seem to have any compunction about killing, and Spite's Agent of Gloom promo bio explicitly says Wraith kills him by firing a razor-bladed weapon through his head. The flavor text for Wraith's Razor Ordnance &mdash; probably the same weapon &mdash; even has her quoting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins">Ra's Al Ghul's</a> answer to the no-killing rule: "Compassion is a weakness your enemies will not share." That said, the fact that other heroes are uncomfortable calling in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCrimesAreEqual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCrimesAreEqual">Fanatic</a> for help against "mundane" criminals like bankrobbers implies that they favor a sort of "proportionate response" to crimefighting.</li><li> The official story states that Wraith could not bring herself to kill Spite and that Parse finished him off when she couldn't. Similarly, Iron Legacy came about because Legacy's refusal to kill Baron Blade, resulted in him eventually killing off Young Legacy.</li><li> Bunker implicitly shoots people in his solo comics as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitarySuperhero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitarySuperhero">Military Superhero</a> with at least four guns, but spent a good chunk of his time with the Freedom Five relishing the chance to cut loose against the aliens and robots who the Comics Code will actually let him shoot.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchesAndPitchforks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchesAndPitchforks">Torches and Pitchforks</a>: An Angry Mob sometimes forms in the Court of Blood, dealing damage to everything but itself (including <em>other</em> angry mobs). If no vampires are in play, they go on to destroy one Environment card, including themselves, implicitly either rampaging around or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamingTheMob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamingTheMob">dispersed by the heroes</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed">Turns Red</a>: Some of the villain cards flip into a stronger, or at least more destructive, form when they're either low on health, out of health, or out of minions &mdash; i.e., when they're starting to lose the fight. For some villains, like Voss or Citizen Dawn, the players will want to keep them out of this stage.<ul><li> Baron Blade is the straightest example. When he is brought down to zero HP, he flips into a robotic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a>, goes back to full health, trashes his shield cards &mdash; He's entering the fray, rather than sitting in his defense platform &mdash; and begins attacking the heroes directly every turn.</li><li> Fittingly, Iron Legacy is another. When he drops below 20 HP, he gains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageReduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageReduction">Damage Reduction</a> &mdash; after already having several cards that reduce or redirect his damage &mdash; starts focusing on the hero target with the lowest HP and starts healing. His flipped side is especially dangerous in Advanced mode, where he'll redirect the first instance of damage he takes a turn to one of the hero targets, making him all but invincible against heroes who can't attack more than once a turn.</li><li> Gloomweaver's Skinwalker variant flips when he's brought to 0 HP, then immediately heals back to double his original HP and starts hitting <em>everyone</em> on the field every round. If the heroes don't have a way to mitigate it or finish him quickly, they're in trouble.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateUniverse">Ultimate Universe</a>: After the Oblivaeon event, the game and the fictional comics focus on two major timelines - the Miststorm or Tactics timeline and the RPG or main timeline. The Miststorm-verse is treated as an Ultimate Universe: it's darker and edgier, characters have different names and redesigns and beloved characters die for real. As a nod to the Marvel Ultimate Universe, the Miststorm timeline is eventually destroyed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery">Unexplained Recovery</a>: During the storyline in which the heroes defeated the Chairman, Mr. Fixer was killed fighting the Operative, but came back. For more than two years, the most fans got out of the creators was that he <em>wasn't</em> revived with the Lazarus Vats that the Chairman and the Operative bathe in, because while they rejuvenate, they can't actually bring back someone already dead. (This is consistent with the card game, in which they heal both, but do not revive them if incapacitated.) Eventually, coinciding with the appearance of his Dark Watch Variant GTG finally revealed the secret. Mister Fixer was revived by his old nemesis Zhu Long as a brainwashed minion, before Nightmist was able to restore his mind.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a>: Certain combinations of heroes and villains can result in unwinnable games, usually because one or more of the key targets is immune to particular damage types.<ul><li> Shu of the Ennead, for instance, is immune to Melee and Projectile damage types. A team like Legacy, Parse, and Wraith &mdash; who only have access to those types of damage &mdash; can't hurt her at all. In an Environment like Megalopolis, whose damage-dealing cards only do melee or projectile to villains and whose only damage-type-changing card changes the damage to melee, Shu is outright invulnerable and the heroes can't win. Handelabra even put out a One-Shot battle with that specific setup, essentially forcing you to use Parse and Wraith's powerful deck control to prevent the Ennead from getting a chance to put Shu into play.</li><li> The Unforgiving Wasteland in Final Wasteland can do this to a few decks that depend on certain cards to come into play or be in the trash for effects, as it takes cards out of play entirely.</li><li> If more than two of the Chairman's Underbosses are taken out of play, he'll never flip and remain invulnerable indefinitely.</li><li> If Citizen Dawn flips to her Merged with the Sun side, she's invincible &mdash; and only flips back when H-1 Citizens are in play (H+1 in Advanced mode). If she flips and then Unforgiving Wasteland eats too many of her citizens, she can never flip back.</li><li> Advanced Gloomweaver is immune on his front side to Melee and Projectile damage. He, at least, the heroes can beat either by destroying his Relics or letting him flip &mdash; unless Unforgiving Wasteland is out and environment damage destroys one, taking it entirely out of play. If this happens to a party that can't do other types of damage, Gloomweaver can't flip, and the instant win condition, which specifies that the three relics <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">be in the trash</a>, can't trigger.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampireVords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampireVords">Vampire Vords</a>: All the vampires in the Court of Blood speak with an exaggerated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunetikAksent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunetikAksent">Funetik Aksent</a>, clearly modeled on Bela Lugosi's <em>Dracula</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsActHeroesReact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsActHeroesReact">Villains Act, Heroes React</a>: The villain always gets the first turn. Their set up usually involves deploying a number of minions or devices, and the heroes have usually taken some damage by the time the villain's turn is over. This mirrors the typical comic book plot, where some villain attacks the city or is after something, and the heroes have to react to stop their plot.<ul><li> In Vengeance mode, it goes villain-hero-villain-hero until it gets to the environment, but the bad guys always start out with access to their specialist gear, minions and so on - Blade always starts with a device out, for example.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">Voluntary Shapeshifting</a>: The Naturalist, though at first it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvoluntaryShapeshifting">wasn't voluntary.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfChoice">Weapon of Choice</a>: Quite a few in various forms.<ul><li> Ra's Staff of Ra, which also gave him the powers of the sun god.</li><li> Expatriette's twin pistols Pride and Prejudice, her two unique guns &mdash; and they can each hold double the normal amount of ammo, and she can fire them both in a turn.</li><li> Fanatic's Absolution, which heals her when it comes out, and lets her do different damage types. Interestingly, it appears to be broken in her Prime Warden alternate, but she continues to use it.</li><li> While Chrono Ranger carries a variety of high-tech weaponry, his old fashioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolversAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolversAreJustBetter">six-gun</a> is what he prefers, and he uses it to dish out damage <em>constantly</em> with nearly every card play.</li><li> Apostate's Condemnation, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a> to Fanatic's sword.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">We Have Reserves</a>: The minion-heavy decks, such as Voss, The Chairman or the Matriarchs, use this as a strategy, with numerous ways to bring mooks to the forefront, and even revive them from the trash. Outright stated in the flavor text of one of Expatriette's cards, which allows her to automatically damage any villain target the moment it enters play: A Blade Battalion Commander, apparently admonishing his troops with, "Get out there! She can't shoot <em>all</em> of you!"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildWest">The Wild West</a>: The 'Silver Gulch, 1883' environment deck. It even has a wagon full of dynamite, which always blows up at the least opportune time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity">With Great Power Comes Great Insanity</a>: Infinitor, who, in addition to the powers his brother Captain Cosmic got, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HearingVoices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HearingVoices">was also driven insane by the screams of voices from across the cosmos now in his head</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfChaos">World of Chaos</a>: The Realm of Discord is another dimension where the laws of physics can change on a whim. One moment you're fast, the next you're slow, and remember to watch out for exploding bubbles.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfSnark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfSnark">World of Snark</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfHam">World of Ham</a>: Somehow manages to have the characters be both incredibly over the top and hammy, and incredibly snarky, occasionally at the same time.<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">X-TREME!verse</a> is called out in the Letters Page podcast as being a deliberate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfHam">World of Ham</a>. From the look of the EXTREME PRIME WARDENS cards, they're not kidding.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Wretched Hive</a>: Rook City in general. <em>Especially</em> so if you're fighting The Organization there.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDirtyRat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDirtyRat">You Dirty Rat!</a>:<ul><li> Plague Rat, whose mutations have turned him into a giant, toxic rat creature.</li><li> The Pike Industrial environment includes rats as targets. They do minimal damage to the lowest-HP targets, but the Experimental Mutagen card buffs them for each card out.</li><li> The Rat Beasts from The Final Wasteland, which are implied to be the descendants of Plague Rat &mdash; they even share a nemesis with him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a>:<ul><li> The Matriarch's entire style. Her individual birds do not hit very hard, but when there's <em>15</em> of them on the field at once, on her second turn, it doesn't matter. Made even worse when you remember that taking out any of them causes damage to your own team anyway.</li><li> The Organization does something similar. Give them a moment's rest and they can put out a small legion of minions, all of whom are buffed by bosses.</li></ul></li></ul></div><hr>
